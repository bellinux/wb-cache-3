5|$|At {{the start}} of her legal career, Ginsburg faced {{difficulty}} finding employment as a wife, a <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> five-year-old daughter and a Jew. In 1960, despite a strong recommendation from Albert Martin Sacks, a professor and later dean of Harvard Law School, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter rejected Ginsburg for a clerkship position due to her gender. Later that year, Ginsburg began a clerkship for Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a position she held for two years.|$|E

5|$|Lina Leandersson {{was born}} in Falun, Sweden. She took an {{interest}} in performing from an early age, acting in amateur theatre performances, attending drama courses, and performing street- and jazz dance. One of her first roles was in amateur theatre performance, playing the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spoiled girl wanting new jeans. In 2006 she appeared as a jury member in the Swedish song competition Lilla Melodifestivalen. The same year, she was selected as one out of five, from a total of five hundred applicants, to participate in Nickelodeon's programledarskola, which was televised in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|She {{appeared}} in Jonathan Demme's moderately successful remake of The Manchurian Candidate (2004), co-starring Denzel Washington, {{playing the role}} of a woman who is both a U.S. senator and the manipulative, ruthless <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vice-presidential candidate. The same year, she played the supporting role of Aunt Josephine in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events alongside Jim Carrey, based on the first three novels in Snicket's book series. The black comedy received generally favorable reviews from critics, and won the Academy Award for Best Makeup.

5|$|Before he {{can leave}} the capital, Littlefinger offers to take Ned to the last person Jon Arryn spoke to before his death. It {{turns out to be}} a prostitute, Mhaegan, the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> baby daughter, who is another of Robert's illegitimate children. Littlefinger reveals Jon Arryn had been searching for Robert's bastards for an unknown reason. When Ned and his guards try to leave, they are ambushed by Jaime Lannister and his men, who want answers for Tyrion's arrest. Ned claims {{responsibility}} for Tyrion's arrest, which leads to a brutal fight between his and Jaime's men. In the end, Ned's guards are killed, including his captain Jory Cassel, whom Jaime stabs through the eye with a dagger. Ned duels with Jaime but is speared through the leg by one of Jaime's guards before Stark and Lannister can finish the fight on their own. Jaime knocks out the guard who interrupted the fight and decides to let Ned live but warns that he wants his brother back. Jaime storms away, leaving Ned bleeding in the dirt, where he quickly faints.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{also took}} place among laymen, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls {{rather than on}} {{literary}} pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed {{the backbone of the}} military forces. Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation. Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men, with the role of <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative.|$|E
5|$|Famous {{painters}} included Ni Zan and Dong Qichang, {{as well as}} the Four Masters of the Ming dynasty, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, and Qiu Ying. They drew {{upon the}} techniques, styles, and complexity in painting achieved by their Song and Yuan predecessors, but added techniques and styles. Well-known Ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art. The artist Qiu Ying was once paid 2.8kg (100oz) of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wealthy patron. Renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers, some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were full-time painters.|$|E

5|$|The ao dai is {{featured}} in {{an array of}} Vietnam-themed or related movies. In Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Robin Williams's character is wowed by ao dai-clad women when he first arrives in Saigon. The 1992 films Indochine and The Lover inspired several international fashion houses to design ao dai collections, including Prada's SS08 collection and a Georgio Armani collection. In the Vietnamese film The White Silk Dress (2007), an ao dai is the sole legacy that the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poverty-stricken family has to pass on to her daughters. The Hanoi City Complex, a 65-story building now under construction, will have an ao dai-inspired design. Vietnamese designers created ao dai for the contestants in the Miss Universe beauty contest, which was held July 2008 in Nha Trang, Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{couple had}} at least two {{children}} together. In 1449, the King notified Ragusa {{of the birth of}} a son: this is likely to have been Sigismund. A daughter named Catherine was born in 1453. Queen Catherine may have also been the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> third son of King Thomas, who was buried on Meleda. Mavro Orbini, a 16th-century Ragusan chronicler, believed that the boy was born to Vojača. If Catherine hoped that her stepson's marriage to Maria of Serbia and his subsequent accession to the Serbian throne in 1459 would pave way for her own son's accession in Bosnia, the hopes were dashed very quickly: within three months Stephen Tomašević lost the Despotate of Serbia to the Ottomans and returned to the Bosnian royal court with his wife.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a casting}} {{department}} at Elstree Studios which casts actors for Holby City {{as well as}} Casualty, EastEnders and Doctors. The programme also has two dedicated casting directors who bring in a shortlist of actors for the producer and director to audition. Some cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in Holby City in minor roles. Mealing appeared as the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> paediatric patient in the show's fourth series, Roberts appeared {{as the son of}} a medical professor in Holby City seventh series, and Dhillon appeared as anaesthetist Sunil Gupta in 2001. Roberts believes that his single scene in series seven was enough for him to be called in for the part of Joseph, while in contrast, Dhillon does not believe that his role contributed to his casting as Michael, but instead worried that it would work against him.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Having a {{chronically ill}} or {{disabled}} child greatly influences {{many aspects of}} everyday life. Literature study shows <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ill child report more symptoms of depression and have more negative mood ratings than <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> healthy child. This study examines the influence <b>of</b> the <b>mother’s</b> family role {{on the level of}} symptoms of depression and the weekly mood rating reported by the mother. Method: The analyses are based on the contribution of 216 participants. All completed an internet questionnaire, which contained <b>a</b> part <b>of</b> the SCL- 90, the VROPSOM, and questions about the family role. Using an objective and a subjective method, the mothers are subdivided into three groups according to their family role: main provider of household income, main caretaker of the child(ren) or <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> both (working part-time and taking care of the child). Results: <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ill child report more symptoms of depression and have more negative weekly mood ratings than <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> healthy child. Neither with the objective, nor with the subjective method a significant difference was found in the level of symptoms of depression and negative mood ratings among the three groups. Also no interaction effect was found. Discussion: Although there was no effect for the mother’s family role, the findings show the amount <b>of</b> time the <b>mother</b> spends on recreation significantly influences the experience of depression and negative mood. Notably, <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> both ill and healthy children spent {{the same amount of time}} taking care of their children, though they might fulfill different tasks. <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> ill children less often work out of the house than <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> healthy children. However, in both groups <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>a</b> similar number <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> perceive themselves as a caretaker...|$|R
