40|$|HIV-associated neurocognitive {{disorders}} (HAND) remain prevalent despite plasma viral suppression by antiretroviral agents. In fact, {{the prevalence}} of milder subtypes of cognitive impairment is increasing. Neuropsychologic testing remains the “gold standard” of diagnosis; however, this is time consuming and costly in a resource-poor environment. Recently developed screening tools, such as CogState and the revised HIV dementia scale, have very good sensitivity and specificity in the more severe stages of HAND. However, questions remain regarding the utility of, optimal population for, and insensitivity of tests in mild HAND. Recognition of ongoing viral persistence and the inflammatory milieu in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) has advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of HAND and facilitated the development of biomarkers of CNS disease. The importance of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> <b>cell</b> and the astrocyte as viral reservoirs, HIV viral proteins, self-perpetuating CNS inflammation, and CCR 5 chemokine receptor neurotropism has been identified. Whilst biomarkers demonstrate monocyte activation, inflammation, and neuronal injury, they remain limited in their clinical utility. The improved understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has led to novel approaches to the treatment of HAND; however, despite these advances, the optimal management is still undefined...|$|E

We investigated cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation in response to native and bovine serum albumin (BSA) -adsorbed disc of hydroxyapatite (HA) or alpha-type alumina (α-Al 2 O 3) using mouse MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblastic cells and mouse RAW 264. 7 macrophages. The adsorbed BSA inhibited adhesion and spreading of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells, but did not affect MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell proliferation on HA and α-Al 2 O 3 substrates.

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the signal {{transduction}} of cytokine receptors and of osteoclastogenesis. Cytokines regulate cell growth, differentiation, and transformation in immune, hematopoietic, and nervous system. Many of cytokine receptors exert their functions through JAK kinases and STAT transcription factors. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and SOCS 3 proteins are induced after stimulations with several cytokines, and bind to the kinase domain of JAK kinases, thereby inhibiting kinase activity. Hence, these proteins function in a classical negative feedback loop of cytokine signaling. Bone resorbing osteoclast originates from <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> <b>cells.</b> Two cytokines, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) are indispensable in the osteoclast differentiation process. RANKL expressed by osteoblasts activates TRAF adaptor proteins, c-Fos, and eventually induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c 1, the master transcription factor of osteoclastogenesis. Cholesterol depletion suppresses the osteoclastogenesis, and the resoponse of signaling molecules to the stimulation of RANKL is disordered. With the notice that RANKL stimulates the expression of caveolin- 1, which is the scaffold protein of caveolae, signaling from lipid raft seems essential for the proper differentiation signals. ...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of cancer-related inflammation is the recruitment of <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> <b>cells</b> to the tumor microenvironment. These tumor infiltrating myeloid cells are educated by the tumor milieu, rich in cancer cells and stroma components, to exert functions such as promotion of tumor growth, immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and cancer cell dissemination. Our review highlights the ontogenetic diversity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and describes their main phenotypic markers. We cover fundamental molecular players in the tumor microenvironment including extra- (CCL 2, CSF- 1, CXCL 12, IL- 4, IL- 13, semaphorins, WNT 5 A, and WNT 7 B) and intracellular signals. We discuss how these factors converge on intracellular determinants (STAT 3, STAT 6, STAT 1, NF-κB, RORC 1, and HIF- 1 α) of cell functions and drive the recruitment and polarization of TAMs. Since microRNAs (miRNAs) modulate macrophage polarization key miRNAs (miR- 146 a, miR- 155, miR- 125 a, miR- 511, and miR- 223) are also discussed {{in the context of the}} inflammatory myeloid tumor compartment.

40|$|The main immunocompetent {{cells in}} sarcoidal lesions are {{epithelioid}} cells and multi-nucleated giant cells (MGC), {{both of which}} are derived from <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> <b>cells.</b> To understand further the relevance of monocytes in sarcoidosis, we examined in vitro MGC formation using monocytes from sarcoidosis patients, patients with other granulomatous diseases (OGD) and healthy control subjects. The supernatant of concanavalin A-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (conditioned medium) generated Langhans type-MGC and foreign body type-MGC from monocytes. Conditioned medium from any three groups had the same ability to form MGC from normal monocytes. On the other hand, MGC were more highly formed using monocytes from sarcoidosis patients than from other groups. When macrophages induced by treatment of monocytes with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were used, the rate of MGC formation in sarcoidosis patients was about threefold or fourfold as much as that in OGD patients or healthy controls, respectively. Oxidized ATP inhibited MGC formation in all groups. The susceptibility of monocytes cultured in conditioned medium for 24 h to 2 ′- and 3 ′-o-(4 -benzoyl-benzoyl) ATP-mediated cytolysis was significantly higher in sarcoidosis patients than other groups. These findings suggest that the ability of monocytes to form MGC through P 2 × 7 receptors is enhanced in sarcoidosis patients...|$|R

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD), {{the most}} common cause of dementia, is {{characterized}} by the deposition of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and by neuroinflammation. During the pathogenesis of AD, <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> <b>cells</b> become increasingly ineffective in clearing Aβ deposits, less able to differentiate, and shift toward pro-inflammatory processes. Beta-nerve growth factor (β-NGF) and its receptors, TrKA and p 75 NTR, produce several biological responses, including cell apoptosis and survival, and inflammation. In the central nervous system, the involvement of these receptors in several critical hallmarks of AD is well known, but their role in circulating monocytes during the progression of dementia is unclear. We investigated the relationship between plasma β-NGF concentration and TrkA/p 75 NTR receptor expression in monocytes of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild AD, and severe AD. We observed that plasma β-NGF concentration was increased with a higher expression of TrKA, but not of p 75 NTR, in monocytes from patients with MCI and mild AD, whereas β-NGF concentration and TrKA expression were decreased and p 75 NTR expression was increased, associated with caspase 3 -mediated apoptosis, in patients with severe AD. In our study, we show evidence of variation in plasmatic β-NGF and monocytic TrkA/p 75 NTR receptor expression during the progression of dementia. These novel findings add evidence to support the hypothesis for the involvement of β-NGF and its receptors on monocytes during AD progression...|$|R
40|$|Transcriptional {{control of}} the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) promoter, the long terminal repeat (LTR), is achieved by interactions with cis-acting elements present both upstream and downstream of the start site. In silico transcription factor binding analysis of the HIV- 1 subtype B LTR sequences revealed a potential downstream CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding site. This binding site (+ 158 to+ 172), designated DS 3, {{was found to be}} conserved in 67 % of 3, 858 unique subtype B LTR sequences analyzed in terms of nucleotide sequence as well as physical location in the LTR. DS 3 was found to be well represented in other subtypes as well. Interestingly, DS 3 overlaps with a previously identified region that bind members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of proteins. NFATc 2 exhibited a higher relative affinity for DS 3 as compared with members of the C/EBP family (C/EBP a and b). DS 3 was able to compete efficiently with the low-affinity upstream C/EBP binding site I with respect to C/EBP binding, suggesting utilization of both NFAT and C/EBP. Moreover, cyclosporine A treatment, which has been shown to prevent dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT isoforms, resulted in enhanced C/EBPa binding. The interactions at DS 3 were also validated in an integrated HIV- 1 LTR in chronically infected U 1 cells.

40|$|Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is {{a benign}} bone tumor with a shown {{clinical}} behavior of local recurrences and rare distant metastases. GCTB is composed of uniformly distributed osteoclastic giant cells, thought to originate from the fusion of <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> <b>cells,</b> in a background consisting of mononuclear rounded cells and spindle-shaped cells. Several reports showed the specific expression of markers, such as CD 14 on the mononuclear rounded cell population, however, lacking osteoclastic giant cells. Blood monocytes that were CD 14 +, CD 33 +, or CD 14 +/CD 33 + have {{also been shown to}} be programmed as pre-osteoclasts. The macrophage marker CD 33 is expressed earlier than CD 14 in macrophage maturation, whereas CD 14 is expressed longer than CD 33. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate CD 14 /CD 33 expression profiles in GCTB. Nineteen GCTB tumor samples of 19 patients were studied. Immunofluorescent analyses were performed with monoclonal antibodies against CD 14, CD 33, RANK, and CD 51. To unambiguously further prove the expression of these molecules, quantitative RT-PCR was used with subsequent sequencing of its products. All samples showed similar immunoreactivity profiles. The mononuclear rounded cell population was positive for RANK, CD 51. CD 14, and CD 33. The osteoclastic giant cell population expressed RANK and CD 51, as well as CD 33, but was consistently negative for CD 14 expression. The CD 14 and CD 33 profiles were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. These RT-PCR products were sequence verified. Osteoclasts in GCTB are the result of fusion of CD 33 -expressing pre-osteoclasts that further fuse with CD 14 + mononuclear cells. Although these results reflect a static rather than a dynamic spectrum, we strongly believe that osteoclastogenesis seems not to be the exclusive result of fusion of intratumoral CD 14 + mononuclear cells. Moreover, CD 33 -modulated osteoclastogenesis opens up the possibility for novel therapeutic directions...|$|R

The cells of the different subsets were seeded separately, trypsin-treated and cultivated in vitro. Cultures of cell fractions 2 and 3 from infected mice contained the majority of the DNA-synthesizing cells and gave regularly rise to fibroblasts. Cultures of the different fractions were used for sequential morphological observations (2 - 11 days) at the electron microscope level.

We examined 46 subjects (19 with AF, and 27 in SR) undergoing coronary bypass or valve surgery. Peroperative bioptic samples of the left and the right atrial tissue were examined using immunohistochemistry. The number of CD 3 + T-lymphocytes and CD 68 -KP 1 + cells were elevated in the left atrial myocardium of patients with AF compared to those in SR.

TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, but not TGF-alpha, decreased the proliferation of U 937 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and both TNF-alpha and TNF-beta enhanced the response of U 937 cells to PMA during the first 24 hr of treatment and to 1, 25 -DHCC over 72 hr. TNF-alpha induced a rapid increase in c-fgr mRNA levels within 4 hr, in contrast to slower induction by PMA and 1, 25 -DHCC.

40|$|The authors {{previously}} reported that unstimulated peritoneal macrophages and LPS stimulated Kupffer cell-rich nonparenchymal liver cells (NPC) can inhibit protein synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes. Hepatocyte function was similarly altered by supernatants from LPS-triggered NPC. Secretory products of macrophages and Kupffer cells (monokines) are possible mediators {{in this model}} of cell-mediated modulation of hepatocyte function. In this article, supernatants from NPC capable of altering hepatocyte protein synthesis were found to contain significant amounts of one monokine, interleukin- 1 (IL- 1). The kinetics of the generation {{of the ability to}} inhibit protein synthesis and the appearance of IL- 1 activity were roughly parallel for the first 24 hours. Exposure of hepatocytes to NPC supernatant and commercially available highly purified IL- 1 resulted in similar response patterns with regard to onset of inhibition and progression of suppression after removal. Certain discrepancies cast doubt, however, on the likelihood that IL- 1 is the mediator in this model of cell-mediated inhibition of hepatocyte protein synthesis. Commercial human IL- 1 preparations did not always suppress protein synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, IL- 1 activity was stable for several days but hepatocyte inhibition was lost. Unstimulated peritoneal macrophage supernatants containing IL- 1 activity could not inhibit protein synthesis in hepatocytes. The evidence supports the idea that appropriately stimulated <b>cells</b> of <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> (including Kupffer <b>cells</b> that lie in direct apposition to hepatocytes) could mediate hepatocyte malfunction by means of secreted monokines similar to, but not necessarily identical to, IL- 1...|$|R

We suggest that new approaches, such as the combination of different kinds of proviral activators, may help to reduce dramatically the size of latent HIV- 1 reservoirs in patients on HAART.

40|$|Abstract Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{has been shown}} to replicate productively in <b>cells</b> of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage,</b> although replication occurs to a lesser extent than in infected T cells. As <b>cells</b> of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> become differentiated and activated and subsequently travel to a variety of end organs, they become a source of infectious virus and secreted viral proteins and cellular products that likely initiate pathological consequences in a number of organ systems. During this process, alterations in a number of signaling pathways, including the level and functional properties of many cellular transcription factors, alter the course of HIV- 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) -directed gene expression. This process ultimately results in events that contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV- 1 infection. First, increased transcription leads to the upregulation of infectious virus production, and the increased production of viral proteins (gp 120, Tat, Nef, and Vpr), which have additional activities as extracellular proteins. Increased viral production and the presence of toxic proteins lead to enhanced deregulation of cellular functions increasing the production of toxic cellular proteins and metabolites and the resulting organ-specific pathologic consequences such as neuroAIDS. This article reviews the structural and functional features of the cis-acting elements upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site in the retroviral LTR. It also includes a discussion of the regulation of the retroviral LTR in the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> during virus infection of the bone marrow, the peripheral blood, the lymphoid tissues, and end organs such as the brain. The impact of genetic variation on LTR-directed transcription during the course of retrovirus disease is also reviewed. </p...|$|R
40|$|The tumor {{microenvironment}} is a well-recognized framework, in which myeloid cells play {{important roles in}} cancer development from tumor initiation to metastasis. Immune cells present in the {{tumor microenvironment}} can promote or inhibit cancer formation and development. Diversity and plasticity are hallmarks of <b>cells</b> of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage.</b> In response to distinct signals the <b>cells</b> of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> {{have the ability to}} display a wide spectrum of activation states; classical Ml or alternative M 2 macrophages represent extremes of a continuum of this activation. Tumor-associated macrophages generally acquire an M 2 -like phenotype that is relevant for their participation in tumor growth and progression. There is now evidence that also neutrophils can be driven towards distinct phenotypes in response to microenvironmental signals. In fact they can interact with distinct cell populations and produce a wide number of cytokines and effector molecules. Therefore, macrophages and neutrophils are both integrated in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses in various inflammatory situations, including cancer. These findings have triggered efforts to target tumor-associated macrophages and neutrophils. In particular, “reeducation” to activate their antitumor potential or elimination of tumor promoting cells is a new strategy undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The human monoblastoid cell line, U 937, {{has been}} widely used to study {{proliferation}} and differentiation in the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage.</b> Recent evidence from other cell systems suggests that heat shock proteins (hsps) may participate in these processes. Therefore, we have examined expression of hsp {{and the effect of}} either increased or decreased expression of the hsp 90 in U 937 cells. Parental U 937 cells express high levels of hsp 90, hsp 73, and hsp 65, but little hsp 72. Heat shock at 42 degrees C for 30 min increased hsp 72 levels but caused no change in hsp 90. U 937 cells transfected with the expression vector pBA. 4 containing either an anti-sense or a sense hsp 90 cDNA insert showed constitutive decrease, or increase, in expression of hsp 90. Decreased hsp 90 levels slowed the rate of cell division and levels of hsp 90 correlated both with the responses to phorbol esters and with phenotypic changes: antisense-transfected cells expressed less CD 50. Sense-transfected cells showed no change in cell cycle, but expressed less CD 14 than controls. Thus, hsp 90 plays a role in the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage,</b> participating in proliferation and cell cycle control and in the acquisition of functional heterogeneity of the mature macrophage phenotype, with potential effects {{on the role of the}} macrophage in innate immunity...|$|R

50|$|A {{distinguishing}} feature of verruciform xanthoma {{is the presence}} of large numbers of lipid-laden foamy histiocytes in the lesion, and essentially limited to, the connective tissue papillae in the lesion. The lesions are solitary, raised, or polypoid with cup-shaped craters filled with parakeratotic cells that blend into keratinocytes of an acanthotic and papillomatous epidermis. There is a neutrophilic infiltrate of varying intensity between plump parakeratotic cells and keratinocytes, near the surface of the epidermis. The xanthoma cells contain periodic acid Schiff positive, diastase resistant granules.

40|$|Bone-resorbing osteoclasts {{are formed}} from {{hemopoietic}} <b>cells</b> of the <b>monocyte–macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> {{under the control}} of bone-forming osteoblasts. We have cloned an osteoblast-derived factor essential for osteoclastogenesis, the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). Synovial fibroblasts and activated T lymphocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis also express RANKL, which appears to trigger bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis as well. Recent studies have shown that T lymphocytes produce cytokines other than RANKL such as IL- 17, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IFN-γ, which have powerful regulatory effects on osteoclastogenesis. The possible roles of RANKL and other cytokines produced by T lymphocytes in bone destruction are described...|$|R
40|$|MHC class II {{molecules}} are cell-surface glycoproteins {{that play}} a central role in the adaptive immune system because they present peptides, derived mainly from extracellular proteins, to the antigen receptor of CD 4 + T cells. MHC class II expression is regulated in a precise cell-type specific manner and restricted to thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and to the antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including B cells, <b>cells</b> of the <b>monocyte–macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> and dendritic <b>cells</b> (DCs). Other cells such as fibroblasts, astrocytes, endothelial cells and epithelial cells, do not express MHC class II molecules unless they are exposed to specific stimuli, particularly IFN-g, that are produced during infection, inflammation or trauma. MHC class II molecules include different isotypes (HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ) composed of two non-covalently associated polypeptides, alfa and beta chains encoded by separate genes, which expression is co-ordinately controlled at level of transcription. Our results indicated that both 3 ’UTRs of HLA-DRA and HLA-DQA 1 mRNA bind the same cytoplasmic complex. procedure we have identified Ebp 1 and DRBP 76 /NF 90 as components of this complex by biochemical purification. Both of them are able to bind dsRNAs, indicating that a secondary structure is shared by MHCII mRNAs. The knockdown of these proteins showed a decrease in the MHCII mRNAs accumulation, demonstrating that they are involved in the stabilization of messengers. Moreover, literature data indicated that both proteins could have a role also in the regulation of translation. Ebp 1, found in the nucleoli and associated with polysomes, could represent a link between ribosome biosynthesis and cell proliferation. Its interaction with MHCII mRNAs, resulting in a modulation of the MHCII surface density, could give us clarifications about the antigen presentation in tumor cells. DRBP 76 /NF 90 is also involved in mechanisms of stabilization and protein translation of different messengers but it is especially implicated in the modulation of IL- 2 mRNA during T cell activation, occurring during the immune response. We hypothesize, according to the ”RNA operon” model that our mRNAs, encoding functionally related proteins, are co-ordinately regulated by their dsRNA structures in the 3 ’UTR, through the interaction with RNA-binding proteins. These complexes, immediately after transcription, arrange the mRNAs splicing, export, stability and translation to guarantee an equilibrium in the heterodimer synthesis. Our future aim will be to clarify the link between MHCII post transcriptional regulation and the function of antigen presentation of these molecules, both in professional antigen presenting cells and in tumor cells...|$|R

No immunophenotypically identifiable B-lymphocytes were seen. Immunofluorescent IgG, IgM, C 3 and C 4 deposits were found in blood vessel walls of the deep dermis.
