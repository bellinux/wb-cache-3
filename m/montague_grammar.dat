The <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> is based on formal logic, especially higher-order predicate logic and lambda calculus, and makes use of the notions of intensional logic, via Kripke models.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for further applications of deductive databases {{in the field}} of natural language processing. Although there were enormous research efforts on analyzing the semantics of natural languages (NL), especially using <b>Montague</b> <b>grammars</b> (PTQ) for Prolog, corresponding programs for deductive databases are still missing, since range restriction is required in nearly all deductive database systems. But without a way to handle open facts and lambda expressions within logic programs, <b>Montague</b> <b>grammars</b> do not work. On the other side, several NL-syntax parsers, based on DCG grammars, using a deductive database, have worked very efficiently in daily use for several years. This paper fills the gap and {{presents a}} technique for (simplified) <b>Montague</b> <b>grammars,</b> including a lambda-reduction, for deductive database systems.

40|$|Translations—unconsciously—rely on the {{hypothesis}} that sentences of a certain source language LS can be expressed by sentences of the target language LT. Formal theories of semantics, on the other hand, assume that semantics is computed compositionally: the meaning of an expression {{is a function of}} the meaning of its parts. A standard argument for the compositionality of meaning is productivity. Formal semantic compositionality has been formalized by the rule-to-rule hypothesis of Bach (1976). The idea is well-known from the <b>Montague</b> <b>grammars.</b> The meaning of idioms is, however, not a function of its parts: its meaning has to be learnt as a unit. Combining the basic idea of translation with the rule-to-rule hypothesis, we can express structures of language LS in language LT. These structures of LT—called translations—can also be either computed compositionally or as units: each syntactic rule of LS should have its counterpart expressed—not by semantic rules, but—by syntactic descriptions in language LT. 1. Toward a new approach to machine translation The meaning of a complex linguistic structure is wholly determined by its sub-structures and the meanings of them. Semantic compositionality was formalized by the rule-to-rule hypothesis of Bach (1976) : it says that a tight correspondence is imposed between syntax and semantics such that every rule of syntax is also a rule of semantics. In a machine translation system (Rosetta—described by Landsbergen 1985) we can meet a rather direct application of the compositionality principle adopted from the <b>Montague</b> <b>Grammars</b> (Thomason 1974) : The meaning of an expression {{is a function of the}} meaning of its parts and the way in which they are syntactically combined. (…) it is an important criterion of a correct translation that it is meaning-preserving, this seems to be a useful guideline in machine translation. (Appelo & al. 1987...|$|R

In this paper, we introduce the N F design pattern based on Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), Huet's zippers and <b>Montague</b> <b>grammars</b> to zip together a natural language and a formal language. Unlike question answering, translation does not go from NL to FL, but as symbol N F suggests, from ASTs (A) of an intermediate language to both NL (N F).

40|$|The main {{assumption}} of many contemporary semantic theories, from <b>Montague</b> <b>grammars</b> {{to the most}} recent papers in journals of linguistics semantics, is and remains the principle of compositionality. It is also adopted by more computation-oriented traditions (Artificial Intelligence or Natural Language Processing - henceforth, NLP). Although its adequacy to ”real” language clearly raises several difficulties, it is almost never challenged and the presuppositions on which it relies are seldom questioned. Rather than proposing some more arrangements to overcome some of its drawbacks, our point, in this paper, will actually consist in a more radical critique which addresses first the very notion of meaning. For us, a semantic theory should not focus on finding ”the meaning of a complex expression” but rather on drawing adequate inferences. This shift of focus allows us to present an approach which fulfills the tasks that the notion of meaning is supposed to carry out, without an explicit (and compositional) construction of the meaning of parts and wholes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper aims to {{show how}} Montague-style grammars can be {{completely}} formalized and thereby declaratively implemented by using the Grammatical Framework GF. The implementation covers the fundamental operations of Montague’s PTQ model: the construction of analysis trees, the linearization of trees into strings, and the interpretation of trees as logical formulas. Moreover, a parsing algorithm {{is derived from the}} grammar. Given that GF is a constructive type theory with dependent types, the technique extends from classical <b>Montague</b> <b>grammars</b> to ones in which the Curry-Howard isomorphism is used to explain anaphoric reference. On the other hand, GF has a built-in compositionality requirement that is stronger than in PTQ and prevents us from formulating quantifying-in rules of Montague style. This leads us to alternative formulations of such rules in terms of combinators and discontinuous constituents. The PTQ fragment will moreover be presented as an exmple of how a GF grammar is modified by replacing English with another target language, French. The paper concludes by a discussion of the complementary rôles of logically and linguistically oriented syntax. ...|$|R

Richard Montague could preserve the most important advantages of Church's intensional calculus in his system.

50|$|Ludlow's {{earliest}} work in semantics was {{an attempt}} to combine work in the theory of meaning with contemporary work in generative linguistics, but using resources that are more parsimonious than those typically used in semantic theory—for example without using the higher-order functions and intensional objects deployed in <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar.</b> The resources were largely limited to primitives like truth and reference to individuals.|$|E
50|$|Linguists rarely {{employed}} formal semantics until Richard Montague {{showed how}} English (or any natural language) could {{be treated like}} a formal language. His contribution to linguistic semantics, which {{is now known as}} <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar,</b> was the basis for further developments, like the categorial grammar of Bar-Hillel and colleagues, and the more recent type-logical semantics (or grammar) based on Lambek calculus.|$|E
50|$|Most {{systems of}} categorial grammar {{subdivide}} categories. The most common {{way to do}} this is by tagging them with features, such as person, gender, number, and tense. Sometimes only atomic categories are tagged in this way. In <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar,</b> it is traditional to subdivide function categories using a multiple slash convention, so A/B and A//B would be two distinct categories of left-applying functions, that took the same arguments but could be distinguished between by other functions taking them as arguments.|$|E
50|$|He pioneered {{a logical}} {{approach}} to natural language semantics which {{became known as}} <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar.</b> This approach to language has been especially influential among certain computational linguists—perhaps more so than among more traditional philosophers of language. In particular, Montague's influence lives on in grammar approaches like categorial grammar (such as Unification Categorial Grammar, Left-Associate Grammar, or Combinatory Categorial Grammar), which attempt a derivation of syntactic and semantic representation in tandem and the semantics of quantifiers, scope and discourse (Hans Kamp, a student of Montague, co-developed Discourse Representation Theory).|$|E
5000|$|Finally, {{over the}} past century, forms of logic have been {{developed}} that are not dependent exclusively on the notions of truth and falsity. Some {{of these types of}} logic have been called modal logics. They explain how certain logical connectives such as [...] "if-then" [...] work in terms of necessity and possibility. Indeed, modal logic was the basis {{of one of the most}} popular and rigorous formulations in modern semantics called the <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar.</b> The successes of such systems naturally give rise to the argument that these systems have captured the natural meaning of connectives like if-then far better than an ordinary, truth-functional logic ever could.|$|E
50|$|It is {{frequently}} taken {{to mean that}} every operation of the syntax should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by Donald Davidson, to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the T-schema with an operator in the semantics that specifies how {{the meaning of the}} whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar),</b> this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a homomorphism between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{ideas of}} categorial grammar date from work by Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (in 1935) and Yehoshua Bar-Hillel (in 1953). In 1958, Joachim Lambek {{introduced}} a syntactic calculus that formalized the function type constructors along with various {{rules for the}} combination of functions. This calculus is a forerunner oflinear logic {{in that it is}} a substructural logic. <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> uses an ad hoc syntactic system for English that is based on the principles of categorial grammar. Although Montague's work is sometimes regarded as syntactically uninteresting, it helped to bolster interest in categorial grammar by associating it with a highly successful formal treatment of natural language semantics. More recent work in categorial grammar has focused on the improvement of syntactic coverage. One formalism which has received considerable attention in recent years is Steedman and Szabolcsi's combinatory categorial grammar which builds on combinatory logic invented by Moses Schönfinkel and Haskell Curry.|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of formal semantics, it has become {{increasingly}} difficult to ignore that <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> does well enough in formally interpreting certain features of natural languages. However, the question of 'adequacy' of this grammatical approach to the formal semantic paradigm {{is still one of the}} most significant current discussions in philosophy of language and linguistics alike. Within the formal semantic paradigm, the test of adequacy for <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> (with respect to Arabic) is to demonstrate syntactic compositionality at a level which guarantees semantic compositionality via a formal interpretation. The main aim of my thesis has been to examine the adequacy of <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> to discharge the requirements of the formal semantic paradigm. The central focus of the thesis has been an attempt to apply <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> to Arabic quantification as a case study. The method adopted for this investigation is to use a 'fragment' of Arabic quantification. In my fragment, random expressions of Arabic quantification have been selected from Arabic textbooks. One of the more significant findings is that <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> 'succeeds' in providing a compositional interpretation of a fragment of Arabic quantification. On this basis, I argue that <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> is adequate to the local requirements of formal semantic paradigm. I argue that, since <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> is shown to be applicable to another significant kind of case (i. e., Arabic, as an example from another language group), this increases the evidence for the hypothesis that <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> is universally applicable. I argue that, because we have increased evidence for the claim that there is a universal compositional grammar, we have increased evidence for the hypothesis that all natural languages are compositional, and share a common compositional core. The most interesting non-philosophical implication of the study is that the extended Montagovian approach strengthens its position among the varieties of semantic theory for having proved applicable in another language group. I conclude by arguing that the applicability of <b>Montague</b> <b>grammar</b> merits consideration in new cases. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
