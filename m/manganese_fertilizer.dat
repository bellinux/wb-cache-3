40|$|Water {{comprises}} 99 % of most spray {{solutions and}} {{properties of the}} water used as carrier can influence the efficacy of herbicides. Water pH is one property of water which can limit the solubility of some herbicides or cause degradation of herbicides through hydrolysis. Water hardness, or the amount of dissolved cations in water, can reduce herbicide efficacy due to binding of herbicide molecules to cations. The presence of these cations can cause reduced absorption or translocation of the herbicide into plants. Glyphosate is the most studied herbicide {{with respect to the}} influence of water pH and hardness. Some herbicides have also exhibited reduced efficacy when co-applied with other herbicides or foliar fertilizers. Antagonism of herbicides has been documented with protoporphyrinogen IX inhibiting herbicides and glyphosate. Glyphosate has been documented to exhibit reduced phytotoxicity when applied with <b>manganese</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The objective of this research was to evaluate the response of selected herbicides applied in water with varying pH and hardness, or co-applied with various herbicides and foliar fertilizers. ^ Saflufenacil, a protoporphyrinogen IX inhibitor, was tested to determine a response to five pH levels (4. 0, 5. 2, 6. 5, 7. 7, and 9. 0) or three water hardness levels (0, 310, and 620 mg L- 1). A field study on common lambsquarters and giant ragweed was conducted as well as a greenhouse bioassay on horseweed and corn to determine the influence of these water properties on saflufenacil efficacy. In both the field and greenhouse experiments, no influence of water hardness was seen when proper adjuvants were included in the spray solution. However, water pH at 4. 0 reduced the efficacy of saflufenacil on common lambsquarters in the field experiments and corn in the greenhouse experiments. High pressure liquid chromatography testing on the solubility of saflufenacil found that the solubility of saflufenacil was reduced from 3, 687 mg L- 1 at pH 7. 7 to 10 mg L- 1 at pH 4. 0. This reduction in solubility may have led to the reduced efficacy on corn in the greenhouse where a pH of 4. 0 showed only 79 % reduction in growth as compared to 87 % reduction in growth with a pH of 7. 7. ^ A second study on saflufenacil was conducted to test if adjusting the pH of the saflufenacil solution would influence efficacy. Saflufenacil was mixed in five different carrier waters with initial pH values of 4. 0, 5. 2, 6. 5, 7. 7, or 9. 0 and adjusted to one of four final pH levels (4. 0, 6. 5, 9. 0, or no change). When initial pH levels were acidic (4. 0 or 5. 2) and raised to a more neutral pH, saflufenacil efficacy on corn was increased. It was also observed that when initial pH was 6. 5 or 7. 7 and reduced to 4. 0, saflufenacil efficacy on corn was reduced. ^ Saflufenacil was also tested for interaction with fourteen herbicides. A field study was conducted on fallow ground containing common lambsquarters, giant ragweed, and giant foxtail. Saflufenacil co-applied with glyphosate or glufosinate provided the most consistent and best control of giant foxtail and common lambsquarters at 14 days after treatment. At 21 days after treatment, control of common lambsquarters was best with 2, 4 -D and dicamba mixed with saflufenacil. All tank mixtures provided 85 % or more control of common lambsquarters except imazaquin, imazethapyr, or chlorimuron-methyl co-applied with saflufenacil. All tank mixtures provided better control of weeds as compared to saflufenacil alone. ^ 2, 4 -D and dicamba, two growth regulator herbicides, were tested for a reduction in efficacy when applied in water with calcium ions, magnesium ions, <b>manganese</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> or zinc fertilizer. 2, 4 -D control of horseweed or redroot pigweed was decreased when ammonium sulfate {{was not included in the}} spray solution regardless of the presence of cations or fertilizers. Overall, 2, 4 -D efficacy was reduced when applied in water containing <b>manganese</b> <b>fertilizer</b> as compared to 2, 4 -D applied in deionized water. The presence of calcium ions decreased 2, 4 -D control of common lambsquarters when ammonium sulfate was not used. Dicamba control of common lambsquarters and redroot pigweed was decreased when applied in water with magnesium or manganese in the absence of ammonium sulfate. No reduction in dicamba control of horseweed was noted across cation solutions, as was seen with 2, 4 -D. ...|$|E
40|$|Potato {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tuberous crops. To achieve optimum yield in potato, suitable brand and sufficient and balanced soil nutrients are necessary. In order to study the effects of Zinc, Manganese and Copper on potato yield and leaf and tuber concentrations of Phosphorus and Iron, a factorial pot experiment with 32 treatments was conducted in greenhouse of Soil Science Department, Zanjan University, using a completely randomized design and three replications. The study factors were four levels of Zinc(Zn 0 : 1. 14, Zn 1 : 5, Zn 2 : 10 and Zn 3 : 15 mg/kg soil), four levels of Manganese(Mn 0 : 1. 4, Mn 1 : 5, Mn 3 : 10 and Mn 4 : 20 mg/kg soil) and two levels of Copper (Cu 0 : 0. 22 and Cu 1 : 2 mg/kg soil) which were applied to the soils of planting pots. The results showed that potato yield increased as the soil concentrations of Zinc, Manganese and copper increased to certain levels Soil application of zinc and <b>manganese</b> <b>fertilizers</b> significantly decreased leaf and tuber concentrations of Phosphorus and Iron. Soil application of copper decreased Iron concentration of leaf but not Phosphorus.

40|$|In {{order to}} study effect of foliar {{application}} of Zinc and Manganese on yield {{and quality of}} potato crop, an experiment was conducted at Aligoudarz Agriculture research station, Lorestan, Iran. The experiment was a randomized complete block design whit 4 replication. All combinations of 4 levels of both elements (including 0, 2, 4 and 8 ppt solution as sulfate compound ZnSO 4, MnSO 4), Which formed 16 different treatments, were distributed randomly in each block. Solutions were sprayed 10 days before and 20 days after flowering. Plants were harvested after ripened and plant characteristics including tuber weight, number of tuber per plant, tuber yield, percent of dry matter, specific weight, protein and starch percent on tuber were measured. Results showed that Zn and Mn application increased all plant characteristics relating to yield and quality of potato crop. These were tuber yield per plant, dry matter percentage, specific weight, protein and starch contents of the tuber. Application of Zn at 8 ppt increased yield to 34170 kg ha - 1 which, was 25 % higher compare with control, meanwhile application of Mn at 4 ppt level increased yield to 33866 kg ha - 1 which was only 15 % higher than control. However application of Mn at 8 ppt decreased both quality and yield of potato tuber compare with 2 and 4 ppt. maximum yield (38950 kg ha - 1) was obtained at 8 ppt of Zn and 4 ppt of Mn foliar application. Fertilizers were significantly affected on elements percentage in tuber. Zinc increased Zn percentage and decrease phosphorus percentage in tuber. Manganese increased Mn percentage of tuber, but no significantly effected on Zn, P and K in tuber.

40|$|The {{objects of}} this study are three {{manganese}} ore deposits and one mine derived from lateritic weathering of gondites (spessartine quartzites). These deposits are associated with Mn-rich garnet metasediments of the Itapira Group (Paleoproterozoic) and the reserves were estimated at approximately 2. 0 × 10 6 tons with an average grade of 23 % MnO 2. The ore minerals are cryptomelane, pyrolusite, lithiophorite, spessartine and psilomelane. Several crystal shapes and textural characteristics were identifi ed in this study, which are related to the degree of liberation, as confi rmed by heavy media separation method. In this study, we determined the main characteristics of the liberation of manganese, which is concentrated in the fi ne grain-size fraction and is lost during ore dressing. Therefore, the low average content of MnO 2 (28 %) is due to this loss, whereas at grain size of minus 0. 074 mm, contents near 40 % MnO 2 were observed. This suggests that the ore can be used for manufacturing <b>manganese</b> sulphate <b>fertilizers.</b> A comparative study with the ore deposits located at Ouro Fino (MG), mainly with the Caneleiras mine, showed that higher degree of liberation occurs in the coarse grain-size fractions (0. 84 to 0. 074 mm with MnO 2 content of 38 %). As a consequence, the ore can be used for manufacturing Fe-Si-Mn alloys...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess whether an extra {{fertilization}} with <b>manganese,</b> commercial <b>fertilizer</b> Alkalin (N, K and Si), and combined treatment (manganese + Alkalin) affect the chemical composition of chokeberry fruits (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx) Elliot), especially sugar content and the quantity and profile of phenolics. Dry weight, soluble solids, titratable acidity, total sugar, reducing sugar, sucrose, vitamin C, total polyphenol (gallic acid equivalents); 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity; and phenolics profile were measured from the fruits harvested from different treatments. Chokeberries treated with manganese showed high content of non-identified phenolic acids [101. 15 mg per 100 g fresh weight (FW), these compounds were not detected in fruit treated with Alkalin and manganese + Alkalin], and the highest content of cyanidin glycosides (813. 75 mg per 100 g FW). The fruits treated with Alkalin displayed the highest content of quercetin derivatives (40. 88 mg per 100 g FW) and eriodictyol 7 -glucuronide (26. 43 mg per 100 g FW). Chokeberries in control treatments had the highest content of dry weight (30. 76 % FW), soluble solids (24. 1 % FW), total sugar (20. 92 % FW), vitamin C (8. 4 mg 100 g 1 FW), total polyphenol (2377. 1 mg gallic acid equivalents per 100 g FW), the highest 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical % inhibition (38. 1 %), highest content of chlorogenic acids (210. 38 mg per 100 g FW), (-) epicatechin (32. 18 mg per 100 g FW) and the highest degree of procyanidin polimerization (59). The results indicate that applied fertilization exerted differential influence on chemical composition of aronia fruits. ...|$|R
30|$|As the metals {{combined}} with organic compound, the organic complex was formed (chelates) that tightly trapped the metallic elements, preventing their release to the soil. Trapped metals in chelates lost their cationic characteristics, making them {{less prone to}} precipitation that is useful in agriculture. When natural products decomposes, they can generate naturally chelating agents such as organic acids, amino acids, lignin-sulfonates, lignin poly carboxylates, sugar acids and derivatives, phenols, poly flavonoids, siderophores, and phytosiderophores. Other chelating agents could be developed synthetically, both types of chelating/complexion causing increment of micronutrient solubility. One {{of the most important}} characteristics of chelating agents used is the relative stability of various metal chelates, especially if one is considering synthetically developed chelates. In other words, it is the degree of affinity of a given agent for a metal. From the stability constant data, the ability of one metal to compete with another can be estimated. Stability of micronutrient chelate bonded generally determines “plant availability” of the applied micronutrient. An effective chelate relationship is one in which the rate of substitution of the chelated micronutrients for cations already in the soil is low, thus maintaining the applied micronutrient in the chelated form for length of time sufficient to be absorbed by the plant roots. The chelated forms of micronutrients have advantages over traditional forms of inorganic fertilizers such as smaller quantities required, are much more easily absorbed, more easily translocate within the plant, easily assimilated within the plant system, chances of “scorching” of crops, while using chelates is less because they are organic substances, compatible {{with a wide variety of}} pesticides and liquid fertilizers, and are not readily leached from the soil as they adsorb on to the surface of soil particles. It has been found that in the alkaline soils, where Fe solubility and availability to plants are extremely low, adding soluble Fe salts is not very effective, unless the soluble Fe is in a form that does not react with the soil system and yet can be readily assimilated by plants. There are two alternatives available to deal with iron deficiency. These are soil application of iron chelates and foliar sprays containing chelated iron. If the soil pH is alkaline, chelates must be preferred to inorganic salts. In citrus cultivation, application of about 10 – 20 [*]g Fe/tree in chelate form has proved satisfactory. The application of Fe-EDDHA and Fe-sugar acid chelates at 7 [*]mg Fe/l resulted in re-greening of leaves in iron-deficient plants. Chelating agents, from which iron has been released and under conditions favorable to chelation of Mn, compete with plant roots for Mn. Chelating agents have the ability to keep iron sufficiently in solution to provide enough iron at the root surface to effect competition with <b>manganese.</b> Organic zinc <b>fertilizer</b> sources are the che 1 ates of EDTA, NTA, HEDTA, and iron citrate. Other organic sources include Zn-lignin sulfonate, Zn-poly flavonoid, and by-products of the wood pulp industry. Mn is mainly transported as Mn and not as an organic complex. Thus, Mn chelates are effective only when used as liquid fertilizer formulation and hydroponics. Application of Cu chelates with different amino acids increased chlorophyll content, grain yield, amino acid content, and the uptake. True amino acid chelates are emerging as state-of-the-art technology for delivering selected micronutrients with maximum bioavailability, tolerability, and safety. In this study, urea is considered as the main source of nitrogen and a carrier for the obtained nanoparticles, while citric acid is the main chelating agent for potassium, iron, magnesium, zinc, manganese, calcium, and amino acids. This is explained as citric acid is one of the most important organic acids in the respiratory pathways into plant cell. Also, it is essential for different biochemical and physiological processes. Potassium citrate increases leaf area, improves leaf mineral content, enhances yield, and improves fruit quality (Ibrahim et al. 2015). Calcium with urea may improve crop production and increases ammonium, potassium, and phosphorus absorption. It also stimulates photosynthesis and increases the size of sellable plant parts (Feagley and Fenn 1998). It is reported that the most optimum form for increasing iron content in plant system is the citrate form which is a significant nutrition for plants and iron deficiency causes severe problem for the soil (Mordoğan et al. 2013). Taha et al. (2014) also concluded the application of banana peel extract as a potential natural source of antioxidant and antimicrobial sources. To determine the effects of foliar application of amino acid and calcium chelate on Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apple trees, a randomized complete block design with four repetitions was conducted. The combination of amino acid and calcium chelate increased weight of both cultivars (Aboul-Enein et al. 2016). Amino acid chelate fertilizers were conducted to test its effect on the growing of Pennisetum American and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) forage crops as well as their effects on some soil properties. The results indicated that organic matter and CEC of soil tended to increase slightly with the use of synthesized fertilizers as compared with unfertilized check; also, they improved the soil content of macro- and microelements. The efficiency of organic synthesized fertilizers was improved when they are applied in combination with 1 / 2 unit or one unit of NPK recommended rates (Arabloo et al. 2017). The effect of both diphenylamin and tryptophan significantly increased plant growth (in terms of plant height, number of leaves/plant, stem diameter, root length, and leaf area, as well as fresh and dry weights of the different plant parts) and the contents of carotenoids, total soluble sugars, and total free amino acids in the leaves as reported (Mostafa et al. 2014). Short-time application of protein hydrolysates increased the root dry weight of maize plants compared to the untreated plants (Abou Dahab and Abd El-Aziz 2006, Nardi et al. 2016). Based on the abovementioned discussion, potassium hydroxide was used for dissolving the cellulosic material, leading to liberation of the fertilizing agent to the solution; then, carrier and chelating agent were added to convert these agents to the nanochelating biostimulant fertilizers. Due to the presence of minerals (K+, Mg++, Fe++, Mn++, Na+, Zn++, and Cu++), tryptophan, amino acids, and protein, a complicated structure with high fertilizing value from the banana peels was obtained.|$|R
