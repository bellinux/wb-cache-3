40|$|Vertical accommodative vergence is {{an unusual}} synkinesis in which {{vertical}} vergence is modulated together with accommodation. It results from a supranuclear <b>miswiring</b> of the network normally conveying accommodative convergence. So far, it is unknown whether this condition is congenital or acquired. We identified an otherwise healthy girl who gradually developed vertical accommodative vergence between five to 13 years of age. Change of accommodation by 3 diopters induced a vertical vergence of 10 degrees. This observation proves that the <b>miswiring</b> responsible for vertical accommodative vergence must not necessarily be congenital, but can be acquired. The cause and the mechanism leading to vertical accommodative vergence are yet unknown...|$|R

40|$|Schizophrenia is {{increasingly}} {{thought of as}} a brain network or connectome disorder and is associated with neurodevelopmental processes. Previous studies have suggested the important role of anatomical distance in developing a connectome with optimized performance regarding both the cost and efficiency of information processing. Distance-related disturbances during development have not been investigated in schizophrenia. To test the distance-related <b>miswiring</b> profiles of connectomes in schizophrenia, we acquired resting-state images from 20 adulthood-onset (AOS) and 26 early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) patients, as well as age-matched healthy controls. All patients were drug naive and had experienced their first psychotic episode. A novel threshold-free surface-based analytic framework was developed to examine local-to-remote functional connectivity profiles in both AOS and EOS patients. We observed consistent increases of local connectivity across both EOS and AOS patients in the right superior frontal gyrus, where the connectivity strength was correlated with a positive syndrome score in AOS patients. In contrast, EOS but not AOS patients exhibited reduced local connectivity within the right postcentral gyrus and the left middle occipital cortex. These regions&# 39; remote connectivity with their interhemispheric areas and brain network hubs was altered. Diagnosis-age interactions were detectable for both local and remote connectivity profiles. The functional covariance between local and remote homotopic connectivity was present in typically developing controls, but was absent in EOS patients. These findings suggest that a distance-dependent <b>miswiring</b> pattern {{may be one of the}} key neurodevelopmental features of the abnormal connectome organization in schizophrenia...|$|R

When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a <b>miswired</b> connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine—a faulty igniter line. The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.|$|R

We show here that geniculocortical mapping is imprecise when the waves of spontaneous activity in the retina during the first postnatal week are disrupted genetically. This anatomical mapping defect is present by postnatal day 8 and has functional consequences, as revealed by optical imaging and microelectrode recording in adults. Pharmacological disruption of these retinal waves {{during the first week}} phenocopies the mapping defect, confirming both the site and the timing of the disruption in neural activity responsible for the defect.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that motor experience {{plays a role}} in shaping development of the corticospinal system and voluntary motor control, which is a key motor function of the system. Here we used a mouse model with conditional forebrain deletion of the gene for EphA 4 (Emx 1 -Cre:EphA 4 tm 2 Kldr), which regulates development of the laterality of corticospinal tract (CST). We combined study of Emx 1 -Cre:EphA 4 tm 2 Kldr with unilateral forelimb constraint during development to expand our understanding of experience-dependent CST development from both basic and translational perspectives. This mouse develops dense ipsilateral CST projections, a bilateral motor cortex motor representation, and bilateral motor phenotypes. Together these phenotypes can be used as readouts of corticospinal system organization and function and the changes brought about by experience. The Emx 1 -Cre:EphA 4 tm 2 Kldr mouse shares features with the common developmental disorder cerebral palsy: bilateral voluntary motor impairments and bilateral CST <b>miswiring.</b> Emx 1 -Cre:EphA 4 tm 2 Kldr mice with typical motor experiences during development display the bilateral phenotype of "mirror" reaching, because of a strongly bilateral motor cortex motor representation and a bilateral CST. By contrast, Emx 1 -Cre:EphA 4 tm 2 Kldr mice that experienced unilateral forelimb constraint from P 1 to P 30 and tested at maturity had a more contralateral motor cortex motor representation in each hemisphere; more lateralized CST projections; and substantially more lateralized/independent reaching movements. Changes in CST organization and function in this model can be explained by reduced synaptic competition of the CST from the side without developmental forelimb motor experiences. Using this model we show that unilateral constraint largely abrogated the effects of the genetic mutation on CST projections and thus demonstrates how robust and persistent experience-dependent development can be for the establishment of corticospinal system connections and voluntary control. Further, our findings inform the mechanisms of and strategies for developing behavioral therapies to treat bilateral movement impairments and CST <b>miswiring</b> in cerebral palsy...|$|R

40|$|Nearly {{everyone}} has experienced the “small world ” social phenomenon, {{in which people}} newly introduced to each other often find they have an acquaintance in common. Recent {{research has indicated that}} the connection topology of social networks is neither completely regular nor completely random, but lies somewhere in between. Moreover, other biological and technological networks have been shown to have similar “small world ” or scale-free properties, where the nodes of the connection graph are highly clustered (like a regular lattice) yet have short characteristic diameters (like a fully random graph). In this paper, we argue that the study of such networks may be of particular interest to computer architects as we implement computation in emerging 1 technologies such as self-assembled nanotechnolgy or biological computing. For example, if the processor nodes of a parallel computer are connected using DNA-templated self-assembly of molecular-scale wiring, it is highly probable that some fraction of the intended connections will be <b>miswired.</b> While it is possible to tolerate these defects by incorporating enough redundancy in the network architecture, it may be preferable to exploit these random shortcuts to route long distance messages and decrease the average latency of message-passing. ...|$|R
40|$|The UNC- 4 homeoprotein and the Groucho-like {{corepressor}} UNC- 37 specify synaptic {{choice in}} the Caenorhabditis elegans motor neuron circuit. In unc- 4 mutants, VA motor neurons are <b>miswired</b> with inputs from interneurons normally reserved for their lineal sisters, the VB motor neurons. Here we show that UNC- 4 and UNC- 37 function together in VA motor neurons to repress VB-specific genes and that this activity depends on physical contact between UNC- 37 and a conserved Engrailed-like repressor domain (eh 1) in UNC- 4. Missense mutations in the UNC- 4 eh 1 domain disrupt interactions between UNC- 4 and UNC- 37 and result {{in the loss of}} UNC- 4 -dependent repressor activity in vivo. A compensatory amino acid substitution in UNC- 37 suppresses specific unc- 4 alleles by restoring physical interactions with UNC- 4 as well as UNC- 4 -dependent repression of VB-specific genes. We propose that repression of VB-specific genes by UNC- 4 and UNC- 37 is necessary for the creation of wild-type inputs to VA motor neurons.

40|$|During development, neurons {{establish}} inappropriate connections as {{they seek}} out their synaptic partners, resulting in supernumerary synapses that must be pruned away. The removal of <b>miswired</b> synapses usually involves electrical activity, often through a Hebbian spike-timing mechanism. A novel form of activity-dependent refinement is used by Drosophila that may be non-Hebbian, and is critical for generating the precise connectivity observed in that system. In Drosophila, motoneurons use both glutamate and the biogenic amine octopamine for neurotransmission, and the muscle fibers receive multiple synaptic inputs. Motoneuron growth cones respond in a time-regulated fashion to multiple chemotropic signals arising from their postsynaptic partners. Central to this mechanism is a very low frequency (< 0. 03 Hz) oscillation of presynaptic cytoplasmic calcium, that regulates and coordinates the action of multiple downstream effectors involved in the withdrawal from off-target contacts. Low frequency calcium oscillations are widely observed in developing neural circuits in mammals, and {{have been shown to}} be critical for normal connectivity in a variety of neural systems. In Drosophila these mechanisms allow the growth cone to sample widely among possible synaptic partners, evaluate opponent chemotropic signals, and withdraw from off-target contacts.

40|$|The unc- 4 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a {{homeodomain}} {{protein that}} defines synaptic input to ventral cord motor neurons. unc- 4 mutants {{are unable to}} crawl backward because VA motor neurons are <b>miswired</b> with synaptic connections normally reserved for their sister cells, the VB motor neurons. These changes in connectivity are not accompanied by any visible effects upon neuronal morphology, which suggests that unc- 4 regulates synaptic specificity but not axonal guidance or outgrowth. In an effort to identify other genes in the unc- 4 pathway, we have devised a selection scheme for rare mutations that suppress the Unc- 4 phenotype. We have isolated four, dominant, extragenic, allele-specific suppressors of unc- 4 (e 2322 ts), a temperature sensitive allele with a point mutation in the unc- 4 homeodomain.

Increasing the positron injection rate would allow more time for all experiments performed at CESR. Therefore, determining a method for an increased injection rate is {{the objective of this}} investigation. Several different projects were accomplished throughout the course of this research. Simulations were the bulk of this work and involved (1) modeling the creation of positrons, (2) determining the optics of the linac injector, (3) creating a simulation (utilizing the BMAD code) to transport positrons through the optics, and (4) validating the simulations so that predictions could be accepted. Measurements from the linac injector were used as parameters in the simulations, in addition to being central to the validations. Finally, the simulation parameters in the model were varied to maximize the capture efficiency: the fraction of positrons transported throughout the linac injector.

The sensory neurons that innervate these hairs synapse with giant interneurons in the terminal ganglion that in turn synapse with interneurons and leg motor neurons in thoracic ganglia. This neural circuit mediates the animal's escape behavior. The transcription factor Engrailed (En) is expressed only in the medially born sensory neurons, which suggested that it could work as a positional determinant of sensory neuron identity. Previously, we used double-stranded RNA interference to abolish En expression {{and found that the}} axonal arborization and synaptic outputs of an identified En-positive sensory neuron changed so that it came to resemble a nearby En-negative cell, which was itself unaffected.

The probability of selecting a particular ET is influenced by wind direction. In this present study, we show that early instar juvenile cockroaches also use those same ETs. En knock-out significantly perturbs the animals' perception of posterior wind, altering the choice of ETs to one more appropriate for anterior wind.

2500|$|Duane {{syndrome}} is most probably a <b>miswiring</b> {{of the eye}} muscles, causing some eye muscles to contract when they shouldn't and other eye muscles not to contract when they should. Alexandrakis and Saunders found that {{in most cases the}} abducens nucleus and nerve are absent or hypoplastic, and the lateral rectus muscle is innervated by a branch of the oculomotor nerve. This view is supported by the earlier work of Hotchkiss et al. who reported on the autopsy findings of two patients with Duane's syndrome. In both cases the sixth cranial nerve nucleus and nerve was absent, and the lateral rectus muscle was innervated by the inferior division of the third or oculomotor nerve. This misdirection of nerve fibres results in opposing muscles being innervated by the same nerve. Thus, on attempted abduction, stimulation of the lateral rectus via the oculomotor nerve will be accompanied by stimulation of the opposing medial rectus via the same nerve; a muscle which works to adduct the eye. Thus, co-contraction of the muscles takes place, limiting the amount of movement achievable and also resulting in retraction of the eye into the socket. They also noticed mechanical factors and considered them secondary to loss of innervation: During corrective surgery fibrous attachments have been found connecting the horizontal recti and the orbital walls and fibrosis of the lateral rectus has been confirmed by biopsy. This fibrosis can result in the lateral rectus being 'tight' and acting as a tether or leash. [...] Co-contraction of the medial and lateral recti allows the globe to slip up or down under the tight lateral rectus producing the up and down shoots characteristic of the condition.|$|R
