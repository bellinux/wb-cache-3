Since the <b>magnesium</b> <b>phosphates</b> are unable to form an apatite structure, the plant-available phosphorus remains in the soil, leading to better growth results observed in agricultural pot experiments.

Catheter encrustation stems from infection with urease-producing bacteria, particularly Proteus mirabilis.

Developed sensors enabled catheter blockage to be predicted ∼ 17 – 24 h in advance of its occurrence. Signaling only occurred following infection with urease positive bacteria and only when catheter blockage followed. In summary, sensors were developed that could predict urinary catheter blockage in in vitro infection models.

The structural properties of these catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, their textural properties were determined by N 2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the dispersion of cobalt–molybdenum was studied by XPS spectroscopy. Their acid properties have been investigated by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed molecules, often, 2, 6 -dimethylpyridine (pKa= 6. 7), pyridine (pKa= 5. 3). Co–Mo incorporation leads to a modification in the MgP acid–base properties, especially on the acid sites type and number. Thus, lower loading of cobalt–molybdenum species decreased the number of strong Lewis acid sites whereas higher loading increased it. It was found that Lewis acid sites on <b>magnesium</b> <b>phosphates</b> {{play an important role}} in the isomerization of 3, 3 -dimethylbut- 1 -ene. The 3, 3 -dimethylbut- 1 -ene (33 DMB 1) conversion increases with the reaction temperature from 493 to 653 K for MgP, but decreases after 573 K for MgP supported by Co–Mo.

40|$|Electro-concentration of {{nutrients}} from waste streams is a promising technology to enable resource recovery, but has several operational concerns. One key {{concern is the}} formation of inorganic scale on the concentrate side of cation exchange membranes when recovering nutrients from wastewaters containing calcium, magnesium, phosphorous and carbonate, commonly present in anaerobic digester rejection water. Electrodialytic nutrient recovery was trialed on anaerobic digester rejection water in a laboratory scale electro-concentration unit without treatment (A), following struvite recovery (B), and following struvite recovery as well as concentrate controlled at pH 5 for scaling control (C). Treatment A resulted in large amount of scale, while treatment B significantly reduced the amount of scale formation with reduction in <b>magnesium</b> <b>phosphates,</b> and treatment C reduced the amount of scale further by limiting the formation of calcium carbonates. Treatment C resulted in an 87 ± 7 % by weight reduction in scale compared to treatment A. A mechanistic model for the inorganic processes was validated using a previously published general precipitation model based on saturation index. The model attributed the reduction in struvite scale to the removal of phosphate during the struvite pre-treatment, and the reduction in calcium carbonate scale to pH control resulting in the stripping of carbonate as carbon dioxide gas. This indicates that multiple strategies {{may be required to}} control precipitation, and that mechanistic models can assist in developing a combined approach...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurposeAlexander Randall {{identified}} {{calcium phosphate}} plaques in renal papillae as {{the origin of}} kidney stones. However, {{little is known about}} the early steps of Randall’s plaque formation, preceding the onset of urolithiasis. Our objectives were to characterize the composition and the initial formation site of incipient Randall’s plaque in non-stone formers living patients. Material and MethodsMedian age of the patients was 67. 7 years. Fifty-four healthy papillae from kidneys removed for cancer and without stones have been analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Von Kossa staining, Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis, μ-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy coupled to Selected-Area Electron Diffraction and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy. ResultsIncipient Randall’s plaque has been observed in 72. 7 % of kidneys. Carbonated apatite was as expected the main component of microcalcifications but amorphous calcium phosphate and whitlockite have been identified in 80 % and 40 % of the papillae, respectively. Incipient plaques stood in the deepest part of the papillae, around the loop of Henle tip but also around vasa recta (respectively 62. 4 % and 37. 2 % of microcalcifications) and rarely close to collecting ducts. At the nanoscale level, incipient calcifications were often made of several nanocrystals inside organic material looking like microvesicles. ConclusionsIncipient Randall’s plaque is frequent and appears at the extreme tip of renal papillae, around the hairpin structure of the loop of Henle but also around vasa recta. Nanoscale analyses suggest a local nucleation process promoting nanocrystal growth in a supersaturated milieu.

40|$|The {{crystalline}} biofilms {{formed by}} Proteus mirabilis can seriously complicate {{the care of}} patients undergoing long-term bladder catheterization. The generation of alkaline urine by the bacterial urease causes calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>phosphates</b> to precipitate from urine and accumulate in the catheter biofilm, blocking the flow of urine from the bladder. The pH at which these salts crystallize from a urine sample, the nucleation pH (pHn), can be elevated by diluting the urine and by increasing its citrate content. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether manipulation of pHn in these ways modulated the rate at which crystalline biofilm developed. Experiments in laboratory models of the catheterized bladder infected with P. mirabilis showed that when the bladder was supplied with a concentrated urine (pHn 6 ? 7) at a low fluid output (720 ml per 24 h), catheters blocked at 19 – 31 h. Diluting this urine 1 : 4 increased the pHn to 7 ? 5 and models supplied with this urine at 2880 ml per 24 h took 110 – 137 h to block. When models were supplied with urine containing citrate at 1 ? 5 mg ml” 1 or above (pHn 8 ? 3 – 9 ? 1), the catheters drained freely for the full 7 day experimental period. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the catheter biofilms that developed in urine with high pHn values were devoid of crystalline formations. These observations should encourage a clinical trial to examine the effect of increasing a patient’s fluid intake with citrate-containing drinks on the encrustation and blockage of catheters...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{development}} of a kinetic-based model to simulate chemical, physical and biological processes in three phase (gaseous-aqueous-solid) mixed weak acid/base systems is described. The chemical processes are {{expressed in terms of}} the kinetics of the forward and reverse reactions for the dissociation of the weak acid/bases. In this approach the H⁺ and all the species of the weak acidfbases of interest are included and the pH is calculated directly from H⁺ via pH = -log (H⁺). The advantage of this approach over the alkalinity/equilibrium chemistry approach is that kinetics are used throughout. Also, the approach is general and can be applied to any combination of mixed weak acid/base systems. The kinetic expressions of the carbonate, phosphate, ammonia, acetate and water systems, including the kinetics of the three phase chemical processes viz. precipitation/dissolution of calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>phosphates</b> and carbonates and gas stripping/dissolution of O₂, CO₂ and NH₃, were programmed into the AQUASIM shell package to generate simulation results. The chemical processes part of the model was validated by comparing steady state model predictions with those obtained from equilibrium chemistry based models such as STASOFT I and III (Loewenthal et al., 1986, 1991). Virtually identical results were obtained. The kinetic approach allowed integration of the biological kinetic processes of the IAWQ activated sludge model No 1 (Henze et al., 1987), to extend application of the model to situations where precipitation of minerals, stripping of gasses and biological processes take place in an environment where the pH does not remain constant.
