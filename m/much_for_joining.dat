This week {{we begin}} our star of the month festival for March — a thirty-six-film salute {{to one of the}} most underrated actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, the {{delightful}} Ann Sothern. Over the course of her sixty-year career, Ann Sothern found success on the stage, on radio, on film and, certainly, on television, becoming one of those faces which would, invariably, make an audience, en masse, kind of give it a happy sigh of relief, knowing well, now we're in good hands, I know I'm gonna have a good time. And with Ann Sothern, they always did. Still, I don't think the film industry ever really fully appreciated her abilities and rarely gave her a chance to stretch as an actress, something Ann lamented about later in her life. Early on, she spent time working all over Hollywood — at Warner Brothers, RKO, Twentieth Century Fox and things got particularly promising for her when she signed with the mighty MGM in 1939. But that didn't really pan out much either. She was so charming in whatever she was given to do, MGM put her in one film after another and never really upping the stakes by teaming with any of the big male stars on the MGM contract list, people like Tracy or Gable, Bob Taylor, Walter Pidgeon. But all that was still in the future when she made our next film, as a contract player at colo… Columbia Studios.|$|E
40|$|Dr. Richard Goode, a Baylor alumnus {{who has had}} a {{distinguished}} career as an economist at the International Monetary Fund, the Brookings Institution, the U. S. Treasury Department, the University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins and other places. We are at Dr. Goode’s home at 5420 Connecticut Avenue, N. W., in Washington, D. C. The date today is March 6, 1998, and the time is about 1 : 30 p. m. Dr. Goode, I {{want to thank you very}} <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> me today, or letting me join you here at your home today. This is an honor for me to meet with you and to have this time to talk. RICHARD B. GOODE: My pleasure. GARDNER: Well, I know that you were born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1916. Why don’t we begin by talking a little bit about your family background. What did your grandparents and your parents do in the Fort Worth area? 2 GOODE: Well, one of my grandfathers was a Baptist preacher. The other grandfather was an active Baptist layman. It so happens that my birthday and their birthdays were all on July thirty-first; an unusual coincidence. So I’m named after both of them: Richard and Benjamin. I don’t use the middle name much, but that’s my middle name. When I was born, my father was a small farmer. He had a varied career. Later, he was a carpenter and small contractor, and we always lived around in that area. My father was born in East Texas; my mother was born in Georgia. And that’s the family history. I was the only one of my immediate family—I had two older sisters—to attend college. Neither my parents nor my older sisters did. GARDNER: Your grandfather who was a preacher, was he a pastor of a church? GOODE: I think he was at various times, but not when I remember him. He was—well, he was essentially retired when I remembered him. My great-grandfather, by the way, was born in the eighteenth century. GARDNER: Is that right? GOODE: In 1786. GARDNER: Was that also in Texas...|$|E

Fest criticised Grass, not so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> having <b>joined,</b> but <b>for</b> having concealed the fact for so many years while engaging in political criticism of others over their Nazi pasts. He said: [...] "After 60 years, this confession comes a bit too late.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{most research}} into parallel databases has focussed on relational database systems. Nevertheless, {{there is growing}} interest in more powerful alternative systems such as deductive databases. Several rule handling strategies {{have been developed to}} incorporate deductive capabilities into parallel database systems. However, in a shared-nothing environment, the performance of a rule handling strategy depends largely on the effectiveness of the data placement strategy adopted in the system. Poorly distributed data can lead to higher loads and/or load imbalance and hence higher cost when executing a query. This paper describes a weightbased data placement strategy which provides improved performance for rule handling in a shared-nothing main memory database system. The main idea behind the data placement strategy is to exploit relation co-location as <b>much</b> as possible <b>for</b> <b>join</b> operations, while distributing evenly the relation fragments across the processors using their weights...|$|R
40|$|After {{speaking}} with several incoming honors college freshman, I realized {{that these students}} were not sure why they were joining the honors college. As I reflected on my life a couple years ago, I quickly decided that I also had lacked <b>much</b> reasoning <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> the honors college. As a high school honors student, it seemed the logical next step in my educational career. In addition, I remember being told the two main perks that every honors college knows: extended library rental periods and priority scheduling. However, because I had completed {{a lot of time}} in the honors college, I had come to appreciate all of the other amazing features that the honors college offers its students. I decided to create a brochure that could be distributed to high school seniors when they come to visit. To collect input, I sent out a survey to honors juniors and seniors, which asked several questions about their experience in the honors college. After receiving the responses, I analyzed the data to look for the most common answers. Honestly, I was surprised with the variety of answers that I obtained, some of which I had never considered. After several sessions of examining all of the data, I was able to create my final project, the brochure. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{experience}} with clinical hepatocyte transplantation {{during the past}} decade has provided proof of concept that cell therapy can be effective for the treatment of some liver diseases. Recent progress in cell biology resulting in the isolation and characterization of hepatic stem cells and progenitor cells further increased the expectation for a new approach to the treatment of genetic and chronic liver disease. Several potential sources have been identified of hepatic stem/ progenitor cells exhibiting both differentiation towards the hepatic lineage in vitro and hepatic parenchymal repopulation with liver-specific metabolic activity in liver-injured animal models. However, a few of these results proved to be poorly reproducible in different laboratories, and it was recognized that some initial optimistic conclusions were drawn from incorrect interpretation of experimental data or from insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms involved in tissue regeneration. Moreover, only modest results have emerged so far from ongoing clinical experience involving the use of putative stem cells in liver disease. There is <b>much</b> need <b>for</b> a <b>joined</b> effort to concentrate the resources on a specific cell population, in order to better characterize its function, to assess its safety and to develop better focused clinical trials. In conclusion, while the biological features of stem cells still justify the hope for future clinical applications, hepatic stem cell therapy has still {{a long way to go}} from bench to bedside...|$|R
