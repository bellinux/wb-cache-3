500|$|Hull {{expressed}} {{a strong desire}} to retain Campbell's services for the 2008–09 season, with Hull chairman, Paul Duffen, describing Campbell as [...] "too good for the Championship". Following his successes leading to their promotion, Hull were hoping to secure either a permanent move or another season-long loan, depending on Manchester United's willingness to let him go. However, Campbell repeatedly expressed the desire to return to Old Trafford and try to break into the first team, saying [...] "Now I'm back at United, the plan is to try to force <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the first team." [...] He added, [...] "I'm going to continue to work hard and try to do enough to stay here and go on from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Palast {{was born}} in Los Angeles, {{growing up in the}} San Fernando Valley {{community}} of Sun Valley. He attended John H. Francis Polytechnic High School, and transferred to San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge) in 1969 before completing his senior year of high school. Palast said about high school: [...] "Basically they were melting my brain, and I had to save myself. Before I finished high school, I talked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> college. Before I finished college, I talked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> graduate school." [...] Palast then attended the University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, Berkeley, and University of Chicago, from which he graduated in 1974 with an Bachelor of Arts in economics and in 1976 with a Master's of Business Administration. Palast majored in economics at Chicago from the advice of a Weather Underground member he met at Berkeley who suggested Palast [...] "familiarize himself with right-wing politics and learn about the 'ruling elite' from 'the inside.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{said that}} he [...] "was in a rather unique position" [...] in the {{disinformation}} campaign: [...] "judging by {{the positions of the}} people I knew to be directly involved in it, [...] definitely {{had something to do with}} national security. There was no way I was going to allow the opportunity to pass me by ... I would play the disinformation game, get my hands dirty just often enough to lead those directing the process into believing I was doing what they wanted me to do, and all the while continuing to burrow <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the matrix so as to learn as much as possible about who was directing it and why."(ibid., 164) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a Confederate officer, madam. I {{have made}} my escape from Elmira prison, and I {{am trying to}} find <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> our lines." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{opened his}} {{door with a}} low bow, and left me at liberty to find <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the garden. I met Mr. Blake {{returning}} to the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{was in a}} {{delicate}} state of health at the time, and my nerves could not stand it. I said good-bye to the town, and making <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> the country, {{put up with a}} county family.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{initially}} stated by police that Menezes was shot {{five times in}} the head. Mark Whitby, a passenger on the train Menezes had run onto, said: 'one of [...] was carrying a black handgun—it looked like an automatic—He half tripped… they pushed him to the floor, bundled {{on top of him}} and unloaded five shots into him.' Another passenger, Dan Copeland, said: 'an officer jumped on the door to my left and screamed, [...] "Everybody out!" [...] People just froze in their seats cowering for a few seconds and then leapt up. As I turned out the door on to the platform, I heard four dull bangs.' Menezes's cousin Alex Pereira, who lived with him, asserted that Menezes had been shot from behind: 'I pushed <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the morgue. [...] They wouldn't let me see him. His mouth was twisted by the wounds and it looked like he had been shot {{from the back of the}} neck.' Later reports confirmed that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot a total of eight times: seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|Seeing further {{potential}} in the idea, Horn teamed Jeczalik and Langan with Dudley in February to develop the project and brought {{in one of his}} business partners, ex-NME journalist Paul Morley, as a provider of concepts, art direction and marketing ideas. Morley came up with the project name (taken from the essay [...] "The Art of Noises" [...] by noted futurist Luigi Russolo, and finalised at Jeczalik's request by dropping the final 's'). Much later, in a July 2002 article penned for The Guardian, Morley wrote [...] "I loved the name Art of Noise so much that I forced <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the group. If over the years people asked me what I did in the group, I replied that I named them, and it was such a great name, that was enough to justify my role. I was the Ringo Starr of Art of Noise. I made the tea. Oh, and I wrote the lyrics to one of the loveliest pieces of pop music ever, Moments in Love." [...] Horn himself joined the new group as production advisor and provider of further ideas. This {{was the first time that}} he had been part of a group since parting company with his The Buggles' partner Geoff Downes (after they had been part of Yes). It would also be the first and last time that he would enjoy chart success as an artist since the new wave hit in 1979 with [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star".|$|E
60|$|On <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> {{the town}} I came across him again. A small crowd was collected, thoughtfully {{watching}} a tramp knocking about a miserable-looking woman.|$|E
6000|$|Right in we went, with soul intent [...] On Death and Dread and Doom: [...] The hangman, {{with his}} little bag, [...] Went {{shuffling}} through the gloom: [...] And I trembled as I groped <b>my</b> <b>way</b> [...] <b>Into</b> <b>my</b> numbered tomb.|$|R
60|$|And I edged for {{the door}} and slipped from the room. I felt weak. The old bean will stand a certain amount, but this was too much. I groped <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out <b>into</b> the street and wailed for a taxi.|$|R
60|$|I only {{waited to}} put the matches near the candle before I {{extinguished}} it, and groped <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> the sitting-room, I locked that door, as I had locked my bedroom door--then quietly {{got out of the}} window, and cautiously set my feet on the leaden roof of the verandah.|$|R
60|$|Opening {{the door}} with my key, I groped <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the well-remembered parlor; and, unbarring the window-shutters, I let {{in the light of}} the moon.|$|E
6000|$|... "I seem to {{have found}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Mr. Brooks' headquarters," [...] she remarked. [...] "Lady Caroom, I shall {{hope to see you}} at the palace shortly." ...|$|E
60|$|A signal cry, sharp to the right, turned me. I answered, {{and with}} the {{exchange}} of signal cries found <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> an open glade where Jones and Jim awaited me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} open the door. Some stones had fallen against it, and fearing to get punished, I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> the council room. It was empty when I reached it. They {{were searching for}} me in the other rooms, and I never told them of my adventure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Ethiopia or Egypt; it's {{all pretty}} much the same--this girl has been wonderfully edicated, Miles, and will turn out famous company for me, in the long winter evenings, some twenty years hence, or when I've worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> up <b>into</b> the {{latitude}} of the dear, good, old soul under the hill yonder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down <b>into</b> the {{waterway}} I felt sartin I would find Henry {{in some sort}} o' shape," [...] he concluded. [...] "But I couldn't find nuthin', not even his cap. His gun he dropped on the hill, an' here it is," [...] and {{he handed it to}} Dave.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} turned a sanguinary pirate for her, let alone {{cheating}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> a berth by dyeing my hair. So {{when you came to}} me with your chemist's wonderful stuff------" ...|$|E
60|$|So looked that parlor to me, when, tired {{with a long}} day's ride, I found <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> it, just at evening, and {{was greeted}} with a hearty welcome from my old friend, Colonel Winthrop.|$|E
60|$|I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> {{the house}} and entered the morning room as the cab drove off. Mr. Bundercombe and Eve were waltzing. Mr. Bundercombe paused at my {{entrance}} and wiped his forehead. He was very hot.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had written}} a note to ------, and {{received}} an answer, indicating that he was much weighed down by his financial misfortune. [...] . However, he desired me {{to come and see}} him; so yesterday morning I wended <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down <b>into</b> the city, and after various reluctant circumlocutions arrived at his house. The interior looked confused and dismal.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, {{the fact}} is,' he remarked, 'that when I recover from these attacks {{my mind is}} always very clouded as to all that has gone before. I woke up in a strange room, as it seemed to me, and made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out <b>into</b> the street {{in a sort of}} dazed way when you were absent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} much doubt about it, colonel," [...] Ralph said. [...] "I {{seem to see}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> quite clearly <b>into</b> Paris. Much more clearly, indeed, than I do to getting out again." ...|$|R
60|$|I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the {{reception}} room. I met no one, {{and the room}} was empty, although I heard on the floor above the sound of many footsteps, apparently those of the sisters preparing for departure.|$|E
60|$|Could {{it be that}} I was laboriously working <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> {{some new}} trap? Were the {{messages}} spurious, after all? And then, just as my hope and courage had ebbed to their lowest, I saw two things.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} done so this morning if I had had a chance," [...] Dominey replied. [...] "When the weather is a little drier, I am going to make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> that wood, Middleton, with a rifle under my arm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I came to myself, {{the army}} was embarking; so I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> through Galicia <b>into</b> Portugal and, on {{reaching}} Lisbon, was appointed by Sir John Craddock to his staff; and was sent by him {{on a mission to}} the northern frontier of Portugal.|$|R
60|$|He {{blinked at}} me for a moment from behind his thick spectacles, and I fancied {{that he was going to}} say {{something}} more. Apparently, however, he changed his mind, and the carriage drove off. I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> at once <b>into</b> the library. Mr. Stanley was still awaiting me.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a {{dark and}} rainy evening, and as the entrances to the catacombs were not guarded in those days, it was not {{difficult}} for me to make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> unseen <b>into</b> their interior. I had brought with me a tinder-box and several rushlights, and as soon as I felt secure from observation from the outside I struck a light and began my operations. Then, according to a plan I had previously made, I slowly walked along the solemn passageway which I had entered.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would make}} a mistake," [...] he asserted. [...] "No one ever goes back--successfully. Do I not know--I who am twenty years your senior, I who have felt <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> all the corners and crevices of life? Listen to me, please." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{might have}} been {{offended}} with another man. Not with him. I was far too anxious to find <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> his confidence--now that he had touched of his own accord {{on the subject of}} Eustace's first wife--to be offended with Miserrimus Dexter.|$|E
60|$|I ground {{my teeth}} at the sudden thought, {{and for a}} moment I was on the point of going back and forcing <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the château at the sword point if necessary, to warn and save the Chevalier in spite of himself and unthanked.|$|E
6000|$|... "I steamed {{into one}} of those silly {{thunderstorms}} that hang about the volcano, and had some trouble in making the island," [...] narrated Davidson. [...] "I had to grope <b>my</b> <b>way</b> dead slow <b>into</b> Diamond Bay. I don't suppose that anybody, even if looking out for me, could have heard me let go the anchor." ...|$|R
60|$|When I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out <b>into</b> the hall, {{with all}} the nonchalance {{in my face and}} manner that I could assume, the very first thing that I saw was Bouvet's dead body, with his legs drawn up and a broken sword in his hand. I could see by the black smudge that he had been shot at close quarters. I should have wished to salute as I went by, for he was a gallant man, but I feared lest I should be seen, and so I passed on.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the talent}} {{he had shown}} during his innings against Somerset, he found the next few seasons difficult. In an {{interview}} with All Out Cricket magazine, he said [...] "I’d {{had a bit of}} first team cricket, and was dropped and managed to work <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> the team {{in the second half of}} the year but just couldn’t get it right." [...] For four seasons, between 1997 and 2000, Walker consistently averaged in the mid-twenties, scoring just one century in the process. Since then, he has scored over one thousand runs in a season on three occasions.|$|R
