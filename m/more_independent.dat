Mary Jane has an abusive father, and aspires {{to become an}} actress, but becomes a {{waitress}} at a run down diner, a fact she hides from her boyfriend, Harry. Before Raimi cast Dunst, he had expressed his interest in casting Alicia Witt. Dunst decided to audition after learning Maguire had been cast, feeling the film would have a <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> feel. Dunst earned the role a month before shooting in an audition in Berlin.|$|E

Her personality has been changed into a stronger, <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> role, being a natural-born leader and the backbone of the team. Her romantic feelings towards Sonic are kept intact, with a notable change being that she actively keeps her crush on him a secret, even from Sonic himself.|$|E

Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and require {{more time to}} start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{originality}} and longevity, Winnie Winkle {{became a}} household name and an icon, inspiring even Pop Art artist Roy Lichtenstein. Winnie Winkle was reprinted in Dell Comics, {{and for a time}} her face appeared on a cigar box lid. In retrospect, Winnie Winkle is seen as one of the comic strips heralding a new, <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> role for American women after World War I.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Karl was a late-season {{and unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that formed during the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season. A minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, Karl {{developed at the}} center of another, larger extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic. After being classified a subtropical cyclone on November 25, it became <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> of its parent storm and grew into a full-fledged hurricane. It peaked in intensity on November 26, and ultimately dissipated as it merged with another system.|$|E

Sudden deaths of powerful independent directors significantly reduce shareholder value, consistent with independent director power “causing ” higher shareholder value.

5|$|Much of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E
5|$|On 11th May, William and Mary {{formally}} {{accepted the}} Scottish throne and on 5th June, the Convention was {{converted into a}} full Parliament. William tried to avoid abolishing Episcopacy but Dundee's 1689 Highland campaign on behalf of James highlighted his reliance on Presbyterian support. He withdrew his opposition and the measures were approved by Parliament in 1690. The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in a Parliament and Kirk far <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> than before but ending Episcopacy isolated {{a significant part of}} the political class. This was a major factor in political debates over the 1707 Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1972, Holt's {{government}} was voted {{out as the}} Labor Party took the majority in Canberra. The new prime minister was Gough Whitlam and new postmaster-general was Doug McClelland. In early 1973, {{in an effort to}} foster a <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> organisation, Madgwick asked Whitlam if the ABC's employees could be removed from the Public Service Board, which administered the Commonwealth government employment system. Although Whitlam had supported the idea in the past, he now opposed it as prime minister and did not act on Madgwick's request.|$|E

5|$|World WarII led to {{significant}} changes to Australian society. Economically, the war accelerated {{the development of}} Australia's manufacturing industry {{and led to a}} large fall in unemployment. The impact of World WarII changed Australian society, and contributed {{to the development of a}} more cosmopolitan society in which women were able to play a larger role. The war also resulted in a greater maturity in Australia's approach to international affairs, as demonstrated by the development of a <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> foreign policy and the encouragement of mass immigration after the war.|$|E
5|$|After Joseph Stalin's death, {{the process}} of destalinization {{prompted}} debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc. Nikita Khrushchev's speech On the Personality Cult and its Consequences had wide implications outside the Soviet Union and in other communist countries. In Poland, {{in addition to the}} criticism of the cult of personality, popular topics of debate centered on the right to steer a <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> course of 'local, national socialism' instead of following the Soviet model down to every little detail; such views were seen in discussion and critique by many Polish United Workers' Party members of Stalin's execution of older Polish communists from Communist Party of Poland during the Great Purge.|$|E
5|$|Another legacy was {{the manner}} in which it led to the emergence—albeit only fleetingly—of an {{independence}} in Australian foreign affairs. Although previously Australian foreign interests had been largely handled by Britain, as a combatant Australia sent its own delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, while it also began to take a more assertive role in regional affairs in the Pacific. At the peace conference Prime Minister Hughes pushed aggressively for reparations and an Australian mandate over German New Guinea; a stance which conflicted with the liberal internationalist inspired Fourteen Points put forward by American President Woodrow Wilson. Regardless, following the war there was little real change in Imperial relations and Dominion affairs, and as a result the war arguably did not lead to any significant change in Australia's perception of its role in the world. Indeed, profound change would only occur following the Japanese crisis of 1942, which ultimately saw Australia pursue a foreign policy <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> of Britain, and an alliance with the United States.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Hitler's release from prison, {{politics}} in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation. As {{a result of the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, the NSDAP and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting {{paved the way for the}} ban on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February. However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927. To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser and Joseph Goebbels to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle {{at the same rate}} as before until their sixth month, after which they become <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.|$|E
5|$|Howard volunteered {{with the}} Richmond Minor Hockey Association for over 12 years, and was active with Tourism Richmond, the Richmond Chamber of Commerce, and the Real Estate Institute of BC. While {{his mother had}} served as an Alderwoman on the Richmond City Council, Howard's {{political}} career began with a civic bylaw election in October 2001. Howard, belonging to the civic political party Richmond Non-Partisan Association, was elected {{to one of the}} three available seats on the Richmond City Council. After less than a year on council, Howard left the Richmond Non-Partisan Association to join a new pro-business political party, Richmond First, which he saw as being less controlling and allowing him to make <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> decisions. He was re-elected in the November 2002 civic election, with his Richmond First party taking four of the eight council seats.|$|E

5|$|Royal {{power in}} Wales was {{unevenly}} applied, {{with the country}} divided between the marcher lords along the borders, royal territories in Pembrokeshire and the <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> native Welsh lords of North Wales. John took a close interest in Wales and knew the country well, visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter, Joan, to the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great. The king used the marcher lords and the native Welsh to increase his own territory and power, striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with the Welsh rulers. A major royal expedition to enforce these agreements occurred in 1211, after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose, through the Welsh uprising of 1211. John's invasion, striking into the Welsh heartlands, was a military success. Llywelyn came to terms that included an expansion of John's power across much of Wales, albeit only temporarily.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{senators}} were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound {{together by a}} strong sense of collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most senior members were ex-Consuls, which facilitated the creation of a bond between the presiding Consul and those senior members. In addition, the Consul was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow senators. When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, and so he was unlikely to stand against his fellow senators. Before the enactment of the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new senators, but after the enactment of this law, Censors appointed new senators, which caused the senate to become even <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> of the presiding Consul. In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate became quite objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E
5|$|The 1938 Anschluss—the {{annexation}} of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime—led to the Nazification of Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Boosey & Hawkes {{seized the opportunity}} to sign up composers Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, and also rescued Universal's Jewish staff, who later {{played an important role in}} developing the company. One such employee in particular, Ernst Roth, facilitated the signing of Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky, and was instrumental in the production of Strauss's Vier letzte Lieder (Four Last Songs) (1948; premièred 1950) and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress (premièred 1951). Another significant figure from Vienna who occupied an editorial role was composer Arnold Schoenberg's pupil Erwin Stein, and after the war the composer Leopold Spinner, a pupil of Anton Webern, was also on the editorial staff. Stein was instrumental in founding the modern-music journal Tempo in 1939, which began as Boosey & Hawkes' own newsletter but later became a <b>more</b> <b>independent</b> publication.|$|E
