40|$|Modern {{beekeeping}} {{does not}} accept swarm from the branch {{as a part of}} technological process. <b>Modern</b> <b>beekeeper</b> produces an artifical swarm, a bee nuclei, when it is the most suitable period for him, in terms of pasture and climate conditions. Organizing production of the selected fertilized queen-bees allow beekeepers not to spend valuable time in the season for the production of queen-bees, because it is possible to get supply on the market. Comparison of two of the most common production methods have been described: inserting fertilized selected queen-bee into the nuclei consisting of three frames with covered brood and two frames with honey (Group A) and inserting fertilized selected queen-bee into the package-swarm (Group B). The research showed that nuclei from the Group A were stronger, and succeeded to create, until the period of hibernation, about 17 frames weighing 35 kg in LR beehive. The nuclei from the Group B were formed at strength of about 11 frames weighing 23 kg in LR beehive type...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to assess the}} process of beekeeping development and diffusion of improved beekeeping management and evaluate the impact of improved beekeeping on household income, per capita income, changes in capacity development and social issues such as educational expenditure, health improvement, and human capita. The study {{was based on a}} representative sample of 200 farm households (99 <b>modern</b> <b>beekeepers</b> and 101 traditional beekeepers) selected using random sampling. To analyze the process of beekeeping development and diffusion of improved beekeeping management and to evaluate the impact of improved beekeeping on household descriptive statistics and matching estimation methods were used respectively. Estimated result of the Heckman regression model indicates there is no selection bias. The descriptive analysis explain due to a number of beekeeping development interventions (i. e. supply of beekeeping materials, training) most <b>modern</b> <b>beekeepers</b> had progressive improvement on the utilization methods and honey handling techniques (i. e. skill improvement) together with their accessories, have been distributed to farmers. The propensity score matching result also indicates that the mean income of <b>modern</b> <b>beekeepers</b> is significantly higher than that of traditional beekeepers. The estimated results for the matching methods showed that the average income gain due to improved beekeeping ranges from 2679 to 2888 Birr per household per annum. The overall average total educational expenditures gain due to improved beekeeping ranged between 79. 75 and 90. 74 Birr and was significant at 1 % level based on the kernel, nearest neighbor, stratified and radius, matching methods. The overall average human capital gain due to improved beekeeping ranged between 82. 35 and 98. 45 Birr and was significant at 5 % level based on the kernel, stratified, radius and nearest neighbor, matching methods. Average per capita income gain due to improved beekeeping ranged between 428. 4 and 493. 5 Birr and was significant at 1 % level based on the stratified, radius, kernel and nearest neighbor matching methods. The results certainly imply that the <b>modern</b> <b>beekeepers</b> had better living status than the traditional beekeepers in the woreda. It is suggested to focus on modern beekeeping development technologies and provision of relevant training as well as technical assistances need to up grade for the improvements in beekeeping production.

5000|$|<b>Modern</b> <b>beekeepers</b> have {{experimented with}} raising bees indoors, in a {{controlled}} environment or in indoor observation hives. This may be done for reasons of space and monitoring, or in the off-season. In the off-season, large commercial beekeepers may move colonies to [...] "wintering" [...] warehouses, with fixed temperature, light and humidity. This helps the bees remain healthy, but relatively dormant. Wintered bees survive on stored honey, and new bees are not born.|$|R
50|$|Beekeepers feed bees {{when there}} is a {{shortage}} of those resources in nature, or when beekeepers want to mimic an abundance of those resources to encourage bees to behave in a certain manner. <b>Modern</b> <b>beekeepers</b> feed sugar syrup as a honey substitute in early spring to encourage comb building, during a dearth to provide energy to large colonies, in the autumn to help bees prepare for overwintering, or when creating nucleus hives. Pollen substitute is commonly fed to bees in early spring or when bees are located in a region with poor pollen resources.|$|R
50|$|Most beekeepers produce {{commodities}} (farm products) for sale. Honey is {{the most}} valuable commodity sold by beekeepers. Honey-producer beekeepers try to maintain maximum-strength colonies of bees in areas with dense nectar sources. They produce and sell liquid and sometimes comb honey. Beekeepers may sell their commodities retail, as self-brokers, or through commercial packers and distributors. Beeswax, pollen, royal jelly, and propolis may also be significant revenue generators. Taiwanese beekeepers, for example, export tonnes of royal jelly, the high-nutrition food supplement fed to queen honeybees. <b>Modern</b> <b>beekeepers</b> seldom keep honeybees exclusively for beeswax production. Beeswax is harvested along with honey and separated for sale.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} the Stone Age, people {{collected}} the honey of wild bees, {{but this was not}} done commercially. From the Early Middle Ages it became a trade, known in German-speaking central Europe, for example, as a Zeidler or Zeitler, whose job it was to collect the honey of wild, semi-wild or domestic bees in the forests. Unlike <b>modern</b> <b>beekeepers,</b> they did not keep the bees in man-made wooden beehives. Instead, they cut holes as hives in old trees at a height of about six meters and fitted a board over the entrance. Whether a colony of bees nested there or not depended entirely on the natural environment and that could change every year. The tree tops were also cut off in order to prevent wind damage.|$|R
25|$|Two {{species of}} honey bee, A. mellifera and A. cerana indica, are often maintained, fed, and {{transport}}ed by <b>beekeepers.</b> <b>Modern</b> hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as the crop needs pollinating {{and allowing the}} beekeeper to charge for the pollination services they provide, revising the historical role of the self-employed beekeeper, and favoring large-scale commercial operations.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} honey stored within the central brood frames, the bees store surplus honey in combs above the brood nest. In <b>modern</b> hives the <b>beekeeper</b> places {{separate}} boxes, called [...] "supers", above the brood box, {{in which a}} series of shallower combs is provided for storage of honey. This enables the beekeeper to {{remove some of the}} supers in the late summer, and to extract the surplus honey harvest, without damaging the colony of bees and its brood nest below. If all the honey is [...] "stolen", including the amount of honey needed to survive winter, the beekeeper must replace these stores by feeding the bees sugar or corn syrup in autumn.|$|R
60|$|Again {{referring}} to the 'Encyclopaedia,' we find the words: 'Before undertaking the management of a <b>modern</b> apiary, the <b>beekeeper</b> should possess {{a certain amount of}} aptitude for the pursuit.' This was possibly the trouble with Elizabeth's venture, considered from a commercial point of view. She loved bees, but she was not an expert on them. She had started her apiary with a small capital, a book of practical hints, and a second-hand queen, principally because she was in need of some occupation that would enable her to live in the country. It was the unfortunate condition of Claude Nutcombe which made life in the country a necessity. At that time he was spending the remains of the money left him by his aunt, and Elizabeth had hardly settled down at Brookport and got her venture under way when she found herself obliged to provide for Nutty a combination of home and sanatorium. It had been the poor lad's mistaken view that he could drink up all the alcoholic liquor in America.|$|R
