5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, {{but he was so}} overwhelmed by the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of <b>making</b> <b>one</b> himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E

As {{of the end}} of December 2008, the game had sold nearly 75,000 units.

5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, <b>making</b> <b>one</b> of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September, the University of Leicester team {{announced}} that the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution. The positive indicators were that the body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; it had severe scoliosis of the spine possibly <b>making</b> <b>one</b> shoulder higher than the other.

In 1945 he joined a picket line against Warner Bros.

5|$|Born in Albury, New South Wales, Meredith {{was spotted}} playing {{football}} in Melbourne {{at the age}} of 16 by a Derby County scout. He was offered a trial by the club and he joined their youth system on a two-year contract in 2004. He progressed through the youth team and he signed a two-year professional contract with Derby on 19 July 2006. He joined Conference National club Cambridge United on a one-month loan on 19 October 2006 and he made his debut in a 3–0 defeat to Oxford United. He finished the loan with two appearances. He had a trial with Conference National club York City in January 2007, playing in a reserve-team match against Rotherham United. He joined League One team Chesterfield on a one-month loan on 19 February 2007, <b>making</b> <b>one</b> appearance as a left midfielder in a 2–0 defeat to Tranmere Rovers on 2 March.

5|$|In August 2009, Mendes joined Liga de Honra club Trofense on {{a one-year}} contract. He made his league debut on 19 September 2009 in a 3–0 defeat at Feirense. He made eight more league appearances, before being {{released}} from his contract in January 2010. He {{then returned to the}} Segunda Divisão with Gondomar and he made his debut on 31 January 2010 in a 2–0 win against Vieira. His first goal for the club came one week later in a 4–4 draw with Espinho. Mendes scored his second goal in a 2–1 win against Padroense. He made 12 league appearances in the 2009–10 season, scoring twice, as they finished 4th in the table.

5|$|In September 1989, Ferguson signed left-winger Danny Wallace from Southampton. Wallace {{was not a}} {{particularly}} successful buy for United, and was soon himself struggling to hold down {{a place in the}} first team, but the progression of Lee Sharpe meant that Milne was forced out of the first team picture at Old Trafford in 1989–90, <b>making</b> <b>one</b> substitute appearance in the league. During that season, as United struggled in the league but won the FA Cup, Milne was loaned out to Lou Macari's West Ham United, where he made the final appearance of his career in a League Cup tie on 24 January 1990 away to Derby County at the age of 28. His season was ended shortly afterwards after he picked up groin injury that required surgery. Despite being given a new one-year contract he began missing reserve team games during the 1990–91 season and instead spent his time drinking.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, Michigan {{defeated}} Michigan State (#9 AP/#10 Coaches) in the Ann Arbor rematch {{of their}} rivalry series as Trey Burke made 2 steals {{in the final}} 30 seconds to secure the 58–57 victory.

Michigan concluded its road schedule with a 5–5 record.|$|E

5|$|Stories {{were told}} of Boone <b>making</b> <b>one</b> last visit to Kentucky {{to pay off}} his creditors, {{although}} {{some or all of}} these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the woods of Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he never returned to Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{returned}} to Norway in mid-1942, but was badly damaged {{when she ran}} aground in July and did not return until April 1943. Hans Lody participated in the German attack (Operation Zitronella) on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle and then spent {{the next six months}} on convoy duties in southern Norway. The ship began a lengthy refit in April 1944 and was not operational for the next year. She spent April 1945 escorting convoys in Danish waters before <b>making</b> <b>one</b> voyage to rescue refugees in East Prussia in May. Hans Lody was assigned to the Royal Navy after the war and used as a training ship and then a barracks ship before being broken up for scrap in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Though Hunt was {{considered}} for the 2004 State of Origin series among other fullbacks, he was ignored for the entire series in favour of Penrith Panthers fullback Rhys Wesser. Hunt's good form in 2006 paid off when he was selected {{to play for the}} Australian team against New Zealand on 5 May as a replacement for the injured Anthony Minichiello. This decision proved controversial, due to his being preferred over the in-form Matt Bowen. That game was Hunt's representative and international debut, and though he performed well, he only played for 50 minutes, <b>making</b> <b>one</b> error and 83 metres in kick returns. However, he was unable to complete the game due to concussion sustained by a blow from Frank Pritchard. He was taken unconscious from the field and played no further part in the match.|$|E
