40|$|We {{report a}} {{detailed}} single crystal and powder neutron diffraction study of Co 2 TiO 4 and Co 2 SnO 4 between the temperature 1. 6 and 80 K {{to probe the}} spin structure in the ground state. For both compounds the strongest magnetic intensity was observed for the 111 <b>M</b> <b>reflection</b> due to ferrimagnetic ordering, which sets in below TN 48. 6 and 41 K for Co 2 TiO 4 and Co 2 SnO 4, respectively. An additional low intensity magnetic reflection 200 M was noticed in Co 2 TiO 4 due {{to the presence of}} an additional weak antiferromagnetic component. Interestingly, from both the powder and single crystal neutron data of Co 2 TiO 4, we noticed a significant broadening of the magnetic 111 <b>M</b> <b>reflection,</b> which possibly results from the disordered character of the Ti and Co atoms on the B site. Practically, the same peak broadening was found for the neutron powder data of Co 2 SnO 4. On the other hand, from our single crystal neutron diffraction data of Co 2 TiO 4, we found a spontaneous increase of particular nuclear Bragg reflections below the magnetic ordering temperature. Our data analysis showed that this unusual effect can be ascribed to the presence of anisotropic extinction, which is associated to a change of the mosaicity of the crystal. In this case, it can be expected that competing Jahn Teller effects acting along different crystallographic axes can induce anisotropic local strain. In fact, for both ions Ti 3 and Co 3, the 2 tg levels split into a lower dxy level yielding a higher twofold degenerate dxz dyz level. As a consequence, one can expect a tetragonal distortion in Co 2 TiO 4 with c a lt; 1, which we could not significantly detect in the present wor...|$|E

To date, approximately 1. 9 km of P-wave data and 0. 9 km of SH-wave data have been collected. Two perpen-dicular six-fold P-wave reflection surveys have been per-formed obliquely to the axis of the KBFS to image the style and azimuth of structure associated with the deeper Creta-ceous (427 m) and Paleozoic (533 <b>m)</b> <b>reflection</b> horizons. The P-wave data also served as reconnaissance forsiting the target areas imaged by the near-surface SH-wave technique. A high-angle reverse fault has been successfully imaged 540 m in front (northeast) of the present scarp topography using P- and SH-wave techniques, indicating a broad zone of near-surface deformation. The fault, along with north-dip-ping reflectors, has been traced {{from the top of}} the Paleozoic bedrock into the water-saturated, unconsolidated sand and gravel of the Quaternary alluvium. It is interpreted to be a northeast-vergent fault, striking approximately N 30 ~ This interpretation is consistent with the surface xpression of the scarp and the nature of the contemporary seismicity.

40|$|Reflectarray antennas combine some of {{the best}} {{features}} between parabolic reflector and phased array antennas, but their application in satellite and terrestrial systems is limited due to high reflection loss performance and limited phase ranges. In this paper an X-band reflectarray patch element constructed on 1 mm thick anisotropic liquid crystal substrate is proposed to be employed as a dynamic phase control strategy for terrestrial systems. Reflection loss and tunability characteristics of dipole and rectangular patch elements, printed on different anisotropic liquid crystal substrates have been investigated by using CST computer model. A detailed analysis of static and dynamic phase ranges with respect to dielectric anisotropy is presented for different anisotropic liquid crystal substrate materials. The preliminary simu lated results demonstrate that dipole patch element contributes highest reflection loss performance of 33. 51 d B compared to rectangular patch element which offers maximu <b>m</b> <b>reflection</b> loss of 10. 74 dB, by using K- 15 nematic liquid crystal as dielectric substrate.

The time courses of changes in both the M 3 and <b>M</b> 6 myosin-based <b>reflections</b> were recorded with 5 ms frames using the gas-filled RAPID detector (MicroGap Technology). Following the end of the latent period (11 ms after the start of stimulation), force increases to the tetanus plateau value (T 0) with a half-time of 40 ms, and the spacings of the M 3 and <b>M</b> 6 <b>reflections</b> (SM 3 and SM 6) increase by 1. 5 % from their resting values, with time courses that lead that of force by ∼ 10 and ∼ 20 ms, respectively. These temporal relations are maintained when the increase of force is delayed by ∼ 10 ms by imposing, from 5 ms after the first stimulus, 50 nm (half-sarcomere) − 1 shortening at the velocity (V 0) that maintains zero force. Shortening at V 0 transiently reduces SM 3 following the latent period and delays the subsequent increase in SM 3, but only delays the SM 6 increase without a transient decrease. Shortening at V 0 imposed at the tetanus plateau causes an abrupt reduction of the intensity of the <b>M</b> 3 <b>reflection</b> (IM 3), whereas the intensity of the <b>M</b> 6 <b>reflection</b> (IM 6) is only slightly reduced. The changes in half-sarcomere stiffness indicate that the isometric force at each time point is proportional to the number of myosin heads bound to actin. The different sensitivities of the intensity and spacing of the M 3 and <b>M</b> 6 <b>reflections</b> to the mechanical responses support the view that the <b>M</b> 3 <b>reflection</b> in active muscle originates mainly from the myosin heads attached to the actin filament and the <b>M</b> 6 <b>reflection</b> originates mainly from a fixed structure in the myosin filament signalling myosin filament length changes during the tetanus rise...|$|R

After contributions from the Sun, Moon, and local atmosphere were removed, the resulting spectrum was fitted with a simple model of the reflectivity of Earth. The best model fit is dominated by the reflection spectrum of the atmosphere above medium-altitude water clouds, with lesser contributions from high-altitude ice clouds and from the ground. The spectral features seen are H 2 O (six strong band structures from 0. 7 to 2. 0 !m), CO 2 (six moderate-strength features from 1. 4 to 2. 1 !m), O 2 (two moderate-strength features at 0. 76 and 1. 26 !m), and several weak CH 4 features. Interpreted as a spectrum of an extrasolar planet, we would confidently conclude that this is a habitable planet, based on the presence of strong water bands. Furthermore, the simultaneous presence of oxygen and methane is a strong indicator of biological activity. We might also conclude that the planet is geologically active, based on the presence of CO 2, water, and a dynamic atmosphere (inferred from cirrus clouds, cumulus clouds, and clear-air fractions in our model fit). This suggests that it would be valuable for the Terrestrial Planet Finder–Coronagraph (TPF-C) mission to include near-infrared spectroscopy capability. On the basis of the present work, we suggest that future long-term monitoring of the earthshine would allow us to discern how the globally integrated spectrum changes with planet rotation, cloud cover, and seasons.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 855 on 06. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) A {{large proportion of}} the U. K. highway network constructed in the 1960 's and 1970 's contains lean concrete roadbase with bituminous surfacing. Pavements containing relatively high strength lean concrete have rarely required structural maintenance (thick overlay or reconstruction) but have required maintenance because of reflection cracking where the surfacing cracks above cracks in the lean concrete. The time of appearance of this cracking is very variable (2 - 20 years). Field observations indicate that roadbase transverse crack spacings are often greater than 5 <b>m.</b> <b>Reflection</b> cracking at these long spacings can be caused by thermal stresses. This project identifies conditions under which thermal reflection cracking will occur and develops a predictive model that allows estimation of the combined effect of thermal and traffic stresses. Finite element analyses indicate that initial crack development is likely to be caused by thermal stresses and final cracking will be assisted by traffic stresses. A temperature model has been developed to determine roadbase daily temperature range and surfacing temperature on a mean monthly basis. Thermal reflection cracking is considered to result from daily cycle fatigue rather than an extreme low temperature mechanism. A test rig has been developed to apply cyclic crack opening movements and simulative tests have been accelerated to 0. 1 Hz by using a "bitumen stiffness", fatigue criterion. Finite element results, displacements recorded during tests and tensile creep tests to determine mix stiffness, enable dc/dN and K 1 values and material constants (A, n) to be determined. This fracture mechanics interpretation of test results serves as the basis of the predictive model for thermal reflection cracking that is consistent with observations from an untrafficked road. The combined estimate of thermal and traffic stresses cannot however explain reflection cracking at < 5 m spacings. This cracking apparently initiates at the surface and is probably influenced by other mechanisms. University of Birmingham, the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), U.

The first myosin-based layer line (ML 1) and the second myosin-based meridional <b>reflection</b> (<b>M</b> 2), which are both strong in resting muscle, were completely abolished at the plateau of the isometric tetanus. The third myosin-based meridional <b>reflection</b> (<b>M</b> 3), arising from the axial repeat of the myosin heads along the filaments, remained intense but its spacing changed from 14. 34 to 14. 56 nm. The intensity change of the <b>M</b> 3 <b>reflection,</b> IM 3, could be explained as the sum of two components, I 14. 34 and I 14. 56, arising from myosin head conformations characteristic of rest and isometric contraction, respectively. The amplitudes (A) of the X-ray reflections, which are proportional to the fraction of myosin heads in each conformation, changed with half-times that were {{similar to that of}} isometric force development, which was 33. 5 ± 2. 0 ms (mean ±s. d., 224 tetani from three fibres, 4 °C), measured {{from the end of the}} latent period.

The changes in the X-ray reflections during rapid shortening have two temporal components. The rapid decrease in intensity of the 14. 56 nm reflection at the start of shortening is likely to be due to tilting of myosin heads attached to actin.

In those studies, lexical processing of spoken stimuli became manifest as an enhanced ERP in response to unattended real words as opposed to phonologically matched but meaningless pseudoword stimuli. This lexical ERP enhancement was explained by automatic activation of word memory traces realised as distributed strongly intra-connected neuronal circuits, whose robustness guarantees memory trace activation {{even in the absence}} of attention on spoken input. Such an account would predict the automatic activation of these memory traces upon any presentation of linguistic information, irrespective of the presentation modality. As previous lexical MMN studies exclusively used auditory stimulation, we here adapted the lexical MMN paradigm to investigate early automatic lexical effects in the visual modality. In a visual oddball sequence, matched short word and pseudoword stimuli were presented tachistoscopically in perifoveal area outside the visual focus of attention, as the subjects' attention was concentrated on a concurrent non-linguistic visual dual task in the centre of the screen. Using EEG, we found a visual analogue of the lexical ERP enhancement effect, with unattended written words producing larger brain response amplitudes than matched pseudowords, starting at ~ 100 ms. Furthermore, we also found significant visual MMN, reported here for the first time for unattended lexical stimuli presented perifoveally.

40|$|The {{overview}} hereafter presented {{offers the}} development of the scholastic interpretations of the passage from Book VI of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics where the Greek philosopher sets an "imperfect identity" between prudentia and politics. From this study two interesting conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, a linear development can not be easily traced: the medieval authors have given different interpretations of the Aristotelian passage, thus trying to solve the problematic relationship between the individual's moral life and his political one. The two possible solutions are equally represented: both the conception which favours the existence of one single virtue responsible for both ambits, and the one which instead holds that the differences between private morality and politics are so relevant that different virtues for each of these ambits are necessary. This first result clearly demonstrates the lack of a communis opinio. There is an evident tension between the two poles variously interpreted by the different authors, anyway in opposition to the thesis of the divisibility of prudentia in species. Thus the second conclusion: the authors taken into consideration do not seem eager to renounce to the idea of the unity of practical reason, and have rather searched with great force for other ways of conceiving this unity. In order to gain a complete image of the problem a wider research would be needed, thus connecting the a. <b>m.</b> <b>reflections</b> to some considerations on the nature of prudentia as a virtue, and on the existing relations between bonum commune and individual good. A general result is however achieved: the medieval thinkers would not even take into consideration an individual prudentia disconnected from politics, nor a political prudentia disconnected from moral life...|$|R

This core 34 KL complements the heavily disturbed late Pliocene-Pleistocene core sections of DSDP Site 317, and is well suited for stratigraphic correlation. The sediments consist of calcareous microfossils (93 - 97 % CaCO 3), minor portions of siliceous microfossils and detrital minerals. All important calcareous microfossil zones could be identified and correlated with the magnetostratigraphic and isotope stratigraphic events, stages and periods. Due to {{the high degree of}} silica dissolution, the late Quaternary radiolarian Buccinosphaera invaginata Zone is the only siliceous fossil zone which could be identified. An interval with Globigerinoides gomitulus/pink was found within the middle Pleistocene which is clearly distinguished from the Globigerinoides ruber/pink interval of the late Pleistocene. The magnetostratigraphic Gauss-Matuyama and Matuyama-Brunhes boundaries as well as the Olduvai and Jaramillo events were clearly identified. The d 18 O curve displays the 100 kyr (Milankovitch) and the 41 kyr (Laplace) cyclicity periods.

During this isometric phase of relaxation the intensities of the equatorial and meridional <b>M</b> 3 X-ray <b>reflections</b> associated with the radial and axial distributions of myosin motors also recovered at a steady rate towards their resting values, consistent with progressive net detachment of myosin motors from actin filaments.

The interference fine structure of the <b>M</b> 3 <b>reflection</b> suggested that actin-attached myosin motors are displaced towards the start of their working stroke during isometric relaxation. There was negligible recovery of the intensities of the meridional and layer-line reflections associated with the quasi-helical distribution of myosin motors in resting muscle during isometric relaxation, and the 1. 5 % increase in the axial periodicity of the myosin filament associated with muscle activation was not reversed. When force had decreased to roughly half its tetanus plateau value, the isometric phase of relaxation abruptly ended, and the ensuing chaotic relaxation had an exponential half-time of ca 60 ms.

The <b>M</b> 3 X-ray <b>reflection</b> from the axial repeat of the heads along the filaments was 27 ± 4 % more intense at 17 °C, suggesting that the heads became more perpendicular to the filaments.

These peaks are due to interference between the two halves of each myosin filament, and the RM 3 decrease shows that heads move towards the midpoint of the myosin filament at the higher temperature. Calculations based on a crystallographic model of the heads indicated that the observed RM 3 change corresponds to tilting of their light-chain domains by 9 deg, producing an axial displacement of 1. 4 nm, which is equal to that required to strain the actin and myosin filaments under the increased force.

40|$|Apartheid {{ideology}} presents traditional historiography with {{a series}} of conundrums: the difficulty of separating historical from subjective agency; the paradoxical status of ideologues who both author ideology and are nonetheless also subject to the spread of its ideas; the issues of the non-material benefits that appear to drive its ideological system. Taking as its starting point J. <b>M.</b> Coetzee's <b>reflections</b> on these issues, this paper builds on his promising intuition of the notion of "fantasmatic rewards" as a crucial explanatory element in understanding the "mind of apartheid". Crucial in this respect are a number of Lacanian concepts (desire, the Other, fantasy, objet petit a, alienation and separation). Recourse to these notions enables us to provide a series of responses to the above dilemmas of apartheid ideology. Such concepts, moreover, arguably do greater conceptual justice to the inter-implication of the Other and the subject, that is, to the inter-implication of the trans-subjective socio-historical substance and unconscious subjectivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Starting from a {{microscope}} {{model of the}} intermolecular potential, a unified description is presented of the Bragg scattering law in the orientationally disordered and in the ordered phase of solid C- 60. The orientational structure factor is expanded in terms of symmetry-adapted surface harmonics. The expansion coefficients are calculated from theory and compared with experiment Their temperature evolution is studied in the disordered phase at the 260 K transitions and in the ordered phase. In the ordered phase, new results from high-resolution neutron powder diffraction are given. In the disordered phase, space group Fm $($) over bar$$ 3 <b>m,</b> the <b>reflections</b> have A(1 g) symmetry; in the ordered phase, space group Pa $$($) over bar 3, reflections of T- 2 g symmetry appear and in addition the A(1 g) reflections are renormalized. The orientational density distribution is calculated. The effective crystal-field potential is constructed, its temperature evolution in the ordered phase is studied and related to the occurrence of an orientational glass...|$|R
40|$|High {{evaporation}} {{rates in}} the desert climate of the Red Sea ensure that, during glacial sea level lowstands when water exchange with the Indian Ocean was more restricted, water salinity and ? 18 O? 18 O became unusually extreme. Modeling of the effect on Red Sea sedimentary ? 18 O? 18 O has been used previously to reconstruct relative sea level to 500 ka and now poses {{the question of whether}} that sea-level model could be extended if continuous core material of older sediment became available. We attempt to address this question here by examining seismic reflection data. The upper Pleistocene hemipelagic sediments in the Red Sea contain intervals of inorganic aragonite precipitated during supersaturated conditions of sea-level lowstands. Seismic impedance changes associated with boundaries to those aragonite-rich layers appear to explain seismic reflection sequences. A segment of Chirp sediment profiler data from the central Red Sea reveals prominent reflections at ? 1, ? 5, ? 23, ? 26 and ? 36 ms two-way travel time (TWT) from the seabed. Based on depths to the glacial marine isotope stages (MIS) in cores, we relate the upper three reflections to the tops of aragonite-rich layers and hence the sea level rises immediately following MIS 2, 6 and 12. The <b>reflection</b> at 26 <b>ms</b> is related to an unusually rapid fall into MIS 12 predicted by one sea level reconstruction, which may have created an abrupt lower boundary to the MIS 12 aragonite-rich layer. With the aid of seismogram modeling, we tentatively associate the ? 36 <b>ms</b> <b>reflection</b> with the top of an aragonite-rich layer formed during MIS 16. Furthermore, some segments of lower frequency (airgun and sparker) seismic data from the central and southern Red Sea show a lower (earlier) Plio-Pleistocene (PP) interval that is less reflective than the upper (late) PP interval. This implies less variability in sediment impedance and that extreme variability in water salinity did not develop; water exchange with the Indian Ocean likely continued throughout this interval. These results suggest that viable relative sea level reconstructions may be recovered from Red Sea sediment ? 18 O? 18 O data to at least MIS 16 and perhaps even {{as far back as the}} early Pliocene...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{with regard}} to the perception of abstract and social stimuli: (1) What constitutes a visual pattern? (2) Whether people possess a proclivity towards one particular pattern type. (3) When is patterning imposed or detected by the visual system? The abstract stimuli consisted of checkerboard patterns and the social stimuli consisted of faces or social groups. Initially the term "pattern" was defined as an image that contains redundant information. This was illustrated by a bias when defining patterns by members of the public towards images that contain both repeated and reflective symmetry, or a low number of possible variants and therefore reduced information content, i. e. more redundancy. Similarly reflective symmetry was identified as a key property in defining faces. The effect of symmetry type on early visual processing was investigated further in a series of backward masking experiments on both abstract and facial stimuli (Chapters 6 & 7). The results of the masking experiments suggest a bias during early visual processing for patterns that contain symmetry (i. e. repetition or reflection), or share common fate compared with randomly generated patterns or distorted faces. A top-hemifield and LVF bias was observed in the early detection of patterns. Patterns that take advantage of these properties such as the eyes within the face were suggested as having a perceptual advantage. Patterning appears to be imposed at all stages of visual processing. At early stages of visual processing, repetition (and in the face the eyes) was observed as having an early perceptual advantage over reflection (and in the face the mouth). However at later stages of processing repetition appeared to be processed serially and no longer had a perceptual advantage over reflection (ISIs > 42 <b>ms).</b> <b>Reflection</b> was suggested as having a perceptual advantage post V 1 (ISIs > 96 ms). Patterning continues throughout a visual scene from the local level to the global level, as such both the human face and human social groups can be perceived as patterns. This was illustrated by a series of experiments investigating the effect of patterning on the perception of images presented in the periphery of a scene (Chapter 8) ...|$|R
