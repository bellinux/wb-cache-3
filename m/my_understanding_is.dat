2500|$|Harrison became {{involved}} in a scandal when Jennings returned by refusing to vacate the governorship, claiming Jennings' actions had violated the state constitution and that Jennings was no longer eligible to be governor. The constitution forbade members of the state government to hold any position {{in the federal government}} at the same time. Harrison seized the state seal and setup his own governor's office from where he attempted to run the state. After a brief period of wrangling in the state legislature, the impeachment proceedings against Jennings failed and Harrison was forced to vacate the governors position and it was returned to Jennings. Harrison became very angry with the outcome and promptly resigned his position as governor in a brief letter stating: [...] "As the officers of the executive department of government and the General Assembly have refused to recognize and acknowledge that authority which according to <b>my</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>is</b> constitutionally attached to the office the name itself in my estimation is not worth retaining." ...|$|E
