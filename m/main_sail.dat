5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the <b>main</b> <b>sail,</b> but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E
25|$|Brig sails {{are named}} after the masts {{to which they are}} attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main {{topgallant}} sail; and occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail (it is somewhat similar to the <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called studding sails, and are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are {{named after the}} sails to which they are fastened, i.e. the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{various sizes}} of Laser are all cat-rigged; in {{they have only}} a <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> and no head sail. The Laser Standard sail has a sail area of 7.06 m² (76ft²) and, {{especially}} in higher winds (15 knots and over), is most competitive when sailed by a very fit, agile, and muscular person weighing no less than 80kg (175lb).|$|E
50|$|Coromandel {{measured}} 133 ft x 33 ft x 23 ft. She was a 3 masted square rigged {{ship with}} 13 foresails, 3 top sails, 3 fore topmast stay <b>sails,</b> 2 <b>main</b> <b>sails,</b> 3 <b>main</b> top <b>sails</b> and well found. She had one long boat and two quarter boats. The ship {{was made from}} oak, black birch, and red pine. She was sheathed in yellow metal.|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>sailing</b> club of {{the lake}} is Wabamun Sailing Club, {{approximately}} 8 km west of the village {{at the end of}} Range Road 43. A smaller club is located on the opposite shore {{of the lake}}.|$|R
50|$|Ljungström rig is {{the name}} for the sailing rig {{designed}} by Swedish engineer Fredrik Ljungström with double <b>main</b> <b>sails</b> and rotating mast, but without boom, foresail, forestay and shroud. The early models of the Ljungström sailboat had a stern stay but this was omitted around 1945, before the model 12 (Vingen 12).|$|R
25|$|Cunninghams, which {{tighten the}} luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling {{downward}} on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. The {{idea is to}} flatten the <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> in heavier weather or when sailing to windward. In its simplest form a stainless steel hook that goes through the cringle. From the hook a cordage tail passes through a turnblock on the deck {{at the base of}} the mast and back to a cleat on the deck. Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.|$|E
25|$|A single sail {{tends to}} turn a vessel in an upwind or {{downwind}} direction, and rudder action is required to steer a straight course. A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder {{had not yet been}} invented. With a single sail, a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts like a brake. The second sail, located forward, could be trimmed to offset the turning tendency of the <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> and minimize the need for course corrections by the steering oar, which would have substantially improved sail performance.|$|E
25|$|Outhauls, which {{control the}} foot tension of a boom-footed sail. This {{is one of}} the main {{controls}} for sail fullness. In a racing boat the boom outhaul runs from the sail clew through a turning block along the inside of the boom and out through another turning bock at the fore end of the boom. For simplicity many small racing craft have the boom outhaul attached to a powerful hyfield lever mounted on the boom or deck. The lever is let off for down wind sailing, so the <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> becomes full. Alternatively the outhaul tail can be attached to a block and tackle system so that it can be adjusted to many positions.|$|E
50|$|The mill {{had four}} sails which used the Cubitt patent system of a {{striking}} lever {{to the rear}} so that the shutters could be furled by only removing the weight from the chain to the striking lever. It was winded by a fantail which served to turn the <b>main</b> <b>sails</b> of the mill automatically into the wind.|$|R
5000|$|His last {{large-scale}} work comprised four panels, {{painted on}} the four <b>main</b> <b>sails</b> of the traditional and historic cargo barge [...] "Klipper Anna". The painting is two-sided and is about 270 m2 in area. The 106-year-old ship was provided by its owners, Gijs en Inge van Hesteren from Harlingen, Friesland, the Netherlands. All summer long in 2004, the painting could be seen everywhere around the Dutch Wadden Sea.|$|R

2500|$|The nordlandsjekt were clinker {{built with}} transom stern, {{with a high}} {{straight}} bow. Most of the jekts had {{only half of the}} deck covered, and always had a veng (Norwegian for a kind of Aftercastle) aft. The mast was without stays and was rigged with two square sails (<b>main</b> <b>sail</b> and top sail).|$|E
2500|$|By late in {{the morning}} of June 29, most of the {{gunpowder}} had been removed, but the British bombardment had heavily damaged the Nancy. The <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> was then wrapped around 50 pounds of gunpowder to create a long fuse running from the nearly 100 gunpowder kegs remaining in the hold to the deck and over the side. The fuse was lit as the crew abandoned ship, while one last sailor climbed the mast to remove the American flag. The British thought the lowering of the flag was a sign of surrender and quickly boarded Nancy. By then the fuse had reached the hold. [...] The gunpowder exploded with a huge blast felt for miles.|$|E
2500|$|When the towing cable broke, {{at about}} 70 miles off shore on November 27, the barge {{displayed}} lights {{and put up}} part of the <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> to keep the bow into the wind. [...] The crew of the barge saw {{the lights of the}} tug for about 15 minutes after the tow line broke. [...] When the barge crew was able to raise all the sails, the barge could still make no headway to windward, and instead drifted in a northwesterly direction for about 35 hours. [...] Wheeler made a zig-zag course, governed by the wind strength [...] and direction, back east towards the Oregon coast, eventually spotting the Yaquina Head Light at about 7:00 pm on Tuesday.|$|E
50|$|The Edmonton Yacht Club, {{founded in}} 1923, is the <b>main</b> <b>sailing</b> club of Seba Beach, located at 1 Avenue and 2 Street West. In 1989, Margaret Lemieux {{compiled}} 'Wind in the sails : the Edmonton Yacht Club, 1923-1981', which documented {{the history of}} the Edmonton Yacht Club and sailing in Alberta during this time period, published through the Seba Beach Heritage Society from records of the Edmonton Yacht Club from Cooking Lake and Seba Beach.|$|R

5000|$|Edith Weston is {{a village}} and civil parish {{in the county}} of Rutland in the East Midlands of England. The {{population}} of the civil parish was 1,042 at the 2001 census, including Normanton and increasing to 1,359 at the 2011 census. [...] It is on the south-eastern shore of Rutland Water and is home of the <b>main</b> <b>sailing</b> club and a fishing lodge. The village is named after Edith of Wessex (1029 - 1075), the queen of Edward the Confessor and sister of Harold Godwinson.|$|R
2500|$|By late in {{the morning}} of June 29, 265 to 286 kegs of {{gunpowder}} had been removed, and the British bombardment had [...] heavily damaged Nancy. Barry ordered the <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> wrapped around fifty pounds of gunpowder to create a long fuse running from the nearly 100 gunpowder kegs remaining in the hold to the deck and over the side. The fuse was lit as the crew abandoned ship, while one last sailor climbed the mast to remove the American flag. The British thought the lowering of the flag was a sign of surrender and quickly boarded Nancy. By then the fuse had reached the hold. [...] The gunpowder exploded with a huge blast felt for miles which killed many British. Captain Graeme reported the loss of his master's mate and six men on longboats from Kingfisher.|$|E
2500|$|Racing {{dinghies}} {{are designed}} for racing, [...] but not all have necessarily the same calibre of performance as the above. [...] However, {{in many cases they}} can still offer equally close competition, [...] at the very highest standards, [...] which for many racing helmsmen and crews is the most important consideration. [...] They cover a wide range, and many are descended from Uffa Fox's seminal International 14. People often [...] "travel" [...] with their dinghies to international races in famous sailing spots such as Lake Garda in Italy. [...] The Snipe International Class still stands as one of the strongest classes, after reaching the status of world's largest fleet of dinghies in July 1936. [...] Other examples include the GP14, Enterprise, Solo, Graduate, Firefly, Lark. [...] A specialized subgroup is the Scow, which typically uses two bilgeboards instead of a centerboard, and may have two rudders. Many racing dinghies require two or more people to sail the boat, the skipper is in charge or steering and the <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> depending on the boat, and the crew {{is in charge of the}} jib, the spinnaker,(which can only be flown while going downwind) and keeping the boat level ...|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 8 {{contains}} {{references to}} and quotes {{from many of}} the works Blake was exposed to and influenced by at a young age. These references include allusions to Saint Jerome, John Taylor's Urania, or his Heavenly Muse (1630), Abraham Cowley's translation of Anacreon's lyric poem [...] "The Grasshopper" [...] (1656), Henry Wotton's Reliquae Wottonianae (1685), John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), Joseph Addison's Cato, a Tragedy (1712), Edward Young's Night-Thoughts (1742) and James Hervey's Meditations and Contemplations (1746) and Theron and Aspasio (1755). The Jerome reference is found in Steelyard's comment [...] "Says Jerome happiness is not for us poor crawling reptiles of the earth Talk of happiness & happiness its no such thing – every person has a something." [...] The Taylor reference is Steelyard’s poem; [...] "Hear then the pride & knowledge of a Sailor/His sprit sail fore sail <b>main</b> <b>sail</b> & his mizen/A poor frail man god wot I know none frailer/I know no greater sinner than John Taylor." [...] Although Alicia Ostriker feels this is a reference to the preacher John Taylor, David Erdman argues that the lines closely parallel the opening of the poem Urania , and as such, the reference is more likely to the poet than the preacher. The Cowley reference is found in the poem [...] "Phebe drest like beauties Queen", which contains the lines [...] "Happy people who can be/In happiness compard with ye." [...] Erdman believes this to be derived from the lines in Cowley's translation of Anacreon, [...] "Happy Insect! What can be/In Happiness compar'd to thee?" [...] The Wotton reference is found in Steelyard's [...] "My crop of corn is but a field of tares;" [...] John Sampson believes this to be reference to the Chidiock Tichborne poem [...] "Elegy" [...] (1586), which Blake could have been familiar with from Wotton's Reliquae. Locke is mentioned when Scopprell picks up one of Steelyard's books and reads the cover, [...] "An Easy of Huming Understanding by John Lookye Gent." [...] Addison is referred to indirectly when Steelyard attributes the quote [...] "the wreck of matter & the crush of worlds" [...] to Edward Young, when it is actually from Addison's Cato. Both the reference to Young and Hervey's Meditations are found in the opening sentence of the chapter; [...] "Steelyard the Lawgiver, sitting at his table taking extracts from Herveys Meditations among the tombs & Youngs Night thoughts." [...] The Theron reference is found when Steelyard announces to Obtuse Angle that he is reading the book.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotating}} fantail {{turns the}} cap of the windmill via {{a system of}} gearing to a toothed rack {{around the top of}} the mill tower, or to wheels running {{on the ground in the}} case of a post mill. It does so until the fantail sails are oriented parallel to the wind, as in this case the wind can no longer move them. When the fantail is oriented parallel to the wind, the <b>main</b> <b>sails</b> are in the optimal perpendicular orientation and produce maximum power.|$|R
50|$|Ljungström {{sailboat}} is {{the name}} for the sailboats created by the Swedish engineer Fredrik Ljungström, whose interest sailing had been since childhood. The characteristics of an Ljungström sailboat are circular arc hull and the Ljungström rig where the mast is unsupported by rope and wire, rotatable on two ball bearings and often with double <b>main</b> <b>sails</b> but no fore sail. At their time the Ljungström sailboats were a minor revolution as they were fast, safe and easy to sail as well as relatively easy and affordable to produce.|$|R
50|$|The narrow {{entrance}} to Newtown River is 3/4 {{of a mile}} east of Hamstead Point, in the centre of Newtown Bay. The entrance needs navigating with care {{as there is a}} bar across the entrance, strong cross tides and a fair flow of water {{in and out of the}} entrance channel at mid-tide. Although a lot of mud is exposed in the harbour at low water there are a number of moorings in the deeper parts of the creeks and lakes and the anchorage can become crowded at weekends during the <b>main</b> <b>sailing</b> season.|$|R
60|$|Then Nelson cooked breakfast, {{and while}} we ate we {{considered}} the situation. He was broke. So was I.

6000|$|Here {{and there}} are stalls where bananas are sold, and every morning two little boys go about with trays of sweet rice and crated cocoa-nut, fried fish, or fried plantains; and {{whichever}} it may be, they have but one cry, and that is [...] "Chocolat-t--t!" [...] This must be a Spanish or Portuguese cry, handed down for centuries, while its meaning has been lost. The Bugis sailors, while hoisting the <b>main</b> <b>sail,</b> cry out, [...] "Vela a vela,--vela, vela, vela!" [...] repeated in an everlasting chorus. As [...] "vela" [...] is Portuguese a sail, I supposed I had discovered the origin of this, but I found afterwards they used the same cry when heaving anchor, and often chanted it to [...] "hela," [...] which is so much an universal expression of exertion and hard breathing that it is most probably a mere interjectional cry.|$|E

5000|$|Fore-and-aft rig {{features}} flat sails {{that run}} fore and aft. These types of sails are {{the easiest to}} manage, because they often {{do not need to}} be relaid when the ship changes course, as the bottom or [...] "foot" [...] of triangular <b>main</b> <b>sails</b> are on booms which are controlled by sheets (i.e. ropes) which are secured to a midpoint so that they automatically swing to the leeward side of the boat as she tacks [...] Bermuda rig (also known as a Marconi rig) is a type of fore-and-aft rig with a triangular mainsail.|$|R
5000|$|After {{two hours}} of mutual cannonade, at eleven, the wind fell and both ships almost came to a sudden halt, their <b>main</b> <b>sailing</b> {{resource}} now the gusts of wind from the shore. Taking advantage of this change in the weather, Willaumez ordered his gunners to cease fire and help manoeuver his frigate, quickly coming in position to rake Hercule, only then firing a devastating broadside at her stern. [...] The damage and confusion on Hercule were such that, probably fearing to run aground, she effectively dropped out of action.
