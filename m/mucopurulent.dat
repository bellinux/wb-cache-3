50|$|Rectal gonorrhea {{is caused}} by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (also Neisseria meninigitidis). The {{condition}} is usually asymptomatic, but symptoms can include rectal discharge (which can be creamy, purulent or bloody), pruritus ani, tenesmus, and possibly constipation.

50|$|<b>Mucopurulent</b> {{cervicitis}} (MPC) {{is characterized}} by a purulent or <b>mucopurulent</b> endocervical exudate visible in the endocervical canal or in an endocervical swab specimen. Some specialists also diagnose MPC on the basis of easily induced cervical bleeding. Although some specialists consider an increased number of polymorphonuclear white blood cells on endocervical Gram stain as being useful in the diagnosis of MPC, this criterion has not been standardized, has a low positive-predictive value (PPV), and is not available in some settings. MPC often is without symptoms, but some women have an abnormal vaginal discharge and vaginal bleeding (e.g., after sexual intercourse). MPC can be caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae; however, in most cases neither organism can be isolated. MPC can persist despite repeated courses of antimicrobial therapy. Because relapse or reinfection with C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae usually does not occur in persons with persistent cases of MPC, other non-microbiologic determinants (e.g., inflammation in the zone of ectopy) might be involved.|$|E
50|$|Acute Haemmorrhagic Conjunctivitis is {{normally}} {{recognized by the}} affected individual upon waking. The eyelids stick together requiring great effort in separating them. Intense whitish <b>mucopurulent</b> discharge is observed throughout the day with the eye having a reddish hue. There is pain which is worse upon looking up or at light. Other symptoms include sore eyes, feeling of grittiness or burning, redness, watery discharge, swelling of eyelids.|$|E
50|$|Mycoplasma genitalium {{is a small}} {{pathogenic}} bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial {{whether or not this}} bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with Mycoplasma genitalium sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the urethra (urethritis) both in men and women, which is associated with <b>mucopurulent</b> discharge in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.|$|E

Common bacteria responsible for non-acute bacterial conjunctivitis are Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus sp. Less commonly Chlamydia trachomatis is involved.Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis or Moraxella can cause a non-exudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness. Bacterial conjunctivitis may cause the production of membranes or pseudomembranes that cover the conjunctiva. Pseudomembranes consist {{of a combination of}} inflammatory cells and exudates, and are loosely adherent to the conjunctiva, while true membranes are more tightly adherent and cannot be easily peeled away. Cases of bacterial conjunctivitis that involve the production of membranes or pseudomembranes are associated with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, β-hemolytic streptococci, and C. diphtheriae. Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes membrane formation in conjunctiva of non-immunized children.|$|E
50|$|Ophthalmia neonatorum due to gonococci (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) {{typically}} manifests in {{the first}} five days post birth and is associated with marked bilateral purulent discharge and local inflammation. In contrast, conjunctivitis secondary to infection with chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis) produces conjunctivitis after day three post birth, but may occur up to two weeks after delivery. The discharge is usually more watery in nature (<b>mucopurulent)</b> and less inflamed. Babies infected with chlamydia may develop pneumonitis (chest infection) at a later stage (range 2 weeks - 19 weeks after delivery). Infants with chlamydia pneumonitis should be treated with oral erythromycin for 10-14 days.|$|E
5000|$|Rheum ( [...] ; from Greek: [...] rheume [...] "a flowing, rheum"), {{also known}} as gound, is thin mucus {{naturally}} discharged from the eyes, nose, or mouth during sleep (cf. <b>mucopurulent</b> discharge). Rheum dries and gathers as a crust {{in the corners of}} the eyes or the mouth, on the eyelids, or under the nose. It is formed by a combination of mucus (in the case of the eyes, consisting of mucin discharged from the cornea or the conjunctiva), nasal mucus, blood cells, skin cells, or dust. Rheum from the eyes is particularly common. Dried rheum is commonly called sleep, sleepy sand, eye goop or sleep dust.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{progression}} of the disease in buffaloes and cattle {{is divided into three}} phases. Phase one is characterised by fever, with a rectal temperature of 40 - 41 C, loss of appetite and depression. Phase two is typified by increased respiration rate (40-50/minute), laboured breathing, clear nasal discharge (turns opaque and <b>mucopurulent</b> as the disease progresses), salivation and submandibular oedema spreading to the pectoral (brisket) region and even to the forelegs. Finally, in phase three, there is typically recumbency, continued acute respiratory distress and terminal septicaemia. The three phases overlap when the disease course is short. In general, buffaloes have a more acute onset of disease than cattle, with a shorter duration.|$|E
50|$|After a short {{incubation}} {{period of a}} few hours to one day, the bacteria multiply in the intestinal lumen, causing an intestinal inflammation. Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. Diarrhea is often <b>mucopurulent</b> (containing mucus or pus) and bloody. In most cases, the illness lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment. In some cases, though, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient becomes dangerously dehydrated and must be taken to a hospital. At the hospital, the patient may receive intravenous fluids to treat the dehydration, and may be given medications to provide symptomatic relief, such as fever reduction. In severe cases, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites, and can cause death, unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Infection with M. genitalium {{sometimes}} produces clinical symptoms, or {{a combination}} of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the urethra (urethritis) both in men and women, which is associated with <b>mucopurulent</b> discharge in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating. In women, it causes cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory diseases, including endometritis and salpingitis. Women may also experience bleeding after sex and it is also suspected with tubal factor infertility. For men, the most common signs are painful urination or a watery discharge from the penis. Polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that it is a cause of acute non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) and probably chronic NGU. Unlike other Mycoplasma, the infection is not associated with bacterial vaginosis. It is highly associated with the intensity of HIV infection. It is also suspected {{to play a role in}} the development of prostate and ovarian cancers and lymphomas.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a rare}} {{inflammatory}} {{condition of}} the minor salivary glands, usually in the lower lip, which appears swollen and everted. There may also be ulceration, crusting, abscesses, and sinus tracts. It is an acquired disorder, but the cause is uncertain. Suspected causes include sunlight, tobacco, syphilis, poor oral hygiene and genetic factors. The openings of the minor salivary gland ducts become inflamed and dilated, {{and there may be}} <b>mucopurulent</b> discharge from the ducts. A previous classification suggested dividing cheilitis into 3 types based on severity, with the later stages involving secondary infection with bacteria, and increased ulceration, suppuration and swelling: Type 1, Simple; Type 2, Superficial suppurative ("Baelz's disease"); and Type 3, Deep suppurative ("cheilitis glandularis epostemetosa"). Cheilitis glandularis usually occurs in middle-aged and elderly males, and it carries a risk of malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma (18% to 35%). Preventative treatment such as vermilionectomy ("lip shave") is therefore the treatment of choice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{clinical}} {{symptoms in}} cattle include a cauliflower-like growth or granuloma in the nasal cavity, {{associated with a}} [...] "snoring" [...] sound and profuse <b>mucopurulent</b> discharge. In the endemic areas, there are some local cattle which remain negative for S. nasale eggs, others excrete eggs but without exhibiting symptoms, while a large number exhibit symptoms with presence of the eggs in nasal discharge. A different form of nasal schistosomiasis where local cattle are negative for S. nasale but local buffaloes carry it without showing any symptoms {{has been shown to}} exist at Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh; there, cross-bred cattle exhibit snoring disease symptoms with eggs in their nasal discharge. [...] Anthiomaline was the drug of choice, but this leads to relapse of the symptoms after two months of the treatment. Praziquantel proved better than any other drug. Recently, Dr. M. C. Agrawal has successfully treated cases of nasal schistosomiasis by administering triclabendazole. Nevertheless, there are all chances of killing susceptible blood flukes by these less effective drugs resulting in existence of more resistant schistosome population in future generations causing more problems. Schistosoma nasale eggs are boomerang or palaquine shaped.|$|E

40|$|Mucociliary {{clearance}} {{depends on}} the interaction between cilia and mucus; it is delayed {{in the presence of}} purulent secretions. Nasal mucociliary clearance was examined by the saccharin method and nasal ciliary beat frequency by a photometric technique. Four groups were studied: normal controls, patients with bronchiectasis without nasal symptoms, patients with chronic <b>mucopurulent</b> sinusitis alone, and patients with chronic <b>mucopurulent</b> sinusitis and bronchiectasis. Nasal mucociliary clearance was prolonged in infected patients. Cilia obtained from the site of purulent secretions were found to beat more slowly in vitro (<b>mucopurulent</b> sinusitis 12. 1 Hz, <b>mucopurulent</b> sinusitis and bronchiectasis 11. 6 Hz), than those obtained from normal controls (14. 3 Hz) and from patients with bronchiectasis alone (13. 6 Hz). The cause of the ciliary slowing seemed most likely to be the release of host factors during the inflammatory response, rather than the particular organism isolated. Ciliary slowing may contribute to the observed delay of mucociliary clearance in conditions in which purulent secretions are present...|$|E
