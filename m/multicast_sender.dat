40|$|Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6) is {{proposed}} as a promising network-based mobility management protocol, {{which does not}} need any participation of mobile nodes. PMIPv 6 {{does not support the}} multicast well and most of the current research concentrates on the mobile multicast receiver. However, the mobile <b>multicast</b> <b>sender</b> is also very important and challenging, which has not been addressed well. Therefore, in this paper we propose two efficient PMIPv 6 based mobile <b>multicast</b> <b>sender</b> support schemes which are PMIP bidirectional tunneling (PMIP-BT) and PMIP direct routing (PMIP-DR). In the PMIP-BT, the multicast traffic can be delivered through the PMIPv 6 bidirectional tunnel, while, in the PMIP-DR, the multicast data can be transmitted via an optimized direct multicast routing. Both of them can support the <b>multicast</b> <b>sender</b> mobility transparently enabled in the PMIPv 6 networks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes by theoretical analysis, and the numerical results show that the proposed schemes have a better performance in terms of the signaling cost than the current schemes. Meanwhile, the proposed schemes are also implemented on the test bed, and the experimental results not only verify the validity and feasibility of our proposed schemes, but also conclude the different scenarios to which they are applicable...|$|E

40|$|Multicast {{communication}} in a wireless ad-hoc network {{can be established}} using a tree that spans the <b>multicast</b> <b>sender</b> and receivers {{as well as other}} intermediate nodes. If the net-work is modelled as a graph, the multicast tree is a Steiner tree, the <b>multicast</b> <b>sender</b> and receivers correspond to ter-minals, and other nodes participating in the tree are Steiner nodes. As Steiner nodes are nodes that participate in the multicast tree by forwarding packets but do not benefit from the multicast, it is a natural objective to compute a tree that minimizes the total cost of the Steiner nodes. We there-fore consider the problem of computing, for a given node-weighted graph and a set of terminals, a Steiner tree with Steiner nodes of minimum total weight. For graph classes that admit spanning trees of maximum degree at most d, we obtain a 0. 775 d-approximation algorithm. We show that this result implies a 3. 875 -approximation algorithm for unit disk graphs, an O(1 /α 2) -approximation algorithm for α-unit disk graphs, and an O(λ) -approximation algorithm for (λ + 1) -claw-free graphs...|$|E

40|$|BMTP offers rate {{controlled}} multicast with reliability, high throughput, {{and support}} for large numbers of receivers. A <b>multicast</b> <b>sender</b> needs feedback from receivers to recover from errors and to choose an appropriate send rate, but must avoid being overwhelmed {{as the number of}} receivers grows. BMTP does this by keeping the rate at which each receiver sends feedback inversely proportional to a running estimate of the number of receivers. BMTP bases its send rate on the minimum of the receive rates observed by the receivers, causing the sender to slow down in the face of packet loss or competing traffic, and to speed up when there is spare network capacity. BMTP’s NAK-based retransmission rarely sends any data more than twice, a substantial improvement over iterated unicast. Rabin’s Information Dispersal Algorithm can reduce this re-send rate as close as desired to the underlying loss rate of the network. Simulations with 1000 receivers substantiate these claims. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{reliable}} multicast MAC protocol {{based on the}} multicarrier direct-sequence code-division multiple access (MC DS-CDMA) scheme to enhance spatial reuse efficiency in wireless local area networks (WLANs). Conventional multicast MAC protocols using RTS-CTS handshake exchange CTS and ACK packets consecutively for reliable transmission. Although this protocol guarantees transmission reliability by avoiding the hidden node (HN) problem, multiple CTSs and ACKs degrade network efficiency and cause the well-known exposed node (EN) problem, rather than the HN problem. The <b>multicast</b> <b>sender</b> must receive multiple CTSs and ACKs from all multicast receivers in its own multicastgroup for reliable multicast. The range of the EN problem is {{greater than that of}} the unicast, and spatial reuse efficiency decreases. In the proposed protocol, CTS/ACK messages of multiple receivers can be transmitted concurrently through the MC DS-CDMA mechanism to alleviate the EN problem and enhance spatial reuse efficiency. This can reduce the transmission and carrier sensing range of multiple receivers, since the protocol spreads the CTS/ACK transmission power by the spreading gain. The proposed protocol also reduces the total transmission delay due to the reduction of the overhead of consecutive CTSs and ACKs. The proposed protocol is thoroughly examined by simulation and theoretical methods. Results show that the proposed protocol significantly reduces the aforementioned overhead, and thus improves the performance of WLAN systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{scheduling}} wireless transmissions under sig-nal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints has received in-creasing attention recently. While previous work has considered the uni-cast case where each transmission has one sender and one receiver, {{we consider the}} setting of multicast requests where each transmission has one sender {{and a set of}} receivers. A set of multicast transmissions can be scheduled in the same round if the SINR at all receivers is above a certain threshold. The goal is to minimise the number of rounds. Building on the relationship between SINR scheduling and unit disk graph colouring established by Halldórsson (ESA 2009), we present an O(logΓ) -approximation algorithm for multicast scheduling in the SINR model, where Γ is the ratio of the longest to the shortest link length, considering only the longest link of each multicast request. The algo-rithm uses uniform power assignment and can be implemented online. We also compare the model of atomic multicasts (where all receivers of a multicast must receive the transmission in the same round) to the model of splittable multicasts (where a <b>multicast</b> <b>sender</b> can transmit in several rounds, each time serving a subset of its receivers). Further-more, we consider the throughput maximisation problem and obtain an O(logΓ) -competitive randomised online algorithm and show that every deterministic algorithm, even for unicast links and using arbitrary power assignments, has competitive ratio Ω(logΓ). ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} novel {{architecture}} for multicasting of adaptively-encoded layered MPEG 4 over a QoS-aware IP network. We require a QoS-aware IP network {{in this case}} to (1) Support priority dropping of packets in time of congestion. (2) Provide congestion notification to the <b>multicast</b> <b>sender.</b> For the first requirement, we use RED’s extension for service differentiation. It recognizes the priority of packets {{when they need to}} be dropped and drops lower priority packets first. We couple RED with our proposal for the second requirement which is the adoption of Backward Explicit Congestion Notification (BECN) for use with IP multicast. BECN will provide early congestion notification at the IP layer level to the video sender. BECN detects upcoming congestion based on size of the RED queue in the routers. The MPEG 4 adaptive-encoder can change the sending rate and also can divide the video packets into lower priority packets and high priority packets. Based on BECN messages from the routers, a simple flow controller at the sender sets the rate for the adaptive MPEG 4 encoder and also sets the ratio between the high priority and low priority packets within the video stream. We use a TES model for generating the MPEG 4 traffic that is based on real video traces. Simulation results show that combining priority dropping, MPEG 4 adaptive encoding, and multicast BECN: (1) Improves bandwidth utilization (2) Reduces time to react to congestion and hence improves the received video quality (3) Maintains graceful degradation in quality with congestion and provides minimum quality even if congestion persists.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present Scalable Position-Based Multicast (SPBM), a {{multicast}} routing protocol for ad-hoc networks. SPBM uses the geographic position of nodes {{to provide a}} highly scalable group membership scheme and {{to forward data packets}} {{in a way that is}} very robust to changes in the topology of the network. SPBM bases the forwarding decision on whether there are group members located in a given direction or not, allowing for a hierarchical aggregation of membership information: the further away a region is from an intermediate node the higher the level of aggregation should be for this region. Because of aggregation, the overhead for group membership management scales logarithmically with the number of nodes and is independent of the number of <b>multicast</b> <b>senders</b> for a given multicast group. Furthermore, we show that group management overhead is bounded by a constant if the frequency of membership updates is scaled down with the aggregation level. This scaling of the update frequency is reasonable since the higher the level of aggregation the lower the number of membership changes for the aggregate. The performance of SPBM is investigated by means of simulation, including a comparison with ODMRP, and through mathematical analysis. We also describe an open source kernel implementation of SPBM that has been successfully deployed on hand-held computers. I...|$|R
40|$|Multicasting is the {{transmission}} of datagrams (packets) {{to a group of}} zero or more hosts identified by a single destination address. Maintaining group membership information and building an optimal multicast distribution structure (typically {{in the form of a}} routing tree) is challenging even in wired networks. However, nodes are increasingly mobile. One particularly challenging environment for multicast is a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). This report provides an in-depth study of one-to-many and many-to-many communication in mobile ad-hoc networks. First we compare a range of best-effort protocols: 2 unicast routing protocols, 3 multicast routing protocols, and 2 broadcast protocols. Our results show that broadcast protocols, in particular BCAST, perform well and that this performance does not come with a high overhead. We then enhance BCAST with a NACK-based retransmission scheme to further increase the packet delivery ratio, resulting in reliable BCAST. We also explore the impact of the MAC layer on the performance of both best-effort BCAST and reliable BCAST. Varying the user traffic load and the MAC layer, the results provide a number of insights into the relationship between MAC and ROUTING layer. Overall, BCAST is a protocol that achieves high packet delivery, at the cost of an increase in packet latency. We show that the protocol performs well in a wide range of scenarios and over a number of MAC layers (all of which were variants of the 802. 11 protocol family). Increasing packet delivery through a retransmission scheme is, however, only of limited value. As MAC rates increase for current and future networks, MANETs will be able to support a non-trivial amount of traffic per <b>multicast</b> <b>sender.</b> Achieving high packet delivery ratios in these networks can be achieved by adjusting the data volume through flow control to operate in the protocol “sweet spot”, using the best-effort protocol as basic protocol...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of point-to-multipoint applications with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in the Internet has prompted research towards {{the deployment of}} multicast communications in Differentiated Services (DiffServ) environments. However, despite many past research efforts, global availability of IP multicast is still a {{pie in the sky}} for Internet users, let alone applications with QoS guarantees. One of the key factors that hamper associated progress is scalability, in terms of various types of states associated with routing and signaling in both multicast and QoS. In this thesis we aim at a scalable architectural design of multicast service provisioning for end users with heterogeneous QoS requirements, targeted to the DiffServ environment. Our architecture consists of three planes: management, control and data plane. First of all, we design and evaluate the Offline Multicast Traffic Engineering (OMTE) building block in the management plane for QoS aware multicast service dimensioning. The main novelty of this scheme is that we shift away from the commonly used Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) based traffic engineering, and address the bandwidth constrained IP multicast TE directly based on link state routing protocols. With this approach, end-to-end performance can be achieved without MPLS explicit routing that potentially suffers from scalability problems in terms of Label Switching Path (LSP) maintenance and is relatively expensive to deploy. In the control plane, we propose two different paradigms. QoS aware Source Specific Multicast (QSSM) is designed for dedicated multicast delivery tree construction in different QoS classes, while another overlay scheme, known as Differentiated QoS Multicast (DQM), attempts to build a single hybrid tree that exhibits heterogeneous QoS channels within the network. In both approaches, multicast group addresses are used to encode QoS class information, and the associated benefit is reflected in scalability and backwards compatibility; neither underlying multicast protocols nor existing routers need any extension for carrying and maintaining QoS states within the network. Finally, envisaging the importance of protecting dimensioned resources from Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks from malicious hosts, we propose the <b>Multicast</b> <b>Sender</b> Access Control (MSAC) mechanism, which is indispensable in multicast security, but still lacks significant attention from the research community. We focus on bi-directional multicast trees, which is the most vulnerable routing paradigm to DoS attacks. Both intra- and inter-domain control mechanisms are addressed with scalability considerations in mind...|$|E
40|$|The use of on-demand {{techniques}} in routing protocols for multihop wireless ad hoc networks {{has been shown}} to have significant advantages in terms of reducing the routing protocol's overhead and improving its ability to react quickly to topology changes in the network. A number of on-demand multicast routing protocols have been proposed, but each also relies on significant periodic (non-on-demand) behavior within portions of the protocol. This paper presents the design and initial evaluation of the Adaptive Demand-Driven Multicast Routing protocol (ADMR), a new ondemand ad hoc network multicast routing protocol that attempts to reduce as much as possible any non-on-demand components within the protocol. Multicast routing state is dynamically established and maintained only for active groups and only in nodes located between <b>multicast</b> <b>senders</b> and receivers. Each multicast data packet is forwarded along the shortest-delay path with multicast forwarding state, from the sender to the receivers, and receivers dynamically adapt to the sending pattern of senders in order to efficiently balance overhead and maintenance of the multicast routing state as nodes in the network move or as wireless transmission conditions in the network change. We describe the operation of the ADMR protocol and present an initial evaluation of its performance based on detailed simulation in ad hoc networks of 50 mobile nodes.

This is accomplished as follows: Notice that members observe the delivery of their own multicasts. Accordingly, if a new view becomes defined in which the old leader has failed, either the multicast has been delivered (in which case the sender knows this because {{it was one of the}} receivers), or the delivery of the new view allows it to conclude that the leader failed to relay the pending message, and that it should be resent by asking the new leader to relay it (non-triviality).|$|R
40|$|A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a {{wireless}} network where {{a collection of}} mobile nodes may dynamically vary the topological structure. Multicast is an efficient method to implement the group communications. Mobile Ad-Hoc is a dynamic, multi-hop and autonomous networks composed by wireless mobile nodes. The mobility model represents the realistic behavior of each mobile node in the MANET. Routing Protocol for Ad-Hoc networks are typically evaluated using simulations. In this paper, we compare the performance of On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP), Adaptive demand driven Multicast Routing Protocol (ADMR) With Robust Scalable Geographic Multicast Protocol (RSGM) under different mobility models such as Random Way Point Model, Manhattan Model and Random Drunken Model. Using these models, performance metrics such as Packet Delivery Ratio, End-to-End Delay and Control Overhead are evaluated. ODMRP dynamically builds the route and manages the group membership. In ADMR, Multicast routing state is dynamically established and maintained only for active groups and only in nodes located between <b>multicast</b> <b>senders</b> and receivers. ADMR detects the high mobility {{without the use of}} GPS or other positioning system. RSGM supports a zone-based scheme to efficiently handle the two-tier membership management, and takes advantage of the membership management structure to efficiently track the locations of all the group members without resorting to an external location server. The simulation result shows that the throughput of ADMR is higher than that of ODMR and RSGM at high mobility and RSGM is high at low mobility. End to end delay and control over head of RSGM is higher than ODMR and ADMR. Keywords [...] MANET; ODMRP; ADMR; RSGM; Random Way Point model; Random Drunken model; Manhattan model. I...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{separately}} control individual secure sessions between unlimited pairs of <b>multicast</b> receivers and <b>senders</b> while preserving the scalability of receiver initiated Internet multicast for the data transfer itself. Unlike other secure multicast solutions, there are absolutely no side-effects on other receivers when a single receiver joins or leaves a session. Each individual receiver can also reliably prove whether any fragment of the data hasn't been delivered or wasn't delivered on time (e. g...|$|R
