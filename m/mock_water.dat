The {{characters}} are parodies of the characters in the films of Stanley Kubrick. Kubrilesque began in California in 2005 with neo-burlesque dancers Crystal Swarovski and Polly Peabody and the Troupe Cherry Kiss Burlesque. Cherry Kiss Burlesque began performing together in the Hollywood Nightclub and cabaret scene with small burlesque themed shows such as “Chicks in Space” and “Jungle Exotica”. Crystal Swarovski and Polly Peabody decided to work on something bigger and more original and they {{came up with the idea}} of a Stanley Kubrick parody themed show. The show was first workshopped as a parody of Clockwork Orange that involved tap dancing statues and Droogs. In spring of 2008 ‘Kubrilesque’ was run as a burlesque revue for a two-night run with The Poubelle Twins joining the cast as a parody of The Grady Twins from the film The Shining and dancer Scarlett Letter was featured in a group fan dance done as an Eye’s Wide Shut parody. The show also featured a parody of 2001:Space Odyssey with burlesque ballerinas stripping out of monkey suits performing a <b>mock</b> <b>water</b> ballet.

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) of barley and wheat is a {{difficult}} disease to manage because {{of the complexity of}} the interactions. A serious problem associated with FHB is the accumulation of trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON). Trichothecenes increase the virulence of the pathogen and reduce grain quality. A primary objective in our laboratory is to identify genes that reduce the impact of trichothecenes. Our laboratory has identified approximately 700 barley transcripts that respond to the invading pathogen and pathogenderived trichothecenes. In an effort to further understand the barley-F. graminearum interaction, a subset of 54 genes encoding transcription factors, regulatory proteins, UDP-glucosyltransferases, cytochrome-P 450 s, and proteins participating in ubiquitination and cell death were selected and tested for their response to DON treatment compared to <b>mock</b> <b>water</b> inoculation at 1, 6 and 12 hours after inoculation (hai).

40|$|Pitch canker, {{caused by}} Fusarium circinatum, {{is a disease}} {{affecting}} Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and many other pine species throughout the world. The impact of pitch canker on Pinus radiata may be limited by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a phenomenon that elevates resistance to a pathogen after initial challenge by that pathogen or another microorganism. Allocation of resources to defense, {{as a consequence of}} SAR, is presumed to reduce resources available to support growth and reproduction, but specific fitness consequences associated with SAR in P. radiata have not been measured. To quantify impacts of SAR on growth rate, a 2 × 2 factorial experiment was established in which trees were either primed for SAR or unprimed, with half the trees in each of those two groups being inoculated with the pitch canker pathogen and the other half not inoculated. Priming for SAR was accomplished by inoculating one branch with F. circinatum and removing inoculated branches prior to subsequent challenge inoculations (= disease treatments). Disease treatments included three inoculations that were removed for measurement of lesion length, and three additional inoculations that remained on the tree as a representation of persistent disease.

40|$|Foram avaliados trifólios de soja de genótipos tolerante (Embrapa 48) e suscetível a seca (BR- 16) sob três níveis de déficit hídrico: ausência de estresse hídrico, estresse hídrico moderado (potencial hídrico foliar na antemanhã de - 1, 5 MPa) e estresse hídrico severo (potencial hídrico de - 3, 0 MPa). Dos três genes aqui estudados, o gene GmHB 13 foi claramente induzido pelo déficit hídrico. O gene GmHB 13 foi induzido no genótipo tolerante, e teve sua expressão reduzida no genótipo suscetível. Como a superexpressão de seu heterólogo em plantas de Arabidopsis tha/iana transgênicas aumenta a tolerância a seca, estas duas evidências, em conjunto, sugerem que este gene esteja contribuindo para a maior tolerância a seca do genótipo Embrapa 48. Por outro lado, a indução semelhante do gene GmHBZ 1 em ambos os genótipos, sugere que este gene possa estar controlando a expressão de genes de aclimatação a seca, não ligados diretamente ao mecanismo de tolerância. A repressão da expressão do gene GmHBô no genótipo suscetível pode estar relacionada ao maior tempo de desidratação deste genótipo, visto que o mesmo atinge mais rapidamente o estresse hídrico severo. A redução no crescimento e então mais forte no genótipo suscetível, o que pode ser devido a maior redução da expressão do fator transcricional GmHBô, que teria um papel importante no controle da divisão celular. A análise dos promotores mostrou a presença de elementos cis-regulatórios relacionados ao estresse hídrico nos três genes estudados. Em conjunto, os resultados indicam que o gene GmHB 13 como um forte candidato a participar no mecanismo de tolerância a seca em soja. The {{objective}} of this work was to analyze the gene expression of the HD- Zip I subfamily, and its involvement in drought tolerance in soybean using the real time PCR (RT-qPCR) technique. Trifoliate soybean leaves of drought tolerant (Embrapa 48) and susceptible (BR- 16) genotypes were evaluated under three levels of water deficit: absence of <b>water</b> stress (<b>mock),</b> moderate <b>water</b> stress (- 1. 5 MPa), and severe water stress (- 3. 0 MPa). Among the three genes studied, GmHB 13 was clearly induced by water stress. GmHB 13 was induced only in the tolerant genotype, While it has reduced expression in the susceptible genotype. Super-expression of heterologous genes in Arabidopsis tha/iana transgenic plants increases drought tolerance. These observations suggest that this gene is contributing to a higher drought tolerance in the tolerant genotype. Moreover, the induction of gene, GmHBZ 1 in both genotypes, suggests that this gene may be controlling the expression of drought acclimation genes {{not directly related to}} the mechanism of tolerance. The greatest reduction in expression of the GmHBG gene in the susceptible genotype may be related to a longer dehydration of this genotype, whereas it quickly reaches the severe water stress. The growth reduction is stronger in the susceptible genotype, Which may be due to greater reduction in the expression of transcription factor GmHBG, Which would have an important role in controlling cell division. The analysis of the promoters showed the presence of cis- regulatory elements related to water stress in the three genes studied. Together, these results indicate the gene GmHB 13 as a strong candidate to participate in the mechanism of drought tolerance in soybean...|$|R

When spring with its moist verdure and frail, sweet-smelling flowers had gone; when the great plain began to turn to a rusty-brown colour, and the dry hard earth was full of cracks, and the days grew longer and the heat greater, there came an appearance of water that quivered and glittered and danced before his wondering sight, and would lead him miles from home every day in his vain efforts {{to find out what it}} was.

40|$|Relief {{organizations}} and governments strive to provide {{safe drinking water}} to natural disaster survivors as quickly as possible. However, drinking water is typically provided either as bottled water or via mobile water treatment equipment, both {{of which can be}} difficult or expensive to transport rapidly into disaster zones. An alternative is the waterbag point-of-use treatment device developed at Cal Poly that allows survivors to produce safe drinking water from contaminated local sources. The waterbag is a 10 -L bladder designed for use with Procter 2 ̆ 6 Gamble Purifier of Water (PŪR®) sachets, which contain coagulant and chlorine compounds. Following treatment with PŪR®, treated water in the waterbag is flowed through an outlet port to a filter, primarily for parasitic cyst removal. Currently, the commercial version of the waterbag uses an effective but expensive hollow-fiber membrane microfilter (3 ̆e 10 each). This cost will likely decrease the use of the waterbag by relief organizations responding to large disasters. The goal of the present thesis research was to develop a novel, low cost (5), effective, low-profile filter to be used with the waterbag in large-scale disaster relief. This new filter is referred to as an envelope filter due to its geometry and size. Various prototype envelope filters were constructed using layers of nonwoven polypropylene filter cloth. Two types of cloth were used: a nominally-rated 1 -µm pore size cloth and an absolute-rated 1 -µm cloth. The filters tested were both internal and external to the waterbag and of various geometries. Filters were attached to the waterbag and used to filter defined test water after it had been treated with a PŪR® sachet. Test water for design experiments consisted of tap water with addition of standard dust (to increase turbidity) and seasalts (to increase salinity). In addition to this basic test <b>water,</b> <b>mock</b> U. S. EPA Challenge Water # 2 with added bacteria and cyst surrogates (fluorescent microspheres) was used to evaluate the filter prototype designs prior to testing according to U. S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers in a commercial laboratory. The filter design and mock challenge experiment results indicated that a 2 -ply filter with one nominal and one absolute layer was the optimal filter design. In the mock U. S. EPA challenge tests, a flowrate of 20 mL/min allowed this filter met the turbidity, bacteria, and microsphere removal requirements determined by the WHO and The Sphere Project for emergency drinking water treatment as well as the U. S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers [...] This filter design was further tested using the U. S. EPA Challenge Water # 2 with triplicate waterbags at the U. S. EPA-certified BioVir Laboratories in Benicia, Calif. All three waterbags with envelope filters met the recommendations for turbidity (3 ̆c 5 3 ̆eNTU) and for virus removal (3 ̆e 4 -log removal). Two of the three waterbags met the bacteria and microsphere removal requirements (3 ̆e 6 - and 3 ̆e 3 -log removal, respectively). The failure of one of the prototypes to meet the requirements could have been due to improper setting of valve that throttled the flowrate through the filter or due to a slightly leaking hose pinch valve. Future work should include incorporating more reliable valves and improving the envelope filter design and materials to achieve higher allowable flowrates...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies silicon {{has been associated}} with reduced disease severity and incidence, the enhanced accumulation of phenolic compounds and lignin, and with changes in the defence-related enzyme activity and transcript abundance of defence and stress related genes. All of these aspects of plant defence were considered in this study on cotton infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (Fov), and the results obtained have greatly enhanced our understanding of the effects of silicon on this interaction. In all experiments conducted, defence responses were only significantly enhanced by silicon treatment following inoculation with Fov, strongly suggesting that silicon can prime defence responses in cotton infected with Fov. Sicot F- 1 was the cultivar most resistant to Fov infection at the commencement of this research, whilst Sicot 189 was considered to have moderate resistance to the pathogen. Vascular discolouration was significantly reduced in the more resistant cultivar, Sicot F- 1 following treatment with potassium silicate, compared to mock inoculated plants and inoculated plants treated with potassium sulphate or calcium sulphate. No significant differences between treatments were observed in the moderately resistant cultivar, Sicot 189, though further trials may need to be conducted to confirm this result. In both cultivars, silicon content was significantly greater in plants which had been treated regularly with liquid potassium silicate, rather than with calcium silicate powder. Histological investigation of cotton infected with Fov, with and without silicon treatment, was conducted to ascertain the effects of this element on the accumulation of fungitoxic phenolic compounds, cell ultrastructural changes and fungal infection structures. Fov proliferated through the cortex and stele of plants from both the resistant (Sicot F- 1), and moderately resistant (Sicot 189) cultivars, regardless of silicon treatment. However, defences were more rapidly and intensely induced in endodermal and vascular regions of inoculated, potassium silicate treated Sicot F- 1 plants. Significantly more phenolic compounds were present at seven days post infection (dpi) in root extracts of inoculated, potassium silicate treated Sicot F- 1 plants. Phenolic compounds were not significantly increased in inoculated, potassium silicate treated root extracts of Sicot 189 plants at three or seven dpi. Lignin assays demonstrated that the dry weight percentage of lignin in root material from inoculated, potassium silicate treated Sicot F- 1 plants was significantly higher than that of extracts from inoculated plants not receiving silicon treatment at three dpi. This trend was also observed at seven dpi; however lignin content was not significantly different in this case. Percentage lignin content in the roots of Sicot 189 plants was not significantly different between inoculated potassium silicate treated plants and those not treated with silicon. Histological alterations were not observed in <b>mock</b> inoculated <b>water</b> or potassium silicate treated plants, nor were any significant increases in phenolic compounds or lignin accumulation detected in control treatments not inoculated with the pathogen. The expression of several defence related genes was assessed with quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results obtained verify that potassium silicate can enhance defence responses in Sicot 189 and Sicot F- 1 plants inoculated with Fov, with silicon having a more pronounced effect on the more resistant cultivar, Sicot F- 1. Genes upregulated at three and four dpi in potassium silicate treated, Fov inoculated Sicot F- 1 plants included peroxidase, cadinene synthase and polygalacturonase inhibiting protein (PGIP), with peroxidase associated with phenol oxidation and lignification and cadinene synthase with phytoalexin biosynthesis. Osmotin-like protein and chitinase class I were consistently upregulated in potassium silicate treated, inoculated Sicot 189 plants; both genes coding for pathogenesis related (PR) proteins, with chitinase also classified as an antifungal protein. In both cultivars, silicon treatment without Fov inoculation did not result in the significant up-regulation of any of the defence genes assessed, providing further evidence for the role of silicon in priming in this interaction. The activities of three defence related enzymes, peroxidase, chitinase and β- 1, 3 - glucanase was assessed in root and shoot material by colourimetric assays. Regular application of potassium silicate significantly increased the activity of peroxidase in root extracts from the highly resistant cultivar Sicot F- 1, at three, four and seven dpi with Fov, and in root extracts from the moderately resistant Sicot 189 at three and four dpi. Significant increases in chitinase activity in inoculated, silicon treated Sicot 189 plants were observed in root extracts at three dpi, and in shoot extracts at four dpi. Soluble potassium silicate treatment resulted in significant increases in β- 1, 3 - glucanase activity in Sicot 189 root extracts at four dpi. Few significant differences between treatments in terms of chitinase and β- 1, 3 - glucanase activity were detected in Sicot F- 1 plants, though higher levels of each of these enzymes were present in root and shoot extracts from this cultivar. In this study the effects of acibenzolar-S-methyl, applied in the form of Bion®, on defence gene expression and enzyme activity in cotton infected with Fov were more pronounced in plants cultivated from treated seed, rather than in plants treated via foliar spray; a finding which is particularly relevant to the industry presently. Significant up-regulation of chitinase class I, peroxidase, and β- 1, 3 -glucanase transcripts and enzyme activities occurred in the Bion® seed soak treatment with Fov inoculation compared to all other treatments. It was possible to compare the actions of silicon with those of Bion® in this study. Bion® primed defence responses in cotton infected with Fov, {{in a manner similar to}} that observed in silicon treated cotton. The use of silicon and Bion® treatments, both alone and in combination as part of integrated disease management programmes, may potentially contribute to increased protection against this pathogen in Australian cotton fields in the future...|$|R
