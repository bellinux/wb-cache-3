Development of formalized {{description}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system of numerical code {{based on the}} analysis of characteristic failures of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system and procedure of its maintenance. Methodology. For this research a theoretical and analytical methods have been used. Findings. Typical failures of the <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> systems were analyzed, as well as basic reasons of failure occur were found out. It was determined that majority of failures occurs due to defects of the maintenance system. Advantages and disadvantages of the current service technology of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system were analyzed. Works that can be automatized by means of technical diagnostics were found out. Formal {{description of}} the numerical code of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system as a graph in the state space of the system was carried out. Originality. The state graph of the numerical code of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system {{that takes into account}} gradual transition from the serviceable condition to the loss of efficiency was offered. That allows selecting diagnostic information according to attributes and increasing the effectiveness of recovery operations {{in the case of a}} malfunction. Practical value. The obtained results of analysis and proposed the state graph can be used as the basis for the development of new means of diagnosing devices for <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system, which in turn will improve the efficiency and service of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system devices in general...|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, the {{signalling}} {{systems were}} rebuilt {{along the entire}} route. <b>Automatic</b> <b>block</b> signaling was established between Salzburg and Freilassing in 1963. In addition, push button relay interlockings were installed in Prien and Bad Endorf stations in 1963. An <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system was installed between the two stations on 28 June 1964 for 233,000 Deutsche Marks, making the signalbox at Rimstings station unnecessary. On 14 July 1969 and in the following days, the automated route setting interlocking in Traunstein, the <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system between Übersee and Traunstein and the <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system between Traunstein and Teisendorf opened. So for 2.092 million Deutsche Marks the personnel at Bergen (Oberbay) and Lauter (Oberbay) were able to be saved. On 11 December 1978, a centralised block was established between Teisendorf and Freilassing, which was controlled by an automated route setting interlocking of the SpDrS60 design. An <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system went into operation between Prien am Chiemsee and Übersee on 1 July 1980. Bergen (Oberbay) station was closed to passenger traffic at the same time. An <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system was taken into operation between Landl (Oberbay) {{and the start of}} the Rosenheim curve on 21 January 1982. The <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> system between Landl and Bad Endorf was not opened until 26 November 1985. The entire upgrade between Rosenheim and Bad Endorf cost 4.7 million Deutsche Marks. An electronic interlocking was put into operation at Rosenheim between 19 and 23 November 2003. Electronic interlockings that are controlled from Munich have operated at Bad Endorf and Prien am Chiemsee stations since 2 March 2005.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{identify}} the characteristic {{features of the}} engineering control measures system of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> of numeric code, identifying their advantages and disadvantages, to analyze the possibility of their use in the problems of diagnosing status of the devices <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> and setting targets {{for the development of}} new diagnostic systems. Methodology. In order to achieve targets the objective theoretical and analytical method and the method of functional analysis have been used. Findings. The analysis of existing and future facilities of the remote control and diagnostics <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> devices had shown that the existing systems of diagnosis were not sufficiently informative, designed primarily to control the discrete parameters, which in turn did not allow them to construct a decision support subsystem. In developing of new systems of technical diagnostics it was proposed to use the principle of centralized distributed processing of diagnostic data, to include a subsystem support decision-making in to the diagnostics system, it will reduce the amount of work to maintain the devices blocking and reduce recovery time after the occurrence injury. Originality. As a result, the currently existing engineering controls facilities of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> can not provide a full assessment of the state distillation alarms and locks. Criteria for the development of new systems of technical diagnostics with increasing amounts of diagnostic information and its automatic analysis were proposed. Practical value. These results of the analysis can be used in practice in order to select the technical control of <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> devices, as well as the further development of diagnostic systems <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> that allows for a gradual transition from a planned preventive maintenance service model to the actual state of the monitored devices...|$|R

50|$|The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{operates}} the New York City Subway, which is mostly manually operated.

Many {{portions of the}} signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s.

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{particularly}} as trains became longer and faster, and railroad lines grew more congested, the banjo signal was considered to have a single and terminal flaw: visibility. The internal disc was difficult to see in foggy weather and when snow clung to the glass panel. Earlier types of electro-pneumatic semaphores made by US&S had seen some limited application by 1880 as <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signals. The need to maintain air pressure in the long pneumatic lines eventually led the railroads to discontinue their widespread use as <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signals. However, these types did see long service in interlocking plants. Early semaphores also had limited range with manual wire operation and poor reliability in bad weather. Thus some railroads continued to use disc signals where <b>automatic</b> <b>block</b> signal operation was needed between manual block stations as borne out by period rule books well into the 1920s and beyond.|$|R

40|$|AbstractNow days, averting {{collision}} of trains is a chief issue in railway sector. The prime cause for {{this problem is}} improper signaling for trains due to faulty working of sensors or result of decision making systems responsible for signaling.
