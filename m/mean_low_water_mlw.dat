40|$|The tide-related {{parameters}} of the Delaware Bay are derived from Space Shuttle time-series photographs. The water areas in the bay are measured from interpretation maps of the photographs with a CALCOMP 9100 digitizer and ERDAS Image Processing System. The corresponding tidal levels are calculated using the exposure time annotated on the photographs. From these data, an approximate function relating the water area to the tidal level at a reference point is determined. Based on the function, the water areas of the Delaware Bay at mean high water (MHW) and <b>mean</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MLW),</b> below 0 m, and for the tidal zone are inferred. With MHW and MLW areas and the mean tidal range, we calculate the tidal influx of the Delaware Bay, which is 2. 76 x 10 exp 9 cu m. The velocity of flood tide at the bay mouth is determined using the tidal flux and an integral of the velocity distribution function at the cross section between Cape Henlopen and Cape May.

40|$|Shallow {{water tables}} {{are one of}} the most {{important}} land characteristics. They determine the potential land use: the depth is essential in the evaluation of suitability for agriculture and in nature development projects, it is also crucial to identify possible problems with other land uses. Although it is easy to derive the water table on a specific location at one point in time, the depth is highly variable in time (due to its dependence on precipitation surplus) and in space (as is easily observed when strolling through the countryside). The common method for estimating the water table depth in Flanders was by using estimates based on the existing natural drainage class map of Flanders. This natural drainage class map is based on data collected during the national soil survey. It was derived from the depth of gley mottles and the reduction horizon and the position in the landscape and is often used to predict the depth and variability of the water table. Rather than duplicating this methodology, a different method was applied based on actual measurements of the water table. The evaluation was done in three case studies in different part of Flanders: The Dijle Valley, Kluizen and Damme. These encompass some of the major regions where the water table is of great importance: sandy Flanders, river valleys in central Flanders, the coastal region and areas with temporary water tables. The method consisted of three steps: (1) Locations with sufficient water table measurements were used as reference time series. Their data were combined with daily precipitation surplus data using time series analysis to derive climate representative water table statistics. The most important statistics derived were the mean highest water table (MHW) defined as the mean value of the three highest water table levels measured biweekly (or semi-monthly) and the <b>mean</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> table (<b>MLW)</b> by using the three <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> table levels. A continuous time series model (PIRFICT) was chosen and implemented, using the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as driver variables. (2) The data derived from these reference time series were combined with data from shorter time series. In the case of Dijle, additional series were already existing. In contrast for Kluizen and Damme, 500 locations were visited twice, once during winter and once during summer, when the water table is supposed to be on its highest/lowest respectively. This was used to estimate the MHW and MLW in these locations. (3) Finally these locations were used to create areawide predictions. Two major methods were used: remapping and relabeling methods. Relabeling methods use the old soil drainage class map and apply new attributes to the existing polygons without changing their borders. Remapping uses ancillary maps as a basis: from the digital elevation model relevant properties like slope and wetness index were derived and combined with other properties such as the horizontal and vertical distance to channels. To map MHW, MLW and drainage class, point measurements and these ancillary maps were used in a regression kriging approach. All methods proved to be superior to estimates using only the old soil drainage class maps. Nevertheless, the timing of measurements was important, and a large number of summer measurements taken in Damme during an unusually dry summmer could not be used in the further analysis, leading to much higher uncertainties associated with these maps. Apart from testing the updating methodologies in different study areas, a second subject was an evaluation of the predictive quality of the current drainage class map in different parts of Flanders. This predictive quality was evaluated by combining data from networks with good spatial but poor temporal coverage with data from networks with better temporal but poor spatial coverage. Point predictions for MHW and MLW were derived by applying time series modelling (in networks with a good temporal coverage) and by using total least squares regression (to expand to the other sites). The resulting MHW and MLW point data set was used to evaluate the currency of the existing map and to identify regional differences. The quality of the current map is moderate, and large differences occur between regions. Especially the Campine region shows large and systematic differences, whereas the southeastern hills and chalk-loam region are relatively accurate. If more weight is given to errors in the wetter drainage classes, about 50 % of the area of Flanders would benefit from remapping...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many open-water {{habitats}} {{that provide}} Essential Fish Habitat functions are also {{thought to be}} particularly susceptible to dredging project impacts. Evidence exists, however, that placement of dredged material in open-water sites can result in viable — even enhanced — habitat attributes and functions for fish and shellfish. For example, offshore disposal sites are often used extensively as recreational fishing areas. Dredged material {{can also be used}} to restore degraded fish habitat, such as to fill artificial pits, holes, and depressions that are scattered throughout a majority of estuaries and coastal embayments. Concerns have been voiced that pits periodically or chronically have poor water quality conditions and consequently represent degraded fish habitat. Several borrow pits in estuarine waters of New Jersey have been documented to experience low dissolved oxygen and high hydrogen sulfide concentrations, particularly during summer months. A major contributing factor to potentially poor water quality in dredged holes is hypoxia or anoxia resulting from accumulation of organic material, poor tidal flushing, and water column stratification. In 2005, the Philadelphia District of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers partially filled a dredged hole in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey with 125, 000 cubic yards of clean, sandy dredged material to raise the bottom from- 11. 6 m <b>Mean</b> <b>Low</b> <b>Water</b> (<b>MLW)</b> to an elevation of- 5. 5 m MLW. For monitoring purposes a nearby dredged pit served as an unrestored control.

40|$|Three {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} using space shuttle imagery to explain the dynamics behavior of internal waves in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and to derive tide-related parameters for Delaware Bay. By interpreting space shuttle photographs taken during mission STS- 40, a total of 34 internal wave packets on the continental shelf of the Middle Atlantic Bight have been recognized. Using the finite-depth theory we derived that the maximum amplitude of solitons is 5. 6 m, the phase speed 0. 42 m/s, and the period 23. 8 min. Deep-ocean internal waves in the western equatorial Indian Ocean on photographs taken during mission STS- 44 were also interpreted and analyzed. The internal waves occurred {{in the form of a}} multisoliton packet in which there are about a dozen solitons. The average wavelength of the solitons is 1. 8 +/- 0. 5 km. The crest lines are mostly straight and reach as long as 100 km. The distance between two adjacent packets is about 66 km. Using the deepwater soliton theory, we derived that the mean amplitude of the solitons is 25 m, the nonlinear phase speed 1. 7 m/s, and the average period 18 min. For both cases, the semidiural tides are the principal generating mechanism. The tide-related parameters of Delaware Bay were derived from space shuttle time-series photographs taken during mission STS- 40. The water area in the bay were measured from interpretation maps of the photographs. The corresponding tidal levels were calculated using the exposure time. From these data, an approximate function relating the water area to the tidal level at a reference point was determined. Then, the water areas of the Delaware Bay at mean high water (MHW) and <b>mean</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MLW),</b> below 0 m, for the tidal zone, and the tidal flux were inferred.

However, Macoma balthica from 1. 0 m above <b>mean</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MLW)</b> grew faster {{than those from}} MLW in Churchill (Hudson Bay). This anomaly {{was the focus of}} this study. The first objective was to determine if this phenomenon is widespread or localised. Results showed that the 2 ̆ 2 Churchill phenomenon 2 ̆ 2 was not present along the St. Lawrence River and the Bay of Fundy and was confined to sites along the coast of Hudson Bay east of Churchill to Cape Henrietta Marie on James Bay.;The second objective was {{to examine the effects of}} biotic and abiotic environmental factors on the growth rate and physiological responses of the Churchill clams. High tide Macoma were more heavily parasitized and grew faster than low tide ones and crawlers (more parasitized) grew faster than the buried (less parasitized) clams. Parasitic castration resulting in enhanced growth could be an explanation for these observations.;Results from transplant studies showed that Macoma transplanted from MLW to 1. 0 m above MLW grew at a rate similar to that of the high tide 2 ̆ 2 residents 2 ̆ 2, indicating that the phenomenon is probably influenced by local environmental conditions at the two tide levels rather than by genotypic differences. No positive correlation was detected between growth rate and degree of heterozygosity (scored for the enzymes PGM, PGI, MDH and LAP) in the clams from either tide level.;The Qdollarlcub 10 rcubdollar of Macoma from both tide levels was 1. 5, indicating a moderately temperature-dependent metabolism. Weight-standardized oxygen uptake was inversely related to the size of Macoma. Low tide Macoma consumed more oxygen than high tide clams. This implies that high tide clams have greater metabolic efficiency: this energy 2 ̆ 2 saved 2 ̆ 2 may be used to further enhance their growth.;Contrary to expectations, low tide clams were able to withstand cold stress better than high tide clams in the laboratory. Low tide Macoma burrowed deeper into the substratum than high tide ones.

40|$|The River Scheldt {{currently}} has a macrotidal estuary with a tidal reach of 160 km. It covers a complete salinity gradient with a polyhaline, mesohaline and oligohaline zone {{and a fresh}} water part with long and short retention time of chloride. The estuary and its tidal tributaries Durme and Rupel have been heavily influenced by anthropogenic pressures such as land reclamation, harbour expansion, dredging activities, embankments and urbanisation. A good understanding {{of the impact of}} human interventions on the ecological functioning of the estuarine ecosystem is required. Based on this knowledge appropriate compensation or mitigation measures can be taken in response or anticipation to future negative effects of anthropogenic changes and relative sea level rise. In this study, all available data on tidal regime (1850 - 2000), bathymetric charts (1930, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000) historical maps {{from the beginning of the}} 19 th century onwards and aerial photographs from 1944 onwards were compiled and analysed for the Zeeschelde (Belgian part of the Scheldt estuary) and the tidal tributary river sections. The report deals with three main issues:(1) Ecological changes during the past century are analysed using a hierarchical ecotope approach. The evolution of the acreage of the distinguished physiotopes (physically characterised units) andecotopes such as shallow waters, tidal mudflats and marshes are analysed for each salinity zone or river section;(2) Changes in hydrodynamic and morphological parameters are analysed over the past century;(3) An overview of anthropogenic interventions and natural changes with potential effects onhabitat acreage and quality in the Zeeschelde and its tidal tributaries in the past two centuries. Thenature of the interventions is very diverse: reclamations, diking, land use change, infrastructureworks, dredging activities, canalisations, discharge manipulations and changes in river dynamics. Changes in tidal regimeBecause tidal regime is a key factor in an estuarine ecosystem, we analysed the characteristics ofthe ten year mean high water (MHW), <b>mean</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (<b>MLW),</b> tidal asymmetry and the tidalamplitude. Temporal and spatial patterns of these parameters are examined within differentsalinity zones in the Scheldt, the Durme and the Rupel. MHW shows a gradual increase in the whole Scheldt estuary. The highest rise is located in the freshwater part with short retention time. Maximum MHW shifted 32 km upstream from Antwerp to Sint-Amands within one century. MLW and tidal asymmetry show a more irregular pattern and are more sensitive to anthropogenicactivities such as dredging and deepening in the navigation channel. MLW dropped in the pastcentury in the harbour zone of the Scheldt between the Dutch-Belgian border and the confluence ofthe Rupel and along the Rupel. In the fresh water zone with long retention time, MLW and tidalasymmetry changed little till 1970 (1 st deepening of the Scheldt). After this period MLW strongly dropped as in most other river sections. MLW and tidal asymmetry in the fresh water zone with short retention time increased between 1900 and 1970 and were presumably affected by river discharge reductions and canalisations. After the 70 ’s MLW and tidal asymmetry decreased again. In the Durme MLW dropped at the confluence, more upstream it rised because of sedimentation in the riverbed. Discharge deviation, damming and channel straighthening played an important role here as well. At the same time tidal asymmetry increased in the whole Durme. MHW and MLW changes resulted in a high increase of tidal amplitude in the Scheldt and Rupel. In the River Scheldt the highest tidal amplitude was recorded at Lillo (62 km to North Sea) around 1890, while in the last ten years the maximum occurs in Temse (98 km to Sea); a shift of 36 km upstream in a bit more than a century. In the Rupel the amplitude increased overall in time but less so in the upstream part. The Durme has an irreg...|$|E
