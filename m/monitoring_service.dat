25|$|Crucial to the {{survival}} of a glacier is its mass balance or surface mass balance (SMB), the difference between accumulation and ablation (sublimation and melting). Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, causing changes in the surface mass balance. Changes in mass balance control a glacier's long-term behavior and are the most sensitive climate indicators on a glacier. From 1980–2012 the mean cumulative mass loss of glaciers reporting mass balance to the World Glacier <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Service</b> is −16 m. This includes 23 consecutive years of negative mass balances.|$|E

25|$|Al Jazeera: Was {{approved}} by the CRTC in 2004 as an optional cable and satellite offering, but {{on the condition that}} any carrier distributing it must edit out any instances of illegal hate speech. Cable companies declared that these restrictions would make it too expensive to carry Al Jazeera. Although no cable company released data as to what such a <b>monitoring</b> <b>service</b> would cost, the end-result was that no cable company elected to carry the station, either, leaving many Arabic-speaking Canadians using free-to-air satellite dishes to watch the station. The Canadian Jewish Congress has expressed its opinion over possible anti-Semitic incitement on this station and that the restrictions on Al Jazeera are appropriate, while the Canadian B'nai Brith is opposed to any approval of Al Jazeera in Canada.

2500|$|Temporal {{changes in}} the spatial {{distribution}} of the mass balance result primarily from changes in accumulation and melt along the surface. As a consequence, variations in the mass of glaciers reflect changes in climate and the energy fluxes at the Earth's surface. [...] The Swiss glaciers Gries in the central Alps and Silvretta in the eastern Alps, have been measured for many years. The distribution of seasonal accumulation and ablation rates are measured in-situ. Traditional field methods are combined with remote sensing techniques to track changes in mass, geometry and the flow behaviour of the two glaciers. These investigations contribute to the Swiss Glacier Monitoring Network and the International network of the World Glacier <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Service</b> (WGMS).|$|E

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>monitoring</b> is an {{important}} part in web service systems, since it aims to ensure that the functions and performance of the service have fulfill the customers' requirements, and detect the potential risks as early as possible. However, monitoring has its costs, which will cause the performance degradation of <b>monitored</b> <b>service</b> system and large resources consumption. If monitoring costs are higher than <b>monitoring</b> benefits, <b>service</b> <b>monitoring</b> will be meaningless. Therefore, it is necessary to balance the monitoring benefits and <b>monitoring</b> costs. Efficient <b>service</b> <b>monitoring</b> means cost-efficiently and time-efficiently of <b>service</b> <b>monitoring.</b> In order to maximize the functions of <b>service</b> <b>monitoring,</b> careful study on how to improve the efficiency of <b>service</b> <b>monitoring</b> is required. This thesis mainly presents a taxonomy of different approaches of <b>service</b> <b>monitoring.</b> It covers several existing optimization approaches, and describes them by giving examples. Since there are two main factors that will add monitoring costs, large amount of monitored objects and inappropriate monitoring approaches, this thesis makes comparisons among different monitoring technologies. They can provide options on selecting the appropriate monitored objects and monitoring approaches to save monitoring costs. Finally, this thesis describes some limitations of optimization approaches, and discusses possible extensions on improving the efficiency of <b>service</b> <b>monitoring.</b> ACM Computing Classification System (CSS) : Applied computing → Enterprise computing → Business process management →Business process monitorin...|$|R

2500|$|Since Einstein rarely defended {{himself against}} these attacks, this task was {{undertaken}} by other relativity theoreticians, who (according to Hentschel) formed {{some sort of}} [...] "defensive belt" [...] around Einstein. Some representatives were Max von Laue, Max Born, etc. and on popular-scientific and philosophical level Hans Reichenbach, André Metz etc., who led many discussions with critics in semi-popular journals and newspapers. However, most of these discussions failed from the start. Physicists like Gehrcke, some philosophers, and the [...] "free researchers" [...] were so obsessed with their own ideas and prejudices that {{they were unable to}} grasp the basics of relativity; consequently, the participants of the discussions were talking past each other. In fact, the theory that was criticized by them was not relativity at all, but rather a caricature of it. The [...] "free researchers" [...] were mostly ignored by the scientific community, but also, in time, respected physicists such as Lenard and Gehrcke found themselves in a position outside the scientific community. However, the critics didn't believe that this was due to their incorrect theories, but rather due to a conspiracy of the relativistic physicists (and in the 1920s & 1930s of the Jews as well), which allegedly tried to put down the critics, and to preserve and improve their own positions within the academic world. For example, Gehrcke (1920/24) held that the propagation of relativity is a product of some sort of mass suggestion. Therefore, he instructed a media <b>monitoring</b> <b>service</b> to collect over 5000 newspaper clippings which were related to relativity, and published his findings in a book. However, Gehrcke's claims were rejected, because the simple existence of the [...] "relativity hype" [...] says nothing about the validity of the theory, and thus it cannot used for or against relativity.|$|E
