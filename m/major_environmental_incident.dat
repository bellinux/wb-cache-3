40|$|Context: Epidemiological {{preparedness}} {{is vital}} in providing relevant, transparent, and timely intelligence for the management, mitigation, {{and prevention of}} public health impacts following <b>major</b> <b>environmental</b> health <b>incidents.</b> A register {{is a set of}} records containing systematically collected, standardized data about individual people. Planning for a register of people affected by or exposed to an incident is one of the evolving tools in the public health preparedness and response arsenal. Objective: We compared and contrasted the instigation and design of health registers in the epidemiological response to <b>major</b> <b>environmental</b> health <b>incidents</b> in England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States. Design: Consultation with experts from the 5 nations, supplemented with a review of gray and peer-reviewed scientific literature to identify examples where registers have been used. Setting: Populations affected by or at risk from <b>major</b> <b>environmental</b> health <b>incidents</b> in England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States. Methods: Nations were compared with respect to the (1) types of major incidents in their remit for considering a register; (2) arrangements for triggering a register; (3) approaches to design of register; (4) arrangements for register implementation; (5) uses of registers; and (6) examples of follow-up studies. Results: Health registers have {{played a key role in}} the effective public health response to <b>major</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents,</b> including sudden chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear, as well as natural, more prolonged incidents. Value has been demonstrated in the early and rapid deployment of health registers, enabling the capture of a representative population. Conclusion: The decision to establish a health register must ideally be confirmed immediately or soon after the incident using a set of agreed criteria. The establishment of protocols for the instigation, design, and implementation of health registers is recommended as part of preparedness activities. Key stakeholders must be aware of the importance of, and protocols for, establishing a register. Agencies will find value in preparing and implementing registers as part of an effective public health response to <b>major</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents,</b> including sudden chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear incidents, as well as natural, more prolonged incidents.

40|$|The {{development}} of best practice recommendations by the Corporate Governance Council (CGC) of the Australian Stock Exchange in 2003 clearly linked corporate regulators' concerns about good governance {{to the concept}} of corporate social and environmental responsibility. The CGC recommended that one way to demonstrate good governance was to use the annual report to disclose information to all legitimate stakeholders. This paper reports on the quantity and categories of environmental information disclosed in the corporate annual reports of 41 Australian companies across eight industry groups covering the period 1983 - 2003. This time period has seen the importance of good corporate governance practice in relation to environmental protection escalate, as demonstrated by the introduction of separate environmental and sustainability reports, the advent of triple bottom line reporting, changes in environmental legislation and the occurrence of <b>major</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents.</b> The results {{of this study indicate that}} an increasing number of companies are disclosing environmental information, and the relative volume of such information in annual reports is increasing across all categories.

Pollution {{has been a major}} problem in China. The lack of corporate environmental responsibility has not only had negative impacts on the corporate image and its sustainable development, but has also hindered the government’s stated social goals of promoting sustainable ecological development and building a “beautiful China”. This paper will briefly review the development of contemporary environmental responsibility accounting in China. It will provide an analysis of the accounting system and provide possible solutions for enhancing application of environmental accountability in China...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{problems}} {{are becoming increasingly}} severe in China with industrial discharges and household sewages being the main sources of water pollution in the country. For example, {{in the case of}} Taihu Lake, {{more than half of the}} total phosphorus in the lake comes from household sewage. While industrial pollution can be treated through technology innovation and controlled by environmental regulations and laws, decreasing household sewage relies entirely on residents. Raising public environmental awareness therefore is essential for ensuring effective environmental improvement and protection. A quantitative assessment of public awareness can inform policy and decision makers; however, not many such studies have been conducted. Changes in the awareness levels in response to a <b>major</b> <b>environmental</b> pollution <b>incident</b> are of particular interest because of the people’s first-hand experience of the triggered consequences. The present paper establishes a system of indicators for the assessment of public environmental awareness. Combined with a fuzzy matter-element analysis method, a model is set-up to quantitatively assess the public environmental awareness. The model is then applied to assess the environmental awareness of the residents of Wuxi City after its major lake Taihu suffered a severe algae bloom in 2007. This study examines whether this serious <b>environmental</b> <b>incident</b> affected people’s <b>environmental</b> awareness and to what degree. The findings show that the matter-element model is capable to resolve well the fuzziness of the ranking affiliation and classification of subjective perceptions, such as public environmental awareness. They show that this <b>environmental</b> <b>incident</b> has had significant positive impacts on the environmental awareness of Wuxi residents. The paper concludes with recommendations related to raising public environmental awareness...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to analyze the oil spill pattern from various types of {{incidents}} and contaminants to determine the extent that incident data {{can be used as a}} baseline to prevent hazardous material releases and improve response activities at a state level. This study addresses the importance of collecting and sharing oil spill incidents as well as analytics using the data. Temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal analysis techniques are employed for the oil-spill related <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents</b> observed in the state of North Dakota, United States of America, from 2000 to 2014, as a result of the oil boom. Specifically, spatiotemporal methods are used to examine how the patterns of <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents</b> in North Dakota, which vary with the time of day, the day, the month, and the season. Results indicate that there were critical spatial and time variations in the distribution of <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents.</b> Application of spatiotemporal interaction visualization techniques, called comap has the potential to help planners and decision makers formulate policy to mitigate the risks associated with <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents,</b> improve safety, and allocate resources...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{environmental}} disclosure initiatives of Niko Resources Ltd – a Canada-based multinational oil and gas company – following the two <b>major</b> <b>environmental</b> blowouts at a gas field in Bangladesh in 2005. As part of the examination, the authors particularly focus on whether Niko’s disclosure strategy was associated with public concern pertaining to the blowouts. Design/methodology/approach – The authors reviewed news articles about Niko’s <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents</b> in Bangladesh and Niko’s communication media, including annual reports, press releases and stand-alone social responsibility report over the period 2004 - 2007, to understand whether news media attention as proxy for public concern has an impact on Niko’s disclosure practices in relation to the affected local community in Bangladesh. Findings – The findings show that Niko did not provide any non-financial environmental information within its annual reports and press releases as a part of its responsibility to the local community which was affected by the blowouts, but it did produce a stand-alone report to address the issue. However, financial environmental disclosures, such as the environmental contingent liability disclosure, were adequately provided through annual reports to meet the regulatory requirements concerning environmental persecutions. The findings also suggest that Niko’s non-financial disclosure within a stand-alone report was associated with the public pressures as measured by negative media coverage towards the Niko blowouts. Research limitations/implications – This paper concludes that the motive for Niko’s non-financial environmental disclosure, via a stand-alone report, reflected survival considerations: the company’s reaction did not suggest any real attempt to hold broader accountability for its activities in a developing country. Originality/value – This is the first known paper that investigates a multinational company’s disclosure behavior in relation to <b>environmental</b> <b>incidents</b> which occurred in a local community. <br /...|$|R
