500|$|In a 2014 interview, Jack {{said that}} Meg's lack of {{enthusiasm for the}} project contributed to the band's breakup. White told Rolling Stone that [...] "she viewed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> of 'Oh, big deal, you did it, so what?' Almost every single moment of The White Stripes was like that. We'd be working {{in the studio and}} {{something}} amazing would happen: I'm like, 'Damn, we just broke into a new world right there!' And Meg's sitting in silence." ...|$|E
500|$|Diane Keaton {{has stated}} that Annie Hall was her {{favorite}} role and that the film meant everything to her. When asked if being most associated with the role concerned her as an actress, she replied, [...] "I'm not haunted by Annie Hall. I'm happy to be Annie Hall. If somebody wants to see <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> it's fine by me". Costume designer Ruth Morley, working with Keaton, created a look which had an influence on the fashion world during the late-70s, with women adopting the style: layering oversized, mannish blazers over vests, billowy trousers or long skirts, a man's tie, and boots. The look was {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Annie Hall look". Some sources suggest that Keaton herself was mainly responsible for the look, and Ralph Lauren has often claimed credit, but only one jacket and one tie were purchased from Ralph Lauren for use in the film. Allen recalled that Lauren and Keaton's dress style almost did not end up in the film. [...] "She came in," [...] he recalled in 1992, [...] "and the costume lady on Annie Hall said, 'Tell her not to wear that. She can't wear that. [...] It's so crazy.' And I said, 'Leave her. She's a genius. Let's just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on all eleven counts of the federal indictment. After the verdict, McVeigh tried to calm his mother by saying, [...] "Think of it this way. When I was in the Army, you didn't see me for years. Think of <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> now, like I'm away in the Army again, on an {{assignment}} for the military." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pipes was a firm {{supporter}} of the Vietnam War, and when his fellow students occupied the Harvard administration building to protest it in the 1960s, he sided with the administration. Pipes had previously considered {{himself to be a}} Democrat, but after anti-war George McGovern gained the 1972 Democratic nomination for President, he switched to the Republican Party. Pipes used to accept being described as a [...] "neoconservative", once saying that [...] "others see <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and, you know, maybe I am one of them." [...] However, he explicitly rejected the label in April 2009 due to differences with the neoconservative positions on democracy and Iraq, now considering himself a [...] "plain conservative".|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{drive me}} to despair!" [...] he cried, with a startling abruptness. [...] "Don't look at <b>me</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> now I {{have found it}} out!" ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Touched--embarrassed by this {{unfamiliar}} emotion.] Thanks. It {{sounds good}} to hear someone--talk to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Say, though--if you're so lonely--it's funny--why ain't you ever married again? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't look at <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>way!</b> You {{have n't}} {{advanced}} so rapidly as I {{used to think}} you would; you haven't distinguished yourself so much," [...] she went on, irrelevantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't answer <b>me</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> child; I'm {{not playing}} with you. Tell {{me where you}} were born, and who your father and mother were." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{liked to}} feel her hearty indignation flash out on <b>me</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> We {{see so much}} malice and so little indignation in my profession.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} I say? Hold your jaw, will you, {{and not be}} halloaing at <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>way?</b> I know what I'm a saying of, and what I'm a doing of." ...|$|E
6000|$|Polly obeyed, and did {{even better}} than before, saying, as she looked up, with a laugh, [...] "I 've been through the whole book; so you won't catch <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> Tom." ...|$|E
