40|$|In this paper, we are {{concerned}} with the reliability assessment of redundant <b>multi-channel</b> <b>systems</b> having multiple controllers with overlapping functionality [...] where all controllers are required to respond optimally to the non-faulty controllers so as to ensure or maintain some system properties. In particular, for such redundant systems with small random perturbation, we study the relationships between the exit probabilities with which the state-trajectories exit from a given bounded open domain and the value functions corresponding to a family of stochastic exit-time control problems on the boundary of the given domain. Moreover, as the random perturbation vanishes, such relationships provide useful information concerning the reliability of the redundant <b>multi-channel</b> <b>systems</b> arising from the large deviations problem in connection with the asymptotic estimates of exit probabilities with respect to some portions of the boundary of the given domain. Finally, we briefly comment on the implication of our results on a co-design technique using multi-objective optimization frameworks for evaluating the performance of the redundant <b>multi-channel</b> <b>systems.</b> Comment: 15 page...|$|R

50|$|The Zaslon is a Pulse-Doppler radar with {{a passive}} {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA) antenna and digital signal processing. The antenna {{used by the}} Zaslon is actually a <b>multi-channel</b> <b>system</b> comprising two separate electronically controlled arrays, an X band radar with 1700 emitters and a L band transponder with 64 emitters brought together into a single antenna. The antenna has a diameter of 1.1 meters and is fixed in position with a scanning sector of +/-70 degrees in azimuth and +70/-60 degrees in elevation. The X-band components of the radar uses reciprocal ferrite phase shifters that allow the radar to position beams in around 1.2 ms. This high performance {{is one of the}} big advantages of phased array radars compared with the previous generation of mechanically scanned arrays which take seconds to perform the same functions as a phased array. The detection performance of the Zaslon radar is stated to be 200 km against a target with a Radar cross section (RCS) of 16 m2, the radar can track up to 10 targets while engaging 4 of those at any one time with either R-33 radar guided or R-40, R-60 IR-guided air-to-air missiles.|$|E

40|$|We obtain exact {{analytical}} expressions for {{the electronic}} transport through a <b>multi-channel</b> <b>system,</b> also with an applied magnetic field. The geometrical {{structure of the}} electrodes is found to cause a splitting of the conduction band into many subbands, depending on the number {{and the length of}} the chains and the conductance approaches zero when the chain number is sufficiently large, due to quantum interference. In the presence of a magnetic field a very complicated oscillatory behavior of the conductance is found with a very sensitive dependence on the number of chains and their lengths, in a remarkable distinction from the usual oscillations in two-channel Aharonov-Bohm (AB) rings.

40|$|Traditional sales {{systems have}} been {{disrupted}} by technological developments. In order to  adapt, companies are changing the way they interact with their customers in business-to-business markets. In the last three decades, multi-channel strategies have spurred the proliferation of different sales channels and new ways of managing sales systems. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate what should be considered when managing <b>multi-channel</b> sales <b>systems</b> with the objective of increasing sales efficiency. The study has investigated current utilisation of <b>multi-channel</b> sales <b>systems</b> {{in the context of a}} business-to-business setting in industrial companies that are involved in the Swedish automotive industry. <b>Multi-channel</b> sales <b>systems</b> can be utilised to achieve many different objectives. However, this research pays specific attention on how to improve sales efficiency by utilising <b>multi-channel</b> sales <b>systems</b> in the context of a business-to-business setting. The research employed an explorative case study, where semi-structured and structured interviews were conducted at a case company and at companies that are first or second tier suppliers in the Swedish automotive industry. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. The empirical findings indicate that the most prevalent measure for increasing sales efficiency is to prioritise and allocate customers based on economic attractiveness. Furthermore, the key issues that impede sales efficiency in <b>multi-channels</b> sales <b>system</b> are misaligned sales activities, deficient prioritisation procedures, insufficient promotion of customer value and inadequate focus on customers. The findings highlight key areas to address and may provide guidelines for the design and management of <b>multi-channel</b> sales <b>systems</b> with the specific purpose of obtaining sales efficiency. The implications of this research are mainly practical and are aimed at supporting sales managers, or individuals in similar positions engaged in <b>multi-channel</b> sales <b>system</b> design and management, in obtaining sales efficiency.

40|$|Recently, the {{behavior}} of customers is changing significantly. Instead of visiting one specific channel of a company to make a purchase, customers are using several channels of different suppliers before making a final purchase. They are switching between these suppliers constantly {{with the aim of}} comparing product details and prices to find the best offer. Customers are combining the advantages of the different channels, offered by different suppliers. However, in order to increase customer loyalty and value, companies {{have to find a way}} to bond customers to their brand. A multi-channel strategy is trying to build long term customer relationships and to increase customer loyalty. By integrating the different channels, instead of running each channel individually, companies can create an additional value for customers. The channel integration is initiated by offering multichannel services, which are connecting online and offline channels to merge them together. These services should lead to an increase of customer satisfaction, build loyalty, and create a long-term customer relationship. Schiesser has recognized this trend in customer behavior and the need to implement a multi-channel strategy. Yet, as the distribution channels of Schiesser are not working with common enterprise resource planning systems, information systems and cash register systems, it would be highly expensive and time consuming to create an integrated <b>multi-channel</b> <b>system.</b> The absence of a CRM-System and the resulting lack of information about the customer journey of Schiesser consumers are further serious obstacles in the way of realizing a multi-channel strategy. However, Schiesser faces the alternative of implanting a hybrid <b>multi-channel</b> <b>system,</b> which combines various channels loosely without being based on common systems. Both, the integrated and the hybrid multichannel system are accompanied by advantages and disadvantages for the Schiesser AG. Considering the current situation and the high costs of an integrated <b>multi-channel</b> <b>system,</b> a hybrid <b>multi-channel</b> <b>system</b> appears to be the appropriate choice for Schiesser. This system allows Schiesser to offer services like “Return to Web/Retail”, “Click and Collect”, “Pick up at Retail” and “QR-Code Scans” without investing in common used systems. These services can be offered by adapting internal organizational processes and by training staff in retail stores. This relatively low investment of time and money enables Schiesser to provide a unique selling proposition for their customers, build a relationship and increase customer value. If Schiesser wants to stay competitive, the introduction of a multichannel strategy is essential, as direct competitors like Lascana and Hunkemöller have already implemented multi-channel strategies...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} draw a {{connection}} between the existence of a stationary density function (which corresponds to an equilibrium state in the sense of statistical mechanics) and a set of feedback operators in a <b>multi-channel</b> <b>system</b> that strategically interacts in a game-theoretic framework. In particular, we show that there exists a set of (game-theoretic) equilibrium feedback operators such that the composition of the <b>multi-channel</b> <b>system</b> with this set of equilibrium feedback operators, when described by density functions, will evolve towards an equilibrium state {{in such a way that}} the entropy of the whole system is maximized. As a result of this, we are led to study, by a means of a stationary density function (i. e., a common fixed-point) for a family of Frobenius-Perron operators, how the dynamics of the system together with the equilibrium feedback operators determine the evolution of the density functions, and how this information translates into the maximum entropy behavior of the system. Later, we use such results to examine the resilient behavior of this set of equilibrium feedback operators, when there is a small random perturbation in the system. Comment: 20 Page...|$|E
