25|$|The Cornell University Library is the 11th largest {{academic}} {{library in}} the United States, ranked by {{number of volumes}} held. Organized into 20 divisions, in 2005 it held 7.5million printed volumes in open stacks, 8.2million microfilms and <b>microfiches,</b> {{and a total of}} 440,000 maps, motion pictures, DVDs, sound recordings, and computer files in its collections, in addition to extensive digital resources and the University Archives. It was the first among all U.S. colleges and universities to allow undergraduates to borrow books from its libraries. In 2006, The Princeton Review ranked it as the 11th best college library, and it climbed to 6th best in 2009. The library plays an active role in furthering online archiving of scientific and historical documents. arXiv, an e-print archive created at Los Alamos National Laboratory by Paul Ginsparg, is operated and primarily funded by Cornell as part of the library's services. The archive has changed the way many physicists and mathematicians communicate, making the e-print a viable and popular means of announcing new research.|$|E
