5|$|New {{morphological}} {{features and}} ultimately new species {{are produced by}} variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions.

Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage. The lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} known embryos, from China's Doushantuo Formation, appear just {{a million}} years after the Earth emerged from a global glaciation, suggesting that ice cover and cold oceans may have prevented the emergence of <b>multicellular</b> <b>life.</b> Potentially, complex life may have evolved before these glaciations, and been wiped out. However, the diversity of life in modern Antarctica has sparked disagreement over whether cold temperatures increase or decrease the rate of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} <b>multicellular</b> <b>life</b> were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{major change}} was {{the advent of}} multicellularity. The presence of oxygen allowed eukaryotes and, later, <b>multicellular</b> <b>life</b> to evolve.|$|E

30|$|Importantly too, as a {{condition}} of <b>multicellular</b> eukaryotic <b>life,</b> development remains anchored within cellular terms to the fundamental unicellular form despite any outward macro form [44]. Evolutionary development and the architecture of collaborative multicellular ecologies is therefore continually based on a set of reiterating First Principles of physiology which represent the range of homeostatic responses that cooperating cells can maintain to cope with environmental change, and have been sustained since the inception of the unicellular form of life [13, 44].|$|R
2500|$|In a {{landmark}} paper published in 1982, Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup identified five mass extinctions.

Non-biological forms of contamination have also been considered, including contamination of sensitive deposits (such as lunar polar ice deposits) of scientific interest by rocket exhausts.

25|$|Those {{who think}} that {{intelligent}} extraterrestrial life is (nearly) impossible argue that the conditions needed {{for the evolution of}} life—or at least the evolution of biological complexity—are rare or even unique to Earth.

40|$|There were {{multiple}} prerequisites to {{the evolution}} of <b>multicellular</b> animal <b>life,</b> including the generation of multiple cell fates ("cellular diversity") and their patterned spatial arrangement ("spatial form"). Wnt proteins operate as primordial symmetry-breaking signals. By virtue of their short-range nature and their capacity to activate both lineage-specifying and cell-polarizing intracellular signaling cascades, Wnts can polarize cells at their site of contact, orienting the axis of cell division while simultaneously programming daughter cells to adopt diverging fates in a spatially stereotyped way. By coupling cell fate to position, symmetry-breaking Wnt signals were pivotal in constructing the metazoan body by generating cellular diversity and spatial form...|$|R
40|$|Biofilms are sessile {{communities}} of microorganisms growing on material surfaces and embedded in self-accumulated extracellular polymers. A comprehensive analysis of physical, {{chemical and biological}} factors including hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions that regulate their formation is required to adequately gain insight to this complex <b>multicellular</b> microbial <b>life</b> style. Reproducible experimental models that consider all {{the conditions under which}} they grow and develop also remain a required tool for studying the biofilms. As a result of its ability to create hydrodynamic and nutrient conditions coupled with continuous and non-destructive ability to grow biofilms, flow cell technology {{has become one of the}} most recently patronised models used to study microbial biofilms.

25|$|A {{number of}} authors have {{questioned}} the assumption that cancers result from sequential random mutations as oversimplistic, suggesting instead that cancer results from {{a failure of the}} body to inhibit an innate, programmed proliferative tendency. A related theory developed by astrobiologists suggests that cancer is an atavism, an evolutionary throwback to an earlier form of <b>multicellular</b> <b>life.</b> The genes responsible for uncontrolled cell growth and cooperation between cancer cells are very similar to those that enabled the first <b>multicellular</b> <b>life</b> forms to group together and flourish. These genes still exist within the genome of more complex metazoans, such as humans, although more recently evolved genes keep them in check. When the newer controlling genes fail for whatever reason, the cell can revert to its more primitive programming and reproduce out of control. The theory is an alternative to the notion that cancers begin with rogue cells that undergo evolution within the body. Instead they possess a fixed number of primitive genes that are progressively activated, giving them finite variability. Another evolutionary theory puts the roots of cancer back to the origin of the eukarote (nucleated) cell by massive horizontal gene transfer, when the genomes of infecting viruses were cleaved (and thereby attenuated) by the host, but their fragments integrated into the host genome as immune protection. Cancer now originates when a rare somatic mutation recombines such fragments into a functional driver of cell proliferation.|$|E
25|$|The Rare Earth {{hypothesis}} {{argues that}} complex and intelligent life is uncommon {{and that the}} CHZ {{is one of many}} critical factors. According to Ward & Brownlee (2004) and others, not only is a CHZ orbit and surface water a primary requirement to sustain life but a requirement to support the secondary conditions required for <b>multicellular</b> <b>life</b> to emerge and evolve. The secondary habitability factors are both geological (the role of surface water in sustaining necessary plate tectonics) and biochemical (the role of radiant energy in supporting photosynthesis for necessary atmospheric oxygenation). But others, such as Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen in their 2002 book Evolving the Alien argue that complex intelligent life may arise outside the CHZ. Intelligent life outside the CHZ may have evolved in subsurface environments, from alternative biochemistries or even from nuclear reactions.|$|E
40|$|Consciousness {{occurs when}} one {{is in a state}} of {{awareness}} of one’s self and the external environment. Quantum consciousness is computed within the cytoskeleton of the cells; basic units of life which comprise of unicellular and <b>multicellular</b> animal <b>life.</b> Consciousness has always been linked to the nervous system but there are several studies that have recorded conscious behaviors in animals with and without nerve cells. Animal behavior is represented as conscious moment, which occurs due to an event, which may be intentional or unintentional. The existence of consciousness in animals can be based on the exhibited behaviors and its comparison to multifaceted conscious behaviors observed in higher beings; which is driven by protein conformational changes within the cytoskeleton network of cells, performed within the domains of space time geometry...|$|R
40|$|E-Cadherin and b-catenin are {{the best}} studied representatives of the superfamilies of transmembrane cadherins and {{intracellular}} armadillo catenins, respectively. However, in over 600 million years of multicellular animal evolution, these two superfamilies have diversified remarkably both structurally and functionally. Although their basic building blocks, respectively, the cadherin repeat domain and the armadillo repeat domain, predate metazoans, the specific and complex domain compositions of the different family members and their functional roles in cell adhesion and signaling appear to be key features {{for the emergence of}} <b>multicellular</b> animal <b>life.</b> Basal animals such as placozoans and sponges have a limited number of distinct cadherins and catenins. The origin of vertebrates, in particular, coincided with a large {{increase in the number of}} cadherins and armadillo proteins, including modern “classical” cadherins, protocadherins, and plakophilins. Also, a-catenins increased. This chapter introduces the many different family members and describes the putative evolutionary relationships between them...|$|R
25|$|There {{is also a}} rival {{hypothesis}} {{which has}} been gaining currency in recent years: that early snowball Earths did not so much affect the evolution of life on Earth as result from it.

The Snowball I episode (of the Huronian glaciation 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's Cryogenian between 580 – 850 million years and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and then the rise of more advanced <b>multicellular</b> animal <b>life</b> and life's colonization of the land.|$|R
25|$|Excluding a few contested {{reports of}} much older forms from North America and India, the first complex <b>multicellular</b> <b>life</b> forms {{seem to have}} {{appeared}} at roughly 1500 Ma, in the Neoproterozoic era of the Proterozoic eon. The oldest fossil evidence from that era of such complex life comes from the Lantian formation of the Ediacarian period, at least 580 million years ago. A very diverse collection of soft-bodied forms is found {{in a variety of}} locations worldwide and date to between 635 and 542 Ma. These are referred to as Ediacaran or Vendian biota. Hard-shelled creatures appeared toward the end of that time span, marking the beginning of the Phanerozoic era. By the middle of the following Cambrian period, a very diverse fauna is recorded in the Burgess Shale, including some which may represent stem groups of modern taxa. The increase in diversity of lifeforms during the early Cambrian is called the Cambrian explosion of life.|$|E
25|$|On Earth, several complex <b>multicellular</b> <b>life</b> forms (or eukaryotes) {{have been}} {{identified}} {{with the potential to}} survive conditions that might exist outside the conservative habitable zone. Geothermal energy sustains ancient circumvental ecosystems, supporting large complex life forms such as Riftia pachyptila. Similar environments may be found in oceans pressurised beneath solid crusts, such as those of Europa and Enceladus, outside of the habitable zone. Numerous microorganisms have been tested in simulated conditions and in low Earth orbit, including eukaryotes. An animal example is the Milnesium tardigradum, which can withstand extreme temperatures well above the boiling point of water and the cold vacuum of outer space. In addition, the plants Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans have been found to survive in an environment where the atmospheric pressure is far too low for surface liquid water and where the radiant energy is also much lower than that which most plants require to photosynthesize. The fungi Cryomyces antarcticus and Cryomyces minteri are also able to survive and reproduce in Mars-like conditions.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensionally {{preserved}} embryos {{from the}} Precambrian Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation, Weng'an, Guizhou, southern China, have attracted great attention {{as the oldest}} fossil evidence yet found for <b>multicellular</b> animal <b>life</b> on Earth. Many embryos are early cleavage embryos {{and most of them}} yield a limited phylogenetic signal. Here we report the discovery of two Doushantuo embryos that are three-dimensionally preserved and complex. Imaging techniques using propagation phase-contrast based synchrotron radiation microtomography (PPC-SR-μCT) reveal that the organization of cells demonstrates several bilaterian features, including the formation of anterior-posterior, dorso-ventral, and right-left polarities, and cell differentiation. Unexpectedly, our observations show a noticeable difference in organization patterns between the embryos, suggesting that they represent two distinct taxa. These embryos provide further evidence for the presence of bilaterian animals in the Doushantuo biota. Furthermore, these bilaterians had already diverged into distantly related groups at least 40 million years before the Cambrian radiation, indicating that the last common ancestor of the bilaterians lived much earlier than is usually thought...|$|R

40|$|INTEGRAL to {{the study}} of the {{processes}} of neoplasia is the opposite and contrary one of cell differentiation and organisation. A single fertilised ovum contains all the necessary information for growth and maturation to <b>multicellular</b> adult <b>life,</b> and Gurdon (1964) has shown that if the gamete is bisected during the first few divisions after meiosis, the separated parts will develop into complete individuals. Chambers and Chambers (1961) investigated many types of cell before and during cell division, and has opined that before, and during, cell division in both newt and echinoderm egg there is a change in the sol-gel state localised in the equatorial region, and proceeding inwards from the cortex, which contracts in this region to form a furrow, before cleavage. It would, therefore, appear that among simple organisms, which are low in the evolutionary scale, irreversible differentiation does not occur until late in embryonic development and that individual cells maintain their complete potential until a fairly advanced stage in differentiation has been reached.

500|$|Determining where Ediacaran organisms fit in {{the tree}} of life has proven challenging; it is not even {{established}} that they were animals, with suggestions that they were lichens (fungus-alga symbionts), algae, protists known as foraminifera, fungi or microbial colonies, or hypothetical intermediates between plants and animals. The morphology and habit of some taxa (e.g. Funisia dorothea) suggest relationships to Porifera or Cnidaria. Kimberella may show a similarity to molluscs, and other organisms have been thought to possess bilateral symmetry, although this is controversial. Most macroscopic fossils are morphologically distinct from later life-forms: they resemble discs, tubes, mud-filled bags or quilted mattresses. Due to the difficulty of deducing evolutionary relationships among these organisms, some palaeontologists have suggested that these represent completely extinct lineages that do not resemble any living organism. One palaeontologist proposed a separate kingdom level category Vendozoa (now renamed Vendobionta) in the Linnaean hierarchy for the Ediacaran biota. If these enigmatic organisms left no descendants, their strange forms might be seen as [...] a [...] "failed experiment" [...] in <b>multicellular</b> <b>life,</b> with later <b>multicellular</b> <b>life</b> evolving independently from unrelated single-celled organisms.|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} to migrate {{is fundamental to}} <b>multicellular</b> and single-celled <b>life.</b> Apicomplexan parasites, an ancient protozoan clade that includes malaria parasites (Plasmodium) and Toxoplasma, achieve remarkable speeds of directional cell movement.

How this motor functions at a mechanistic level during motility and host cell invasion is a matter of debate. Here, we integrate old and new insights toward refining the current model for the function of this motor with the aim of revitalizing interest in the mechanics of how these deadly pathogens move...|$|R
25|$|Since {{hypotheses}} for {{the origins}} of sex are difficult to test experimentally (outside of Evolutionary computation), most current work {{has focused on the}} maintenance of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction must offer significant fitness advantages to a species because despite the two-fold cost of sex, it dominates among <b>multicellular</b> forms of <b>life,</b> implying that the fitness of offspring produced outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from recombination, where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual replication, where the offspring is identical to the parents. Recombination supplies two fault-tolerance mechanisms at the molecular level: recombinational DNA repair (promoted during meiosis because homologous chromosomes pair at that time) and complementation (also known as heterosis, hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).|$|R
5000|$|A {{sporophyte}} (...) is the diploid multicellular {{stage in}} {{the life cycle of}} a plant or alga.

All land plants, and most <b>multicellular</b> algae, have <b>life</b> cycles in which a multicellular diploid sporophyte phase alternates with a multicellular haploid gametophyte phase. In the seed plants, the Gymnosperms and flowering plants (Angiosperms), the sporophyte phase is more prominent than the gametophyte, and is the familiar green plant with its roots, stem, leaves and cones or flowers. In flowering plants the gametophytes are very reduced in size, and are represented by the pollen and the embryo sac.|$|R
