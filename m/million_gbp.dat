40|$|Background: We {{report the}} first study that {{analyses}} public and philanthropic investments awarded to UK institutions for research related to sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Methods: We systematically searched award data from the major funders for information on all infectious disease research funding awarded in 1997 – 2013. The STI–related projects were identified and categorised by pathogen, disease and type of science along the research pipeline from preclinical to translational research. Findings: We identified 7393 infection–related awards with total investment of GBP 3. 5 billion. Of these, 1238 awards (16. 7 %) covering funding of <b>GBP</b> 719. 1 <b>million</b> (20. 5 %) were for STI research. HIV as an STI received <b>GBP</b> 465 <b>million</b> across 719 studies; non–HIV STIs received <b>GBP</b> 139 <b>million</b> across 378 studies. The Medical Research Council provided greatest investment (<b>GBP</b> 193 <b>million</b> for HIV, <b>GBP</b> 45 <b>million</b> for non–HIV STIs). Preclinical awards totalled <b>GBP</b> 233 <b>million</b> (37. 1 %), whilst translational research received <b>GBP</b> 286 <b>million</b> (39. 7 %). Substantial proportions of HIV investment addressed global health research (<b>GBP</b> 265 <b>million),</b> vaccinology (<b>GBP</b> 110 <b>million)</b> and therapeutics (<b>GBP</b> 202 <b>million).</b> For other STIs, investments focused on diagnostics (<b>GBP</b> 45 <b>million)</b> and global health (<b>GBP</b> 27 <b>million).</b> Human Papilloma Virus research received <b>GBP</b> 58 <b>million</b> and chlamydia <b>GBP</b> 24 <b>million.</b> Funding for non–HIV STIs has declined in the three most recent years of this data set. Conclusions: The investment for HIV research awarded to UK institutions correlates with the high global burden, but other STIs are relatively neglected, including gonorrhoea and syphilis. Future STI funding should be better aligned with burden while addressing the emerging risk of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and outbreaks of other pathogens...|$|R

The junction precipitated the construction of Telford Shopping Centre, and the central commercial area, as the exchange was upgraded to allow traffic from the motorway to join and exit in both directions. The Forge to Cluddley section, from junction 5 to junction 7, opened to traffic in December 1975. The Hilton Park to Forge section, from the M6 to junction 5, opened in November 1983.

25|$|Although Hitler {{originally}} wrote Mein Kampf {{mostly for}} {{the followers of}} National Socialism, it grew in popularity after he rose to power. (Two other books written by party members, Gottfried Feder's Breaking The Interest Slavery and Alfred Rosenberg's The Myth of the Twentieth Century, have since lapsed into comparative literary obscurity, and no translation of Feder's book from the original German is known.) Hitler had made about 1.2 million Reichsmarks from the income of the book by 1933, when the average annual income of a teacher was about 4,800 Marks. He accumulated a tax debt of 405,500 Reichsmark (very roughly in 2015 1.1 <b>million</b> <b>GBP,</b> 1.4 million EUR, 1.5 million USD) {{from the sale of}} about 240,000 copies before he became chancellor in 1933 (at which time his debt was waived).|$|E
25|$|Williamson's heirs {{sold the}} mine for about £4 <b>million</b> <b>GBP</b> to an equal {{partnership}} between De Beers and the colonial government of Tanganyika on August 13, 1958. In 1971, {{a decade after}} Tanzania's independence, the government nationalized the mine. Although details are unknown, De Beers and other diamond industry players speculate that mine performance deteriorated significantly in the 1980s under government management. Suspected causes of this are a decrease in ore grade as the mine's richer deposits were worked out, loss of skilled foreign management and engineering staff, a bloated labor force resulting from government employment efforts, and inadequate capital investment in the mine's equipment. Perhaps {{as a result of}} this poor performance, Tanzania invited De Beers to purchase back into the mine, which the company did. In 1994 De Beers bought 75% of the Williamson mine, with Tanzania retaining the remaining shares.|$|E

The commission found that Majola had breached the South African Companies Act at least four times and recommended that both the SCA and the South African Revenue Service should consider taking further action. The commission also recommended a restructuring of CSA's structure.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Maxwell's death while {{cruising}} on the Canary Islands in 1990 shone {{a spotlight}} on his company's affairs. A series of risky acquisitions in the mid-eighties had led Maxwell Communications into high debts, which was being financed by diverting resources from the pension funds of his companies. After his disappearance, it emerged that the Mirror Group's debts (one of Maxwell's companies) vastly outweighed its assets, while £440 <b>millions</b> (<b>GBP)</b> were missing from the company's pension funds. Despite the suspicion of manipulation of the pension schemes, there was a widespread feeling in the City of London that no action was taken by UK or US regulators against the Maxwell Communications Corp. Eventually, in 1992 Maxwell's companies {{filed for bankruptcy protection}} in the UK and US. At around the same time the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) went bust and lost billions of dollars for its depositors, shareholders and employees. Another company, Polly Peck, reported healthy profits one year while declaring bankruptcy the next.Following the raft of governance failures, Sir Adrian Cadbury chaired a committee whose aims were to investigate the British corporate governance system and to suggest improvements to restore investor confidence in the system. The Committee was set up in May 1991 by the Financial Reporting Council, the London Stock Exchange, and the accountancy profession. The report embodied recommendations based on practical experiences and with an eye on the US experience, further elaborated after a process of consultation and widely accepted. The final report was released in December 1992 and then applied to listed companies reporting their accounts after 30th June 1993.|$|R

500|$|The Varlık Vergisi was {{followed}} by the Istanbul pogrom a few years later, where an organized mob attacked Greeks and Armenians on 6–7 September 1955. The material damage was considerable, with damage to 5317 properties (including 4214 homes, 1004 businesses, 73 churches, 2 monasteries, 1 synagogue, and 26 schools). Estimates of the economic cost of the damage range from the Turkish government's estimate of 69.5 million Turkish lira (equivalent to 24.8 million US$), the British estimate of 100 <b>million</b> <b>GBP</b> (about 200 million US$), the World Council of Churches' estimate of 150 million US$, and the Greek government's estimate of 500 million US$.

500|$|In October 1907, the United States {{experienced}} a bank {{run on the}} Knickerbocker Trust Company, forcing the trust to close on October 23, 1907, provoking further reactions. The panic was alleviated when U.S. Secretary of the Treasury George B. Cortelyou and John Pierpont [...] "J.P." [...] Morgan deposited $25 million and $35 million, respectively, into the reserve banks of New York City, enabling withdrawals to be fully covered. The bank run in New York led to a money market crunch which occurred simultaneously as demands for credit heightened from cereal and grain exporters. Since these demands could only be serviced through the purchase of substantial quantities of gold in London, the international markets became exposed to the crisis. The Bank of England had to sustain an artificially high discount lending rate until 1908. To service the flow of gold to the United States, the Bank of England organized a pool from among twenty-four different nations, for which the Banque de France temporarily lent £3 <b>million</b> (<b>GBP,</b> 305.6 million in 2012 GBP) in gold.|$|E

40|$|Several {{countries}} in the world are able to support health research. This capability is dependent upon the economy. One measure of economies that is generally used is the country's gross national product (GNP). Thus, it is of interest to ascertain the GNPs of a few countries.

40|$|This paper focuses upon {{differences}} in the valuation of UK quoted and unquoted companies. It draws on empirical evidence over the period from 1991 to 1997. It commences with {{an overview of the}} published literature. This suggests a broad spectrum of valuation statistics ranging from very minor discounts for non-listed companies relative to their quoted brethren, up to a discount as high as 40 %. The empirical analysis uses PE ratios, derived from the publication Acquisitions Monthly, in respect of non-listed, private companies selling out in takeover deals. These are compared with average PE ratios for quoted companies in Britain. A raw statistic of approximately 40 % was found as the discount for non-listed firms relative to quoted companies. However, this is dramatically different when corrected for size. For size varying from less than <b>GBP</b> 0. 5 <b>million</b> to about <b>GBP</b> 55 <b>million,</b> the discount ranges, respectively, from 16 % to 6 % with an average of around 10 %. Regression equations relating size and PE ratio are presented. Valuation, Quoted Companies, Non-quoted Companies, Discount, Pe Ratios,...|$|R

With {{an investment in}} excess of 30 <b>million</b> <b>GBP,</b> the Boots Advantage Card, launched in 1997, is the largest smart card retail loyalty card scheme in the world, and the third-largest retail loyalty scheme in the UK in terms of cards issued. The Advantage scheme has 16.4 million cardholders using the card online and in store and at 3rd party retailers. [...] The scheme gives a cardholder four points for every pound spent in a Boots store under normal shopping circumstances. [...] Most stores have kiosks {{which can be used}} in conjunction with the cards for [...] "exclusive offers" [...] which are printed on vouchers and can be used at the till. [...] These vouchers enable money off specific purchases, extra points for specific purchases, or money off or extra points when spending has reached an amount specified on the voucher, or other offers such as double points on either everything of specific products. [...] For example, a customer may get a voucher which provides 250 extra points when they have spent £50 in one transaction.
