50|$|Immediately {{after his}} second marriage, Mussolini {{left to the}} {{frontier}} {{to fight in the}} First World War. While he was on service, the Kingdom of Italy regularly paid Dalser a war pension, and when Mussolini was injured by a <b>mortar</b> <b>shot</b> in 1917, she received a visit from the Carabinieri notifying her that her husband was wounded in action.|$|E
25|$|Preparations {{to perform}} a final assault on the fort began on 20 October; siege ladders were distributed, and {{officers}} were told where they would strike the fort. Finally, on 22 October, Peter decided to perform the assault. At one o'clock in the morning, a fire {{broke out in the}} fort. Local hunters and men from the Preobrazhensky Regiment, among others, waited at the ready in landing boats, two miles away from the fort. At half-past two, <b>mortar</b> <b>shots</b> were fired, which was the signal to commence the attack.|$|R
500|$|It is {{not certain}} on what day the Russians began {{shelling}} the fort. Based on reports by Apraksin to Peter and on Peter the Great's journal, Russian artillery opened fire on 1 April. However, Apraksin reported to the czar that he [...] "began bombarding Viborg and the castle on 30 March, and {{on the first day}} 130 bombs were planted, and 90 on the second." [...] Furthermore, Aleksander Myshlayevsky published a [...] "List of how many shots were fired from mortars and cannon at Viborg from 21 March to 9 April, and how many of them hit the city." [...] There, it claims that shelling began on 29 March, when 150 <b>mortar</b> <b>shots</b> and 60 cannon shots were fired. It continues, saying that during the next three days only the mortars were used, firing 100 shots per day. In total, during the first period of the siege, the attackers fired 2,975 <b>shots</b> from <b>mortars</b> and 1,531 from cannon, and the Swedes fired 399 <b>mortar</b> <b>shots</b> and 7,464 cannon shots; thus the Swedish fire outweighed the Russian fire. On 5 April, Apraksin noted that [...] "our cannon are doing little to help us, for they are rather small and light; when we begin firing, the opponent shoots one out of ten." [...] However, the mortars inflicted great damage upon Vyborg and the fort, forcing citizens to find cover in cellars. Despite this, soldiers had to remain positioned on the mounds, and suffered heavy casualties.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 August Salamine {{captured}} {{an unnamed}} French privateer of four guns, six swivel guns, and 56 men. Then {{on the day}} after Christmas, Salamine and the frigate [...] captured the French brig Good Friends, which was carrying a particularly militarily useful cargo of 28 brass long guns, five brass <b>mortars,</b> and <b>shot</b> and shell from Leghorn to Marseilles.|$|R
500|$|Nevertheless, {{the second}} barrage {{of the fort}} began on 1 June; by then, Bergholtz had 13 {{additional}} cannon at his disposal. The barrage lasted until 6 June, {{as a result of}} which [...] "there was made a great breach, that two battalions were lined up on either side to take the city". During those six days, there were a total of 2,975 <b>mortar</b> <b>shots</b> and 1,539 from cannon. The Swedish fired 7,464 shots from cannon and 394 from mortars. Both the first and second barrages had a similar number of shots fired, but the second barrage was a lot more devastating to the Swedish. This was due to several factors; the shots fired during the second bombardment used higher-caliber ammunition and did greater damage per round, and the rate of fire was much more intense. The first bombardment took a month, whereas the second only took six days.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mortar</b> fired a <b>shot</b> {{with a line}} {{attached}} {{from the}} shore to the wrecked ship. It {{was used by the}} Waterguard and later by H M Coastguard for many years.|$|R
5000|$|Coalition belligerent {{soldiers}} in Tal Afar, to January 18, 2005, had been regularly exposed to street attacks most often consisting of small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). <b>Mortars</b> or <b>shots</b> {{fired at the}} 'Combat Outpost' in the Tal Afar Citadel were also reported. To January 18, 2005, the American military SIGACT administration database lists 156 enemy actions of which 103 were [...] "direct fire".|$|R
2500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} {{remarked on}} the game's multiplayer as its strong point. [...] Official Xbox Magazine UK reviewer Ryan King called V8 Arcade [...] "a glorious throwback to a simpler age in gaming." [...] He further applauded the game's online multiplayer, stating {{that it was}} {{some of the best}} that Xbox Live Arcade has to offer players. Cheat Code Central's Jason Lauritzen felt the game was nostalgic. Nate Ahearn of IGN welcomed the game's salvage gameplay mechanic while also praising the online multiplayer. Official Xbox Magazines Mitch Dyer also commented on the strong multiplayer, and added positive remarks on the amount of weaponry and number of firing modes per weapon. [...] TeamXbox's Tom Price noted the game's [...] "big levels, tons of weapon pickups, and crazy opponents" [...] calling them [...] "simple and effective." [...] Reviewer Andrew Hayward of 1UP.com stated the game's predecessors [...] "built a solid foundation for taking the series online" [...] adding that the game as fun when [...] "pounding <b>mortar</b> <b>shots</b> and missiles at some unfortunate foe from afar." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1943 and 1944, {{as part of}} the West Virginia Maneuver Area, the U.S. Army used {{parts of}} the Monongahela National Forest as a {{practice}} artillery and mortar range and maneuver area before troops were sent to Europe to fight in World War II. Artillery and <b>mortar</b> shells <b>shot</b> into the area for practice are still occasionally found there today. Seneca Rocks and other area cliffs were also used for assault climbing instruction. This was the Army's only low-altitude climbing school.|$|R
5000|$|After the war, many {{adjustments}} and additions {{were noted}} and designed, {{the most important}} being that the 60 mm mortar needed to be installed within the hull and engineered for remote firing—a valuable feature that the Israelis had initially encountered on their Centurion Mk3s with their 2" [...] Mk.III <b>mortar.</b> A <b>shot</b> trap was found beneath {{the rear of the}} turret , where a well-placed shot could jam the turret completely. The installation of chain netting to disperse and destroy rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank rockets before impacting the primary armor increased survivability.|$|R
5000|$|Green Archer could {{locate a}} medium mortar {{up to about}} 10 km away and a heavy mortar out to 17 km, the maximum range. It took about 30 seconds from a mortar firing to {{producing}} its location. The radar {{could also be used}} [...] "in reverse" [...] to observe and adjust <b>mortar</b> fall of <b>shot</b> and that of guns firing in high angle. It was also capable of surface observation.|$|R
60|$|At {{a quarter}} to eleven, just as the van of the convoy came to an anchor off the New Mole, Fort San Philip opened fire upon the town and, at the signal, {{the whole of the}} {{batteries}} in the forts and lines followed suit. A hundred and fourteen guns and <b>mortars</b> rained their <b>shot</b> and shell upon the town, and the guns of the batteries of the garrison at once responded.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the last}} of several Republican sieges of the town during 1793. Charles-François Dumouriez was {{attempting}} to invade Holland and had put Francisco de Miranda in command of a Republican force sent to Maastricht. Miranda hoped to take the city in a few days with only 15,000 men and invested it from the Wyck suburb side. The city's governor was Jean Thérèse de Beaumont d'Autichamp, a former cavalry general in the French royal army and his forces were ready for the siege. Miranda wrote demanding that Autichamp surrender, adding that city would capitulate after the tenth bomb fired, despite Miranda only having four 16 pounders and ten <b>mortars</b> and <b>shot</b> which was of the wrong caliber for the mortars.|$|R
5000|$|Then, {{the real}} {{competition}} starts. The jousters {{of the four}} gates (the real protagonists of the event) gallop their horses with lance in rest against the Saracen, an armor-plated dummy representing a Saracen holding a cat-o'-nine-tails in his hand ("Buratto, King of the Indies"). The sequence of charges is drawn on the week preceding the joust during a costume ceremony in Piazza del Comune. It's almost impossible foreseeing what {{the result of the}} joust will be: it depends on the ability, the courage and the good-luck of the eight jousters who alternate on the packed-earth sloping track (the lizza) that runs transversally across Piazza Grande. The competition is won by the couple of knights who hit the Saracen’s shield obtaining the higher scores. The quarter associated to the winning knight receives the coveted golden lance. In the event of a draw between two or more quarters after the standard number of charges (two sets of charges for each jouster), the prize is assigned with one or more deciding charges. At the end of the joust, <b>mortar</b> <b>shots</b> hail the winning quarter. The rules of the tournament are contained in technical regulations that repeat - virtually unchanged - the Chapters for the Buratto Joust dating back to 1677. They are easy to understand, and yet worded {{in such a way as}} to guarantee a long-lasting suspense. The outcome of the fight between the Christian knights and the [...] "Infidel" [...] is undecided until the very last moment due to dramatic turns of events. For instance, jousters may be disqualified if they ride accidentally off the jousting track, or their scores may be doubled if their lance breaks after violently hitting the Saracen.|$|R
2500|$|The next morning, {{the police}} sent a patrol {{to search the}} village of Ljuboten after {{receiving}} intelligence {{that a group of}} three NLA insurgents had moved into the village, after having planted the mines on the road. When the police entered the village, three grenades from a 120mm <b>mortar</b> were <b>shot</b> at them from {{the northern part of the}} village. Then a detachment of the reservist [...] "Lion" [...] police unit was called in as reinforcements, backed by a police TM-170 armoured personnel carrier. According to police witnesses, when the police entered the village, insurgents opened fire on them with automatic rifles from four houses. The police called an army mortar battery not far away from the village for artillery fire to be directed at the four houses in the village. The army mortar unit fired sixty grenades, both 120mm and 80mm, at the four designated targets. According to CNN two helicopter gunships were also called to shell the village, whose hundreds of residents were hiding in basements.|$|R
5000|$|Each Waterguard {{station was}} issued with a Manby mortar, {{which had been}} invented by Captain George William Manby in 1808. The <b>mortar</b> fired a <b>shot</b> with a line {{attached}} from the shore to the wrecked ship and was used for many years. This began the process through which the Coastguard assumed a life saving role. In 1821 a committee of inquiry recommended that responsibility for the Preventative Waterguard {{be transferred to the}} Board of Customs. The Treasury agreed and (in a memorandum dated 15 January 1822) directed that the preventative services, which consisted of the Preventative Water Guard, cruisers, and riding officers should be placed under the authority of the Board of Customs and in future should be named the [...] "Coastguard". In 1845 the Coastguard was subordinated to the Admiralty.|$|R
50|$|HM Coastguard was {{established}} in 1822. In 1809 the Preventative Water Guard {{was established}}, which may {{be regarded as the}} immediate ancestor of HM Coastguard. Its primary objective was to prevent smuggling, but it was also responsible for giving assistance to shipwrecks. For this reason, each Water Guard station was issued with Manby's Mortar (the <b>mortar</b> fired a <b>shot</b> with a line attached from the shore to the wrecked ship and was used for many years). In 1821 a committee of enquiry recommended that responsibility for the Preventative Water Guard should be transferred from HM Treasury to the Board of Customs. The Board of Custom and the Board of Excise each had their own long-established preventative forces: shore-based Riding Officers and sea-going Revenue Cruisers. The committee recommended the consolidation of these various related services. The Treasury agreed, and in a Minute dated 15 January 1822 directed that they be placed under the authority of the Board of Customs and named the Coast Guard.|$|R
40|$|Slabs are {{the most}} costly {{structural}} elements in a building, often accounting for more than 20 % {{of the cost of}} the building. &# 13; Therefore, and as a continuation of previous works on columns and beams, the authors are working on a research project relative to the strengthening of slabs, both massive concrete slabs and those in joist construction form. &# 13; This article presents the results of flexural strengthening carried out by attaching steel mesh to the bottom of joist construction slabs with adhesive <b>mortar</b> or <b>shot</b> concrete. Very good results were obtained, which are hard to explain, if it is taken into account that 85 % of the reinforcement is adhered to the porous concrete filling piedes between ribes which are of no significant strength in the calculation, and only 15 % to the resistant ribs bottoms. Los forjados constituyen el elemento estructural de mayor incidencia económica en el coste de un edificio de plantas, alcanzando porcentajes respecto al valor total del inmueble que superan habitualmente el 20 %. &# 13; Por ello, y continuando trabajos anteriores en torno a pilares y vigas, se está desarrollando por los autores un proyecto de investigación relativo al refuerzo de forjados, tanto en forma de losa maciza como confeccionados a partir de semiviguetas. &# 13; En el presente artículo se exponen los resultados del refuerzo a flexión adhiriendo malla de acero a la parte inferior de los forjados de semiviguetas por medio de mortero adherente u hormigón proyectado.

40|$|Concrete {{structure}} {{are designed}} to be able for providing an optimum service towards influences or forces both from the outside and also from inside of the structure. These influences and forces are the caused, which the structure will result in a failure such as cracking, concrete degradation, and reinforcement corrosion. Concrete cracking are consist of hair cracks and structural cracks. Hair cracks are most likely caused from concrete drying process, while structure cracks are mostly caused by errors on planning and also because of poor implementation. Concrete degradation is the process of reduction in concrete strength, which is increasingly lower than its concrete capacity. Reinforcement corrosion is caused from the process of concrete weathering around the reinforcement, which directly influence the dimension of the reinforcement. To implement concrete structure refinement technology, detection, observation, evaluation, and analysis are required to be done. Wherein the first indication is emphasized on concrete cracking, whether it was a new or old cracks and the type of the cracks. Aside from that concrete weathering also needs to be checked. The instruments used are sound test, rebound hammer, and ultrasonic pulse velocity test. To determine crack width, crack compactor, brittle liquid coating and linear variable differential transformer are used. Here strength of the concrete also needs to be determining by hammer test and core drill system. Concrete structure refinement technology, aside from considering the mean of its improvement, is also highly dependent on the damage. The aims of this technology are to increase the capacity and improve the performance of the structure. Aimed at concrete weathering refinement, the damage part is removed for then replaced with new concrete mixture. The substitute concrete can be from dry packing, <b>mortar,</b> grouting, <b>shot</b> crating, and pre packed concrete. For the active cracks type, the technologies to be used are painting and concrete injection. Similarly if the analysis result is require replacing the reinforcement, replacement should be performed including the possibility of adding concrete reinforcement. ...|$|R
2500|$|... "By sunset on March 9 {{thousands}} of men, women, children started to gather outside {{the walls of}} the Summer Palace." [...] On March 10, 1959, the crowd surrounded the summer palace in response to a rumor that the Chinese communists were planning to arrest the Dalai Lama at a cultural performance in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) camp. The people were determined not to allow the Dalai Lama to leave Norbulingka palace. Some members of the crowd directed aggression at Tibetan officials that were thought to be Chinese collaborators. Tenpa Soepa, who was staying at a house on the night of March 10th near Norbulingka said, [...] "When I arrived at the gate I found Kalon Sampho lying on the ground unconscious." [...] Sampho, [...] "...had arrived at Norbulinka [...] in a car with his Chinese bodyguard. They got out of their car and when the crowd saw the Chinese guard they began throwing stones." [...] "Phakpalha Khenchung ...had been killed by the protestors. He was a government official, and it was rumored that he had a very close relationship with the Chinese." [...] PLA General Tan considered the Dalai Lama to be in danger and offered him refuge if he could make it to the Chinese camp. He declined the offer. A week into the fighting, the general ordered two <b>mortar</b> rounds <b>shot</b> toward the palace. At that point, the Dalai Lama decided {{the time had come to}} slip out over the mountains, with a very small party, arriving a few days later at the Indian border. He was granted asylum by the Nehru government with the stipulation that he would not engage in politics on Indian soil. Meanwhile, Enlai dissolved the Tibetan government and appointed the Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region to take its place. In 1959, Tenpa Soepa and other prisoners of war near Toema in Amdo said, [...] "Along the road we could see why our guards were so jumpy. We saw many burnt-out guardposts and even some tanks that were destroyed by Tibetan guerillas. This was Amdo, where the guerrilla war had gone on for years." ...|$|R
