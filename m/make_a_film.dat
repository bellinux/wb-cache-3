He cited Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Eat Drink Man Woman and Big Night as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.|$|E

5|$|After the {{financial}} backing from Tsui Hark became problematic following {{the release of}} Woo's film A Better Tomorrow 2, Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun Fat's and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming The Killer with a rough draft whose plot {{was influenced by the}} films Le Samouraï, Mean Streets, and Narazumono.

5|$|After {{the success}} of his {{previous}} film The Life of Oharu, Mizoguchi was offered to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> by his old friend Masaichi Nagata at Daiei Film studios.

5|$|Another {{important}} stylistic {{influence was}} the experimental oeuvre of Kenneth Anger, {{and in particular}} Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Noé saw Anger's films in the early 1990s, while promoting the short film Carne, and quickly became a fan. Other influences from experimental cinema included the works of Jordan Belson and Peter Tscherkassky. Noé's favourite film, , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films; Noé {{wanted to become a}} filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven. Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> largely from such a perspective.|$|E

Filming took place over the course of four weeks, and was a challenging process that included over eighty locations.|$|E
5|$|Ideas for a {{film about}} the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were {{proposed}} as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission {{to tell the story}} of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.|$|E

5|$|Swayamvaram marked several debuts—directorial of Gopalakrishnan, acting of the Malayalam star Bharath Gopi, {{and film}} {{producing}} of the Chitralekha Film Cooperative, an organisation cofounded by Gopalakrishnan himself. The film features an original score by M. B. Sreenivasan, camerawork by Mankada Ravi Varma, and film editing by Ramesan. Writer-director K. P. Kumaran co-scripted the film with Gopalakrishnan.
