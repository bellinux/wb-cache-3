40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} climate forcing agents other than carbon dioxide using the <b>MiniCAM</b> integrated assessment model for both no-climatepolicy and policy emissions scenarios. Non-CO 2 greenhouse-gas forcing is dominated by methane and tropospheric ozone. Assumptions about the prevalence of methane recovery and local air pollution controls in the no-policy cases are a critical determinant of methane and ozone-precursor emissions. When these factors are considered, emissions are substantially reduced relative to earlier estimates. This reduces their potential as climate mitigation agents through specific climate policies. Nevertheless, the addition of non-CO 2 greenhouse gas and ozone precursor abatement options significantly reduces mitigation costs {{in the first half}} of the 21 st century (by up to 40 %) compared to the case where only CO 2 abatement options are pursued. While the influences of aerosols are small by the end of the century, there is a significant interaction in the early 21 st century between policies to reduce CO 2 emissions and SO 2 emissions, even in the presence of SO 2 -related pollution control policies. The attendant reduced aerosol cooling can more than offset the reduction in warming that accrues from reduced CO 2. When non-CO 2 gases are included in the policy, the net effect is that global-mean climate change to 2050 is practically unaffected by mitigation policy. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPlug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEVs) {{have the potential}} to be an economic means of reducing direct (or tailpipe) carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from the transportation sector. However, without a climate policy that places a limit on CO 2 emissions from the electric generation sector, the net impact of widespread deployment of PHEVs on overall US CO 2 emissions is not as clear. A comprehensive analysis must consider jointly the transportation and electricity sectors, along with feedbacks {{to the rest of the}} energy system. In this paper, we use the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory <b>MiniCAM</b> model to perform an integrated economic analysis of the penetration of PHEVs and the resulting impact on total US CO 2 emissions. Under the assumptions used in this analysis where PHEVs obtain 50 – 60 % of the market for passenger and light-duty trucks, the ability to deploy PHEVs under the two climate policies modeled here results in 6000 – 7300  Mt CO 2 of additional cost -effective emissions reductions from the US economy over the period 2005 – 2050. The additional demand for geologic CO 2 storage created by the introduction of the PHEVs is approximately equal to the cumulative geologic CO 2 storage demanded by two to three large 1000  MW IGCC+CCS power plants over a 50 -year period.

40|$|Abstract: The {{authors have}} applied the <b>MiniCAM</b> energy-economic model to {{estimate}} the economic costs of strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The primary focus of the paper is a supply-side strategy: the application of low-cost, low-carbon energy production technologies over the next century. Results are summarized for six advanced technology scenarios. The authors also consider {{the economic impact of}} one demand-side strategy: reducing emissions by improving energy end-use intensity in transition economies over the next 20 - 30 years. This strategy is represented by one scenario of economic rationalization and reform in the formerly-planned economies. The findings indicated that even with relatively low rates of market penetration, new energy supply technologies could result in a dramatic reduction in mitigation costs. For example, when advanced biomass technologies reached even 25 percent of the global energy supply market, total discounted mitigation costs to 2100 fell from $ 2. 2 trillion to $ 790 billion. When these technologies were deployed in conjunction with an emissions stabilization path that allowed for a later onset in reductions, costs fell to $ 207 billion. 1 The results have important implications for both the models and the policies that they inform. First, findings suggest that technology can generate cost savings in both the United States and formerly planned economies in Eastern Europe and the New Independent States. These cost savings increase with the effectiveness and level of penetration of the advanced energy technologies, a relationship that holds across emissions paths and levels of stabilization. Second, the finding suggest that previous macroeconomic modeling efforts have overestimated the costs generated by the inefficient formerly planned economies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{large-scale}} {{integration of}} PV solar energy onto the electricity grid remains {{a major challenge}} because of the intermittency issues which affect the grid reliability. In this thesis, we investigate the impact of grid integration issues upon the optimal energy R 2 ̆ 6 D portfolio for climate change under damage uncertainty. We especially {{look at how the}} following two contrasting assumptions about solar intermittency issues will impact the composition of the optimal energy R 2 ̆ 6 D technology portfolio for climate change. The first assumption, which we term “costly solar storage”, implies that grid integration will have costs; the second assumption, which we term “free solar storage”, implies that grid integration will have no costs. To achieve this task, we first present a two-stage stochastic programming model for energy R 2 ̆ 6 D portfolio for climate change and the solution methods used to solve it. We will refer to this model as the budget constraint model (BCM model). Then, we will introduce a relaxation of the BCM model by including the R 2 ̆ 6 D budget as a cost in the objective function. We will call this the overall optimal model (OOM model). In order to represent the impacts of technical change, we will use the Mini-Climate Assessment Model (<b>MiniCAM)</b> to generate marginal abatement cost curves (MAC), which represent the cost of reducing an additional ton of CO 2. Two sets of MAC curves based on the two assumptions are generated and used in our models to estimate the impacts of grid issues on the optimal R 2 ̆ 6 D portfolios for climate change. The results of our analysis using the BCM model show that the composition of the optimal portfolio remains almost the same under the two grid assumptions. However, the results of the OOM model show some {{significant differences between the two}} assumptions, with considerably more solar R 2 ̆ 6 D investment when intermittency issues are neglected. Our estimates of the costs of the grid range between 2. 5 billion and 21 billion dollars...|$|E

The overall objective of this collaborative project between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was to unite the latest advances in carbon cycle research with scientifically based models and policy-related integrated assessment tools that incorporate computationally efficient representations of the latest knowledge concerning science and emission trajectories, and their policy implications. As part of this research we accomplished the following tasks that we originally proposed: (1) In coordination with LLNL and ORNL, we enhanced the Integrated Science Assessment Model's (ISAM) parametric representation {{of the ocean and}} terrestrial carbon cycles that better represent spatial and seasonal variations, which are important to study the mechanisms that influence carbon sequestration in the ocean and terrestrial ecosystems; (2) Using the <b>MiniCAM</b> modeling capability, we revised the SRES (IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios; IPCC, 2000) land use emission scenarios; and (3) On the application front, the enhanced version of ISAM modeling capability is applied to understand how short- and long-term natural carbon fluxes, carbon sequestration, and human emissions contribute to the net global emissions (concentrations) trajectories required to reach various concentration (emission) targets. Under this grant, 21 research publications were produced. In addition, this grant supported a number of graduate and undergraduate students whose fundamental research was to learn a disciplinary field in climate change (e. g., ecological dynamics and ocean circulations) and then complete research on how this field could be linked to the other factors we need to consider in its dynamics (e. g., land use, ocean and terrestrial carbon sequestration and climate change) ...|$|E
40|$|The 5 th IPCC {{assessment}} {{will employ}} new integrated climate and carbon cycle models (CMs) that, {{for the first}} time, will use gridded scenarios of future land-use activities. In preparation for this assessment, the international modeling community is developing four Representative Concentration Path (RCP) scenarios developed by four Integrated Assessment Modeling teams (IAMs). The RCP scenarios include land-use changes and {{will be used as}} input to CMs. However, the diversity of approaches and requirements among IAMs and CMs for tracking land-use change, along with the dependence of model projections on land-use history, presents a challenge for effectively passing data between these communities and for smoothly transitioning from the historical estimates to future projections. Our goal is to bridge the two communities by developing a harmonized set of land-use scenarios that smoothly connects historical reconstructions of land- use with future projections, in the format required by CMs. We compute consistent global gridded maps of land-use activities and recovering lands as well as the underlying land-use transitions including the effects of wood harvest and shifting cultivation. We build upon the method of Hurtt et al. 2006 and use gridded historical maps of crop and pasture data from HYDE 3. 0 1500 - 2000 (Klein Goldewijk, in prep), historical national wood harvest and shifting cultivation estimates from Hurtt et al. 2006, future agricultural and wood harvest data from IAMs (AIM, IMAGE, MESSAGE, and <b>MiniCAM)</b> 2000 - 2100, and future climate and CO 2 data from IAMs. The resulting half degree gridded maps of subgrid-scale land-use and underlying transitions smoothly progress from past to future in a format that can be used as input into CMs. This harmonized set of products will provide the first consistent set of land-use change and emission scenarios in a consistent format for a large community of CMs to enable studies of the effects of gridded land-use changes on the global carbon-climate system...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a scenario}} analysis exploring {{the value of}} advanced technologies in the U. S. buildings, industrial, and transportation sectors in stabilizing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The analysis was conducted by staff members of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), working at the Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) {{in support of the}} strategic planning process of the U. S. Department of Energy (U. S. DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). The conceptual framework for the analysis is an integration of detailed buildings, industrial, and transportation modules into <b>MiniCAM,</b> a global integrated assessment model. The analysis is based on three technology scenarios, which differ in their assumed rates of deployment of new or presently available energy-saving technologies in the end-use sectors. These technology scenarios are explored with no carbon policy, and under two CO 2 stabilization policies, in which an economic price on carbon is applied such that emissions follow prescribed trajectories leading to long-term stabilization of CO 2 at roughly 450 and 550 parts per million by volume (ppmv). The costs of meeting the emissions targets prescribed by these policies are examined, and compared between technology scenarios. Relative to the reference technology scenario, advanced technologies in all three sectors reduce costs by 50 % and 85 % for the 450 and 550 ppmv policies, respectively. The 450 ppmv policy is more stringent and imposes higher costs than the 550 ppmv policy; as a result, the magnitude of the economic value of energy efficiency is four times greater for the 450 ppmv policy than the 550 ppmv policy. While they substantially reduce the costs of meeting emissions requirements, advanced end-use technologies do not lead to greenhouse gas stabilization without a carbon policy. This is due mostly to the effects of increasing service demands over time, the high consumption of fossil fuels in the electricity sector, and the use of unconventional feedstocks in the liquid fuel refining sector. Of the three end-use sectors, advanced transportation technologies have the greatest potential to reduce costs of meeting carbon policy requirements. Services in the buildings and industrial sectors can often be supplied by technologies that consume low-emissions fuels such as biomass or, in policy cases, electricity. Passenger transportation, in contrast, is especially unresponsive to climate policies, as the fuel costs are small compared to the time value of transportation and vehicle capital and operating costs. Delaying the transition from reference to advanced technologies by 15 years increases the costs of meeting 450 ppmv stabilization emissions requirements by 21 %, but the costs are still 39 % lower than the costs assuming reference technology. The report provides {{a detailed description of the}} end-use technology scenarios and provides a thorough analysis of the results. Assumptions are documented in the Appendix...|$|E
