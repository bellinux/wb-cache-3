50|$|Children At Risk has {{proposed}} that the Texas Legislature require schools with student populations of 80% or more living at or below 185% of {{the federal poverty level}} to provide free school breakfast to all interested students. The 80% threshold is useful as it allows school districts to utilize the “severe need’’ designation and receive a higher federal reimbursement rate per student meal. Schools that serve 60% or more of their meals at a free or reduced price are classified as “severe need”. This threshold also allows economies of scale to lower the per-meal cost provided to students, due to the higher volume of <b>meal</b> <b>production</b> and consumption. In the 2010 school year, all “severe need” schools received the following federal reimbursement: $0.26 for each paid breakfast, $1.76 for each free breakfast and $1.46 for each reduced-price breakfast.

50|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} {{similar to}} the body's natural digestive process provides the most efficient breakdown of the proteins into smaller fractions termed peptides which can then {{be separated from the}} oil and non-digested proteins during liquid phase processing. Subsequent steps of solids and oil removal through various mechanical separation techniques are required to create a final fish protein fraction with acceptable organoleptic properties for use in human food. Minimization of odor through the elimination of fat and oil from the protein fraction, as well as separating out the lowest molecular weight protein fractions from the larger fractions all serve to create a refined fish protein. Some processes utilize solvents to extract the fat but these can result in dangerous handling and potential residual issues. The final step in producing the product is typically spray drying, which involves atomizing the liquid protein in a hot air chamber resulting in rapid evaporation of the water and a fine powder falling {{to the bottom of the}} chamber for removal. Spray drying is different from typical oven dehydration used in animal grade fish <b>meal</b> <b>production</b> in that spray drying will not denature the protein fraction resulting in a higher quality protein product for human consumption.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{factors such}} as wages may have {{different}} influences on <b>meal</b> <b>production</b> and consumption times. Previous research has typically investigated only production or consumption time, and has produced mixed results. After developing a stylized model that illustrates how higher wages may reduce <b>meal</b> <b>production</b> time but have ambiguous effects on meal consumption time, I examine these relationships using time diary information from the ATUS supplemented with wage information from the CPS. Using standard and censored regression models, I find that for <b>meal</b> <b>production</b> time, women experience a negative effect from wages on weekdays, as expected, and no effect on weekends. However, men show no weekday effect and a surprising positive effect of wages on weekends, suggesting that men with a high value of weekday time may substitute weekend <b>meal</b> <b>production</b> time for weekday time.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess food service environmental and food safety management systems according to two checklists based on ABNT ISO 22000 and 14001. METHODS: This exploratory and descriptive study investigated a-la-carte food services of the Federal District, Brazil. Two checklists were developed to investigate ISO 14001 and 22000 compliance. A total of 37 food services were selected from the list of the Brazilian Association of Bars and Restaurants by simple random sampling. Checklist results were analyzed according to ANVISA resolution nº 275 / 2002. RESULTS: Only five food services employed dietitians to supervise <b>meal</b> <b>production.</b> These establishments achieved the highest ISO compliance. However, no establishment had more than 50 % ISO 14001 or 22000 compliance.

40|$|Subsidized {{harvest of}} {{invasive}} silver carp Hypopthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp H. nobilis (collectively {{referred to as}} Asian carp) from the Illinois River have been initiated {{in an effort to}} control their populations. However, market-driven control strategies have been suggested in an effort to reduce or eliminate the need for subsidies. Given that Asian carp are not a favored food fish in the U. S. and exporting to Asian markets is currently not economically feasible, industrial applications such as fish <b>meal</b> <b>production</b> have been explored. Fish <b>meal</b> <b>production</b> to support aquafeed manufacturing is potentially a high-value, high-volume market which is essential to a market-driven approach. However, the nutrient composition of Asian carp as a raw material from the Illinois River needs to be evaluated as well as the nutrient digestibility and production performance of a rendered Asian carp fish meal product to fully assess its suitability for use in aquafeeds. To determine the suitability of Asian carp to support aquafeed manufacturing, we evaluated seasonal and geographical differences in Asian carp harvested from the Illinois River, performed standard digestibility trials with hybrid striped bass and rainbow trout, and assessed production performance through standard feeding trials with hybrid striped bass, rainbow trout, and cobia. Results indicate slight geographical and seasonal variation in body composition, though both species represent protein-dense raw materials suitable for fish <b>meal</b> <b>production.</b> Additionally, Asian carp fish meal is a highly digestible feedstuff that closely resembles the nutrient content of traditional menhaden fish meal sources, although it is slightly less digestible. Production performance of fish fed practical Asian carp fish meal based diets was similar to those that used menhaden fish meal. Overall, Asian carp fish meal appears to be a highly-digestible, nutrient-dense ingredient suitable for inclusion in aquafeeds. Therefore, rendering Asian carp into fish meal appears to be a viable market-driven approach to help control Asian carp populations...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in order to investigate the possibility of utilizing hazelnut kernel oil meal (HKOM) in layer diets as a replacement for soybean oil meal (SBM). Two hundred and sixteen brown egg layers raised in contiguous wire cages were used. The duration of the experi-ment was 24 wk consisting of six periods of 4 wk. In the trial, six diets containing different levels of HKOM replacing 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % of SBM protein, respectively, were utilized as the treatments. Differences among the diets in terms of egg yield, feed consumption, feed efficiency ratio, egg weight, egg yolk and albumen ratios, shell thickness, shell weight, and Roche color values of the yolk were not statistically significant (P>. 01). Results indicated that SBM could be replaced totally by HKOM in layer diets. However, replacement of more than 40 % of SBM with HKOM is not recommended.

40|$|The {{demand for}} feed and animal food {{products}} {{is expected to}} rise sharply until 2050. In addition, livestock production plays a role in the overall anthropogenic impact. Thus, valuable protein alternatives such as edible insects are welcome. Edible insects have an excellent protein value, low feed conversion ratio (FCR) and can be massively reared on low-value substrates. Based on the available literature, this paper is aimed at reviewing the environmental performances of insect rearing and drawing the perspectives for future investigations. To date, few papers focused on the environmental impact of insects farming and used the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as standardized methodology. Impacts such as Global Warming Potential (GWP), energy use (EU) and land use (LU) have been estimated for the mealworm <b>meal</b> (MM) <b>production.</b> If compared to some animal food products, the GWP of MM ranges from about a half (pork) to less than a tenth (beef) (Tab. 1), mainly due to the weak climate-relevant emissions of this insect. In addition, the low LU of MM production sounds promising and may be partially explained by the low FCR (2. 2) observed for this species. With the exception of beef and pork, the EU of MM is higher than the literature values for the other animal food products due to the rearing facility climate-conditioning. For feed production, housefly larvae grown on organic wastes (including poultry manure) have been studied. The data were obtained from a commercial-exploited testing site. If compared to literature data on fishmeal (FM), housefly larvae meal (HLM) exhibits a very low impact on climate changes, but is comparable to soybean <b>meal</b> (SBM) <b>production</b> (Table 1). Producing HLM requires less agricultural land than SBM as no dedicated crops are required. The energy demand of HLM production is more than twice the EU for SBM meal, but it is lower than for FM. Even if comparisons between these studies are not easy due to several methodological aspects, edible insects appear more sustainable than other animal products or feedstuffs. However, other environmental indicators (e. g., acidification potential) should be investigated to get a complete understanding of the environmental performance of edible insects as food and feed. The different rearing strategies adopted {{have a significant effect on}} the sustainability of the mealworm and housefly rearing cycles. Studies comparing different insect species and/or different rearing strategies should be undertaken...|$|R
