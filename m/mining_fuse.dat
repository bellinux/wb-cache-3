50|$|He {{received}} his first patent in 1899, for {{a device that}} ignited a photographer's flash. The same year, Cowen received a defense contract from the United States Navy to produce <b>mine</b> <b>fuses</b> that netted him $12,000. The following year, Cowen {{and one of his}} partners founded Lionel Corporation in New York City.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the <b>mine's</b> <b>fuse</b> {{mechanism}} {{was against}} the pillar, meaning that the mine had to be turned {{before it could be}} defused. Some of the water was pumped out and an access hole was cut {{into the side of the}} gas holder. The job of now rendering the mine safe was left to Temporary Lieutenant Harold Newgass.|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of Cowen's {{invention}} was as a fuse to ignite explosive powder to get a photographer's flash. One of the first practical applications, however, for Cowen's flash-lamp was as underwater <b>mine</b> detonator <b>fuses</b> for the U.S. Navy. In 1899, the year the invention was patented, the government awarded Cowen a $12,000 contract for 24,000 naval <b>mine</b> detonator <b>fuses.</b> The use of the flash for photography was dangerous, and photographers could get burned hands from the flash.|$|R
50|$|Strung {{along the}} submarine's {{gunwales}} were two parallel sets of demagnetization cables, {{running from the}} stern to the bow planes. These were intended to dissipate the static charge that normally builds up when a boat's hull slices through the water, causing the steel in the hull to deteriorate over time. They were also meant to protect against magnetic mines, by nullifying the magnetic field which normally triggers the <b>mines</b> <b>fusing</b> system. A similar demagnetizing system was carried on many Japanese surface ships during {{the first part of}} the war, until they were later removed during refitting.|$|R

50|$|Smith {{was the son}} of George Smith of Truro and {{his wife}} Elizabeth Hurral Bickford. He was educated at Saltash and Plymouth. His {{grandfather}} William Bickford had developed a method of making <b>mining</b> <b>fuses</b> using rope which was safer than previous methods and with Smith's father had established a factory at Tuckingmill, Cornwall. Smith became a partner in his father's firm of Bickford, Smith, & Co. and lived near the factory at Camborne. There was another factory at St. Helen's Junction, Lancashire, and Smith was also chairman of Helston Railway. He was also captain in the 15th Cornwall Rifle Volunteers and J.P. for Cornwall. In 1868, he took the additional surname of Bickford, when he inherited the property of his maternal grandfather. Bickford-Smith purchased the Trevarno Estate, at Helston, Cornwall in 1874 and set about developing the gardens.|$|R

The officials travelled along Red Army Street (ulica Armii Czerwonej), the main artery of Zagórze. To honor the guests, local authorities adorned the street and buildings along it with flowers. Edward Jaros had several kilograms of ammonite - explosive used for mining purposes - six hundred detonators, and 24 rings of <b>mining</b> <b>fuses,</b> which he had stolen from a coal mine in Upper Silesia. He placed the bomb on a lime tree, next to a Communist Police station. However, upon seeing crowds of people he hesitated, anticipating that the explosion would cause widespread destruction. Finally, the time bomb constructed by Jaros exploded at 3 pm, two hours before the arrival of the officials. The report of the investigation stated: [...] "In the hours close to the planned arrival of the motorcade, a time bomb, planted on a tree exploded.

Moreover, it introduced its own advanced (although controversial) cluster bomb in the early 1990s and constructed Greek-designed modern wind generators in 2002. In a move reflecting one made almost a hundred years earlier, it merged with EBO in 2004, to eliminate the odd competition between the two companies for state orders, forming EAS.|$|R

6000|$|... "Another {{thing that}} appeals to the sunny humour of the {{trenches}} as a really delicious practical joke is the trick of the fuses. We have two kinds of fuse, a slow-burning fuse such as is used for hand-grenades and such-like things, a sort of yard-a-minute fuse, and a rapid fuse that goes a hundred yards a second--for firing mines and so on. The latter is carefully distinguished from the former by a conspicuous red thread. Also, as you know, it is the habit of the enemy and ourselves when the trenches are near enough, to enliven each other by the casting of homely but effective hand-grenades made out of tins. When a grenade drops in a British trench somebody seizes it instantly and throws it back. To hoist the German with his own petard is particularly sweet to the British mind. When a grenade drops into a German trench everybody runs. (At least that is what I am told happens by the men from our trenches; though possibly each side has its exceptions.) If the bomb explodes, it explodes. If it doesn't, Hans and Fritz presently come creeping back to see what has happened. Sometimes the fuse hasn't caught properly, it has been thrown by a nervous man; or it hasn't burnt properly. Then Hans or Fritz puts in a new fuse and sends it back with loving care. To hoist the Briton with his own petard is particularly sweet to the German mind.... But here it is that military genius comes in. Some gifted spirit on our side procured (probably by larceny) a length of <b>mine</b> <b>fuse,</b> the rapid sort, and spent a laborious day removing the red thread and making it into the likeness of its slow brother. Then bits of it were attached to tin-bombs and shied--unlit of course--into the German trenches. A long but happy pause followed. I can see the chaps holding themselves in. Hans and Fritz were understood to be creeping back, to be examining the unlit fuse, to be applying a light thereunto, in order to restore it to its maker after their custom....|$|R

40|$|The VIREO group {{participated in}} four tasks: {{instance}} search, multimedia event recounting, multimedia event detection, and semantic indexing. In this paper, we will present our approaches {{and discuss the}} evaluation results. Instance Search (INS) : We submitted four runs in total, experimenting three search paradigms for particular objects retrieval: (1) an elastic spatial consistency checking method; (2) a background context weighting strategy; and (3) a re-ranking step based on objects mining. The first two approaches are similar as last year [1], while the last one is our new exploration. Our submissions are all based on BoW model and tailored for the INS task. In particular, we use Delaunay Triangulation (DT) to address the complex spatial transformations for non-planar and non-rigid queries; {{the lack of information}} for small query objects is tackled with context modeling; and object mining augments the results by exploring frequent instances in TV series. - F X NO vireo dt 2 : BoW method + elastic spatial checking via DT. This run corresponds to our paradigm (1), which models elastic spatial structures as deformable graphs. - F X NO vireo dtc 1 : vireo dt + context modeling. This run corresponds to our paradigm (2) by weighting the importance of different features in the query. - F X NO vireo dtm 4 : The <b>mining</b> result is <b>fused</b> with the results by vireo dt via random walk (paradigms (1) + (3)). Links established by our mining algorithm serves as the cues for re-ranking. - F X NO vireo dtcm 3 : The <b>mining</b> result is <b>fused</b> with vireo dtc through random walk (paradigms (2) + (3)). This run uses the ranking list from vireo dtc.

40|$|Visual {{and audio}} {{modalities}} are two symbiotic modalities underlying videos, which contain both common and complementary information. If {{they can be}} <b>mined</b> and <b>fused</b> sufficiently, performances of related video tasks can be significantly enhanced. However, due to the environmental interference or sensor fault, sometimes, only one modality exists while the other is abandoned or missing. By recovering the missing modality from the existing one based on the common information shared {{between them and the}} prior information of the specific modality, great bonus will be gained for various vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CMCGAN) to handle cross-modal visual-audio mutual generation. Specifically, CMCGAN is composed of four kinds of subnetworks: audio-to-visual, visual-to-audio, audio-to-audio and visual-to-visual subnetworks respectively, which are organized in a cycle architecture. CMCGAN has several remarkable advantages. Firstly, CMCGAN unifies visual-audio mutual generation into a common framework by a joint corresponding adversarial loss. Secondly, through introducing a latent vector with Gaussian distribution, CMCGAN can handle dimension and structure asymmetry over visual and audio modalities effectively. Thirdly, CMCGAN can be trained end-to-end to achieve better convenience. Benefiting from CMCGAN, we develop a dynamic multimodal classification network to handle the modality missing problem. Abundant experiments have been conducted and validate that CMCGAN obtains the state-of-the-art cross-modal visual-audio generation results. Furthermore, it is shown that the generated modality achieves comparable effects with those of original modality, which demonstrates the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed method.

40|$|FPM (Frequent Pattern Mining) is a {{data mining}} {{paradigm}} to extract informative patterns from massive datasets. Researchers have developed numerous novel algorithms to extract these patterns. Unfortunately, the focus primarily {{has been on}} a small set of popular patterns (itemsets, sequences, trees and graphs) and no framework for integrating the FPM process has been attempted. In this paper we introduce DMTL, a generic pattern <b>mining</b> library which <b>fuses</b> theoretical concepts from formal concept analysis and generic programming. It provides a framework that allows mining a large spectrum of patterns. We express each pattern in terms of its relational properties. Describing patterns based on their properties results in a pattern concept hierarchy. This hierarchical model is implemented using principles from generic programming. In this paper, we describe our design considerations and the subsequent implementation. Some of the challenges faced in terms of language features have also been highlighted. Apart from using the library in its entirety, we believe that some of its components, such as isomorphism checking, can be used independently. These components can definitely enrich the existing functionality provided in some of the popular libraries such as the Boost Graph Library. 1...|$|R
