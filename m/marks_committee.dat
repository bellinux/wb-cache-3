50|$|Sir Ugo P. Mifsud {{was born}} in Valletta on 12 September 1889. He pursued his studies at the Lyceum and at the Royal University of Malta from where he gratuated as a Lawyer in 1910. He had a very {{successful}} career at the Bar. He contributed papers on international law to leading legal journals, including the London International Law Notes. He was appointed a Member of the International Law Association, set up in Brussels and took {{an active part in}} the bi-annual conferences which discussed problems related to international law. In 1928, he presided over the aerial and radio law committee at a conference in Warsaw; and in 1934 he presided the Trade <b>Marks</b> <b>Committee</b> at a conference in Budapest. At a conference held in Oxford in 1932, he eas elected member of the executive committee and vice president. In 1928, he represented Malta at a conference convened in Canada by the Empire Parliamentary Association. Mifsud was Knighted in 1927. Sir Ugo was elected Secretary of the initial sittings of the National Assembly after Sir Filippo Sciberras had rallied the Assembly to draft a Constitution for submission to the British Government. In 1921, under the Amery-Milner Constitution, Sir Ugo successfully contested the elections as a candidate of the Unione Popolare Maltese (UPM) for the Legislative Assembly. In 1924 Sir Ugo became the youngest Prime Minister in the British Empire. After the merger in 1926 between the UPM and Dr. Enrico Mizzi's PDN, Sir Ugo became co-leader with Dr. Mizzi of the newly formed Partito Nazionalista (PN). He was re-elected in 1927 and again in the PN landslide victory of 1932, when he held the office of Prime Minister up to 1933, when the 1921 Constitution was withdrawn. In 1932 he formed part of a government delegation to London which submitted to the secretary of state for the colonies, Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister, a Memorandum with a formal request for Malta to be placed under the Dominium Office as an Independent Member of the Commonwealth. Sir Ugo held several portfolios: Minister of Finance (1924-26), Minister of Justice (1926-27, 1932-33), Minister for Industry and Commerce (1921-24, 1932-33), Minister for Posts (1921-22, 1923-24), Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (1921-22, 1923-24). In 1939 Sir Ugo Mifsud was elected Member of the Council of Government. On 9 February 1942 as the Council was debating, as a matter of urgency, the British Government's intention to deport several Maltese citizens, Sir Ugo suffered a heart attack as he was delivering a stirring and impassionate speech against the government's intention. Two days later he died. He is buried at the Lija cemetery. Sir Ugo Mifsud was married to Maria Beatrice ("Blanche") Francia in 1928. On the 21st Anniversary of his death a marble monument at Floriana was erected to his memory.|$|E

In 1979, a debate developed around whether a commemorative marker of the first sit-in belonged in Durham or Greensboro; Blackwell M. [...] "Dog" [...] Brogden, one of the prosecutors from the 1957 Recorder's Court case, stated to the press that the marker belonged in Durham.

40|$|As the new {{millennium}} approaches, signing and marking materials continue to evolve. Recent efforts to increase {{the safety of the}} motoring public include the use of improved delineation materials. PERFORMANCE If the current and future state of the art for signing and marking materials could be summarized in one word, that word would be performance. Quantifiable material performance requirements are relatively new to this industry, which is more than 70 years old. In the {{new millennium}}, performance of signing and marking materials will be measured day and night, and during clear and inclement weather. Improved signing and marking materials will be part of some new Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) initiatives; development is already under way in the ITS arena. Sign performance will be measured by its durability and utility (that is, how easily it is viewed by motorists) in real situations. New marking and signing materials to improve roadway delineation are currently under evaluation. Improvements The use of durable marking materials instead of standard paint and beads has increased recently. Because maintenance funds continue to be squeezed, this trend will extend into {{the new millennium}}. One new concept under development is pavement marking management systems, which allow choice of pavement-marking materials on the basis of field performance and optimal use. Some agencies have moved away from in-house striping to contractors whose materials must meet specified performance criteria. Additionally, at least 10 state departments of transportation require a minimum retroreflective performance on markings newly applied by contractors. Some initial attempts have been made at warrantee contracts for pavement markings, which hold the contractor responsible for the long-term retroreflective performance of the installed material. The Pavement <b>Marking</b> <b>Committee</b> of the American Traffic Safety Services Association is developing a generic warrantee application specification to help agencies develop their own requirements. This generic specification should be finalized by the Pavement <b>Marking</b> <b>Committee’s</b> first meeting in the new millennium...|$|R

40|$|Stenting {{remains a}} common {{treatment}} option for atherosclerotic arteries. The main drawback of early stent platforms was restenosis, {{which has been}} combated by drug eluting stents; however, these stents have suffered from {{a higher incidence of}} late stage thrombosis. To address current stenting limitations, the major research focuses have been the development of the next generation of drug eluting stents and first generation bioabsorbable stents. The main objective of this dissertation was the design and development of a new class of bioabsorbable stent composed of elastin mimetic protein polymers. The first phase explored different stent design schemes and fabrication strategies. Successfully fabricated stents were then mechanically tested to ensure they possessed sufficient mechanical strength. Additionally, described herein is the potential to modulate the properties of the elastin mimetics through different crosslinking strategies. We have demonstrated that chemical crosslinking allows for the tailoring of the physical, mechanical, drug delivery, and endothelialization properties of these materials. The potential for drug delivery from this elastin mimetic stent was benchmarked as was the potential to endothelialize these stents. Furthermore, we developed the necessary delivery systems to allow for deployment in the rat aorta model.

40|$|Transdermal drug {{delivery}} system has been limited to small and lipophilic drugs because skin has the intrinsic function to protect the body preventing entry of the external species into the body. In this thesis, two physical methods were studied to overcome the skin barrier in the controlled breakage of the skin barrier and to deliver macromolecules-based drugs through the skin; (1) polysaccharide dissolving microneedles and (2) micro thermal skin ablation. Polysaccharide dissolving microneedles system was designed to break the skin barrier in a minimized size with the mechanically poor material, to release them into skin with the dissolution of microneedles, and to deliver human growth hormone into the living hairless rats. Micro thermal skin ablation was designed to fabricate the device generating the energy impact with the basis of arc discharge, to transfer the energy impact on the skin, to remove stratum corneum selectively with three-dimensionally controlled manner, and to deliver hydrophilic macromolecules through skin.

40|$|The major hurdle in the {{development}} of transdermal route as a versatile drug delivery method is the formidable transport barrier provided by the stratum corneum. Despite decades of research to overcome the stratum corneum barrier, limited success has been achieved. The objectives of this research were to develop and characterize two different strategies to overcome the stratum corneum barrier for transdermal delivery of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines. In the first strategy, coated microneedles (sharp-tipped, micron-sized structures) were developed to enable delivery of drugs directly into the skin by bypassing the stratum corneum barrier. In the second strategy, instead of bypassing the barrier, microdermabrasion was used to selectively abrade stratum corneum with sharp microparticles for topical drug application. Coated microneedles 	For developing painless microneedles, the first detailed study was performed to characterize the effect of microneedle geometry on pain caused by microneedle insertions in human volunteers. This study demonstrated that microneedles are significantly less painful than a 26 -gage hypodermic needle and that decreasing microneedle length and numbers reduces pain. 	Next, the first in-depth study of microneedle coating methods and formulations was performed to (i) develop a novel micron-scale dip-coating process, (ii) test the breadth of compounds that can be coated onto microneedles, and (iii) develop a rational basis to design novel coating formulations based on the physics of dip-coating. 	Finally, a plasmid DNA-vaccine was coated onto microneedles to immunize mice, to provide the first evidence that microneedle-based skin immunization can generate a robust in vivo antigen-specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte response using similar, or lower, DNA doses on microneedles as when using the gene gun or intramuscular injection. Microdermabrasion 	We demonstrated {{for the first time that}} microdermabrasion in monkeys and humans can selectively, yet completely remove the stratum corneum layer. Using a mobile mode of microdermabrasion, an increase in the number of treatment passes led to greater tissue removal. Furthermore, topical application of Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus after microdermabrasion induced virus-specific antibodies in monkeys. 	In conclusion, both coated microneedles and microdermabrasion were developed to enable delivery of biomolecules into the skin, indicating their potential for transdermal delivery of a wide range of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines.

40|$|Slamming often {{occurs in}} severe sea states {{particular}} for high speed vessels, {{which can cause}} damage to ship hulls or even equipment on ships. Analysis of transient dynamic response of ship hulls is useful in establishing criterion related to slamming loads and predicting seakeeping behavior of the ship. Thus this thesis is mainly focused on dynamic response of the ship due to slamming loads. Experimental study of the floating structure dynamics can be very expensive. Hence, numerical methods {{are considered to be}} very useful for dynamic analysis of the ship. The ship to be analyzed in this work is owned by Wagenborg which is a multi-purpose cargo/container ship. The bench <b>mark</b> <b>committee</b> has provided all the information about the ship and corresponding sea condition. Three-dimensional finite element model is established in Sesam Genie. Hydrodynamic coefficients are computed in Sesam HydroD. The model made in Genie is imported in ABAQUS for dynamic analysis. The material properties, sections, mesh size and load cases are defined in ABAQUS. The introductory part of this thesis gives an overview of slamming phenomenon and reviews of previous literature. The second part of the thesis introduces different types of external loads which act on the ship hull and the response induced by these loads. Slamming load theories are described especially. The third part elaborates dynamic response analysis theories and corresponding analysis methods. The analysis methods used in ANAQUS are also specified in this section. The forth part of the thesis presents details of the finite element modelling of the ship using software Sesam and ABAQUS. Different ship models are established for comparison.
