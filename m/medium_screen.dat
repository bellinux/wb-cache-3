A screen of 360 plant extracts for inhibition of calcineurin-dependent gene expression in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified the compound 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxybenzyl isothiocyanate as an inhibitor. The compound was subsequently shown to inhibit human calcineurin via a mixed inhibition mechanism.

50|$|Although RMAs {{are derived}} from RIAs, there are {{fundamental}} dissimilarities between them, particularly task/layer distribution of application, interaction <b>medium,</b> <b>screen</b> size and layout, communication and networking mediums. The logic and data layers in RIAs are initially located in remote back-end servers and only the user interface is located inside the end-user's device. The fundamental principle in forming RIAs is to mitigate the server-side computing cost of the applications by exploiting the computing power of contemporary desktop computers at the user end. Parts of logic and data layers are transferred from the server node to the client node. The rich computing and storage resources in contemporary personal computers (PCs) reduce client-server networking traffic and delay, and shrink ownership and maintenance costs on the server side. This helps service providers reduce operating costs. In return, the end-user benefits from a crisp interaction response from the application since {{some part of the}} data and logic is stored in their local computer.|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli is {{routinely}} {{used for the}} production of recombinant proteins both for research purposes and for commercial applications. Despite the extensive amount of knowledge gathered about the synthesis and accumulation of heterologous proteins and the well established principals affecting the production of secondary metabolites, little {{attention has been paid to}} the effects of medium composition on the production of recombinant proteins. In the course of optimizing the production of various recombinant proteins, we found that the level of accumulation of a given protein was composition-dependent. Since the best formulation for a protein could not be deter-mined solely on the basis of the class of protein, a simple screening technique was developed to rapidly identify the best available medium for any give recombinant protein. The screen was tested on six different recombinant proteins and shown to be an effective means of empirically determining the best medium. It was further observed that the medium composition affected the relative level of soluble protein that accumulated. These results suggested that a <b>medium</b> <b>screen</b> should be employed as a routine part of developing bacterial strains which produce recombinant proteins.

40|$|Parental {{mediation}} up to 4 {{year old}} children usage of screen media” Aim of this bachelor thesis {{was to investigate}} how parents describe screen media usage of their 4 year old children. Empirical material for this work was gathered from ten semi-structured in-depth interviews with parents who {{have at least one}} up to 4 year old child. This work examined parents’ opinions about the effects of <b>screen</b> <b>mediums</b> to their small child and parents understandings, about the importance of their own role between <b>screen</b> <b>medium</b> and the toddler. In this work author has examined television, computer, videogames, DVDs, VHS viewing and usage by children. Most common <b>screen</b> <b>medium</b> amongst the children of participants are TV and also DVD-s. The analysis of interviews showed that children watch TV almost daily, viewing time is from 15 minutes to 3 hours. Children mainly watch shows specially designed for children, but there are some exceptions when children watch also shows created for older viewers. Parents have not set exact rules when and what child can watch from TV, play videogames or use computer. Restrictions, which parent use, are situation based. Many parents brought up the importance of preventing violence viewing from screen, {{but at the same time}} parents do not watch commonly <b>screen</b> <b>mediums</b> together with their children, so it is not possible for them to be sure that child does not view any inappropriate content. Quite often parents seem to be assuming the program suitability for child. This assumption seems to be based on the channel, which child is viewing. Although all the participants have at least one computer in their home, less than half the children are using computers. What was surprising about the result is that children seem to be using computers under very little parental supervision. Parents allow their children to certain websites, where child is allowed to operate on its own. Mostly parents do not see different <b>screen</b> <b>mediums</b> as a channel from which their child could learn. Parents look at TV and other mediums mostly as entertainment for child, something for the child to do when parents themselves for example do not have time for their children. Results also show that parents do not usually talk about what child has viewed from screen. Neither do parents check how children understand the programs watched. Results of this study indicate that children <b>screen</b> <b>medium</b> usage is supervised in some ways by parents, but the parental mediation is not sufficient. Parents do not seem to value importance of co-viewing and positive effect of discussion over programs.

Traditionally, the {{production}} process of astaxanthin by this algae is achieved by a two-stage system: during the first stage, vegetative “green” cells are produced and then converted, in the second stage, into cysts that accumulate astaxanthin. In this work, a <b>medium</b> <b>screening</b> strategy based on the mixing of a 3 -component hydroponic fertilizer was applied to identify a new formulation optimized for the vegetative stage. A maximal and high cell density of 2 x 106 cells mL− 1 was obtained in a medium containing {{a high level of}} phosphate relative to nitrate, resulting in a N:P ratio much lower than commonly used media for H. pluvialis.
