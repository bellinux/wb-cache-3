5|$|Marrow {{or blood}} is {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{strain of}} H. pylori {{a person is}} exposed to <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> risk of {{developing}} gastric cancer. Strains of H. pylori that produce high levels of two proteins, vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), appear to cause greater tissue damage than those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely. These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion is under way. As {{a result of the}} bacterial presence, neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault.|$|E

5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{has been}} noted to often co-occur with Amanita muscaria or A.rubescens, although {{it is unclear whether}} this is due to a biological association between the species, or because of similarities in growing season, habitat, and ecological requirements. An association has also been reported between B.edulis and Amanita excelsa on Pinus radiata ectomycorrhizae in New Zealand, suggesting that other fungi <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> life cycle of porcini. A 2007 field study revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies were more complex.|$|E
5|$|When {{applied to}} human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of {{participants}} having varying phenotypes {{for a particular}} trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), {{or they may be}} people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said {{to be associated with the}} disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> risk of disease.|$|E

5|$|Mammalian coats are colored for {{a variety}} of reasons, the major {{selective}} pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, {{is the result of a}} symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.|$|E
5|$|Once {{passed by}} the Senate, a bill {{is sent to the}} House of Delegates for consideration. If the House also approves the bill without amendment, it is sent to the Governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with {{amendments}} or ask {{for the establishment of a}} conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation, usually October 1 of that year. If it is vetoed, both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three-fifths majority to overturn the veto. They may not, however, overturn a veto in the first year of a new term, since the bill would have been passed during the previous session. Additionally, joint resolutions and the budget bill may not be vetoed, although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> latter; it may only decrease the Governor's budget proposal, not increase it.|$|E
