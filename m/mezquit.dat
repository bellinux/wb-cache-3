On the south-west, twenty miles distant, is a range of lofty mountains, which forms its limit in that direction. On the north and east, it is bounded by the horizon, no mountains or hills being visible. The soil is either a fine gravel, or loose sand. The vegetation is exceedingly sparse, consisting chiefly of stunted <b>mezquit</b> and the larrea Mexicana. Near the arroyo, where water sometimes finds its way, a few <b>mezquit</b> bushes have attained the height of ten feet, whose brilliant hue is most agreeable to the eye, amid so much barrenness. A little grass was found in clumps {{about a mile from}} our camp in an arroyo, whither our animals were sent. This, with the young shoots of the <b>mezquit,</b> was all they had. At sunrise this morning, the mercury stood at 92°, and at noon 108° in the shade. Distance from Carrizo Creek, twenty-five miles." ...|$|E

Peterman told me he had built this station, which he intended making his permanent residence, in order to obtain the business of the main line. I purchased of him several tons of <b>mezquit</b> beans, besides contracting for a supply of hay.|$|E

Before leaving camp last night, I sent four men with spades in advance, {{in order that}} they might sink some holes, and have a small supply of water for us on our arrival; but as they were ignorant of the place and were {{unfamiliar}} with the best indications of water, they had accomplished little. Some more experienced hands now set themselves busily at work in an arroyo, or place {{where there was a}} slight depression in the desert, marked by some <b>mezquit</b> bushes, whose freshness showed that water sometimes reached their roots. After digging about six feet, the water began slowly to enter and by dipping it up with a basin, we managed to supply our animals." ...|$|E

Already this enterprising pioneer has contracted with a party of Mexicans to build a main irrigating ditch from the Gila, with branches sufficient to enable him to cultivate several hundred acres of land. The Mexicans are now at work. I made such arrangements for him, by writing to an agent at Fort Yuma, as would secure the necessary barley for seed, making {{at the same time}} a conditional purchase of all his crop. He felt confident of gathering a good harvest the present season. Peterman originally came up here from Fort Yuma to execute a contract for several tons of <b>mezquit</b> bean, made with the parties who are contractors for hauling the ore of the Arizona Copper Mining Company to Fort Yuma." ...|$|E
