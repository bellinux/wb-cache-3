More recently, the P90 has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90, a semi-automatic carbine intended for personal protection and sporting use.|$|E

500|$|P90 TR:The P90 TR (Triple Rail) model, {{also known}} as the [...] "flat-top," [...] was {{introduced}} in late 1999. It features a receiver-mounted triple MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail interface system, or [...] "Triple Rail," [...] for <b>mounting</b> <b>accessories.</b> There is one full-length accessory rail integrated into the top of the receiver, and two rail stumps are included {{on the sides of the}} receiver. The top rail will accept various optical sights with no tools or additional mounting hardware required, and the side rails serve to mount secondary accessories, such as tactical lights or laser aiming devices.|$|E

2500|$|The CPW is {{available}} in 9mm Parabellum (9Ã—19mm NATO) caliber for now and [...] "resembles an updated/modernized MP7A1". The main differences are the angled pistol grip of the CPW for enhanced ergonomics and natural aiming, and a transparent rear magazine so that the operator can see the rounds remaining. Other features include a skeletonised trigger, a full-length Mil-Std-1913 Picatinny top rail for <b>mounting</b> <b>accessories</b> such as optics and lasers, and a shorter bottom rail {{in front of the}} trigger guard for mounting a vertical foregrip.|$|E
2500|$|The HK45 {{represents}} an evolutionary {{advancement of the}} Heckler & Koch USP, and shares the same operating principles of that weapon. It {{is available in the}} same ten variants as the USP. The HK45 is a full size model pistol, but significant effort went towards making it more ergonomic than the HK USP full-size chambered in [...]45 ACP by incorporating features found on the Heckler & Koch P2000. These include an extended ambidextrous slide release, a textured ergonomic grip with finger grooves, and interchangeable backstraps to fit differently sized hands. The newer grip and backstraps allow the pistol to sit lower into the web of the hand, contributing to greater control of the weapon and recoil management. In order to accommodate the smaller, more ergonomic grip, the HK45 has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds versus 12 rounds for the USP45. The HK45 also added grip serrations on {{the front end of the}} slide, a Picatinny rail in front of the trigger guard for <b>mounting</b> <b>accessories,</b> and an O-ring polygonal barrel similar to the USP Expert and Match models and the Mark 23 for more consistent lock-up of the slide and barrel during cycling and increased accuracy.|$|E

50|$|Neither the AK-47 nor the M16 were {{designed}} to <b>mount</b> <b>accessories,</b> except of course for their respective bayonets and a simple clamp type bipod for the M16. However, {{with the advent of}} the Picatinny rail and by sheer happenstance, the M16 has proven itself to be a remarkably adaptable weapon system, capable of mounting a wide range of accessories, including grenade launchers, fore-grips, removable carry handle/rear sight assemblies, bipods, laser systems, electronic sights, night vision, tactical lights, etc. The AK-47 can also use Picatinny rail <b>mounted</b> <b>accessories,</b> although its design and smaller fore-stock make it less adaptable.|$|R

50|$|The VP9 has an {{extended}} full size Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for <b>mounting</b> lights and <b>accessories.</b> The rail {{has been tested}} and certified to handle the heavier <b>mounted</b> <b>accessories</b> because of its full size which adds rigidity. This rigidity gives the VP9 superior capabilities compared to some of its polymer competitors whose frames flex under use and cannot handle the weight {{of some of the}} medium to larger mounted lights.|$|R

50|$|The {{accessory}} drive is a gearbox that forms {{part of a}} gas turbine engine.

50|$|By the 1880s, lens front <b>mounted</b> <b>accessory</b> shutter {{boxes were}} available, {{containing}} a rubberized silk cloth curtain (also called a blind) {{with one or}} more width slit cutouts wound around two parallel drums and using springs to pull a slit from one drum to the other. These shutters offered a wide range of shutter speeds by adjusting the spring tension and selecting a slit width.|$|R

5000|$|SP5K: First {{introduced}} in 2016, the SP5K is {{an updated version}} of the SP89. It features a Picatinny rail mounted {{on the top of the}} receiver for <b>mounting</b> <b>accessories.</b> As with the SP89, it is semi-automatic only and the forward handguard does not have a vertical foregrip.|$|E
50|$|Some models feature frames with {{integral}} Picatinny rails. While such rails can {{be useful}} for <b>mounting</b> <b>accessories</b> (primarily laser target designators), they {{increase the size of}} the frame, making it impractical to use many common holsters (such as those for the M1911-type pistols) even when no accessories are mounted.|$|E
50|$|Further {{plans are}} {{underway}} {{to develop a}} NATO standard to provide electrical power to rail <b>mounted</b> <b>accessories</b> in the future. Currently, Wilcox Industries, in cooperation with Surefire, {{is working on the}} creation of a railed forend for an AR-15 that will power battery-reliant accessories such as tactical lights and laser sights. Accessories are intended to be powered by one central battery pack or via their proprietary vertical grip, the Universal Control Grip.|$|R

Weight-saving measures include aluminium chain cases, oil sump, motor <b>mount</b> arms, <b>accessory</b> <b>mounts</b> and a cartridge-style oil filter housing. Closely {{related to the}} SOHC M40, the M42's DOHC 16 valve head and chain-driven cams provided increased power {{in comparison to the}} M40.|$|R

50|$|The M21 {{is based}} on the AK-47 Kalashnikov principle, {{chambered}} in the 5.56Ã—45mm NATO cartridge. The current models use a 1.5mm thick stamped receiver, while a future model will feature an improved receiver of 0.9mm thickness to achieve a considerably lighter weight.Like many modern assault rifles, the M21 can incorporate picatinny rails for <b>mounting</b> <b>accessories</b> like optics, vertical grips, bipods, etc.|$|E
5000|$|In North America {{the vehicle}} {{attachment}} {{is known as}} the trailer hitch. Trailer hitches come in two main configurations: receiver type and fixed-drawbar type. Receiver-type hitches consist of a portion that mounts to the frame of the vehicle that has a rearward-facing opening that accepts removable ball mounts, hitch bike racks, cargo carriers, or other hitch <b>mounted</b> <b>accessories.</b> Fixed-drawbar hitches are typically built as one piece, have an integrated hole for the trailer ball, and are generally not compatible with aftermarket hitch accessories.|$|R
