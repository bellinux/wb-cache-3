Due to the longterm runtime and to the multidisciplinarity a consequent and consistent management of data and information is developed on the basis of Open Source software. Two core elements of this web-based scientific information system are presented here - a metadata server (GeoNetwork) and a map server (UMN <b>Map-server).</b> Conclusions: The importance of professional management of data, information and knowledge can hardly be underestimated. For developing the infrastructure and specific profiles, knowledge from other disciplines (e. g. business sciences, library sciences, environmental informatics) was used...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study is to present the {{open-source}} <b>Map-Server</b> and the way it can be used as a Web-based Geographic Information System. The MapServer object model is analyzed and algorithms are proposed for geo-referenced spatial data dynamic representation. The results of this analysis are used in the development of our application called AstroWeb. AstroWeb presents graphically the application data of the Plate Archives catalog (CWFPA v. 2011) of Bulgarian Wide-Field Plate Database and ensures fast and easy access to the digitalized plate information. This work is supported with Grant No. DO- 02 - 275 / 2008 of the National Science Fund of the Bulgarian Ministry of Education, Youth and Science to the Institute of Information and Communication Technologies at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (IICT-BAS) ...|$|E
40|$|A typical Internet <b>map-server</b> {{application}} allows only {{retrieval of}} maps and maprelated data. We have been developing web-based GIS/database (WebGD) applications that allow users to insert, query, update, and delete geographical features {{and the data}} associated with them from standard Web browsers. The code shared by these applications is organized as the WebGD framework. We have also built a WebGD application generator (WebGD-Gen) that automatically produces a WebGD application from a database schema. This application generator greatly simplifies {{the process of creating}} a complex Web-based GIS/database application and significantly reduces the development time and maintenance cost. The WebGD framework and WebGD-GEN currently support such advanced features as tight integration of a Webbased map interface with a database, automatic selection of the spatial reference and map layers for the current region, and automatic generation of Web forms. The forms generated can be used to insert, search, update, and delete geographical features and the data associated with them. 1...|$|E
40|$|Internet of Things {{communication}} is mainly {{based on a}} machine-to-machine pattern, where devices are globally addressed and identified. However, {{as the number of}} connected devices increase, the burdens on the network infrastructure increase as well. The major challenges are the size of the routing tables and the efficiency of the current routing protocols in the Internet backbone. To address these problems, an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working group, along with the research group at Cisco, are still working on the Locator/ID Separation Protocol as a routing architecture that can provide new semantics for the IP addressing, to simplify routing operations and improve scalability in the future of the Internet such as the Internet of Things. Nonetheless, The Locator/ID Separation Protocol is still at an early stage of implementation and the security Protocol e. g. Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), in particular, is still in its infancy. Based on this, three scenarios were considered: Firstly, in the initial stage, each Locator/ID Separation Protocol-capable router needs to register with a <b>Map-Server.</b> This is known as the Registration Stage. Nevertheless, this stage is vulnerable to masquerading and content poisoning attacks. Secondly, the addresses resolving stage, in the Locator/ID Separation Protocol the Map Server (MS) accepts Map-Request from Ingress Tunnel Routers and Egress Tunnel Routers. These routers in trun look up the database and return the requested mapping to the endpoint user. However, this stage lacks data confidentiality and mutual authentication. Furthermore, the Locator/ID Separation Protocol limits the efficiency of the security protocol which works against redirecting the data or acting as fake routers. Thirdly, As a result of the vast increase in the different Internet of Things devices, the interconnected links between these devices increase vastly as well. Thus, the communication between the devices can be easily exposed to disclosures by attackers such as Man in the Middle Attacks (MitM) and Denial of Service Attack (DoS). This research provided a comprehensive study for Communication and Mobility in the Internet of Things as well as the taxonomy of different security protocols. It went on to investigate the security threats and vulnerabilities of Locator/ID Separation Protocol using X. 805 framework standard. Then three Security protocols were provided to secure the exchanged transitions of communication in Locator/ID Separation Protocol. The first security protocol had been implemented to secure the Registration stage of Locator/ID separation using ID/Based cryptography method. The second security protocol was implemented to address the Resolving stage in the Locator/ID Separation Protocol between the Ingress Tunnel Router and Egress Tunnel Router using Challenge-Response authentication and Key Agreement technique. Where, the third security protocol had been proposed, analysed and evaluated for the Internet of Things communication devices. This protocol was based on the authentication and the group key agreement via using the El-Gamal concept. The developed protocols set an interface between each level of the phase to achieve security refinement architecture to Internet of Things based on Locator/ID Separation Protocol. These protocols were verified using Automated Validation Internet Security Protocol and Applications (AVISPA) which is a push button tool for the automated validation of security protocols and achieved results demonstrating {{that they do not have}} any security flaws. Finally, a performance analysis of security refinement protocol analysis and an evaluation were conducted using Contiki and Cooja simulation tool. The results of the performance analysis showed that the security refinement was highly scalable and the memory was quite efficient as it needed only 72 bytes of memory to store the keys in the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) device...|$|E
