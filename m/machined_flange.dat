40|$|Work {{supported}} by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. I ‘Thin-foil vacuum-tight windows of low 2 material are used at high energy accelerators whenever the beam passes from vacuum to air. The use of low 2 / materials ensures negligible scattering of the primary beam. These windows I are usually made of Al or Be, approximately 0. 005 ” thick and are sealed using! Indium and/or specially <b>machined</b> <b>flanges</b> or foils. Recently we required a thin foil window which was bakeable to 200 or 2 SO°C for use in an ultra-high-vacuum-‘ system designed to measure the secondary emission from low-density alkali halides at relativistic energies. The following note describes a simple solution we found to this problem. A sketch of the seal is shown in Fig. 1. The seal is accomplished by compressing a Cu gasket into the thin foil window. The flanges used were standard _ ConFlat ultra-hig...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-piercing}} riveting (SPR) method {{which uses a}} flange pipe rivet. This joining technology can {{solve the problems of}} oblique rivet and incorrect rivet position which are usually found in the SPR with a pipe rivet. The lap shear strength of the joint with a flange pipe rivet is higher than that of a joint with a conventional rivet. In this research, a flange pipe rivet was placed between two sheets with a force applied to the top sheet by a punch riveting <b>machine.</b> The <b>flange</b> pipe rivet moved downward along with the top sheet to induce appropriate bending and form a mechanical interlock in both sheets. Finite element (FE) analysis of the SPR with a flange pipe rivet was done by DEFORM software. The simulated joint cross-section shapes were observed, and the influence of the flange pipe rivet parameters on joint quality was analyzed. Simultaneously, some riveting experiments on joining aluminum sheets were conducted taking into consideration different rivet heights and chamfer angles. The results show that the joining surface is smooth and the simulated joint cross-section shapes are in good agreement with the experimental results. The joining property with a chamfer angle of 45 ° and a rivet height of 5 mm is found to be the best in joining the Al 6063 aluminum alloy sheets with a thickness of 2. 4 mm by using the SPR with a flange pipe rivet...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand various {{researches}} studied the structural performance of repairing artificially damaged composite or non-composite steel beam using FRP element. Section loss due to corrosion has been simulated artificially by cutting part of the flange or the web, or <b>machining</b> the tension <b>flange</b> to a reduced thickness throughout the entire span. Fatigue cracks have been simulated by introducing partial or complete saw cut in the steel flange thickness. Another method of introducing an artificial damage is by loading the steel girder beyond yielding and then unloading. Liu et al. (2001) studied the effect of repairing damaged non-composite I-beams using HM-CFRP plate. The tension flange of the damaged beams was completely cut. Their {{results indicated that the}} repaired specimens did not recover the total strength of the control intact specimen. The failure mode of specimen with full length repair was due to a gradual debonding of the CFRP laminate which initiated at mid-span and extended to the end as the load increased. Tavakkolizadeh and Saadatmanesh (2003) and (Al-Saidy et al. 2004) examined the effect of repairing partial cutting of the tension flange of composite beams using SM-CFRP sheets and HM-CFRP plates, respectively. Tavakkolizadeh and Saadatmanesh (2003) indicated that the repaired specimens did not recover the total strength of the intact specimen. Also their results showed that the girder having 25  % loss in tension flange failed by rupture of CFRP. On {{the other hand}} the girder having 50  % loss in tension flange failed by crushing of the concrete slab, followed by a limited debonding of the CFRP laminate at mid-span. In the case of the girder having 100  % loss in tension flange complete debonding of CFRP laminate occurred. Al-Saidy et al. (2004) showed that repairing the girders using HM-CFRP plates was able to fully restore the strength of the original undamaged girders. The CFRP debonding mode of failure was not observed in their study and only crushing of the concrete slab or rupture of the CFRP plates was reported. Shaat (2007) studied the effect of repairing the damage composite steel beams by bonding SM-CFRP or HM-CFRP sheets on the bottom side of the tension steel flange and on both the bottom and top sides of the tension flange. The steel tension flanges were completely cut at mid-span to represent a severe section loss in bridge girders. His results indicated that bonding SM-CFRP sheets to both sides of the steel flange enhances flexural stiffness of the repaired girders, but has no effect on flexural strength.|$|R
