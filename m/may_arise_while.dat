Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.|$|E

However, several extrapolation and numerical issues <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>while</b> using these functions that have not been covered by the literature much so far. In this paper, we identify these problems and show how to deal with them by enforcing nonnegativity of certain polynomials. Further, we show how to model these nonnegativities using polynomial matrix inequalities (PMI) and how to estimate the radial distortion parameters subject to PMI constraints using semidefinite programming (SDP). Finally, we suggest several approaches on how to incorporate the proposed method into the overall camera calibration procedure...|$|E

30|$|Numerous {{problems}} such as dangerous well kicks, lost circulation, blowouts, stuck pipe, excessive costs, and borehole instability <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>while</b> drilling, if pore pressure is not predicted before drilling. Pre-drill pore pressure prediction {{in the form of}} velocity-to-pressure transform has been carried out utilizing surface seismic survey data. Estimated bulk densities from seismic interval velocities at each seismic line were compared with the measured densities of the closest well. Good matching has been observed between the estimated and measured densities for reliability of our pressure results. Overburden pressure at any interested depth was calculated from summation products of interval bulk densities and their corresponding thicknesses of all layers overlying that depth. Pore pressures were predicted from subtraction of the effective stresses (skeleton pressure, matrix stress) in terms of normal and observed interval velocities from overburden pressures using the modified Eaton’s equation method.|$|E
