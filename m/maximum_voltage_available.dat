The fader, which traditionally controls the audio signal directly, becomes a DC control voltage for the VCA. The <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>available</b> to a fader {{can be controlled}} {{by one or more}} master faders called VCA groups. The VCA master fader then controls the overall level of all of the channels assigned to it.

5000|$|The signal {{passes through}} an anti-aliasing, resampling, or {{reconstruction}} filter, which may increase peak amplitude slightly {{due to the}} Gibbs phenomenon (The Gibbs Phenomenon is a mathematical concept and only applies to one point so in practice it is irrelevant to real life circuits and devices). It is possible, for the analog signal represented by the digital data to exceed digital full scale even if the digital data does not, and vice versa. In the analog domain there is no peak/clipping problem unless the d/a analog circuitry was badly designed. In the digital domain there are no peaks created by these conversions. [...] In analog systems, full scale may be defined by the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>available,</b> or the maximum deflection (full scale deflection or FSD) or indication of an analog instrument such as a moving coil meter or galvanometer.|$|E
25|$|Different {{power supply}} types result in many {{different}} methods of bias. Bias is a technique by which active devices are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltages</b> <b>available</b> from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class-A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide {{both positive and negative}} voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class-C amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{the torque}} maximizing and field {{weakening}} control strategies for synchronous machines with magnetically anisotropic structure such as synchronous reluctance machines (SyRMs) and interior permanent magnet machines (IPMs) are studied. In {{order to obtain}} maximum torque using minimum stator current, the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control strategy is employed below the base speeds. The MTPA control {{is limited by the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>available</b> <b>voltage</b> of the motor. Therefore, field weakening (FW) control is employed in order to achieve speeds higher than base speed. To obtain maximum torque while effectively reducing the stator flux {{at the same time the}} maximum torque per volt (MTPV) is employed at high speeds. The control techniques are realized using direct flux vector control (DFVC) strategy. Performance of the DFVC technique is analysed in unsaturated and saturated magnetic conditions. Robustness of the technique against parameter variation is evaluated by a series of loading tests. Performance of the DFVC is then evaluated by comparing it with the rotor oriented current vector control. Simulations are performed from experimental data of 7. 5 kW IPM drive...|$|R

Uninterrupted {{power supply}} (UPS) sits between {{a power supply}} such as wall outlet and devices to prevent {{undesired}} feature that can occur within the power source such as outages, sags, surges and bad harmonics from the supply to avoid {{a negative impact on}} the devices. This paper presents a photovoltaic (PV) powered UPS using microcontroller PIC 16 F 628 A-I/P.

40|$|The {{electric}} {{solar wind}} sail produces thrust by centrifugally spanned high voltage tethers {{interacting with the}} solar wind protons. The sail attitude can be controlled and attitude maneuvers are possible by tether voltage modulation synchronous with the sail rotation. Especially, the sail can be inclined {{with respect to the}} solar wind direction to obtain transverse thrust to change the osculating orbit angular momentum. Such an inclination has to be maintained by a continual control voltage modulation. Consequently, the tether <b>voltage</b> <b>available</b> for the thrust is less than the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> provided by the power system. Using a spherical pendulum as a model for a single rotating tether, we derive analytical estimations for the control efficiency for two separate sail control modes. One is a continuous control modulation that corresponds to strictly planar tether tip motion. The other is an on-off modulation with the tether tip moving along a closed loop on a saddle surface. The novel on-off mode is introduced here to both amplify the transverse thrust and reduce the power consumption. During the rotation cycle, the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied to the tether only over two thrusting arcs when most of the transverse thrust is produced. In addition to the transverse thrust, we obtain the thrusting angle and electric power consumption for the two control modes. It is concluded that while the thrusting angle is about half of the sail inclination for the continuous modulation it approximately equals to the inclination angle for the on-off modulation. The efficiency of the on-off mode is emphasized when power consumption is considered, and the on-off mode can be used to improve the propulsive acceleration through the reduced power system mass.

This paper mainly explores vector selection approach pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategies for diode-assisted NPC-MLI to obtain a <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> gain without compromising in waveform quality. To obtain a high <b>voltage</b> gain <b>maximum</b> utilization of dc-link voltage and stress on the power switches must be reduced.

40|$|Abstract – This paper proposes the {{development}} and implementation of a hybrid <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> utilization controller for interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) over a wide operating region. It has a structure that combines the current vector control (CVC) -type Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) controller and the modulating voltage scaled controller (MVSC). Particularly, the current regulator is deactivated for achieving the true <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> utilization in the MVSC region. The hybrid structure provides a smooth transition from the CVC to the proposed MVSC mode by deactivating the current regulator in the flux weakening region. A seamless transition to the full six-step modulation can be easily realized by adjusting a scaling gain, which can be considered a very significant merit in terms of power utilization for wide flux weakening applications. This paper also attempts to investigate the torque control accuracy under motor parameter drifts and provide how to decouple its influence using a voltage disturbance state-filter design.
