Recently, however, orally delivered antigens were shown to induce CD 8 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of causing autoimmune diabetes. In this report, we have examined several <b>mucosal</b> <b>routes</b> for their ability to induce CTLs and autoimmune diabetes, with the aim of identifying approaches that would maximize tolerance and minimize CTL generation. In normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice, ovalbumin (OVA) delivered by either the oral or nasal routes or by aerosol inhalation was able to prime CTL immunity in both high- and low-dose regimens. To address the relevance of these CTLs to autoimmune disease, OVA was given to mice that transgenically expressed this antigen in their pancreatic β-cells. Irrespective of antigen dose or the <b>route</b> of delivery, <b>mucosal</b> OVA triggered diabetes, particularly after intranasal administration. These findings suggest that CTL immunity is likely to be a consequence of mucosal antigen delivery, regardless of the regimen, and should be considered in the clinical application of mucosal tolerance to autoimmune disease prevention...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{observations}} {{demonstrated that}} the delivery of recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin strains to mice via <b>mucosal</b> <b>routes</b> did not efficiently activate systemic and secreted antibody responses to either type d flagellin or genetically fused heterologous B-cell epitopes, thus reducing {{the usefulness of the}} protein as a carrier of epitopes for vaccine purposes. In this work, we investigated murine systemic and mucosal flagellin immunogenicity after oral immunization with attenuated Salmonella strains. The reduced anti-type d flagellin antibody responses in mice immunized via <b>mucosal</b> <b>routes</b> with three doses of flagellated S. enterica serovar Dublin strains were not caused by oral tolerance and could not be restored by coadministration of a mucosal adjuvant. The induction of antibody responses to Salmonella flagellins was shown to differ according to the genetic background, but not the haplotype, of the mouse lineage. Moreover, BALB/c mice orally immunized with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains developed anti-type i flagellin sera and secreted antibody responses, which indicated that the serovar of the Salmonella vaccine strain also affected flagellin immunogenicity. Analyses of cytokine responses of BALB/c mice immunized with three oral doses of flagellated S. enterica serovar Dublin vaccine strains showed that, in spite of the lack of antibody responses, elevated type d flagellin-specific CD 4 -cell-activation-dependent gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and interleukin- 10 responses were elicited after the administration of the vaccine strains via either parenteral or <b>mucosal</b> <b>routes.</b> Similar cytokine production patterns were detected to a T-cell heterologous epitope, derived from the CFA/I fimbriae of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), in mice orally immunized with a Salmonella vaccine strain expressing hybrid flagella. These results indicate that the immunogenicities of Salmonella flagellins can differ significantly, depending on the murine host and on the bacterial vector used, and demonstrate that the induction of CD 4 -cell-activation-dependent IFN-γ production represents a major immune response triggered by flagellin and in-frame fused heterologous T-cell epitopes after the oral administration of recombinant S. enterica serovar Dublin vaccine strains...|$|R

A total of 82 % of vaccinated BALB/c mice were protected from the lethal challenge with 50 LD(50) of tetanus toxin (TT) and a direct correlation between the serum TTFC-specific IgG concentration and survival time of unprotected animals was observed. Intranasal immunization of BALB/c mice was also effective in inducing TTFC-specific serum IgG and local IgA in lung washes.

Because of the mucosal nature of this infection, vaccination strategies aimed at providing prophylactic or therapeutic immune protection have included immunization by <b>mucosal</b> <b>routes.</b> Using the hamster model of C. difficile infection, we examined the protective efficacy of inactivated toxin (toxoid) vaccine formulations prepared as either culture filtrate or partially purified toxoid.

Protection was associated with high levels of toxin-neutralizing antibodies in serum. The requirement for adjuvants for protection was assessed by using sequential i. m. and rectal or i. m. vaccination regimens.

Passive transfer of mouse antitoxin antibodies protected hamsters in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the principal role of circulating antitoxin antibodies in immunity from this toxin-mediated mucosal disease.

Here we report a new strategy, in which steric hindrance between CTB-antigen fusion subunits is significantly reduced through the integration of unfused CTB “molecular buffers” into the pentamer unit, making them more efficiently self-assemble into biologically active pentamers. In addition, the chimeric protein took a compact configuration, becoming small enough to be secreted, and one-step affinity-purified proteins, when administered through a <b>mucosal</b> <b>route,</b> induced specific immune responses in mice.

40|$|Abstract The {{possibility}} of producing local hyposensitization by administering allergens via <b>mucosal</b> <b>routes</b> was envisaged {{at the beginning}} of 1900, and local nasal immunotherapy has been extensively studied since the 1970 s. Presently, there are 21 randomized controlled trials being conducted with the most common allergens, consistently showing the clinical efficacy of local nasal immunotherapy for rhinitis. Other advantages are that it has an optimal safety profile and can be self-administered at home by the patient. Moreover, there are several data from animal models and from humans that confirm the immunomodulatory effect of intranasally administered antigens. On the other hand, local nasal immunotherapy seems to be effective only on rhinitis symptoms and requires a particular technique of administration.

Here we investigate a novel approach based on targeting of dendritic cells using the DEC- 205 /CD 205 receptor (DEC) via the intranasal route as way to improve mucosal cellular immunity to the vaccine. Intranasal administration of Yersinia pestis LcrV (V) protein fused to anti-DEC antibody together with poly IC as an adjuvant induced high frequencies of IFN-gamma secreting CD 4 (+) T cells in the airway and lung as well as pulmonary IgG and IgA antibodies. Anti-DEC:LcrV was more efficient to induce IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha/IL- 2 secreting polyfunctional CD 4 (+) T cells when compared to non-targeted soluble protein vaccine. In addition, the intranasal route of immunization with anti-DEC:LcrV was associated with improved survival upon pulmonary challenge with the virulent CO 92 Y. pestis.

In addition, local immunization may result in the induction of substantial levels of serum antibodies, and therefore represents an attractive alternative for parenteral vaccination. However, without the use of a powerful mucosal adjuvant, local administration of inactivated vaccines usually fails to trigger a substantial immune response. Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LT) is one of the most potent mucosal immunogens and adjuvants known to date. The intrinsic toxicity has, however, precluded its use as an adjuvant for locally administered vaccines. One of the objectives of our work in this area is the identification of non-toxic LT variants which retain the immunogenic and adjuvant properties of the wild-type toxin. Here, we present a number of such variants.
