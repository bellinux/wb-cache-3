Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and fatty acid biomarkers were used to study trophic linkages and the trophic ecology of the most important pelagic species in this ecosystem, with emphasis on capelin (Mallotus villosus). According to 15 N enrichment results, there are 3 – 4 trophic levels in this ecosystem excluding organisms of the microbial loop and birds and mammals.

40|$|We {{have used}} “MultiSampler”, a {{multiple}} opening-closing device that allows obtaining several samples {{from a single}} trawl haul, during the trawl-acoustic survey targeting blue whiting (<b>Micromesistius</b> <b>poutassou)</b> on their spawning areas west of the British Isles in spring 2005 and 2006. Typically, two consecutive samples were obtained with the vessel towing at same direction and at similar depth all the time, as if when fishing without the multisampler. Typically, cod-end was opened for 10 - 20 minutes for each sample. During standard survey operation without the multisampler, total towing time would have been similar but only one sample could have been obtained. Multiple samples taken within a distance of just 1 – 2 nautical miles reveal substantial variation in mean length of blue whiting in the samples originating from the same haul. Within-haul, between-sample variability is not much less than between haul variation, and may even be larger. Our findings highlight that spatial heterogeneity can be combated (1) by taking more trawl samples and (2) by keeping tow duration sufficiently long.

However, the diet varied geographically and ontogenetically: the proportion of fish in the diet was higher in large blue whiting and {{in the north of}} the range. Blue whiting overlap geographically with other pelagic species at the edge of their distribution in the Barents Sea, with juvenile herring in the south, with polar cod in the north, and with capelin in the northeast. The overlap in diet between blue whiting and these other pelagic species ranged from 6 to 86 % and was greatest with capelin in areas where both species feed on hyperiids and krill. The importance of blue whiting as prey for predatory fish was highest in the areas of greatest abundance, but overall, blue whiting were seemingly unimportant as prey of piscivorous fish in the Barents Sea...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{perception of}} prey species preference of killer whales Orcinus orca L. in the Northeast Atlantic has, {{to a large}} extent, been linked to herring Clupea harengus L. Few studies have investigated the feeding ecology of killer whales from the offshore parts of this ecosystem. We conducted 2 summer-season ecosystem-based surveys in the Norwegian Sea, when it is most crucial for these animals to build up their energy reserves, using observational, acoustic, oceanographic, plankton net, and pelagic trawl haul data to quantify any spatial overlap between killer whales and the 3 most common and abundant pelagic fish species: herring, mackerel Scomber scombrus L., and blue whiting <b>Micromesistius</b> <b>poutassou</b> R. No spatial relationships were found between killer whales and herring or blue whiting. However, {{there was a significant}} relationship and spatial overlap between killer whales and mackerel. Feeding on this epipelagic schooling fish species during summer may incur lower migration costs and higher energetic gain than feeding on alternative prey. Killer whale group size was also correlated to the size of mackerel trawl catches, indicating active group size adjustment to available prey concentrations. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
