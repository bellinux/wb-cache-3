40|$|The {{modifications}} of existing Diesel auto-ignition tabulation for CFD code AVL "FIRE" {{will be presented}} in this paper. Current n-heptane tabulation (used to simulate Diesel behaviour in IC engines) {{did not include the}} phenomenon of cool flame ignition. This phenomenon is important since the temperature of the air/fuel mixture is significantly higher after its occurrence and the simulation results could be improved if this is also taken into consideration when simulating combustion in Diesel engines. Current methods of auto-ignition computation in AVL FIRE are based on the extraction of ignition delay times from tabulated data dependent on four parameters: temperature, pressure, air excess ratio and EGR mass fraction. The new tabulation procedure was developed using the same parameters as starting points for two-step chemical combustion. Temperature changes were observed and a compilation of several criteria was used to determine the start of both cool flame and <b>main</b> <b>ignition.</b> The above parameters were varied and the calculations were performed for each parameter set. Chemical software was used for two-step combustion calculations, using reduced then complex chemical mechanisms, and the results of calculations were stored in a binary file. Results included the values for cool flame <b>ignition</b> delay, <b>main</b> <b>ignition</b> delay, and cool flame and <b>main</b> <b>ignition</b> heat releases. This paper will present the methods used to determine the ignition delays (cool flame and <b>main</b> <b>ignition),</b> as well as results comparing the data acquired using three different chemical mechanisms (three levels of complexity). The data acquired from the calculations would be used to optimize the tabulation procedure using more complex (accurate) chemical mechanisms in a way which will also be described...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to construct a high voltage power supply for laser system. In this attempt multiple-mesh pulse forming technique was performed to obtain electrical pump pulses with a more rectangular shape and long normal-mode laser pulses at constant power. The flashlamp driver was designed with variable input energy. The developed flashlamp driver composes of five major electronic circuits. There are comprised of signal controller device, simmer power supply (SPS), trigger pulse <b>ignition</b> <b>circuit,</b> capacitor charging power supply (CCPS) and multiple-mesh LC pulse forming network (MPFN). The construction of the flashlamp driver is started by designing a signal controller.

The <b>ignition</b> <b>circuit</b> was used to ignite xenon gases which responsible to form ionized spark streamer between the two electrodes of flashlamp. A Low dc current was induced by the simmer power supply to sustain the flashlamp in simmering mode.

50|$|Thermal noise {{can be made}} lower by cooling the circuits, {{but this}} is only usually {{worthwhile}} on radio telescopes. In other applications the limiting noise source depends on the frequency range in use. At low frequencies (longwave or mediumwave) and at high frequencies (shortwave), interference caused by lightning or by nearby electrical impulses in electrical switches, motors, vehicle <b>ignition</b> <b>circuits,</b> computers, and other man-made sources tends to swamp transmissions with thermal noise. These noises are {{often referred to as}} static. Atmospheric noise is radio noise caused by natural atmospheric processes, primarily lightning discharges in thunderstorms. At very high frequency and ultra high frequency these sources can still be important, but at a much lower level, such that thermal noise is usually the limiting factor. Cosmic background noise is experienced at frequencies above about 15 MHz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the sun or to certain other regions of the sky such as the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.|$|R

40|$|This Final Technical Report {{discusses}} {{the progress that}} was made on the experimental and numerical tasks over the duration of this project. The primary objectives of the project were to (1) develop an improved understanding of the spark ignition process, and (2) develop the railplug as an improved ignitor for large bore stationary natural gas engines. We performed fundamental experiments on the physical processes occurring during spark ignition and used the results from these experiments to aid our development of the most complete model of the spark ignition process ever devised. The elements in this model include (1) the dynamic response of the <b>ignition</b> <b>circuit,</b> (2) a chemical kinetics mechanism that is suitable for the reactions {{that occur in the}} plasma, (3) conventional flame propagation kinetics, and (4) a multi-dimensional formulation so that bulk flow through the spark gap can be incorporated. This model (i. e., a Fortran code that {{can be used as a}} subroutine within an engine modeling code such as KIVA) can be obtained from Prof. Ron Matthews at rdmatt{at}mail. utexas. edu or Prof. DK Ezekoye at dezekoye{at}mail. utexas. edu. Fundamental experiments, engine experiments, and modeling tasks were used to help develop the railplug as a new ignitor for large bore natural gas engines. As the result of these studies, we developed a railplug that could extend the Lean Stability Limit (LSL) of an engine operating at full load on natural gas from {phi} = 0. 59 for operation on spark plugs down to {phi} = 0. 53 using railplugs with the same delivered energy (0. 7 J). However, this delivered energy would rapidly wear out the spark plug. For a conventional delivered energy (< 0. 05 J), the LSL is {phi} = 0. 63 for a spark plug. Further, using a permanent magnet to aid the plasma movement, the LSL was extended to {phi} = 0. 54 for a railplug with a delivered energy of only 0. 15 J/shot, a typical discharge energy for commercial capacitive discharge ignition systems. Here, it should be noted that railplugs and the associated <b>ignition</b> <b>circuit</b> should not cost much more than a conventional spark ignition system. Additionally, it is believed that the railplug performance can be further improved via continued research and development...|$|R

The system contains a GPS receiver and a GSM modem interfaced with a microcontroller. To track any vehicle, the vehicle's owner has to send an SMS to the tracking system installed inside the vehicle. Upon receiving the SMS, the microcontroller takes the current location's longitude and latitude coordinates from GPS receiver, packs it into an SMS and sends it to the owner and on a web server using GSM modem. When the web server receives the SMS containing vehicles coordinates, it will show location of the vehicle on Google Maps. For android users, the location is also displayed on an android application.
