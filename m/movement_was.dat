5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas {{concluded that}} despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

50|$|Overt {{orienting}} is {{the act of}} selectively {{attending to}} an item or location over others by moving the eyes to point in that direction. Overt orienting can be directly observed {{in the form of}} eye movements. Although overt eye <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> quite common, there is a distinction that can be made between two types of eye movements; reflexive and controlled. Reflexive <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> commanded by the superior colliculus of the midbrain. These <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> fast and are activated by the sudden appearance of stimuli. In contrast, controlled eye <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> commanded by areas in the frontal lobe. These <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> slow and voluntary.|$|R
