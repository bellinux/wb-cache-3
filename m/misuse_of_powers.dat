5000|$|In European Union law {{the general}} {{principle}} of legal certainty prohibits retroactive laws, i.e. laws {{should not take}} effect before they are published. The general principle also requires that sufficient information must be made public to enable parties {{to know what the}} law is and comply with it. For example, in Opel Austria v Council 1997 ECR II-39 Case T-115/94 The European Court of Justice held that European Council Regulation did not come into effect until it had been published. Opel had brought the action on the basis that the Regulation in question violated the principle of legal certainty, because it legally came into effect before it had been notified and the regulation published. The doctrine of legitimate expectation, which {{has its roots in the}} principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that [...] "those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is or seems to be should not be frustrated in their expectations". This means that a European Union institution, once it has induced a party to take a particular course of action, must not renege on its earlier position if doing so would cause the party to suffer loss. The European Court of Justice has considered the legitimate expectation doctrine in cases where violation of the general principle of legal certainty was alleged in numerous cases involving agricultural policy and European Council regulations, with the leading case being Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij 1988 ECR 2321 Case 120/86. The <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> test is another significant element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. It holds that a lawful power must not be exercised for any other purpose than that for which it was conferred.

50|$|There was {{widespread}} opposition building {{up against the}} authoritarian acts of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In {{the midst of the}} resulting turmoil, Allahabad High Court declared her election invalid on grounds of corrupt electoral practice. On appeal, the Supreme Court of India granted only conditional ‘stay’ of the Order of the High Court. The Supreme Court’s Order prevented Indira Gandhi from participating in the proceedings of the Lok Sabha as a Member and prevented her also from voting. She was however entitled as Prime Minister to participate in the proceedings of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha but was prevented from voting. She responded to the challenge by recommending to the President of India that a proclamation be issued declaring that a grave emergency existed whereby the security of India was threatened by internal disturbance. She added in her letter addressed to the President on June 25, 1975 that the matter was extremely urgent, that she {{would have liked to have}} taken this to the Cabinet but that unfortunately this was not possible that night and recommended that such a proclamation be issued. The Presidential proclamation issued as recommended by the Prime Minister was accordingly dated June 25, 1975. There was no report from the Intelligence Bureau, State Governments or from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to corroborate the facts alleged by her. Clearly, the ‘Emergency’ was a means to buttress her position as Prime Minister. This was followed by censorship of the press. Already, the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971 (MISA) was in place which provided for preventive detention attempts were made to interfere with normal functioning of the Courts by arbitrary transfers of Judges and other actions designed to pack the Courts. The Attorney General of India, the Government’s Chief Law Officer told the Supreme Court that during the emergency, the fundamental rights including the right to life remained suspended. The Court however was unmoved by fears of <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> under emergency. In the famous Habeas Corpus case (ADM Jabalpur Vs. Shivkant Shukla), Justice Chandrachud observed: “Counsel after counsel expressed the fear that during the emergency, the executive may whip and strip and starve the detenu and if this be our judgement, even shoot him down. Such misdeeds have not tarnished the record of Free India and I have a diamond-bright, diamond-hard hope that such things will never come to pass.” The Commission of Enquiry led by Justice J C Shah later documented how the ‘diamond-bright, diamond-hard hope’ was belied by setting out a plethora of facts on the arbitrary killings, atrocities and other executive excesses committed under the cover of emergency. H.M. Seervai, said: “The press was muzzled, and so were the legislatures, for the Acts granting immunity to fair reports of legislative proceedings were repealed, and those proceedings could not be reported. Judicial proceedings could not be reported; public meetings could not be held without the permission of the police which was given to “the cringing and the craven” and refused to sober and responsible men; a servile radio and television worked under government orders. Again, public opinion, which is the safeguard of freedom, was strangled at birth, for all means of forming and expressing public opinion were suppressed. Except in a limited class of cases, grounds of detention were not to be communicated to the detenu and his case was not to be referred to an advisory Board, the legislatures were not to be informed about the precise number of people arrested and released, or their whereabouts.” (‘Constitutional law of India - A Critical Commentary’, Third Edition, Appendix III, para.7.)

Darbas aktualus todėl, kad ši tema yra iš esmės nenagrinėta, kadangi trūksta tiek mokslinių darbų, tiek teismų praktikos. Norint atsakyti į darbe iškeltą klausimą dėmesys buvo skiriamas ir teorinei, ir praktikinei problemos pusei. Todėl, analizuojant teismų jurisprudenciją ir praktikoje susidariusias problemas, buvo siekiama nustatyti, ar dabartinis Lietuvos Respublikos teisinis reglamentavimas, numatydamas Vyriausybės nariams teisinę neliečiamybę dėl valstybei ar institucijoms padarytų nuostolių, nepažeidžia atsakomybės neišvengiamumo principo. Atskleidžiant temą, pasirinkta trijų dalių darbo struktūra. Pirmiausia buvo nagrinėjamas teisinės atsakomybės neišvengiamumo principas pagal dabartinį Lietuvos Respublikos Vyriausybės narių teisinį reguliavimą. Tuomet atskleidžiamas materialinės atsakomybės institutas ir šios atsakomybės taikymo galimybės Lietuvos Respublikos Vyriausybės ministrams. Antroje dalyje analizuojama teisinės neliečiamybės reikšmė: imuniteto samprata, atsiradimo prielaidos ir ministrams taikomo imuniteto pagrindimas. Trečioje darbo dalyje nagrinėjamas Vyriausybės nairiams taikomas teisinės atsakomybės institutas užsienio šalyse. Be to, atskleidžiamos materialinės atsakomybės taikymo problemos ministrų atveju. Darbo pabaigoje pateiktos išvados ir rekomendacijos, siūlant apsvarstyti dabartinį teisinį reguliavimą ir papildyti nauju teisiniu reglamentavimu. Analizuojant teisės aktus, nustatyta, kad ministrai atlieka dvejopo tipo funkcijas: veikia kaip politikai, priimdami Vyriausybėje kolegialius sprendimus, ir kaip administratoriai, vykdydami vidaus administravimo funkcijas ministerijose. Todėl teisinės neliečiamybės instituto taikymas yra objektyviai nepateisinimas tuo atveju, kai ministrams suteikiama teisė vykdyti ministerijos administravimo funkcijas pagal savo nuožiūrą, tačiau neprisiimant asmeninės materialinės atsakomybės už kilusius nuostolius. Atlikta ministrų teisinės atsakomybės analizė parodė, jog Lietuvos Respublikos Vyriausybės nariai iš dalies pažeidžia atsakomybės neišvengiamumo principą padarius nuostolių valstybei ar institucijoms, kadangi nėra numatytos asmeninės materialinės atsakomybės. Application {{of legal}} {{liability}} {{is one of}} the component elements of the legal framework. The most relevant legal liability in this work - the institute of material liability, which functions as a measure of educational nature {{in order to reduce the}} opportunities for corruption. This Thesis analyses the legal liability of one of the main and the most significant executive authorities of the republic of Lithuania, i. e. the Government, or also called as the Cabinet of Ministers. This theme is new and relevant, because the institute of legal liability of the government members in Lithuanian law is a topic, which has not been substantially studied yet. The government members act both as politicians by developing the policy of the state and as administrators by leading the ministries appointed individually; therefore, they are not obligated to assume any legal liability for losses inflicted on the state or institutions. Legal inviolability, i. e. immunity, must be applied to the Government as to the institution making collegial decisions. Because politically-significant decisions are made with majority voting, consequently, application of individual material liability would conflict with the current national rules adopted in accordance with the Constitution. However, it is said that the principle of inevitability is violated when not applying the institute of individual material liability to the ministers carrying out national administrative functions. LR case law develops a new law precedent of court, which raises debatable issues regarding to the contradiction to the current legal regulation of ministers’ liability. Namely, it is the application of individual material liability to a minister who carries out national administrative functions, as well as the requirement to compensate losses inflicted on the state. The circumstances when the body applying the law and the legislature considers the institute of the liability of the Government Members differently create legislative loopholes which cannot exist in the legal regulation. The legal regulations of foreign countries show that it is sufficient for the government and ministers to have political responsibility, and, then, inevitability of liability shall not be applied to them. However, the system of the Government is of a complicated operation, and for this reason, it is important to regulate the institute of the personal legal liability of ministers carrying out administrative functions that it would become an effective tool for impeding illegal activities or damages caused by <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> within the scope of the Government. The hypothesis of this Thesis is that consolidation of personal material liability to the members of LR Government Members ensures inevitability of liability. In order to answer the question provided in this Thesis, the focus was given to both the theoretical and practical sides of the problem. Therefore, when analysing the jurisprudence of court and practical problems, it was striven to establish if the current legal regulation of the Republic of Lithuania supposing legal immunity to the Government Members in cases of losses inflicted on the state or institutions, did not violate the principle of inevitability of liability. First of all, the Thesis investigates the principle of inevitability of liability pursuant to the current legal regulation of LR Government Members. Then, it indicates the institute of material liability and the possibilities of the application of this liability to the ministers of LR Government. The second section analyses the meaning of legal immunity: the conception of immunity, assumptions of its origin and substantiation of the immunity applied to the ministers. The third part of the Thesis studies the institute of legal liability used for Governments in foreign countries. Moreover, it shows the problems of the application of material liability in case of ministers. The end of the Thesis contains its conclusions and recommendations by suggesting to consider the current legal regulation and to consolidate a new legal regulation. The performed analysis of the legal liability of the ministers shows that LR Government Members violate partly the principle of inevitability of liability in cases of losses inflicted on the state or institutions, because no personal material liability is proposed. Taking into consideration that LR Government Members act both as politicians and persons fulfilling the activities of national administration, application of inevitability of liability is not proportional in these two cases. Besides, it should be noted that the most part of losses, i. e. material damages, is made by the ministers carrying out national administrative functions by misusing the granted rights and it is necessary to consider and take measures in order to properly and effectively regulate the issue of legal liability to the minister fulfilling the national administration. After carrying out a scientific research, it is recommended to solve this problem by legislatively establishing personal material liability to the ministers for the damages made due to making illegal decisions when fulfilling national administrative functions...|$|E
