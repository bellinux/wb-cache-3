25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist to know how much water is currently in the soil before deciding if and how much to irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the surface soil appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using tensiometers which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron <b>moisture</b> <b>meters</b> that utilize an aluminium tube with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition to monitoring for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E

5000|$|A {{concrete}} <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> {{is a type}} of <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> used by installers of flooring {{to measure}} the moisture levels of concrete. These meters have been used for decades to measure the moisture content in different materials and substances. Concrete meters have evolved from the successful wood <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> as flooring contractors tried to use their wood meters to measure the moisture in concrete.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the process, it is {{necessary}} to keep close control of the moisture content using a <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> system in order to reduce over-drying and allow operators to know when to pull the charge.

50|$|For typical {{woodworking}} operations, {{two basic}} types of <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> are available. One type measures the electrical {{resistance of the}} wood fibers, which becomes increasingly lower as the moisture content of the wood rises. With the electrical resistance type of <b>moisture</b> <b>meter,</b> two electrodes are driven into the wood fibers and the electrical resistance is translated into moisture content on the device’s electronic or dial output. A second type of <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> relies on the dielectric properties of wood, and requires only surface contact with the wood.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of coal analyzers. Some of the more sophisticated analyzers use prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) or pulsed fast thermal neutron activation (PFTNA) to determine the elemental content of the coal. Another emerging technology for elemental analysis is laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). PGNAA and LIBS enable analysis of sulfur and ash (the latter, by summing the ash constituents). When combined with a second type of analyzer, the moisture meter, they provide moisture and energy value as well. <b>Moisture</b> <b>meters</b> are often found {{in conjunction with the}} elemental analyzers, but sometimes are used alone, or in conjunction with ash gauges.

50|$|Rising damp is {{the common}} term for the slow upward {{movement}} {{of water in the}} lower sections of walls and other ground-supported structures by capillary action. Although rising damp of up to 5 metres in height has been observed the height of rise is typically much lower and is rarely above 1.5m. Rising damp has been a widely observed phenomenon for at least two hundred years. There is also strong evidence to suggest that it was a problem understood by the Romans and Ancient Greeks. In common with most other forms of dampness, rising damp is often misdiagnosed in buildings. Many misdiagnose a wall stain as rising damp instance due to misinterpreting the visual evidence of the wall and the readings of <b>moisture</b> <b>meters.</b>|$|E

It {{is for this reason that}} electrical <b>moisture</b> <b>meters</b> are often used when surveying for rising damp.

5000|$|Both under-watering and over-watering can be {{detrimental}} to a houseplant. The best way {{to determine whether a}} plant needs water is to check the soil moisture. Feeling the soil is most reliable, since <b>moisture</b> <b>meters</b> are often inaccurate. Most potted plants must be allowed to reach an appropriate level of dryness in between waterings, though the amount of watering required varies greatly depending on the species. Proper soil moisture can range from still slightly moist on the soil surface to very dry to nearly the bottom of the pot. Watering a plant by the calendar is not recommended. If a plant does need to be watered, water should be slowly poured over the surface of the soil until it begins to drain out the bottom of the pot, ensuring complete saturation. However, sometimes the soil separates from the sides of the pot if it is allowed to dry out thoroughly, allowing the water to flow down the sides of the rootball and out the bottom too quickly to be absorbed and retained by the soil and roots. If this is the case, {{it may be necessary to}} set the plant in a shallow dish of water long enough for it to soak up enough water to moisten the rootball to its center. Repotting should eliminate this problem. Repotting should be done only when necessary, since the roots of a plant that is in an excessively large pot may rot.|$|E
