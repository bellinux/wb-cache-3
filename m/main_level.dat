5|$|The John Deere House {{was built}} in 1836 when Deere arrived in Grand Detour and the {{building}} was added onto as his family grew. It is furnished with period furniture and household objects {{that would have been}} common around the time the Deere family occupied the home. The house has two levels with four rooms on the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> and two rooms upstairs. Each of the upstairs rooms is accessible via a private staircase and it is believed one of the rooms was used by Deere's apprentices while the other was used as a children's bedroom.|$|E

25|$|The New England barn {{is from a}} {{different}} tradition than the Pennsylvania Barn. In New England the barn doors are always on the gable end. The cows were on the <b>main</b> <b>level,</b> hay in a mow on the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> and/or above in haylofts, possibly grain storage on the <b>main</b> <b>level,</b> sometimes a tack room or workshop and the basement was used for manure management and other tasks. The New England barn developed in the early 19th century, became the most popular barn type after 1850 replacing the smaller, side-entry English barn and are almost always square rule framing.|$|E
25|$|In August 1974, {{construction}} of the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored {{to the top of}} the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the <b>main</b> <b>level,</b> as well as a base for the {{construction of}} the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.|$|E

25|$|The Hartington City Hall and Auditorium {{includes}} three levels: raised basement partially below grade, <b>main</b> <b>level,</b> and upper level. The basement level and <b>main</b> <b>level</b> are basically rectangular in plan, 75 feet (23 meters) wide (north-south along Broadway) and 130 feet (40 meters) {{front to back}} (east-west along Centre). However, the upper level plan is {{in the shape of}} a cross, so that the four corners are one story lower and function as wings. The two front wings project forward toward Broadway as well as laterally (north and south). The two rear wings are flush with the back (east) of the building. The southeast wing projects south and contains the two fire house doors, but the northeast wing does not project north. The basement originally contained the armory including officers’ quarters, lockers, supply room, and sleeping facilities for fire fighters, with the firehouse in back under the auditorium stage. The <b>main</b> <b>level</b> accommodated the lobby and city offices in front, the auditorium’s hardwood floor taking up the large middle, and the stage in back above the fire house. The cross-shaped upper level included a small space in front above the lobby and the stage fly space in back, but the bulk of it in the middle was simply open to the auditorium.|$|E

The venue reopened on September 28, 2016 with a show by ambient musician Tycho.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the 20th century is {{regarded}} by many as the golden age of Romanian culture and it is the period when it reached its <b>main</b> <b>level</b> of international affirmation and a strong connection to the European cultural trends. The most important artist who had a great influence on the world culture was the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși (1876–1957), a central figure of the modern movement and a pioneer of abstraction, an innovator of world sculpture by immersion in the primordial sources of folk creation.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> {{in its current form}} evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (now named SkyPod) {{was not part of the}} plans until some time later. One {{engineer}} in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.|$|E

25|$|Between {{the first}} and second renovations of Geisel Library, several other UCSD library {{facilities}} were also renovated or closed. The biomedical library received a $17 million, 43,454 square foot expansion in 2006. In 2011, the SIO library, the IR/PS library, the Hillcrest Medical Center library, and the Center for Library Instruction and Computing Services (CLICS) were closed and their collections consolidated into Geisel Library due systemwide budget cuts. In 2015, university officials announced that Geisel Library would begin to undergo its second renovation. This renovation includes construction of a café named Audrey's on the <b>main</b> <b>level</b> of the library.|$|E
25|$|Central Library, {{combined}} with the original Scripps Library, the Humanities-Library building (now Galbraith Hall) in Revelle College, and the Biomedical Library (built in 1969), was able to support and represent the growing university for years. In 1990, construction began on a two-story, 136,850 square foot subterranean expansion of the <b>main</b> <b>level.</b> The project included renovation of the existing facility to comply with safety standards and cost $38 million, provided by California's 1988 Proposition 78. The expansion, designed by Gunnar Birkerts, was completed in February 1993. In 1995, La Jolla resident Audrey Geisel donated $20 million to the UCSD Library, supplementing her 1991 donation of $2.3 million worth of her husband Theodor Seuss Geisel's original works. In exchange, the library was renamed Geisel Library.|$|E

25|$|The {{levels of}} the game are {{accessed}} through a world map, in which players can explore to find hidden secrets or access bonus areas to earn more items or coins. Each level contains three hidden collectable Green Stars which are required to access certain levels, and each <b>main</b> <b>level</b> contains a hidden Stamp {{which can be used}} in handwritten posts to Miiverse within the game's community. Players can also view messages left by other players, both on the world map and after clearing a level, and can download 'Mii Ghosts', which are live records of other players completing levels. They are used to race against and sometimes hold gift prizes such as coins or extra lives. Additional Green Stars can be earned in Captain Toad levels, where players control Captain Toad, who cannot jump, as he navigates puzzle-like stages using the GamePad's functionality, and Mystery Houses, where players must clear a series of challenges with short time limits, as well as challenge levels, that have the player complete quick challenges in fast succession.|$|E
25|$|A Boy and His Blob is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle {{platform}} in which players control {{a young boy}} as he cooperates with a blob-like creature to overcome various obstacles. The boy can feed the blob a variety of jellybeans, which are unlocked as the game progresses and {{vary depending on the}} level, which transforms it into one of fifteen different objects {{that can be used to}} solve puzzles and defeat enemies. These include ladders for climbing, anvils to drop on top of enemies, holes that allow the boy to drop through platforms, and cannons for shooting to the hard-to-reach areas. Unlike the original NES game, which only displayed each jellybean's flavor, this version allows players to select beans from a wheel that shows what each bean does. The boy can also hug and scold the blob, as well as call to it to revert its transformation and bring it to his side. However, the boy will die if he touches an enemy or a hazardous object, or falls from a great height, sending the player back to the beginning of the area. The game is split into four worlds, each containing ten levels and a boss battle. Finding three chests hidden within each <b>main</b> <b>level</b> unlocks additional challenge levels, which rewards bonus developer material such as concept art and storyboards when cleared.|$|E
