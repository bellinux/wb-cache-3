5|$|Sheep {{are one of}} the few animals {{where the}} <b>molecular</b> <b>basis</b> of the {{diversity}} of male sexual preferences has been examined. However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams. Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep. OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division of Biology at Caltech, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (and its precursors) at Cambridge, {{and a handful of}} other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with Molecular modelling and the new computational possibilities of digital computing (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of macromolecular structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment with a series of publications regarding the lac operon that established the concept of gene regulation and identified what came to be known as messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the <b>molecular</b> <b>basis</b> of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the <b>molecular</b> <b>basis</b> of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E

5|$|McClintock {{was widely}} {{credited}} with discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered {{the process in}} bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the <b>molecular</b> <b>basis</b> for transposition. In the 1970s, Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons. Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase, which {{is required for the}} element to move within the genome. Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac. Spm has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, Ac/Ds is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Ovarian cancer {{remains a}} major health problem for women. Although there is {{considerable}} clinico-pathological heterogeneity, the <b>molecular</b> genetic <b>basis</b> of ovarian cancer remains poorly understood. Recently, high-resolution genomic maps generated by genome-wide SNP analyses and novel sequencing technologies, have started to dissect the genetic basis of ovarian cancer. METHODS: Here, we will describe our first insights on how somatic mutations {{may contribute to the}} diagnostic re-classification of ovarian cancer. We will discuss how copy number alterations and epigenetic changes represent promising biomarkers to predict resistance to treatment in ovarian cancer, and will also highlight how some of the recently-discovered microRNAs might represent interesting therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Future studies, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas Project, involving a large number of ovarian tumors and combining various high-throughput genetic technologies with sophisticated integrative bioinformatic analyses, will be required and are expected to fine-map the full genetic spectrum of ovarian cancer. It is hoped, however, that once the <b>molecular</b> genetic <b>basis</b> of ovarian cancer is understood, this will lead to better and personalized treatments for ovarian cancer. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The antigen {{is found}} on glycophorin D. This antigen was {{discovered}} in a Finnish man on May 5, 1968, during post operative blood cross matching for an aortic aneurism repair. In Finland the incidence of this antigen {{was found to be}} 6/10,000 donors. In Sweden the incidence was 2/3266 donors. The <b>molecular</b> <b>basis</b> for the origin of this antigen lies within exon 2 where a G->T substitution in codon 67 (base position 199) converts an alanine to a serine residue. While this epitope exists within glycophorin C there it is a cryptantigen. It is only antigenic in glycophorin D because of the truncated N terminus.|$|E

40|$|Although RNase-based {{self-incompatibility}} (SI) {{is suspected}} {{to operate in}} a wide group of plant families, it has been characterized as the <b>molecular</b> genetic <b>basis</b> of SI in only three distantly related families, Solanaceae, Plantaginaceae, and Rosaceae, all described over a decade ago. Previous studies found that gametophytic SI, controlled by a multi-allelic S-locus, operates in the coffee family (Rubiaceae). The <b>molecular</b> genetic <b>basis</b> of this mechanism remains unknown, despite the immense importance of coffee as an agricultural commodity. Here, we isolated ten sequences with features of T 2 -S-type RNases from two Coffea species. While three of the sequences were identified in both species and clearly {{do not appear to}} be S-locus products, our data suggest that six sequences may be S-alleles in the self-incompatible C. canephora, and one may be a relict in the self-compatible C. arabica. We demonstrate that these sequences show style-specific expression, display polymorphism in C. canephora, and cluster with S-locus products in a phylogenetic analysis that includes other plant families with RNase-based SI. Although our results are not definitive, in part because the available plant materials were limited and data patterns relatively complex, our results strongly hint that RNase-based SI mechanism operates in the Rubiaceae family...|$|R
