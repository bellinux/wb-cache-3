More recently, polymetallic sulfide deposits have been discovered and polymetallic sulfide [...] "black muds" [...] are being presently deposited from [...] "black smokers" [...] The cobalt scarcity situation of 1978 has a new option now: recover it from manganese nodules. A Korean firm plans to start developing a <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> recovery operation in 2010; the manganese nodules recovered would average 27% to 30% manganese, 1.25% to 1.5% nickel, 1% to 1.4% copper, and 0.2% to 0.25% cobalt (commercial grade) [...] Nautilus Minerals Ltd. is planning to recover commercial grade material averaging 29.9% zinc, 2.3% lead, and 0.5% copper from massive ocean-bottom polymetallic sulfide deposits using an underwater vacuum cleaner-like device that combines some current technologies in a new way.

5000|$|Manganese {{occurs in}} {{different}} states, including Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+. Todorokite {{is made up}} of (Mn4+O6) octahedra that share edges to form triple chains. These chains share corners to form roughly square tunnels parallel to the b crystal axis. [...] The tunnels accommodate water molecules and large cations such as potassium K+, barium Ba2+, silver Ag+, lead Pb2+, calcium Ca2+ and sodium Na+. [...] The octahedra {{at the edges of the}} triple chains are larger than those in the middle and therefore are likely to accommodate the larger cations (magnesium Mg, manganese Mn3+, copper Cu2+, cobalt Co, nickel Ni etc.), whilst the middle octahedra are occupied by the smaller Mn4+ cations. This structure is similar to that of hollandite (BaMn2+Mn4+7O16) and romanèchite ((Ba,H2O)2(Mn4+,Mn3+)5O10), but with larger tunnels. [...] Although tunnels formed from triple chains of octahedra are most common in todorokite, occasional tunnels have been observed in crystals from both terrestrial and <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> deposits that have one pair of sides formed by triple chains, but with the other pair of sides formed from chains 4, 5, 8 or more octahedra wide.|$|E
40|$|The deep-sea <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> {{contains}} valuable {{elements such}} as Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co. In this study, the effect of iron oxidizing bacteria on the leaching of a <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> was studied. Although the <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> was not leached in a 0. 01 N sulfuric acid solution, the extraction was increased by adding ferrous ion as a reducing agent. As the iron oxidizing bacteria can utilized ferrous ion as a substrate, the leaching of the <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> {{was carried out in}} the presence of ferrous ion and the iron oxidizing bacteria. The results show that the extraction of a mangannese nodule increased with the initial cell concentration. In the oxidative-reductive leaching of a <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> and nickel sulfide, the leaching rates of these two materials incresed. In addition, we also investigated the effect of the bacteria in oxidative-reductive leaching. The increase in the extraction was also observed in the bacterial leaching system...|$|E
40|$|Through the {{application}} of negative reduction potential significant reduction of manganic and iron oxides in the ocean <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules</b> can be achieved, liberating the occluded copper, nickel and cobalt for easy dissolution in an acid medium.

40|$|Internal growth {{features}} of <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules</b> reveal that many nodules are structurally, chemically, and mineralogically non-uniform, {{largely as a}} result of a complex growth history. If numerous investigators are to study the mineralogical and textural {{features of}} <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules,</b> the laboratories concerned must standardize procedures to some extent so that work is not duplicated and so that results can be compared fairly. In particular, we suggest that all investigators, for example, geochemists, mineralogists, and biologists who work with individual nodules, should pay due attention to the internal complexity of nodules while pursuing their individual specialized research. Detailed investigation of the relationships between the internal structure of <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules</b> and the mineralogy and chemical composition is essential to an understanding of nodule origin and of possible problems in economic use of nodules.

40|$|Bacteria, {{found in}} <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules</b> from the Atlantic Ocean, enhance the {{adsorption}} of Mn++ from sea water by crushed <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules</b> {{in the presence}} of peptone. When bacterial outgrowth from crushed <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules</b> was experimentally delayed, peptone did not enhance Mn++ adsorption by nodular substance, but hindered it in some cases. A mechanism to explain the role of bacteria in enhancing Mn++ adsorption by <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules</b> is presented. Oyster shells were shown to adsorb Mn++ in the absence of bacteria. Peptone did not enhance the rate of Mn++ adsorption. Adsorbed Mn++ was not visibly oxidized during experimental observation. These results suggest one way whereby nodule formation may be initiated in the oceans. Some bacteria in the nodules were found to release manganese from them {{in the presence of}} glucose and peptone. Bacteria may, therefore, play a role not only in nodule buildup but also in nodule breakdown...|$|R
40|$|The {{deep ocean}} floor between the Clarion and Clipperton {{fracture}} zones (NE equatorial Pacific) has the highest known <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> abundance in the world oceans. A detailed analysis of MR 1 (Mapping Researcher 1, 11 – 12 kHz) sonar images and free-fall grab data in the Korean <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> field areas reveals a close relationship between side-scan sonar characteristics of the seafloor and <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> abundance. Eight sonar facies are identified based on back-scattering intensity and distribution patterns. These sonar facies {{can be interpreted as}} (1) volcanic seamounts (facies I- 1), (2) bounding faults of abyssal hills (facies I- 2 and II- 1), (3) lava flows or volcanoclastic mass-flow deposits around the volcanic seamounts (facies I- 3 and II- 2), (4) crests of abyssal hills (facies II- 1), (5) abyssal troughs between abyssal hills (facies III- 1), (6) relatively flat areas (facies II- 3 and III- 2). In the areas where facies II- 1 (abyssal hill crests with thin sediment cover) and II- 3 (relatively flat areas draped by thin sediments) are dominant, manganese nodules occur abundantly. In contrast, zones comprising facies III- 1 (abyssal troughs with thick sediment cover) and III- 2 (relatively flat areas covered by thick sediments) are characterized by low abundance of manganese nodules. This relationship between distribution of sonar facies and <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> abundance implies that (1) the qualitative difference in acoustic reflectivity of long-range sidescan sonar with some ground truth data is useful for regional assessment of <b>manganese</b> <b>nodule</b> occurrence over wide areas in a reasonable time, and (2) seafloor topography and sediment thickness are important controlling factors for regional occurrences of manganese nodules...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMagnetotactic {{bacteria}} (MTB) {{are distributed}} ubiquitously in sediments from coastal environments {{to the deep}} sea. The Pacific <b>Manganese</b> <b>Nodule</b> Province contains numerous polymetallic nodules mainly composed of manganese, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel. In the present study we used Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology to assess the communities of putative MTB in deep sea surface sediments at nine stations in the east Pacific <b>Manganese</b> <b>Nodule</b> Province. A total of 402 sequence reads from MTB were classified into six operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Among these, OTU 113 and OTU 759 were affiliated with the genus Magnetospira, OTU 2224 and OTU 2794 were affiliated with the genus Magnetococcus and Magnetovibrio, respectively, OTU 3017 had no known genus affiliation, and OTU 2556 was most similar to CandidatusMagnetananas. Interestingly, OTU 759 was widely distributed, occurring at all study sites. Magnetism measurements revealed that all sediments were dominated by low coercivity, non-interacting single domain magnetic minerals. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the magnetic minerals were magnetosomes.

The metal exhibiting the greatest variability in the 21 box cores is Zn, followed in decreasing order by Cu, Mn, Co, Ni, and Fe.

40|$|Chemical {{analyses}} of <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules</b> from the Central Pacific Basin show that their chemical composition varies regionally, although {{that of the}} associated sediments is markedly uniform throughout the basin.

Fe content tends to enrich in nodules from deep-sea clay area. Most <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules,</b> except those from deep-sea clay, are remarkably depleted in Fe compared with ones from the other Pacific regions. Mostly, Cu and Ni contents exceed 1 % in nodules from siliceous clay, and decrease towards the northwest of the basin where deep-sea clay is distributed. The inter-element relationship between <b>manganese</b> <b>nodules</b> and associated sediments suggests that the mechanism of incorporation of major and minor elements in nodules is apparently {{different from that of}} the associated sediments.
