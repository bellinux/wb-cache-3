5|$|There {{are eight}} {{species of fish}} in the park: Northern pike and European perch are the most common, others include grayling, common <b>minnow,</b> burbot, three-spined stickleback and the least common, brown trout. The trout came up Pasvikelven about 8000 BC. The other species arrived after the last glacial period from Lake Inari and {{ultimately}} from the ten fresh-water Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|Whitefish and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can be caught in creeks. Other fish found in the park include Arctic char, grayling, pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and <b>minnow.</b> Stocking with fish has {{resulted}} in the introduction of Atlantic salmon, vendace and lake trout.|$|E
5|$|Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, {{among them}} cutthroat, bull, and rainbow trout, {{several species of}} salmon, sucker, <b>minnow,</b> sculpin, and lamprey, as well as sturgeon, stickleback, and others. Among the 29 {{non-native}} species in the basin, there are brook, brown, and lake trout, largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, carp, bluegill, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander. Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the American dipper, osprey, and harlequin duck. Garter snakes are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to identifying predators by their appearance, common <b>minnows</b> {{can respond to}} the predators’ motivation to attack. In an experiment, common <b>minnows</b> inspected a northern pike behind a clear partition at regular intervals until the pike tried to attack the <b>minnows.</b> Their responses differed depending on when their visit was made. <b>Minnows</b> that inspected the pike just before the pike attacked were more alarmed than those who inspected the pike long before the attack. The observation shows that common <b>minnows</b> can detect the predator’s impending aggressiveness and motivation to attack.|$|R
50|$|When common <b>minnows</b> {{sense the}} alarm substance, they form tighter shoals as {{individuals}} move {{to be in}} the central position in their shoaling group. However, in an experiment where common <b>minnows</b> were habituated to the chemical by continuous exposure, common <b>minnows</b> did not react to the signal. Only the naïve common <b>minnows</b> reacted to the signal by relocating themselves to the central position in the group. In another experiment, researchers observed common <b>minnows</b> in semi-natural setting and found that common minnows’ shoaling behavior varies depending on the habitat’s complexity. <b>Minnows</b> tend to respond to increased predation risk by forming larger shoals in structurally simple habitats and by reducing their rate of movement in complex habitats.|$|R
5000|$|Silverjaw <b>minnows</b> (Ericymba buccata or Notropis buccatus) {{are part}} of the family Cyprinidae, which {{includes}} carps and <b>minnows.</b> With over 300 known species, there are more species of <b>minnows</b> native to North America's fresh waters than any other fish. [...] <b>Minnows</b> can be hard to distinguish because many look alike. [...] All <b>minnows</b> have one dorsal fin, ventral fins near the anus, a lateral line system (in most species), and smooth, round cycloid scales. [...] Their jaws lack teeth, but they have one to three rows of pharyngeal teeth to grind food. [...] Defining physical characteristics such as the number and type of fin rays, type of scales, and pattern of pharyngeal teeth are used to distinguish <b>minnows.</b>|$|R
5|$|In some {{parenting}} species, young from {{a previous}} spawning batch may stay with their parents and help care for the new young. This is known to occur in around 19 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. These helpers take part in cleaning and fanning eggs and larvae, cleaning the breeding hole and protecting the territory. They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators. Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other <b>minnow</b> species. The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding cichclids collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the cichlid larvae. Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation.|$|E

50|$|When {{potential}} predators {{come near}} the shoal, some common <b>minnows</b> {{take the risk}} of approaching the predators in order to inspect the predator and assess the danger. Predator inspection behavior increases the risk of being attacked and eaten by the predator, but the behavior is beneficial to the inspectors as more alert <b>minnows</b> react more quickly to the attack of the predator. Common <b>minnows</b> are expected to recognize predators by their appearance. In an experiment, common <b>minnows</b> inspected a realistic-looking model of a pike, one of the major predators of <b>minnows,</b> and a simple cylinder model. Common <b>minnows</b> showed high level of alertness, such as low feeding rate and frequent skittering after their visit to the realistic model, but they became easily habituated to the simple model and resumed foraging even in proximity to the model.|$|R

40|$|Student paper, BIOL 3811, 2012 Previous {{studies have}} shown that some animals can exhibit time-place {{learning}}. Our study focused on the ability of time-place learning in fathead <b>minnows.</b> To test this we placed groups of 8 <b>minnows</b> into 11 tank replicates. To prevent room position bias, some tanks had food placed on the right side in the morning and on the left side at night. Remaining tanks had food placed vice versa. After one week of feeding, we recorded the total average positions of <b>minnows</b> in comparison to the correct side where they should have been in the morning and night. Our results showed no significant differences in the total average positioning of <b>minnows</b> within the tanks (t=- 1. 247, df= 10, P= 0. 241). In our study we found that fathead <b>minnows</b> did not exhibit time-place learning.

25|$|The area {{features}} three rare fish species: the venomous stonecat (Noturus flavus), {{the only}} catfish species in Alberta, St. Mary's Sculpin (Cottus bairdi punctulatus), {{and the western}} silvery <b>minnow</b> (Hybognathus argyritis). All three are under threatened status in Alberta, and the western silvery <b>minnow</b> was upgraded to endangered in Canada by COSEWIC in April 2008. Their greatest threats are habitat alteration or loss, changes in water flow or drought water levels, increased siltation, elevated water temperatures, surface water extraction, dam construction, and for the western silvery <b>minnow,</b> introduction of predatory fish species.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Individuals {{that live}} in groups may have the {{opportunity}} to learn to recognize unfamiliar predators by observing the fright responses of experienced individuals in the group. In intraspecific trials, naive fathead <b>minnows,</b> Pimephales promelas, gave fright responses to chemical stimuli from predatory northern pike, Esox lucius, when paired with pike-experienced conspecifics but not when paired with pike-naive conspecifics. These pike-conditioned <b>minnows</b> retained the fright responses to pike odour when tested alone, indicating that learning had occurred, and transmitted their fright responses to pike-naive <b>minnows</b> in subsequent trials. Brook stickleback, Culaea inconstans, are found in mixed-species aggregations with fathead <b>minnows</b> and are also vulnerable to predation by northern pike. In a series of interspecific tests, pike-naive brook stickleback gave fright responses to chemical stimuli from northern pike when paired with pike-experienced <b>minnows</b> but not when paired with pike-naive <b>minnows.</b> Pike-conditioned stickleback also retained the fright responses when tested alone and subsequently also transmitted the fright responses to pike-naive <b>minnows.</b> Individuals may benefit from observations of the fright responses of conspecifics or heterospecifics by (1) being alerted to the immediate presence of unfamiliar predators and (2) learning to recognize unfamiliar predators as a potential threat...|$|R

25|$|In 1999 a {{group of}} conservationists filed suit against the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers {{on the grounds that}} they had failed to {{adequately}} consult with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, as required under the Endangered Species Act, to determine if action should be taken to avoid jeopardizing the <b>minnow.</b> The case revolved around whether the Bureau of Reclamation had the authority to use water to assist the <b>minnow</b> when this might affect delivery of water under contract to existing users.|$|E
50|$|Ostariophysan fishes, {{which include}} fathead <b>minnows,</b> possess an alarm substance, or Schreckstoff, in {{distinctive}} epidermal club cells. The alarm substance is released upon mechanical damage to these club cells {{due to a}} predator attack, and can be detected by other ostariophysan fishes which then engage in antipredator behaviors such as hiding or dashing away. Fathead <b>minnows</b> learn to recognize an animal as a potential predator when it is presented {{in conjunction with the}} alarm substance. Also, alarm substance ingested by the predator will chemically label it as dangerous to naïve fathead <b>minnows,</b> thereby resulting in learned predator recognition. Prey fishes with chemical predator recognition abilities can inhabit areas with low visibility and more quickly detect ambush predators like the fathead <b>minnow’s</b> primary predator, the northern pike.|$|R
