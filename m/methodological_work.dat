40|$|In this article, travelogues and ethnographies of {{equatorial}} Africa form a {{point of}} departure for reflections on the construction of the "primitive," the "wild," and the "cannibal," in Gabon and neighboring areas. Travel narratives from various periods are discussed, from the first contacts between Europeans and Africans to the studies of German ethnologist Günter Tessmann (1884 - 1969). The paper also addresses discourse on anthropophagy by African ethnic groups, especially the Okanda and the Mpongwé, showing that they contributed to negative external definitions of their neighbors, the Pahouin and the Fang, especially the latter. Because the subject of anthropophagy is treated here as a topos, it implies reflecting over res ficta as well as res facta - travelogues as well as ethnographic history.

In fact, it is argued that these philosophical tensions actually contributed to its influence.

There is a 60 %- 30 % balance between empirical research and theory articles, and 10 % split between research reviews and <b>methodological</b> <b>works.</b> Quantitative research dominated early, but has waned; qualitative research has increased. Curriculum, learning, and teaching studies are roughly equal, with a recent upsurge in teaching research. Curriculum-oriented inquiry is increasingly dominated by normative theory. Learning studies aim most at intellectual development, with a recent focus on historical understanding. Teaching studies are dominated by pedagogy and methods research, with a recent emphasis on teacher thinking and perspectives. Subject matter is seen as general social studies about 20 % of the time, and as disciplines about 40 %, most notably history and economics.

40|$|Political {{theorists have}} long noted the “liberal” {{dimensions}} of Max Weber 2 ̆ 7 s theory of politics. In doing so, I believe they overlook the anti-political overtures in his push for national glory, his mechanical design of parliamentarism, and his desperate faith in plebiscitarian leaders—all of which constrain {{the prospect of}} human struggle underlying his idea of politics. Political theorists who address Weber 2 ̆ 7 s works on science and methodology have viewed them as “correlates” of his theoretical project of politics. I contend that they too ignore {{the degree to which}} Weber 2 ̆ 7 s <b>methodological</b> <b>works</b> reveal an immanent critique of his own theory of politics in particular and the craft of political theorizing in general. ^ In this dissertation I confirm the anti-political overtures that underlie Max Weber 2 ̆ 7 s theory of politics. I challenge his theory of liberal democracy insofar as he anchors it to his public and quite problematic advocacy of German national glory. But more important, I charge that his scientific and <b>methodological</b> <b>works</b> provide greater insight into the elements that comprise a theory of politics in his thinking. I believe they do so in that Weber 2 ̆ 7 s theory of scientific scholarship posits the aim of ethical clarity, the divide between facts and values, and the conditional quality of all human values. I thus turn Weber the ethical scholar against Weber the active citizen. ^ With this critique, I draw several conclusions about the contemporary value of Max Weber 2 ̆ 7 s political thinking. In clarifying the differences between his concepts of political judgment (Augenmass) and scholarly judgment (Urteil), I confirm that where the former succumbs to the dictates of one conviction, the latter ultimately contests all convictions. Based on this contrast, I also affirm how Weber 2 ̆ 7 s idea of scholarship invites more fruitful prospects of political struggle, prospects that extend outside the “life-sphere” of the liberal institutions of politics. Finally, from this alternative location of politics, I suggest that Weber 2 ̆ 7 s idea of an ethic of responsibility (Verantwortungsethik) includes the scholar as much as the politician, especially a scholar who contests the ultimate ends of the politician, other scholars, and one 2 ̆ 7 s own self. ...|$|R

Over the last 35 years, historiography was obviously influenced by foreign trends, and it developed into new history, specifically, the interpretative history. This last change appeared in numerous works which, in addition to the description of events, attempted also to interpret them by correlating education with both the socio-political and the ideological-political conditions of the period. These works are influenced by the international trends in historiography such as the School of Annales, the Marxistic theories, the theories of reproduction, of dependence, etc...|$|R
