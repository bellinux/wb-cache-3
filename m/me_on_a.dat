5|$|Wodehouse's {{early period}} {{as a writer}} {{came to an end}} in 1908 with the {{serialisation}} of The Lost Lambs, published the following year in book form as {{the second half of the}} novel Mike. The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, Psmith, whose creation both Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse's development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte—"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> silver plate with watercress around it". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: Psmith in the City (1910), a burlesque of banking; Psmith, Journalist (1915) set in New York; and Leave It to Psmith (1923), set at Blandings Castle.|$|E

25|$|In 1982 Tell <b>Me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunday was {{combined}} with Lloyd Webber's other successful album Variations, which had featured his brother, cellist Julian Lloyd Webber, {{to create the}} show Song and Dance. The first act saw Webb reprise her role as the unnamed girl. In the second act Wayne Sleep and a dance troupe performed choreographed routines to the music from Variations. The pair toured with the show {{in the latter half}} of the decade.|$|E
60|$|ALDEN,--dear {{and ancient}} friend--it is a solemn moment. You have now {{reached the age}} of discretion. You have been a long time arriving. Many years ago you docked <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> article because the subject was too old; later, you docked <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> article because the subject was too new; later still, you docked <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> article because the subject was betwixt and between. Once, when I wrote a Letter to Queen Victoria, you did not put it in the respectable part of the Magazine, but interred it in that potter's field, the Editor's Drawer.

25|$|In 2003, she {{returned}} to the London stage at the Gielgud Theatre in Andrew Lloyd Webber's one-woman show Tell <b>Me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunday, which he reworked for her. She was a huge success and the show ran for nearly a year. She then joined the cast of the established ITV sentimental drama Where the Heart Is as one of the lead characters, playing single mother Kim Blakeney, continuing for two series.|$|E
25|$|On stage she has {{starred in}} the one-woman musical Tell <b>Me</b> <b>On</b> <b>A</b> Sunday, which toured the UK, and played in London's West End.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the following year, she again reprised her role in Tell <b>Me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunday, first for a limited run before the closure of the show in the West End and subsequently on tour. The show had been substantially rewritten for a production starring Denise Van Outen, but a combination of the new and original scores was created specifically for Webb. She appeared in many of the principal venues on the tour, but in other locations the show was performed by Faye Tozer and Patsy Palmer.|$|E
25|$|Variations (1978) – A set {{of musical}} {{variations}} on Niccolò Paganini's Caprice in Aminor that Lloyd Webber composed for his brother, cellist Julian. This album featured fifteen rock musicians including guitarist Gary Moore and pianist Rod Argent and reached number 2 in the UK album chart upon its release. It was later combined with Tell <b>Me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunday to form one show, Song and Dance. Lloyd Webber also used variation five {{as the basis}} for Unexpected Song in Song and Dance. The main theme is used as the theme music to The South Bank Show.|$|E
25|$|Particularly {{since coming}} to fame through Tell <b>Me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunday, Webb has {{regularly}} performed on British television. In the 70s and 80s she appeared in the BBC's TV show, The Good Old Days, performing the song 'Sing us One of the old Songs, George' a piece which became her own for the show. Prior to her performance in Evita, though, she appeared in the television series The Songwriters, about songwriting partnerships. The final episode of the series featured Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice and she first met the pair, briefly, while recording the programme.|$|E

500|$|Up to this point, Poe had {{not written}} much poetry. His {{earliest}} lines of verse were a couplet labeled [...] "Poetry", presumably written sometime in 1824 in the ledger book of Allan & Ellis, his foster father's mercantile company. The lines read: [...] "Last night with many cares & toils oppress'd / Weary, I laid <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> couch to rest—". The earliest known full-length poem by Poe, [...] "O, Tempora! O, Mores!", is a satirical poem whose authorship {{is the subject}} of some dispute. Nevertheless, calling himself [...] "irrecoverably a poet", he had been working on a few longer poems at the University of Virginia, whose manuscripts he brought with him to Boston.|$|E

Musically, the track contains [...] "slick" [...] production and a rock-inspired drum beat, a [...] "zippy" [...] piano melody and [...] "ebullient" [...] brass instrumentation. In an interview with Popjustice's Peter Robinson, Trainor said: [...] "It's my lil' list of things he should probably be aware of if he wants to marry me.

[...] Many of the Union generals would eventually be memorialized in Washington, D.C., with statues spread throughout the city. [...] While looking {{at one of his}} comrade's equestrian sculptures, Sheridan was not impressed with the depiction of the man and horse. [...] He reportedly told his wife [...] "Whatever you do after I'm gone, don't put <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> horse like that." [...] Following her husband's death in 1888, when an equestrian sculpture of her husband was being planned, Irene Sheridan insisted the horse be as [...] "proud and courageous as its rider." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 1996, Madonna {{went through}} a number of [...] "life-changing experiences" [...] which {{included}} giving birth to her daughter Lourdes, gaining interest in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, as well as earning the title role on the film adaptation of the musical Evita (1996). A year later she started working on Ray of Light, her eighth studio album. Madonna wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard, Rick Nowels and Babyface. The album would reflect the singer's changed perspectives about life. Author Carol Benson noted that it was a [...] "deeply spiritual dance record", with the crux of it based on Madonna's career, her journey and the many identities she had assumed over the years. Motherhood had softened the singer emotionally, which was reflected in the songs. She started talking about ideas and used words which implied deep and personal thoughts, rather than the regular dance-floor anthemic tunes she had composed. The singer began introspecting herself with motherhood being a [...] "big catalyst for me. It took <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before", she said to Q magazine.|$|E

500|$|While {{there has}} been {{speculation}} that the song is about drugs such as LSD or marijuana, particularly with lines such as [...] "take <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> trip upon your magic swirling ship" [...] and [...] "the smoke rings of my mind", Dylan has always denied the song is about drugs. Though he was using marijuana {{at the time the}} song was written, Dylan was not introduced to LSD until a few months later. Other commentators have interpreted the song as a call to the singer's spirit or muse, or the singer's search for transcendence. In particular, biographer John Hinchey has suggested in his book Like a Complete Unknown that the singer is praying to his muse for inspiration; Hinchey notes that ironically the song itself is evidence the muse has already provided the sought-after inspiration. Mr. Tambourine Man has also been interpreted as a symbol for Jesus Christ and for the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The song may also reference gospel music, with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation.|$|E
500|$|While {{working in}} the studio for her fifth studio album, Beyoncé demanded from Miguel to write a song in which nothing was [...] "off-limits" [...] and where he could push the {{envelope}} creatively. He recalled that they collaborated soon after she had had her first baby. Inside the studio, she told him, [...] "'Listen I feel so empowered at this time and place. You'll have to put <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pedestal, like, never mind that it's Beyoncé. I wanna make music {{that makes me feel}} or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's what I meant in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel was inspired by the singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé to say to me, as a man? What have I not heard her say? That's where the song came from." [...] He further noted that [...] "Rocket" [...] managed to showcase a new part of the singer which was confident, sexual and liberating at the same time.|$|E
500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna and American {{producer}} and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom {{she gave birth to}} in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. [...] "That was a big catalyst for me. It took <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before," [...] she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including [...] "Nothing Really Matters". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of [...] "Nothing Really Matters"'s music. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work {{for a long time and}} was pleased with the demo version, which he started to work on.|$|E
