5|$|After initial assessments, the HUSAR team {{felt they}} had the proper {{equipment}} for the mission. In {{the early hours of}} <b>Monday</b> <b>morning,</b> June 25 – and despite discovering signs of life – rescue work was suspended due to the danger of additional concrete falling on the potential survivors and the HUSAR rescuers.|$|E
5|$|On <b>Monday</b> <b>morning,</b> {{the storm}} had moved {{northeast}} of London, Ontario, dragging lake effect blizzards in its wake. An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the streets with snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take shelter and wait for things to clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{fears of}} {{terrorism}} received an extra boost from {{the disruption of}} communications and news as facilities were devoured by the fire. The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on <b>Monday</b> <b>morning,</b> through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames. The whole nation depended on these communications, and the void which they left filled up with rumours.|$|E

When her room was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not clear whether Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and <b>Monday</b> <b>morning.</b> On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E

She completed her undergraduate studies in one year, and decided to earn a master's degree in health administration. In 1972, Shabazz {{enrolled at}} the University of Massachusetts Amherst to pursue an Ed.D. in higher education administration and curriculum development. For the next three years, she drove from Mount Vernon to Amherst, Massachusetts, every <b>Monday</b> <b>morning,</b> and returned home Wednesday night. In July 1975, she defended her dissertation and earned her doctorate.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 September 1981, Bill Shankly was {{admitted}} to Broadgreen Hospital following a heart attack.

But, on the following <b>Monday</b> <b>morning,</b> his condition suddenly deteriorated and was transferred into intensive care. At 00:30 on 29 September, he suffered another cardiac arrest and was certified dead, aged 68, at 01:20.

She also spent 20million rupees for a slot on a leading channel for a promotion for the film. Askhay Kumar, Sonakshi Sinha and Imran Khan (the three leads) {{promoted the}} film on Comedy Nights with Kapil, hosted by Kapil Sharma. Kumar, Sinha, Khan, Kapoor {{and most of}} the other cast and crew visited the Dargah Sharif (a shrine to the Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer) on <b>Monday</b> <b>morning,</b> 5 August, to pray for the film's success and the well-being of all involved.|$|E
5|$|After Scott B. Smith had {{published}} {{a short story}} for The New Yorker, the magazine's fiction editor learned of his then-unpublished novel A Simple Plan before reading it and forwarding it to an agent. Shortly thereafter, Smith learned that Mike Nichols was interested in purchasing the film rights to his novel. Nichols spent a weekend reading the book, before contacting Smith's agent, and finalizing a deal the following <b>Monday</b> <b>morning.</b> Nichols purchased the rights for his production company Icarus Productions for $250,000, with an additional $750,000 to come later from a studio interested in pursuing the project. Smith’s manuscript of A Simple Plan was optioned for development at an independent film studio, Savoy Pictures. However, due to scheduling conflicts with a planned film adaptation of All the Pretty Horses, Nichols {{stepped down from the}} project.|$|E
5|$|After regular {{ballots were}} counted, Pryce led Kilroy by over 3,500 votes with about 19,000 {{provisional}} ballots outstanding. The Franklin county absentee and provisional ballots were not counted until approximately {{two weeks after}} the election. On Monday November 27, nearly three weeks after Election Day, Pryce was declared the winner by a 1,054 vote margin that mandated a recount. After two recounts and all of the votes were counted, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce (R) prevailed over Democratic challenger Mary Jo Kilroy. The Franklin County Board of Elections announced the results <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> December 11, 2006. Pryce (R) gained 25 votes and Kilroy (D) gained 18 votes in the recount of votes in Franklin, Union, and Madison Counties in Ohio. Pryce won with 50.20% of the vote by a 110,739–109,677 margin. Kilroy felt her campaign was slowed by the early candidacy of fellow Franklin County Commissioner Paula Brooks, who eventually withdrew. Immediately after losing in 2006, she announced she would recontest the seat in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Sunday was a rest day, and {{the match}} resumed on <b>Monday</b> <b>morning.</b> In the third over of the day, Lindwall {{was the last}} man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Bradman's men had added only one run to its {{overnight}} score of 457/9. Bedser took the final wicket as Lindwall edged, and Crapp took the catch low down in the slips with his left hand. Bedser ended with 3/92 and Laker 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each. England's use of Cranston as an all rounder had not been successful; he conceded almost four runs per over without taking a wicket. Although England only had a slight lead, Australia had the disadvantage of being a bowler short due to Toshack's injury. This meant Johnston and Johnson among the slower bowlers were left to exploit the wearing pitch.|$|E
5|$|When Davidson {{returned}} home {{he found that}} Molly was six months pregnant. The dates of his service leave during 1918 made it apparent {{that he was not}} the father. A daughter was born on 21 June 1919; the likely father was a Canadian army colonel, Ernest Doudemain, a friend from Davidson's schooldays who had lodged at the rectory {{in the latter part of}} 1918. Although deeply upset by his wife's infidelity, Davidson accepted the child—who bore some resemblance to him—as his own. To escape the poisoned atmosphere in Stiffkey he applied for a year's posting as chaplain to a hill station at Simla in India, but the opportunity fell through. Instead, Davidson resumed his pre-war routine of spending his weeks in London, departing early on <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> and returning late on Saturday. Sometimes, through a missed rail connection or other mishap, he was barely in time for the Sunday morning service at Stiffkey, and sometimes he would fail to arrive at all.|$|E

25|$|In July 2009, Georgie Gardner was {{appointed}} Nine News Sydney presenter on Friday and Saturday nights, she juggled her commitments with Today news presenter. This {{meant that she}} was only able to commit to her role on Today 4 days of the week. Therefore, the Weekend Today news presenter would present news on the Monday edition of Today as well. The <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> news presenters have included Amber Sherlock (2009-2010), Alicia Loxley (2010-2011) and Deborah Knight (2011-2014). In 2014, Sylvia Jeffreys took over from Gardner as news presenter on Today.
