5|$|In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{finalized}} {{plans to}} overhaul the station completely. In 1999, the MTA requested $125 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> funding for the renovation. As part of renovation, a group of satellite dishes was proposed for the station. By this point, the New York City Transit Police were operating from a tent adjacent to the station, and there were vestiges of a carousel within the station.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 2008, the FTA {{reversed}} the earlier decision and approved the above-ground project, {{saying that it}} met standards for cost efficiency, construction and ridership, moving it closer to receiving the $900 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> funding. Officials told The Washington Post that the project would move into the final design stage. The FTA approved funding for the project on December 4, 2008.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of Federal and State funding was {{obtained for the}} project. In March 1972, the entire cost of the section between 34th Street and 126th Street, according to the project's Draft Environmental Study, {{was estimated to be}} $381 million. In June 1972, it was announced that the UMTA would grant $25 million for the construction of this section of the line. The MTA had requested $254 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> funds for {{the northern part of the}} line. Preliminary estimates of the cost of the southern portion of the line came to $450 million.|$|E

5|$|In April 2009, Beshear {{announced}} {{a partnership between}} the University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville, and Chicago-based Argonne National Laboratory to construct a research facility in Lexington to develop advanced battery technologies {{that could be used}} to power electric cars. A week later, the National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Battery Cell Manufacture announced they would locate a battery manufacturing plant in Hardin County, citing the nearby research facility as an incentive for choosing Kentucky over competing sites. The venture, however, was predicated upon receiving $342 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> stimulus funds; in August 2009, those funds were denied, and officials conceded it was unlikely that the plant would be built.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, local {{officials}} began to consider constructing a new station to serve both Amtrak trains and the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority, which {{had taken over}} private bus services {{in the area in}} 1974. Between 1993 and 1999, BRTA administrator Diane Smith worked to advance plans for an intermodal transit center. A study completed in January 1998 provided cost-benefit analysis and preliminary costs and recommended eight sites for further study. Based on this, Congressman John W. Olver obtained $8.615 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> earmarks to fund the project; the state provided the 20% local match to reach the full $11 million cost.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2016, the MassDOT Board {{approved}} {{spending an}} additional $19 million {{to finish the}} station {{by the end of}} September, bringing the total cost of the extension to $93.3 million. The additional cost included replacement for several Pan Am Southern-owned bridges which were in poorer shape than originally thought, and night and weekend work to speed completion. Service to the station had to begin by September 30, or the state risked a revocation of the $59.2 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> funds. Limited service began on September 30, 2016, with two weekday round trips; full service began with the schedule change on November 21, 2016.|$|E

5|$|On July 26, 2013, the executors of the Estate of Michael Jackson filed a {{petition}} in the United States Tax Court {{as a result}} of a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over U.S. federal estate taxes imposed on the value of Jackson's Estate at the time of his death. The executors claim that the Estate was worth about $7 million. The IRS asserts that the Estate was worth over $1.1 billion, and that over $700 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> estate taxes (including penalties) are due. A trial was held from February 6 to 24, 2017. As of early July 2017, no decision has been rendered.|$|E
5|$|The {{turn of the}} 20th century {{brought the}} Progressive Era to Mobile. The {{economic}} structure developed with new industries, generating new jobs and attracting {{a significant increase in}} population. The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920. During this time the city received $3 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels. During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health, with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important industries.|$|E
5|$|American Airlines {{announced}} in 1985 {{that it would}} establish a hub at Nashville, investing $115 million {{to develop a new}} 15-gate concourse and applying for $50 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> funds to build a new 10,000-foot runway. The hub was intended to compete with Delta Air Lines, Eastern Airlines and Piedmont Airlines for north-south traffic in the eastern United States. American and its regional affiliate American Eagle officially opened their hub in Nashville in April 1986. Besides providing nonstop flights to many cities in the U.S. and Canada, American also operated a transatlantic flight to from Nashville to London (flying into Gatwick Airport). The American hub was touted as a selling point in bringing companies such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation to the Nashville area.|$|E

5|$|On September 26, President Gerald Ford {{approved}} the declaration for Florida, and later issued a separate declaration for 30 counties in Pennsylvania as the storm's flooding rains progressed northward. Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Ernest Kline assigned 600 National Guardsmen {{to assist in}} the evacuation of flood victims and maintain security in storm-ravaged areas. Over $430 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> disaster relief was spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92,000 families; the bulk of the funds went to recovery for areas affected by Hurricane Eloise along its entire course. In Maryland, Governor Marvin Mandel placed 10 of the state's 23 counties under a state of emergency. Following the severe damage caused by Hurricane Eloise, its name was retired {{at the end of the}} 1975 season. As such, the name was removed from the rotating lists of names used in the Atlantic hurricane basin. However, Eloise was not replaced by any particular name due to the addition of male names into the lists in 1979.|$|E
5|$|From the {{introduction}} of Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) funding in 1965 until the mid-2000s, Wedgemere station remained essentially static. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required transit agencies to make certain stations handicapped accessible. A number of high-ridership stations on the MBTA Commuter Rail system were upgraded, but due to its relatively low ridership — less than 600 riders per day as of 2009 — Wedgemere was not chosen as a key station for upgrades. Wedgemere had older low-level platforms, and access from the street was via stairs only. Beginning in 2008, a local family lobbied the MBTA to make the station accessible; in July 2009, the Federal Transit Administration granted the MBTA permission to build mini-high platforms. (Full-length high level platforms {{would not have been}} possible because the Lowell Line is a designated freight corridor; full-length platforms cause operational difficulties with freight trains. Wedgemere does not have room for a dedicated freight passing track like Anderson RTC.) In February 2010, the MBTA announced that $2 <b>million</b> <b>in</b> <b>federal</b> stimulus funds had been allotted to the project, part of a grant that also funded construction of the John W. Olver Transit Center and repairs to the Red Line tunnels between Harvard and Alewife. The work was then intended to be finished by the end of 2010.|$|E

5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010.
