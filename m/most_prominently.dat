5|$|The Teen Idles {{appeared}} on several hardcore punk compilations throughout the 1980s and 1990s, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> the influential collection Flex Your Head, issued by Dischord in January 1982.|$|E
5|$|Details {{about the}} {{religious}} life in Qatna {{are not available}} due to the rarity of written evidence from the city; in general, many cults seems to have existed and mixed in Qatna, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> the royal ancestor cult, the cult of gods and {{the cult of the}} dead.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis is {{suspected}} based on lesion circumstances and clinical evidence, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> a neurological examination, for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally {{in response to}} light and assigning a Glasgow Coma Score. Neuroimaging helps in determining the diagnosis and prognosis and in deciding what treatments to give.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane also {{provides}} the voices for various other recurring and one-time only characters, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> those of news anchor Tom Tucker, Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman. He {{is the only}} voice to be in every episode.|$|E
5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. The mechanics of a Peléan eruption {{are very similar}} to that of a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure is able to withstand more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Stafford blames Arab nationalists, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and Bakr Sidqi. According to him, Iraqi Army {{officers}} despised the Assyrians, and Sidqi {{in particular}} was vocal of his hate for them. This view was also shared by British officials who recommended to Faysal not {{to send him to}} the north during the crisis.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{professional}} leagues {{were founded}} in many Latin American countries, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955). Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs {{from the four}} leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan, Province of China (1990) and China (2003) all have professional leagues.|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier's, Reasons of State (El recurso del método, 1974), is a {{synthesis}} of several historical figures from Latin American, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> Gerardo Machado, dictator of Cuba. This fictional character, in his bid to be refined, spends half {{of his life in}} Europe, perhaps reminiscent of Sarmiento's dichotomy of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine elements of both tragedy and comedy.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to capture}} Taegu {{as part of}} the Great Naktong Offensive, the North Korean People's Army's 1st and 13th Divisions {{advanced}} to the hill masses north of the city where they confronted the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK Army's 1st Division. The North Koreans sought to occupy a number of hill masses, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> Hill 902, known to South Koreans as Ka-san, for the ancient fortress situated atop it.|$|E
5|$|Bonds {{has not had}} a jersey number retired {{by either}} the Pirates or Giants, {{although}} there have been calls by fans of both teams to retire their respective uniform numbers held by Bonds. His number 24 with the Pirates remains in circulation, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> worn by Brian Giles from 1999 to 2003 and by Pedro Alvarez from 2011 to 2015. The Giants have not reissued Bonds's number 25.|$|E
5|$|Each Senator has {{at least}} one {{standing}} committee assignment. The first is to one of the four legislative committees: Budget and Taxation; Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs (listed in this table as Education, Health, and Environment); Finance; or Judicial Proceedings. A number of Senators have secondary committee assignments, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> to the Executive Nominations Committee, which oversees the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to approve nominations by the Governor. Assignment to the Rules or Executive Nominations committees or to any Ad Hoc committees is not noted.|$|E
5|$|George is a {{supporting}} character {{who appeared in}} various adaptations of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, played by Hugh Laurie. Each series saw a different incarnation of the character, because each was set in a different period of history. He was <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> featured {{in the third and}} fourth series. The character was added to the series as a replacement for the Lord Percy Percy character, who did not appear in the third instalment because Tim McInnerny, the actor playing him, feared being typecast.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite his}} success and {{important}} AFL records, he is <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> {{listed in the}} NFL record book for less flattering accomplishments, including his place as a former record holder for most quarterback sacks in a game. Despite Kemp's many records, Joe Namath and Len Dawson were selected as the quarterbacks for the All-time AFL team. Kemp {{is a member of}} the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Buffalo Bills' Wall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|In 1613, John Sigismund {{converted}} from Lutheranism to Calvinism, {{but failed to}} achieve {{the conversion of the}} estates by the rule of cuius regio, eius religio. Thus, on 5 February 1615, he granted the Lutherans religious freedom, while the electors court remained largely Calvinist. When Frederick William I rebuilt Brandenburg-Prussia's war-torn economy, he attracted settlers from all Europe, especially by offering religious asylum, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> by the Edict of Potsdam which attracted more than 15,000 Huguenots.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar {{is widely}} used as a product name, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> for a British luxury car brand. The name has been adopted by sports franchises, {{including}} the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and the Mexican soccer club Chiapas F.C. The crest of Argentina's national federation in rugby union features a jaguar; however, because of a journalist error, the country's national team is nicknamed Los Pumas. In {{the spirit of the}} ancient Mayan culture, the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City adopted a red jaguar as the first official Olympic mascot.|$|E
5|$|Mona Penelope Simpson (née Olsen) is a {{recurring}} fictional {{character in the}} animated television series The Simpsons. She has been voiced by several actresses, including Maggie Roswell, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, and <b>most</b> <b>prominently,</b> Glenn Close. Glenn Close's performances as Mona have been well received by critics and she was {{named one of the}} top 25 guest stars on the show by IGN.|$|E
5|$|The 181-room hotel, {{opened in}} 1902, was {{designed}} by architect Goldwin Starrett. It was originally conceived as a residential hotel but was quickly converted to a traditional lodging establishment. Its first owner-manager, Frank Case (who bought the hotel in 1927), established many of the hotel's traditions. Perhaps its best-known tradition is hosting literary and theatrical notables, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> {{the members of the}} Algonquin Round Table.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> on the building's interior.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003, running {{independently}} {{from the}} pioneering FWD night, an event called Filthy Dub, co promoted by Plastician, and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly. It was there that Skream, Benga, NType, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, dub values, and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of sounds and influences to the genre, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> reggae and dub, as well as orchestral melodies.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasys {{popularity}} sparked Uematsu's {{career in}} video game music, {{and he would}} go on to compose music for over 30 titles, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> the subsequent games in the Final Fantasy series. He scored the first installment in the SaGa series, The Final Fantasy Legend, in 1989. For the second game in the series, Final Fantasy Legend II he was assisted by Kenji Ito. In late 1994, Uematsu signed on to finish the soundtrack for the critically acclaimed title Chrono Trigger after the game's composer, Yasunori Mitsuda, contracted peptic ulcers. In 1996, he co-composed the soundtrack to , and created the entire score for DynamiTracer. He also created music for three of the games in the Hanjuku Hero series.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Michael Naify and William Nasser {{turned to}} Pflueger {{again for a}} new {{neighborhood}} theater design based on the Alhambra in Grenada, Spain. The Alhambra Theatre opened on November 5, 1926 with a grand facade flanked by twin minarets that glowed red at night. Pflueger's vision stayed firmly planted in the Moorish Revival style, complete to the iron scrollwork and amber shade redesign of two municipal streetlamps standing outside of the theater. Pflueger worked with muralist Arthur Frank Mathews to achieve a rich palette of color <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> displayed in a geometric floral pattern on the main ceiling. The Alhambra was named San Francisco Landmark No. 217 in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Welsh {{roots of}} the college {{come to the fore}} <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> on Saint David's Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, {{decorated}} for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a small minority of the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford. The college's annual St. David's Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn's Pudding. The name recalls the Welsh politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Junos soundtrack, Music {{from the}} Motion Picture Juno, was {{released}} January 15, 2008, features nineteen songs from Barry Louis Polisar, Belle & Sebastian, Buddy Holly, Cat Power, The Kinks, Mott the Hoople, Sonic Youth and The Velvet Underground, and <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> Kimya Dawson and her former bands The Moldy Peaches and Antsy Pants. Under the Rhino Entertainment record label, {{it became the}} first number one soundtrack since the Dreamgirls , 20th Century Fox's first number one soundtrack since the Titanic soundtrack, and Rhino's first number one album, topping the American Billboard 200 music charts in its fourth week of release.|$|E
5|$|Lava {{flows from}} Mauna Kea {{overlapped}} in complex layers {{with those of}} its neighbors during its growth. <b>Most</b> <b>prominently,</b> Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once {{believed to be a}} part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Orban (born 28 June 1961) is a Romanian {{independent}} technocrat {{who served}} as the Commissioner for Multilingualism in the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union (EU). He was responsible for the EU language policy and was the first Romanian Commissioner and the first member of the Commission whose portfolio is exclusively multilingualism. His term of office began on 1 January 2007 and ended on 9 February 2010. With a background in engineering and economics, Orban has taken up various posts working for the accession of Romania to the European Union, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> as Deputy and later as Chief Negotiator for his country at the time of final negotiations with the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII's {{underestimation}} of Bonaparte proved disastrous. On 19 March, {{the army}} stationed outside Paris defected to Bonaparte, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. That same day, Louis XVIII quit the capital {{with a small}} escort at midnight. Louis decided to go first to Lille, and then crossed the border into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, staying in Ghent. Other leaders, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> Alexander I of Russia, debated whether {{in the case of}} a second victory over the French Empire, the Duke of Orléans should be proclaimed king instead of Louis XVIII.|$|E
5|$|Providence is home {{to eight}} {{hospital}}s, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> Rhode Island Hospital, the largest general acute care hospital in the state. It is also the Level I Trauma Center for Rhode Island, Southeastern Massachusetts and parts of Connecticut. The hospital is in a complex along I-95 that includes Hasbro Children's Hospital and Women and Infants Hospital. The city {{is also home to}} the Roger Williams Medical Center, St. Joseph Hospital For Specialty Care (a division of St. Joseph Health Services Of Rhode Island), The Miriam Hospital, a major teaching affiliate associated with the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, as well as a VA medical center.|$|E
5|$|The dragon motif is {{repeated}} in the radial coffers of the caisson and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre. The Imperial dragon is accompanied by {{the symbol of the}} Empress, the Chinese phoenix (Fèng huáng), sometimes called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese. This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> in relief as part of the grills above false balconies that once screened organ pipes. In addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre. The highly decorated proscenium arch and safety curtain maintain the Chinese design influence.|$|E
5|$|With Carol's {{mistress}} hated {{throughout the}} country, {{it was only}} a matter of time before opposition to the King emerged. This opposition <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> came under the form of the Iron Guard, a group supported by Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. After Carol turned to Ion Duca for help, the Iron Guard assassinated Duca in December 1933. After Duca's death, Carol's popularity plummeted and there were rumours that an attempt would be made on his life at the annual independence parade. In order to avoid this, he instead had Marie attend the parade, in what would be her final public appearance.|$|E
5|$|Apart from singles tournaments, Kuznetsova {{was also}} {{successful}} in doubles. She won her first five WTA doubles titles with Arantxa Sánchez Vicario. After {{a series of}} disappointing results with her she paired with Martina Navratilova, Elena Likhovtseva, Alicia Molik, and Amélie Mauresmo. Pairing with Likhovtseva she climbed to No. 3 WTA in doubles in 2004, holding that position for eight weeks, which remains her career-high. She won the Australian Open twice in doubles, in 2005 alongside Alicia Molik and in 2012 partnering Vera Zvonareva. Kuznetsova also played various times mixed doubles at Grand Slams, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> in 2003, but never went beyond the quarterfinals. She has won a total of 17 WTA and 1 ITF singles titles and 16 WTA doubles titles to date.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{employed}} trusted {{architects and}} engineers {{to run the}} projects, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> the Savoyard Master James of St George, but also Edward's close friend Otto de Grandson, the soldier Sir John de Bonvillars and the master mason John Francis. The English had built castles {{in the wake of}} the 1272 conflict, usually larger and more expensive than those of the local Welsh rulers, but the new fortifications were on a still grander scale. Carpenters, ditch diggers and stonemasons were gathered by local sheriffs from across England and mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved was so great that it placed a significant strain on England's national labour force. The costs were huge: Caernarfon's castle and walls cost £15,500, Conwy's castle and walls came to around £15,000 and Harlech Castle cost £8,190 to construct.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{order has}} been criticized because it left too much {{discretion}} to Ewell. Numerous historians and proponents of the Lost Cause movement (<b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> Jubal Early, despite his own reluctance to support an attack at the time) have speculated how the more aggressive Stonewall Jackson would have acted on this order if he had lived to command this wing of Lee's army, and how differently {{the second day of}} battle would have proceeded with Confederate artillery on Cemetery Hill, commanding the length of Cemetery Ridge and the Federal lines of communications on the Baltimore Pike. Stephen W. Sears has suggested that Gen. Meade would have invoked his original plan for a defensive line on Pipe Creek and withdrawn the Army of the Potomac, although that movement would have been a dangerous operation under pressure from Lee.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{was named}} one of his state's delegates to the Constitutional Convention and {{traveled}} to Philadelphia, his only lengthy trip outside Virginia. Many clauses in the document bear his stamp, as he {{was active in the}} convention for months before deciding that he could not sign it. He cited the lack of a bill of rights <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> in his Objections, but also wanted an immediate end to the slave trade and a supermajority for navigation acts, which might force exporters of tobacco to use more expensive American ships. He failed to attain those objectives there, and again at the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788, but his prominent fight for a bill of rights led fellow Virginian James Madison to introduce one during the First Congress in 1789, and it was ratified in 1791, a year before Mason died. Obscure after his death, in the 20th and 21st centuries, Mason has come to be recognized for his contributions to the United States, and to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{government}} was formed around his uncles, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> {{the rich and}} powerful John of Gaunt, and many of his grandfather's former senior officials. They faced the challenge of financially sustaining the war in France. Taxes in the 14th century were raised on an ad hoc basis through Parliament, then comprising the Lords, the titled aristocracy and clergy; and the Commons, the representatives of the knights, merchants and senior gentry from across England. These taxes were typically imposed on a household's movable possessions, such as their goods or stock. The raising of these taxes affected the members of the Commons much more than the Lords. To complicate matters, the official statistics used to administer the taxes pre-dated the Black Death and, since the size and wealth of local communities had changed greatly since the plague, effective collection had become increasingly difficult.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the Democratic {{organization}} on some occasions, <b>most</b> <b>prominently</b> on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down some of the amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican Arlen Specter for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E
