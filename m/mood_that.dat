5|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare became {{associated}} with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped {{into the same}} <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only to a social elite who prided themselves on their artistic taste, {{but also to the}} emerging middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works a vision of a diversified society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled the gap in the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E

25|$|Later that evening, Crater {{went to a}} Broadway ticket agency (Supreme Tickets) {{and bought}} one seat from William Deutsch (proprietor of Supreme) for a comedy called Dancing Partner at the Belasco Theatre. He then went to Billy Haas's Chophouse at 332 West 45th Street, where he ate dinner with Ritzi and William Klein, a lawyer friend. Klein later told {{investigators}} that Crater was in a good <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> evening and gave no indication that anything was bothering him. The dinner ended a little after 9 p.m., shortly after the curtain rose on the show for which Crater had bought a ticket, and the small group went outside.|$|E

500|$|The {{novel was}} {{published}} in September 1992 by Zebra Books, with a cover designed by illustrator Anne Yvonne Gilbert. Lady of the Forest received generally positive reviews, and has been analyzed by Robin Hood scholar Stephen Thomas Knight, who observed that Roberson's Marian is a [...] "strong woman" [...] who helps Robert, a traumatized veteran of the Crusades, adjust to his life in England; Knight connects this to the [...] "post-Vietnam" [...] <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> existed when the novel was written. Roberson released a sequel, Lady of Sherwood, in 1999.|$|E
500|$|The release {{reflected}} Harrison's continued {{belief in}} the power of music to instigate change in the world, an ideal that distinguished Material World as the last of [...] "rock's grand statements", Leng suggests, and [...] "the final fading of the 1960s dream into middle-age contentment and fiscal luxury". Author and former Mojo editor Mat Snow writes of the timing of the album's US release: [...] "he caught a public <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> craved an echo of 1960s idealism as America was gripped by the cynicism revealed in the Watergate hearings." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{perceived}} {{inability to}} connect {{has led to}} much speculation about Drake's sexuality. Boyd has said he detects a virginal quality in his lyrics and music, and notes that he never observed or heard of the singer behaving in a sexual way with anyone, male or female. Kirby described Drake's lyrics as a [...] "series of extremely vivid, complete observations, almost {{like a series of}} epigrammatic proverbs", though he doubts that Drake saw himself as [...] "any sort of poet". Instead, Kirby believes that Drake's lyrics were crafted to [...] "complement and compound a <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> the melody dictates in the first place." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Morning Sun" [...] {{was issued}} {{as the third}} single from the record. In the UK, it was {{released}} as the official Sport Relief Single on 8 March 2010. The music video for the single was directed by Vaughan Arnell and filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood. [...] "Morning Sun" [...] peaked at number 45 on the UK Singles Chart, making it Williams' first single not to enter the top 40. Jude Rogers from The Quietus said that the song features a vocal [...] "that shows what his voice really can do" [...] and that [...] "Even a middle-eight that nods towards the trippy oompah of 'I Am the Walrus' can't change a <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> is both grand but melancholy, epic but reflective." ...|$|E
500|$|Later {{commentators}} have praised the coin. Taxay deemed the obverse [...] "undoubtedly the finest work Morgan ever {{did in his}} forty-eight years with the Mint. The head is not merely well drawn, there is in it a depth of feeling, and introspective <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> almost makes the observer feel he is intruding on the great man." [...] Writers on commemorative coins, including Arlie Slabaugh and David M. Bullowa, also admired the Illinois piece. Q. David Bowers deemed Sinnock's reverse [...] "the finest work he ever did for a legal tender coin", not excluding the Roosevelt dime (1946) and Franklin half dollar (1948, posthumous). Bowers noted that the border of {{both sides of the}} coin consists of beads and pellets, [...] "an attractive substitute for denticles".|$|E

500|$|... "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" [...] has six verses and no chorus. The lyrics {{describe}} a nightmarish experience in Juarez, Mexico, where, in Shelton's words, [...] "our anti-hero stumbles amid sickness, despair, whores and saints." [...] He battles with corrupt authorities, {{alcohol and drugs}} before resolving to return to New York City. In this song, critics have heard literary references to Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano, Edgar Allan Poe's [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" [...] and Jack Kerouac's Desolation Angels. The backing musicians, Bobby Gregg on drums, Mike Bloomfield on electric guitar, and two pianists, Paul Griffin on tack piano and Al Kooper on Hohner Pianet, produce a <b>mood</b> <b>that,</b> for Gill, perfectly complements the [...] "enervated tone" [...] of the lyrics. Heylin notes that Dylan took great care—sixteen takes—to get the effect he was after, with lyrics that subtly [...] " [...] the edge of reason".|$|E
500|$|An upbeat pop song in {{a similar}} vein to Harrison's 1971 hit [...] "What Is Life", [...] "You" [...] was the most obvious choice for a single off Extra Texture. It was {{released}} in advance of the album, backed by [...] "World of Stone", on 12 September 1975 in Britain (as Apple R 6007) and three days later in the United States (as Apple 1884). The picture sleeve in Britain featured a photo of a smiling Harrison taken on stage by 1974 tour photographer Henry Grossman; the US picture sleeve incorporated Roy Kohara's humorous design for the album, showing blue lettering on a vivid orange background. In another example of the upbeat <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> was otherwise lacking in the musical content of Extra Texture, the single's face labels showed the familiar Apple Records logo as an apple core, a pun on the demise of the company.|$|E
500|$|DJ Shadow's singles for Mo' Wax – {{including}} [...] "In/Flux" [...] and [...] "Lost and Found (S.F.L.)" [...] – were, as Sean Cooper of AllMusic wrote, {{hailed as}} [...] "genre-bending {{works of art}} that merged elements of funk, rock, hip hop, ambient, jazz, soul, and used-bin found records." [...] Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for Mixmag, coined the term [...] "trip hop" [...] in June 1994 to describe [...] "In/Flux" [...] and similar tracks being spun in London clubs at the time. DJ Shadow's follow-up single [...] "What Does Your Soul Look Like" [...] topped the British independent music charts. Following this period, he began work on his debut album, intent on capturing the downbeat <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> characterized his aforementioned three singles. The album was aptly titled Endtroducing....., as according to DJ Shadow, [...] "it signified the fourth and final chapter {{in a series of}} pieces that I was doing for Mo' Wax with a certain sound, a certain tone, a certain atmosphere." ...|$|E

500|$|The season's title {{sequence}} was {{a collaboration}} between director Patrick Clair, his Santa Monica-based studio Elastic, his Sydney-based studio Antibody, and Brisbane-based company Breeder. The design team emphasized southern Louisiana's industrial landscape because it reflected the characters' traits and personal, inner struggles. Clair stated that from the start he had an [...] "unusually clear" [...] vision of True Detective finished opening sequence. Using Richard Misrach's photography book Petrochemical America (2012) as a template, the production team initially photographed the local scenery, and the resulting images were woven together to form {{the core of the}} title sequence. By the time production began animating, they faced several problems: the photographic stills were too grainy and the footage was too jagged. As a result, many shots were digitally altered and slowed to about a tenth of their original speed, which, according to Clair, [...] "evoked a surreal and floaty <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> perfectly captured what we were after." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the deaths of}} leading characters in similarly countercultural films of the time, such of Ben, Duane Jones' character in Night of the Living Dead, and Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda in Easy Rider, in which said characters are killed by similarly disenfranchised groups, the bounty killers are working as part of the State, acting in the service of capital by helping to protect it. What further separates the deaths of the heroes and the anti-authoritarian position of The Great Silence from Romero and Hopper's films is that, unlike Night of the Living Dead and Easy Rider, which were produced without the restrictions of well-established genre conventions, Corbucci's film also subverts and comments on the genre that it is part of. Donato Totaro states that the film's title [...] "is rich in possible meaning, suggestive not only of the great white expansive snow, the lead character's muteness, but the late 1960s political defeats that impacted Corbucci's <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> led him to make one of the grimmest Westerns ever made".|$|E
500|$|The film's story {{originated}} from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind {{over a period}} of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only [...] "a feeling" [...] and the title Blue Velvet, Lynch told Cineaste in 1987. The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. [...] "I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect," [...] Lynch remarked in an interview. The third idea was Bobby Vinton's classic rendition of the song Blue Velvet and [...] "the <b>mood</b> <b>that</b> came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time." [...] Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that [...] "there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while." ...|$|E
