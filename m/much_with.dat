5|$|English cuisine {{encompasses}} the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England. It has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares <b>much</b> <b>with</b> wider British cuisine, partly through {{the importation of}} ingredients and ideas from North America, China, and India {{during the time of}} the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration.|$|E
5|$|This success led Barnes to {{consider}} cricket {{as a potential}} career. However, his mother and stepfather {{were concerned about the}} likelihood of cricket providing him with a living. In response, Barnes took a job with a garage in Mosman but after finding that the necessary travel interfered too <b>much</b> <b>with</b> playing cricket, he found alternative employment, demonstrating motorbikes in the city.|$|E

He was well-liked among other pilots and the black stewards and support staff of the carrier.

He was able to reveal his marriage following his commissioning.|$|E
5|$|Diane quickly {{weakened}} as {{a tropical}} storm over the mountainous terrain of central North Carolina. The associated area of precipitation expanded and spread away from the center {{to the north and}} northeast. The weakening system turned to the north and recurved toward the northeast through Virginia after a ridge built in from the west. It did not interact <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the non-tropical westerlies, and as a result it remained a distinct tropical cyclone over land. Convection redeveloped as the storm approached the Atlantic coast once again. Diane passed through the Mid-Atlantic states, exiting New Jersey on August 19 into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City. Paralleling the southern coast of New England, the storm later accelerated east-northeastward, becoming extratropical on August 21. Passing south and east of Newfoundland, the remnants of Diane accelerated and restrengthened slightly while moving to the northeast. Late on August 23, the storm dissipated between Greenland and Iceland.|$|E

5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too <b>much</b> <b>with</b> Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{was asked}} to write a series called Riverboat, set in 1860s Mississippi. When he {{discovered}} that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued so <b>much</b> <b>with</b> them that he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Sir Lew Grade of Associated Television wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer {{for the first time}} on a summer replacement for the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show titled Wrangler.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet leadership's {{policy towards}} the Eastern Bloc {{did not change}} <b>much</b> <b>with</b> Khrushchev's replacement, as the states of Eastern Europe were seen as a buffer zone {{essential}} to placing distance between NATO and the Soviet Union's borders. The Brezhnev regime inherited a skeptical attitude towards reform policies which became more radical in tone following the Prague Spring in 1968. János Kádár, the leader of Hungary, initiated a couple of reforms similar to Alexei Kosygin's 1965 economic reform. The reform measures, named the New Economic Mechanism, were introduced in Hungary during Khrushchev's rule, and were protected by Kosygin in the post-Khrushchev era. Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, who was removed from all of his posts in 1970, was succeeded by Edward Gierek who tried to revitalize the economy of Poland by borrowing money from the First World. The Soviet leadership approved both countries' respective economic experiments, since {{it was trying to}} reduce its large Eastern Bloc subsidy program in the form of cheap oil and gas exports.|$|E

5|$|The car {{scene with}} Gillian Anderson and Annabeth Gish {{was shot at}} Kanan Road, Malibu. Anderson and Gish sat in {{what is known as}} an insert car, while the crew sat in a pickup car in front of them. The birth scene was filmed at the old Paramount Movie Ranch. According to {{director}} Kim Manners, the most difficult scene to shoot was in the elevator with Mitch Pileggi and Nicholas Lea. Gish had never worked <b>much</b> <b>with</b> guns before joining The X-Files cast, so the producers got a retired LAPD officer to teach her more about firearms. She did some shooting practices before returning to the set. The FBI garage scenes were shot in Century City and took a total of four days to finish.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} <b>much,</b> <b>with</b> the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. The strength of the union {{was based on the}} ability to almost cripple the prison system through strike action, first taken in 1975.|$|E

5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change <b>much</b> <b>with</b> time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
