2500|$|English {{historical}} tradition associates <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine</b> {{with the}} death of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, brother of King Edward IV of England. Following his conviction for treason, he was [...] "privately executed" [...] at the Tower on 18 February 1478, by tradition in the Bowyer Tower, and soon after the event, the rumour gained ground that he was drowned in a butt of <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When the Bourbon rule {{collapsed}} in 1860 a British man named James Stevenson bought {{the northern part}} of the island, built a villa, reopened the local mines and planted vineyards for grapes that would later be used to make <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b> [...] Stevenson lived on Vulcano until the last major eruption on the island, in 1888. [...] The eruption lasted the better part of two years, by which time Stevenson had sold all of his property to the local populace, and never returned to the island. [...] The villa is still intact.|$|E

5000|$|Rumney was {{exported}} from Methoni in {{the southern}} Peloponnese (one English source calls it Rompney of Modonn) and perhaps also from Patras and other ports. Although modern methods are different, the Mavrodafni of Patras might {{be regarded as a}} modern equivalent of medieval Rumney wine. At the same period, Monemvasia, on the eastern coast of the Peloponnese, was the centre for the export of <b>Malmsey</b> wine; Cretan <b>wine</b> was the third of the medieval trio of Greek wines that were prized in western Europe.|$|R
5000|$|To enforce their claim, the Venetians {{landed a}} small force in Spinalonga. The Genoese however, {{who already had}} a colony on Crete, moved quicker: {{under the command of}} Enrico Pescatore, Count of Malta, and enjoying the support of the local populace, they soon became masters over the eastern and central {{portions}} of the island. A first Venetian attack in summer 1207 was driven off, and for the next two years, Pescatore ruled the entire island {{with the exception of a}} few isolated Venetian garrisons. Pescatore even appealed to the Pope, and attempted to have himself confirmed as the island's king. It took the Venetians another five years of bloody warfare to force him to surrender; and only in 1218 did the war with Genoa end in a treaty that left Crete securely in Venetian hands. Giacomo Tiepolo became the first governor of the new colony, with the title of [...] "duke of Crete" [...] (duca di Candia), based in Candia (modern Heraklion). The duke usually held office for two years, assisted by two deputies and two councils.Venetians used Crete as a center for their profitable eastern trade. Furthermore, they established a feudal state and administered a strict capitalist system for exploiting the island's agricultural produce. Exported products consisted primarily of wheat and sweet <b>wine</b> (<b>malmsey),</b> and to a lesser extend of timber and cheese.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote I: There was {{a strange}} story in respect to the manner of Clarence's death, which was very current at the time, namely, that he was drowned by his {{brothers}} in a butt of <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b> But {{there is no evidence}} whatever that this story was true.] ...|$|E
60|$|Edward was merry and good-natured {{when not}} angered, and had quite sense and ability {{enough to have}} been a very good king, if he had not been lazy, selfish, and full of vices. He {{actually}} set out to conquer France, and then let himself be persuaded over and paid off by the cunning King of France, and went home again, a laughing-stock to everybody. The two kings had an interview on a bridge over the River Somme in France, where they talked through a kind of fence, each being too suspicious of the other to meet, without such a barrier between them. As to George, the king had never trusted him since his shameful behavior when Warwick rebelled; besides, he was always abusing the queen's relations, and Richard was always telling the king of all the bad and foolish things he did or said. At last there was a great outbreak of anger, and the king ordered the Duke of Clarence to be imprisoned in the Tower; and there, before long, he too was killed. The saying was that he was drowned in a butt of <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine,</b> but this is not at all likely to be true. He left two little children, a boy and a girl.|$|E
60|$|It was time, now, {{that the}} Duke of Clarence {{should be punished}} for his treacheries; and Fate had his {{punishment}} in store. He was, probably, not trusted by the King--for who could trust him who knew him!--and he had certainly a powerful opponent in his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who, being avaricious and ambitious, wanted to marry that widowed daughter of the Earl of Warwick's who had been espoused to the deceased young Prince, at Calais. Clarence, who wanted all the family wealth for himself, secreted this lady, whom Richard found disguised as a servant in the City of London, and whom he married; arbitrators appointed by the King, then divided the property between the brothers. This led to ill- will and mistrust between them. Clarence's wife dying, and he wishing to make another marriage, which was obnoxious to the King, his ruin was hurried by that means, too. At first, the Court struck at his retainers and dependents, and accused some of them of magic and witchcraft, and similar nonsense. Successful against this small game, it then mounted to the Duke himself, who was impeached by his brother the King, in person, {{on a variety of}} such charges. He was found guilty, and sentenced to be publicly executed. He never was publicly executed, but he met his death somehow, in the Tower, and, no doubt, through some agency of the King or his brother Gloucester, or both. It was supposed {{at the time that he}} was told to choose the manner of his death, and that he chose to be drowned in a butt of <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b> I hope the story may be true, for it would have been a becoming death for such a miserable creature.|$|E
5000|$|English {{historical}} tradition associates <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine</b> {{with the}} death of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, brother of King Edward IV of England. Following his conviction for treason, he was [...] "privately executed" [...] at the Tower on 18 February 1478, by tradition in the Bowyer Tower, and soon after the event, the rumour gained ground that he was drowned in a butt of <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another {{theory is}} that the sauce {{originally}} contained Malvasia (<b>malmsey)</b> <b>wine.</b> Proponents of this theory include brandy or sherry in the sauce.|$|E
5000|$|The town's name {{derives from}} two Greek words, mone and emvasia, meaning [...] "single entrance". Its Italian form, Malvasia, gave {{its name to}} <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b> Monemvasia's {{nickname}} is the Gibraltar of the East or The Rock.|$|E
50|$|The May 5, 1706 {{eruption}} {{originating from}} the northwest rift zone was a major event in the town's history. Prior to then, Garachico was an important port exporting <b>Malmsey</b> <b>Wine</b> and other local produce. However, a several-week-long eruption poured lava into the old bay and effectively destroyed the town's livelihood.|$|E
50|$|Though {{a member}} of the House of York, he {{switched}} sides to support the Lancastrians, before reverting to the Yorkists. He was later convicted of treason against his brother, Edward IV, and was executed (allegedly by being drowned in a butt of <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine).</b> He appears as a character in William Shakespeare's plays Henry VI, Part 3 and Richard III, in which his death is attributed to the machinations of Richard.|$|E
5000|$|Then, in 1472, it {{was granted}} to George, Duke of Clarence, {{who was married}} to Warwick's eldest daughter. When the Duke of Clarence was {{executed}} in 1478 for treason (supposedly by being drowned in a vat of <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine),</b> the title was forfeit. It was then granted to Edward of Middleham (who was his nephew via the Duke's brother Richard), who died in 1484 {{at the age of}} 11.|$|E
50|$|When the Bourbon rule {{collapsed}} in 1860 a British man named James Stevenson bought {{the northern part}} of the island, built a villa, reopened the local mines and planted vineyards for grapes that would later be used to make <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b> Stevenson lived on Vulcano until the last major eruption on the island, in 1888. The eruption lasted the better part of two years, by which time Stevenson had sold all of his property to the local populace, and never returned to the island. The villa is still intact.|$|E
50|$|The early {{reign of}} Edward IV {{was marred by}} Lancastrian {{plotting}} and uprisings in favour of Henry VI. Warwick himself changed sides, and supported Margaret of Anjou and the king's jealous brother George, Duke of Clarence, in briefly restoring Henry in 1470-71. However, Edward regained his throne, and the House of Lancaster was wiped out {{with the death of}} Henry VI himself, in the Tower of London in 1471. In 1478, the continued trouble caused by Clarence led to his execution in the Tower of London; popularly he is thought to have been drowned in a butt of <b>malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Clarence {{was imprisoned}} in the Tower of London {{and put on}} trial for treason against his brother Edward IV. Clarence was not present - Edward himself prosecuted his brother, and demanded that Parliament pass a Bill of Attainder against his brother, declaring that he was guilty of [...] "unnatural, loathly treasons" [...] which were aggravated {{by the fact that}} Clarence was his brother, who, if anyone did, owed him loyalty and love. Following his conviction, he was [...] "privately executed" [...] at the Tower on 18 February 1478, by {{tradition}} in the Bowyer Tower, and soon after the event, the rumour gained ground that he had been drowned in a butt of <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|By 1464 the {{inhabitants}} found the Pope's representative feeble and the Pope unable to protect them; they admitted a Venetian garrison. The town was fairly prosperous under Venetian rule until {{the peace of}} 1502-3, in which it lost its farm lands, source of its food supply and of <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine.</b> The food had to come by sea or from Turkish-held lands, and the cultivation of wine languished under Turkish rule. The rock was governed by the Venetians until the treaty of 1540, which cost the Republic Nauplia and Monemvasia, her last two possessions on mainland Greece. Those inhabitants who {{did not wish to}} live under Turkish rule were given lands elsewhere. The Ottomans then ruled the town until the brief Venetian recovery in 1690, then again from 1715 to 1821. It was known as [...] "Menekşe" [...] ("Violet" [...] in Turkish) during Ottoman rule and was a sanjak (province) centre in the Morea Eyalet.|$|E
50|$|It {{remained}} {{part of the}} Byzantine Empire until 1460, {{becoming the}} seat of an imperial governor, a landing place for Byzantine operations against the Franks, the main port of shipment (if not always production) for <b>Malmsey</b> <b>wine,</b> {{and one of the}} most dangerous lairs of corsairs in the Levant. The Emperors gave it valuable privileges, attracting Roger de Lluria who sacked the lower town in 1292. The town welcomed the Catalan Company on its way eastward in 1302. In 1397 the Despot of the Morea, Theodore I Palaiologos, deposed the local dynast of Monemvasia, who appealed to Sultan Bayezid I and was reinstated by Turkish troops. In 1419 the rock appears to have come into the possession of Venice, though it soon returned to the Despot. About 1401, the historian George Sphrantzes was born in the town. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 Monemvasia held out against the threats of Sultan Mehmed II in 1458 and 1460, when it became the only remaining domain of the Despot of the Morea, Thomas Palaiologos, claimant of the Imperial throne. He had no forces to defend it; he offered it to the Sultan, and finally sold it to the Pope.|$|E
40|$|U radu je prikazan jedan primjer neuobičajene plovidbe trgovačkog jedrenjaka iz prve polovice 15. stoljeća u čemu su sudjelovala dva pomorca iz hrvatskih krajeva. Slučaj je zanimljiv zbog toga što je plovilo dospjelo do krajnjih granica tada poznatog svijeta – na jugu do Kanarskih otoka, a na sjeveru do Lofotskog otočja. Stečena saznanja ugrađena su u jedan od najvažnijih kartografskih spomenika kasnog srednjeg vijeka. Osim toga, na povratku su preživjeli posjetili Ivana VI. Frankopana u Švedskoj. Towards {{the end of}} the 13 th century, Venetian Republic {{established}} {{bonds with}} harbours in the North Sea. For reasons of prestige and financial profit, state control was kept over the convoys sent in this direction, yet enough room was left for private trading initiative as well. Thanks to the experience gained and for the purpose of facilitating the sailing itself, a whole set of cartographic products and portolan charts with descriptions of shores, harbours, anchorages, and sea characteristics were developed. The principal feature of those maps was that they did not include the shores southward of the Canary Islands, Cape Bojador, and the north shores of Scandinavia. Pietro Querini’s voyage was described in two reports written by the surviving crew members. Their sailing ship set on the voyage from Crete on 30 April 1431, freighted with barrels of <b>malmsey</b> <b>wine</b> and other goods. The crew numbered around fifty seamen, among whom there were two Croatians – one from Zadar, and the other from Šibenik. During the voyage, the ship passed the Gibraltar and was wrecked near Cadiz. The damage to the steering wheel decided the ship’s further fate. After repair, the wind directed them to the Canary Islands, which caused fear among the crew. This was in line with the belief that all ships that sail behind Capes Non and Bojador would suffer a wreck. They however managed to return and, after passing Cape Finisterre, arrived to the Channel. They were caught in a sequence of storms, which destroyed their steering wheel and sails, and consequently arrived to a position approximately 1, 000 km westward of Ireland. After leaving the ship, they embarked two smaller boats. One of them carried Querini and another 44 seamen; they set to the northeast under strong wind and the Gulf Stream. The majority died of cold, hunger and thirst, while only thirteen of them managed – on 5 January 1432 – to disembark on Sandøy in the Lofoten Islands (in the north of Norway). The islanders of Røst rescued them and offered them hospitality, so that they recovered. The eleven men who had survived (the two from Zadar and Šibenik with them) set off on a journey home. They crossed Norway and Sweden on foot up to the harbour of Lödöse. Ivan VI Frankopan, who was in service of King Erik VII at that time, offered them hospitality on the way. Querini and Croatian seamen continued to sail to England, and later to Flanders. They arrived in Venice on 12 October 1432. Though shipwrecks were rather frequentin that period, none of the other cases attracted as much attention as the case of Querini. It is interesting {{due to the fact that}} the ship had reached the ultimate borders of the world as known at that time – the Canary Islands in the south, and the Lofoten Islands in the north; the voyage crossed 14, 100 km in total. Additionally, as a result thereof, certain data were entered into cartographic products of later dates – for instance into the Mappamondo by friar Mauro of 1459. The seamen who survived were the first South Europeans who ate codfish. For us, it is of interest that two seamen from Croatian lands took part in the voyage and managed to survive all the hardships...|$|E
