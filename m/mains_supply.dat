5|$|Electricity {{distribution}} {{is the responsibility}} of Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire), which is wholly owned by MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company. There is no domestic gas <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b> Water is supplied by Yorkshire Water from Embsay Reservoir. Yorkshire Water is responsible for wastewater disposal, and a small-scale treatment plant is located adjacent to the River Wharfe south of Hebden Beck. Refuse collection is handled by Craven District Council, and North Yorkshire County Council provides a household waste and recycling centre at Skibeden, between Bolton Abbey and Skipton.|$|E
5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street lighting. The area was served by good spring water, with <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the sewerage system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Isolated level {{crossings}} are fed direct from <b>mains</b> <b>supply,</b> but use a locally derived railway standard 24-volts DC.|$|E

50|$|The {{island has}} a <b>mains</b> water <b>supply,</b> and {{boreholes}} are also used. Flotta didn't have a <b>mains</b> electricity <b>supply</b> until 1977, although most households had {{had their own}} electricity generators for many years beforehand. Mains electricity is supplied by Scottish Hydro Electric. The island {{is connected to the}} BT telephone network. Mobile phone connections can be an issue. Broadband internet connection is possible on the island. There is no <b>mains</b> gas <b>supply</b> on Flotta, although coal and heating oil are delivered regularly, and Calor Gas is stored at the shop.|$|R
25|$|Case A is any charger {{connected}} to the mains (the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.|$|E
25|$|Case B is an {{on-board}} vehicle charger with a <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> cable {{which can}} be detached from both the supply and the vehicle – usually mode 3.|$|E
25|$|Case C is a {{dedicated}} charging station with DC {{supply to the}} vehicle. The <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> cable may be permanently attached to the charge-station such as in mode 4.|$|E
50|$|Switched-mode {{power supply}} units (PSUs) in {{domestic}} products such as personal computers often have universal inputs, meaning that they can accept power from <b>mains</b> <b>supplies</b> throughout the world, although a manual voltage range switch may be required. Switch-mode power supplies can tolerate {{a wide range of}} power frequencies and voltages.|$|R

25|$|On 8 September 2003, two of {{the last}} {{remaining}} places in Ireland unconnected to the national grid – Inishturbot and Inishturk islands (off the coast of Galway)- were finally connected to the <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b> Some islands are still powered by small diesel-run power stations.|$|E
25|$|Once Colossus {{was built}} and installed, it ran continuously, powered by dual {{redundant}} diesel generators, the wartime <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> being considered too unreliable. The only {{time it was}} switched off was for conversion to Mk2, which added more tubes. Another nine Colossus Mk2s were built. Each Mk2 consumed 15 kilowatts; most of the power was for the tube heaters.|$|E
25|$|L6-20 and L6-30 {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} found on in-rack power distribution units {{in countries where}} the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> voltage is greater than 120V. They are {{also found in the}} US for heavy-duty 240V equipment such as welders, where the higher supply voltage allows a lower current draw. These connectors are thus found where industrial equipment or large power tools are commonplace.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1950s, {{isolated}} ground domestic <b>mains</b> <b>supplies</b> {{tended to have}} no Residual-Current Device (RCD) or Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB), and too high a ground impedance to blow a fuse if a live-to-earth fault occurred. This could leave metalwork in the house live. The use of Residual Current Devices (RCDs) or formerly ELCBs with such installs solved this problem. Such installs are called EEBAD (Earthed Equipotential Bonding and Automatic Disconnection).|$|R
50|$|New Marston {{seems to}} have {{received}} a <b>mains</b> water <b>supply</b> {{by the end of}} the 1870s and mains drainage by the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The Ifold Estate {{was first}} divided into plots {{of land in}} the 1930s. Until around 1953 there was no <b>mains</b> water <b>supply.</b>|$|R
25|$|By 1925, {{the speed}} of the record was {{becoming}} standardized at a nominal value of 78rpm. However, the standard differed between places with alternating current electricity supply at 60 hertz (cycles per second, Hz) and those at 50Hz. Where the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> was 60Hz, the actual speed was 78.26rpm: that of a 60Hz stroboscope illuminating 92-bar calibration markings. Where it was 50Hz, it was 77.92rpm: that of a 50Hz stroboscope illuminating 77-bar calibration markings.|$|E
25|$|Bournville Lane Baths were {{unusual in}} that they {{featured}} an aeration and filtration system for the water which was extracted from a <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b> This meant that the baths {{did not need to}} be emptied and refilled. This system was modern and the system was later installed in all swimming baths controlled by local authorities meaning that King's Norton and Northfield District Council were the first local authority in the country to use such a system. The Baths were built in 1910 to a design by John P. Osborne. The building is Grade II listed.|$|E
25|$|In the UK the {{installation}} of smoke alarms in new builds must comply with British Standard BS5839 pt6. BS 5839: Pt.6: 2004 recommends that a new-build property consisting {{of no more than}} 3 floors (less than 200 square metres per floor) should be fitted with a Grade D, LD2 system. Building Regulations in England, Wales and Scotland recommend that BS 5839: Pt.6 should be followed, but as a minimum a Grade D, LD3 system should be installed. Building Regulations in Northern Ireland require a Grade D, LD2 system to be installed, with smoke alarms fitted in the escape routes and the main living room and a heat alarm in the kitchen; this standard also requires all detectors to have a <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> and a battery back up.|$|E
50|$|The XT had {{a desktop}} case {{similar to that}} of the IBM PC. It weighed 32 pounds and was {{approximately}} 19.5 inches wide by 16 inches deep by 5.5 inches high. The power supply of the original XT sold in the US was configured for 120 V AC only and could not be used with 240 V <b>mains</b> <b>supplies.</b> XTs with 240V-compatible power supplies were later sold in international markets. Both were rated at 130 Watts.|$|R
50|$|In electronics, a jiffy is {{the period}} of an {{alternating}} current power cycle, 1/60 or 1/50 of a second in most <b>mains</b> power <b>supplies.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{is opposed}} to the typical view of {{emergency}} power systems, where the backup generators are seen as secondary to the <b>mains</b> electrical <b>supply.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{variant of}} this is to use two {{capacitors}} in series for the output smoothing on a bridge rectifier then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts like a normal bridge rectifier. With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (±15%, approx.) DC from any 120V or 230V <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple switched-mode power supply. However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a half-wave rectifier, and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the time}} average of a {{function}} of the form cos(ωt+k) is zero provided that ω is nonzero. Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match. In other words, it is possible to calculate active (average) power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers. Furthermore, if we assume the voltage of the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> is a single frequency (which it usually is), this shows that harmonic currents are a bad thing. They will increase the rms current (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the active power transferred. Hence, harmonic currents will reduce the power factor. Harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device. Typically this will consist of either just a capacitor (relying on parasitic resistance and inductance in the supply) or a capacitor-inductor network. An active power factor correction circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity.|$|E
500|$|Prior to 2007 {{there was}} no <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> of {{drinking}} water on the island, water being supplied instead from wells and springs. In that year the then Scottish Executive announced plans for a <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> to be provided {{at a cost of}} £1million: a pipe was laid under Loch Linnhe and work was to begin on laying about [...] of pipes across Lismore. However, Scottish Water later decided to supply water from boreholes instead.|$|E
50|$|The hamlet {{is served}} by Wessex Water; Scottish and Southern Electricity are {{responsible}} for the overhead <b>mains</b> power <b>supplies.</b> The BT exchange at Hilmarton serves the hamlet via overhead telephone lines. There is no sewerage service or <b>mains</b> gas <b>supply</b> to the hamlet. There are no shops, pub or telephone box, but there is a post box. There are no regular public transport services, the nearest bus stops being on the A3102 at the foot of Snow Hill which is about 2 miles away.|$|R
50|$|Voltage {{optimisation}} {{systems are}} typically installed {{in series with}} the <b>mains</b> electrical <b>supply</b> to a building, allowing all its electrical equipment to benefit from an optimised supply.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} and most common {{version of the}} powerCON is rated at 20 A. It comes in two deliberately incompatible variants to prevent people connecting two <b>mains</b> <b>supplies</b> together. The type A is blue and used for power sources (power flows out of a blue-ended cable, into a chassis socket). The type B is white and used for power drains (power flows from a chassis socket into a white-ended cable). Couplers are available with one chassis socket of each type mounted {{on the ends of}} a plastic tube to extend cables.|$|R
500|$|The {{ground floor}} houses the {{transformers}} for powering the wheel. When the wheel was flooded by vandals in April 2002, this room was filled to within [...] of the 11kV busbars. On {{the first floor}} is a standby generator and switchgear should the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> to the wheel fail. The second floor houses a pair of hydraulic pumps that drive the hydraulic motors in the chamber above. Power is supplied directly to the axle with 10 hydraulic motors, which also double as brakes. Connected to each motor is a 100:1 gear system to reduce the rotation speed.|$|E
