500|$|A radiolanthanum sample, precipitated in a {{tip of a}} small cone, {{followed}} by a plug, was lowered {{into the center of}} the metal sphere of the experimental assembly with a device resembling a fishing rod. The cone and the plug were mated to the metal center of the assembly, together forming a metal sphere. A section of the explosive lensing was then returned to its place above the sphere. Several, typically four, ionization chambers were located around the experimental setup. Immediately after the detonation they generated signals that were displayed on oscilloscopes in a blast-proof shelter or a <b>mobile</b> <b>laboratory</b> in a tank, [...] away, and the oscilloscope traces recorded on cameras. A calibration measurement was performed before and after each test. The ionization chambers and their preamplifiers were destroyed during the explosion, but their simple design allowed their production in sufficient quantities.|$|E
500|$|The RaLa {{sources were}} highly radioactive. They {{had to be}} lowered to the test {{apparatus}} by a [...] long rod. The tests were initially observed from a sealed M4 Sherman tank; the <b>mobile</b> <b>laboratory</b> consisted of two tanks. Each experiment was supposed to contaminate an area of about [...] for about a half year. When radiobarium {{was removed from the}} radiolanthanum, the short term contamination levels turned out to be insignificant. Tanks were then replaced with fixed shelters. One of the tanks was later lead-plated, sealed, equipped with self-contained air supply, and used for sampling of fission products in the post-blast debris after the Trinity test. The sources posed a considerable radiation exposure risk; the exposure rate of a [...] source at [...] was 1,130R/h and 11,000R/h at [...] Sources with activities up to [...] were used in some tests.|$|E
