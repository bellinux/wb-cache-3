This represented the most parsimonious balance of addressing the majority of attributes without overburdening the evaluation process. Indicators included in the <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set also needed to be feasibly collected and reported at a population level.

30|$|Whilst the {{identified}} <b>indicators</b> in our <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set have content and face validity for medication-related {{quality of care}} in the elderly, many are yet to be validated for the Australian aged care setting. Indicators for assessing access to medication-related health services were not common and may reflect the differences in health systems between countries. Indicators addressing medication-related health services specific to residential aged care residents in Australia, {{would need to be}} further investigated for inclusion in the <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set. Subsequent development and validation of the <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set should be the focus of future research.|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} we have derived a <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set for {{evaluating}} medication-related quality of care in residential aged care using systematically identified and previously validated indicators based on the key medication-related needs of the aged care population. The developed <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set is intended {{as a starting point}} for comprehensively evaluating medication-related quality of care in Australian aged care. This study identified that indicators focusing on pertinent medication-related issues for older aged care residents, namely patient-centred care and limited life expectancy, were lacking and warrant further attention. Also, inclusion of additional indicators which address detection and monitoring of adverse events, not just falls, as these were not overly prevalent in the indicator sets. The focus on the core medication-related attributes in the <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set improves the feasibility of implementation in the aged care setting by minimising data collection and management. Validation of the <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set in the Australian aged care setting will provide a means to assess and monitor quality of care in this growing health sector.|$|R

30|$|Given {{the growing}} aged care population, the {{complexity}} of their medication-related needs and increased risk of adverse drug events, there is a necessity to systematically monitor and manage medication-related quality of care. The aim of this systematic review was to identify and synthesise medication-related quality of care indicators with respect to application to residential aged care. MEDLINE (Ovid), Psychinfo, CINAHL, Embase and Google® were searched from 2001 to 2013 for studies that were in English, focused on older people aged 65 + years and discussed the development, application or validation of original medication-related quality of care indicators. The quality of selected articles was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program and psychometric qualities extracted and synthesised using content analysis. Indicators were mapped to six medication-related quality of care attributes and a <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set derived. Thirty three articles describing 25 indicator sets met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen (52 %) contained prescribing quality indicators only. Eight (32 %) were developed specifically for aged care. Twenty three (92 %) were validated and seven (28 %) assessed for reliability. The most common attribute addressed was medication appropriateness (n[*]=[*] 24). There were no indicators for evaluating medication use in those with limited life expectancy, which resulted in only {{five of the six}} attributes being addressed. The developed <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set contains 28 indicators representing 22 of 25 identified indicator sets. Whilst a wide variety of validated indicator sets exist, none addressed all aspects of medication-related quality of care pertinent to residential aged care. The <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set is intended as a foundation for comprehensively evaluating medication-related quality of care in this setting. Future work should focus on bridging identified gaps.|$|R
30|$|The {{results from}} mapping {{were used to}} guide the {{development}} of a <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set for evaluating medication-related quality of care in Australian residential aged care.

30|$|Two of the {{identified}} indicator sets developed specifically for aged care take quite an extensive approach to medication management. ACOVE- 3 contains nearly 400 indicators with {{one quarter of}} the indicators related to medication use (Wegner et al. 2007). This indicator set addresses prescribing, monitoring of medicines and consumer involvement in medication management. It has been extended to several subsets of indicators such as quality of care in dementia and poor prognosis. The Australian Guiding Principles for Medication Management in Residential Aged Care has a broad approach to evaluating medication use ranging from reviewing medicines policies and procedures to annual medication review but does not target specific medications (Department of Health 2012). Twelve of the <b>indicators</b> in our <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set are from ACOVE- 3 and three are from the Australian Guiding Principles for Medication Management in Residential Aged Care. This demonstrates the relevance of these indicators for evaluating medication-related quality of care in Australian residential aged care. Whilst ACOVE- 3 is a very comprehensive indicator set, it is burdensome for implementing in a clinical setting with 98 indicators relating to medication-related quality of care, many of which address clinical conditions not prevalent in the residential Australian aged care population. Currently quality of care indicator sets developed specifically for Australian residential aged care include simplistic medication-related quality of care indicators such as polypharmacy and medication review (Table  1). These two indicators are useful tools for identifying residents at risk of inappropriate medication-related quality of care and predicting adverse health outcomes however they do not reflect the complexity of medication-related care for the residential aged care population (Duerden et al. 2013). The <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set developed in this study provides a platform for a quality of care indicator set specific for Australian residential aged care that focuses on the key requirements to examine medication-related quality of care in this setting.|$|R

30|$|The {{variability}} of indicators of under-assessment was very large except for Sainte-Anne. Thus, if respondents {{from the three}} other study sites displayed indicators from 0.20 % to 100 %, those from Sainte-Anne presented a <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> of 33.9 %. The average indicators of under-assessment (78 %) were {{higher than the average}} indicators of over-assessment (44 %) for all study sites. Thus, respondents were more likely to under-assess than over-assess the spatial extent of areas exposed to coastal flooding. Average indicators of under-assessment of respondents from Châtelaillon-Plage (85 %) and from Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer (83 %) were higher than the average indicator (78 %). Despite the fact that the average indicators of over-assessment and under-assessment of respondents in Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer were less precise in their calculation than the other study sites, they provided information about the general trend of individuals’ perception of the spatial extent of areas exposed to coastal flooding. In fact, respondents that lived in this municipality are more likely to under-assess than over-assess the exposed areas.|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} we {{identified}} 25 sets of medication-related quality of care indicators relevant to residential aged care. From these, 28 indicators that address key medication-related quality of care issues specific for residential aged care were selected to form the <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set. All 28 indictors have been previously validated for face and content validity through either extensive literature reviews and or expert consensus. Furthermore, external validity was demonstrated across countries {{for some of these}} indicators. Indicators for assessment of medication appropriateness, PQIs, were common among the identified indicators sets which demonstrated a strong international consensus on the appropriateness of these medications use in the elderly. Indicators for addressing the medication appropriateness for the most prevalent diseases, detecting and monitoring adverse drug events, access to relevant services and medication-related policy were identified in at least three of the included indicators sets. Indicators to address medication use in limited life expectancy in aged care residents are lacking.|$|R
30|$|The {{indicators}} are selected, {{depending on the}} case study, as the most significant for each category. For example, {{in the case of}} social fragility, we can use the slum-squatter neighborhoods area, the mortality rate, the delinquency rate, and the population density. In the case of lack of resilience, the number of hospital beds, the health human resources, the public space area, the rescue and firemen manpower, the development level, and the emergency planning can be used. These indicators can be replaced by others according to the information available for each case study. There is not a <b>minimum</b> <b>indicators</b> number established to apply the methodology; instead, it is expected that the indicators involve information related to the social fragility and lack of resilience of the community. Jaramillo et al. (2016) provide an idea about indicators that can be used following the indicators applied by urban observatories of the United Nations and other social researchers.|$|R
30|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of medication-related quality of care indicator sets identified included exclusively PQIs. PQIs {{play an important role}} in evaluating medication-related quality of care. They are evidence based and specifically target medications known to cause adverse effects. Furthermore, the PQI sets developed for the older age groups address medicines most problematic in this population. PQI sets are often criticised due to their lack of sensitivity as they are designed to be generically applied across a population and do not consider variability in individual patient medical needs and preferences (Spinewine et al. 2007; Steinman et al. 2007). This however enhances the feasibility in reporting of these indicators. These qualities of PQIs are reflected by their prevalence in the <b>minimum</b> <b>indicator</b> set. Some PQI sets target medications to be avoided in certain comorbid states (e.g. Beer's criteria) and others (e.g. CRIME) addressed medication use in clinically complex frail elderly patients (Onder et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|Among {{theories}} {{that address the}} impact of variations in immediacy behaviors during ongoing interactions are nonverbal expectancy violations and discrepancy arousal theories.

Additionally, all violations of expectations were followed by increases in arousal rather than the orientation response. Finally, arousal was generally predictive of nonverbal <b>indicators</b> of arousal <b>intensity,</b> thus offering less obtrusive ways to measure arousal...|$|R
