The integrated radiator/photonic device incorporates a non-contact fed stacked patch antenna {{that has been}} designed to radiate efficiently between 9 – 11 GHz and is easily coupled to the Lithium Niobate Mach-Zehnder modulator, requiring minimal modification to the electrode structure of this photonic device. We discuss the design procedure for the integrated assembly, the predicted characteristics of the antenna in this environment and test a proof-of-concept version of the module. Finally we verify the performance of the module through a link demonstration. Index Terms — Microwave photonics, integrated antennas, optical modulators, phased arrays, printed antennas...|$|E

40|$|Electrospray ionisation-ion {{mobility}} spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS) is {{a powerful}} method {{for the study of}} conformational changes in protein complexes, including oligomeric species populated during protein self-aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Information on the mass, stability, cross-sectional area and ligand binding capability of each transiently populated intermediate, present in the heterogeneous mixture of assembling species, can be determined individually in a single experiment in real-time. Determining the structural characterisation of oligomeric species and alterations in self-assembly pathways observed in the presence of small molecule inhibitors is of great importance, given the urgent demand for effective therapeutics. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of ESI-IMS-MS to identify small molecule <b>modulators</b> of amyloid <b>assembly</b> and to determine the mechanism by which they interact (positive, negative, non-specific binding, or colloidal) in a high-throughput format. Here, we demonstrate these advances using self-assembly of Aβ 40 as an example, and reveal two new inhibitors of Aβ 40 fibrillation...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{studies have}} {{identified}} LIMK 2 {{as a key}} downstream effector of Rho GTPase-induced changes in cytoskeletal organization. LIMK 2 is phosphorylated and activated by Rho associated coiled-coil kinases (ROCKs) {{in response to a}} variety of growth factors. The biochemical targets of LIMK 2 belong to a family of actin binding proteins that are potent <b>modulators</b> of actin <b>assembly</b> and disassembly. Although numerous studies have suggested that LIMK 2 regulates cell morphology and motility, evidence supportive of these functions in vivo has remained elusive. In this study, a knockout mouse was created that abolished LIMK 2 biochemical activity resulting in a profound inhibition of epithelial sheet migration during eyelid development. In the absence of LIMK 2, nascent eyelid keratinocytes differentiate and acquire a pre-migratory phenotype but the leading cells fail to nucleate filamentous actin and remain immobile causing an eyes open at birth (EOB) phenotype. The failed nucleation of actin was associated with significant reductions in phosphorylated cofilin, a major LIMK 2 biochemical substrate and potent modulator of actin dynamics. These results demonstrate that LIMK 2 activity is required for keratinocyte migration in the developing eyelid...|$|R
40|$|The {{asymmetric}} {{distribution of}} stable, post-translationally modified microtubules (MTs) contrib-utes to the polarization of many cell types, yet the fac-tors controlling {{the formation of}} these MTs are not known. We have found that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a major serum factor responsible for rapidly generating stable, detyrosinated (Glu) MTs in serum-starved 3 T 3 cells. Using C 3 toxin and val 14 rho we showed that rho was both necessary and sufficient for the induction of Glu MTs by LPA and serum. Unlike previously described factors that induce MT stability, rho induced the stabilization of only {{a subset of the}} MTs and, in wound-edge cells, these stable MTs were appropriately oriented toward {{the leading edge of the}} cell. LPA had little effect on individual parameters of MT dynamics, but did induce long states of pause in a subset of MTs near the edge of the cell. Rho stimula-tion of MT stability was independent of actin stress fi-ber formation. These results identify rho as a novel reg-ulator of the MT cytoskeleton that selectively stabilizes MTs during cell polarization by acting as a switch be-tween dynamic and stable states of MTs rather than as a <b>modulator</b> of MT <b>assembly</b> and disassembly. ...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{core protein}} assembles viral pre-genomic (pg) RNA and DNA {{polymerase}} into nucleocapsids for reverse transcriptional DNA replication to take place. Several chemotypes of small molecules, including heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) and sulfamoylbenzamides (SBAs), {{have been discovered}} to allosterically modulate core protein structure and consequentially alter the kinetics and pathway of core protein assembly, resulting in formation of irregularly-shaped core protein aggregates or "empty" capsids devoid of pre-genomic RNA and viral DNA polymerase. Interestingly, in addition to inhibiting nucleocapsid assembly and subsequent viral genome replication, we have now demonstrated that HAPs and SBAs differentially modulate the biosynthesis of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways by inducing disassembly of nucleocapsids derived from virions as well as double-stranded DNA-containing progeny nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. Specifically, the mistimed cuing of nucleocapsid uncoating prevents cccDNA formation during de novo infection of hepatocytes, while transiently accelerating cccDNA synthesis from cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsids. Our studies indicate that elongation of positive-stranded DNA induces structural changes of nucleocapsids, which confers ability of mature nucleocapsids to bind CpAMs and triggers its disassembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the dual effects of the core protein allosteric <b>modulators</b> on nucleocapsid <b>assembly</b> and disassembly will facilitate the discovery of novel core protein-targeting antiviral agents that can more efficiently suppress cccDNA synthesis and cure chronic hepatitis B...|$|R

In Caenorhabditis elegans, uncoordinated- 53 (unc- 53) encodes a neural guidance molecule that directs axonal growth. One of the vertebrate homologs of unc- 53 is neuron navigator 3 (Nav 3). Here, we identified a novel vertebrate neuron navigator 3 isoform in zebrafish, nav 3 a, and we provide genetic evidence in loss- and gain-of-function experiments showing its functional role in endodermal organogenesis during zebrafish embryogenesis. In zebrafish embryos, nav 3 a expression was initiated at 22 hpf {{in the gut}} endoderm and at 40 hpf expanded to the newly formed liver bud. Endodermal nav 3 a expression was controlled by Wnt 2 bb signaling and was independent of FGF and BMP signaling. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of nav 3 a resulted in a significantly reduced liver size, and impaired development of pancreas and swim bladder. In vivo time-lapse imaging of liver development in nav 3 a morphants revealed a failure of hepatoblast movement out from the gut endoderm during the liver budding stage, with hepatoblasts being retained in the intestinal endoderm. In hepatocytes in vitro, nav 3 a acts as a positive <b>modulator</b> of actin <b>assembly</b> in lamellipodia and filipodia extensions, allowing cellular movement. Knockdown of nav 3 a in vitro impeded hepatocyte movement. Endodermal-specific overexpression of nav 3 a in vivo resulted in additional ectopic endodermal budding beyond the normal liver and pancreatic budding sites. We conclude that nav 3 a is required for directing endodermal organogenesis involving coordination of endodermal cell behavior...|$|R
40|$|Self-assembly of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) into {{neurotoxic}} oligomers and fibrillar aggregates is a {{key process}} {{thought to be the}} proximal event leading to development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, numerous {{attempts have been made to}} develop reagents that disrupt this process and prevent the formation of the toxic oligomers and aggregates. An attractive strategy for developing such reagents is to use peptides derived from Aβ based on the assumption that such peptides would bind to full-length Aβ, interfere with binding of additional full-length molecules, and thereby prevent formation of the toxic species. Guided by this rationale, most of the studies in the last two decades have focused on preventing formation of the core cross-β structure of Aβ amyloid fibrils using β-sheet-breaker peptides derived from the central hydrophobic cluster of Aβ. Though this approach is effective in inhibiting fibril formation, it is generally inefficient in preventing Aβ oligomerization. An alternative approach is to use peptides derived from the C-terminus of Aβ, which mediates both oligomerization and fibrillogenesis. This approach has been explored by several groups, including our own, and led to the discovery of several lead peptides with moderate to high inhibitory activity. Interestingly, the mechanisms of these inhibitory effects have been found to be diverse, and only in a small percentage of cases involved interference with β-sheet formation. Here, we review the strategy of using C-terminal fragments of Aβ as <b>modulators</b> of Aβ <b>assembly</b> and discuss the relevant challenges, therapeutic potential, and mechanisms of action of such fragments...|$|R
40|$|Proteins {{associated}} with neurodegenerative diseases are highly pleiomorphic and may adopt an all-α-helical fold in one environment, assemble into all-β-sheet or collapse into a coil in another, and rapidly polymerize {{in yet another}} one via divergent aggregation pathways that yield broad diversity of aggregates' morphology. A thorough understanding of this behaviour {{may be necessary to}} develop a treatment for Alzheimer's and related disorders. Unfortunately, our present comprehension of folding and misfolding is limited for want of a physicochemical theory of protein secondary and tertiary structure. Here we demonstrate that electronic configuration and hyperconjugation of the peptide amide bonds ought {{to be taken into account}} to advance such a theory. To capture the effect of polarization of peptide linkages on conformational and H-bonding propensity of the polypeptide backbone, we introduce a function of shielding tensors of the Cα atoms. Carrying no information about side chain-side chain interactions, this function nonetheless identifies basic features of the secondary and tertiary structure, establishes sequence correlates of the metamorphic and pH-driven equilibria, relates binding affinities and folding rate constants to secondary structure preferences, and manifests common patterns of backbone density distribution in amyloidogenic regions of Alzheimer's amyloid β and tau, Parkinson's α-synuclein and prions. Based on those findings, a split-intein like mechanism of molecular recognition is proposed to underlie dimerization of Aβ, tau, αS and PrPC, and divergent pathways for subsequent association of dimers are outlined; a related mechanism is proposed to underlie formation of PrPSc fibrils. The model does account for: (i) structural features of paranuclei, off-pathway oligomers, non-fibrillar aggregates and fibrils; (ii) effects of incubation conditions, point mutations, isoform lengths, small-molecule <b>assembly</b> <b>modulators</b> and chirality of solid-liquid interface on the rate and morphology of aggregation; (iii) fibril-surface catalysis of secondary nucleation; and (iv) self-propagation of infectious strains of mammalian prions...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{signaling}} pathways {{that are}} involved in protection of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from apoptosis remain poorly understood. This study examines the effect of activators of cAMP/cGMP signaling on apoptosis in non-transfected VSMC and in VSMC transfected with c-myc (VSMC-MYC) or with its functional analogue, E 1 A-adenoviral protein (VSMC-E 1 A). Serum-deprived VSMC-E 1 A exhibited the highest apoptosis measured as the content of chromatin and low molecular weight DNA fragments, phosphatidylserine content in the outer surface of plasma membrane and caspase- 3 activity (ten-, five-, four- and tenfold increase after 6 h of serum withdrawal, respectively). In VSMC-E 1 A, the addition of an activator of adenylate cyclase, forskolin, abolished chromatin cleavage, DNA laddering, caspase- 3 activation and the appearance of morphologically-defined apoptotic cells triggered by 6 h of serum deprivation. In non-transfected VSMC and in VSMC-MYC, 6 h serum deprivation led to approximately six- and threefold activation of chromatin cleavage, respectively, that was also blocked by forskolin. In VSMC-E 1 A, inhibition of apoptosis was observed with other activators of cAMP signaling (cholera toxin, isoproterenol, adenosine, 8 -Br-cAMP), whereas 6 h incubation with modulators of cGMP signaling (8 -Br-cGMP, nitroprusside, atrial natriuretic peptide, L-NAME) did not affect the development of apoptotic machinery. The antiapoptotic effect of forskolin was abolished in 24 h of serum deprivation that was accompanied by normalization of intracellular cAMP content and protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Protection of VSMC-E 1 A from apoptosis by forskolin was blunted by PKA inhibitors (H- 89 and KT 5720), whereas transfection of cells with PKA catalytic subunit attenuated apoptosis triggered by serum withdrawal. The protection of VSMC-E 1 A by forskolin from apoptosis was insensitive to <b>modulators</b> of cytoskeleton <b>assembly</b> (cytochalasin B, colchicine). Neither acute (30 min) nor chronic (24 h) exposure of VSMC to forskolin modified basal and serum-induced phosphorylation of the MAP kinase ERK 1 / 2. Thus, our results show that activation of cAMP signaling delays the development of apoptosis in serum-deprived VSMC at a site upstream of caspase- 3 via activation of PKA and independently of cAMP-induced reorganization of the cytoskeleton network and the ERK 1 / 2 -terminated MAPK signaling cascade...|$|R
40|$|The {{surfaces}} of many Gram-negative bacteria {{are decorated with}} soluble proteins anchored to the outer membrane via an acylated N-terminus; these proteins {{are referred to as}} surface lipoproteins or SLPs. In Neisseria meningitidis, SLPs such as transferrin-binding protein B (TbpB) and factor-H binding protein (fHbp) are essential for host colonization and infection because of their essential roles in iron acquisition and immune evasion, respectively. Recently, we identified a family of outer membrane proteins called Slam (Surface lipoprotein <b>assembly</b> <b>modulator)</b> that are essential for surface display of neisserial SLPs. In the present study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis to identify 832 Slam related sequences in 638 Gram-negative bacterial species. The list included several known human pathogens, many of which were not previously reported to possess SLPs. Hypothesizing that genes encoding SLP substrates of Slams may be present in the same gene cluster as the Slam genes, we manually curated neighboring genes for 353 putative Slam homologs. From our analysis, we found that 185 (~ 52 %) of the 353 putative Slam homologs are located adjacent to genes that encode a protein with an N-terminal lipobox motif. This list included genes encoding previously reported SLPs in Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, for which we were able to show that the neighboring Slams are necessary and sufficient to display these lipoproteins on the surface of Escherichia coli. To further verify the authenticity of the list of predicted SLPs, we tested the surface display of one such Slam-adjacent protein from Pasteurella multocida, a zoonotic pathogen. A robust Slam-dependent display of the P. multocida protein was observed in the E. coli translocation assay indicating that the protein is a Slam-dependent SLP. Based on multiple sequence alignments and domain annotations, we found that an eight-stranded beta-barrel domain is common to all the predicted Slam-dependent SLPs. These findings suggest that SLPs with a TbpB-like fold are found widely in Proteobacteria where they exist with their interaction partner Slam. In the future, SLPs found in pathogenic bacteria can be investigated for their role in virulence and may also serve as candidates for vaccine development...|$|R
40|$|Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a modern, {{non-invasive}} {{imaging technique}} in biomedical research and medical diagnostics. It was initially developed for clinical applications in ophthalmology, providing high-resolution, cross-sectional {{images of the}} retina, retinal nerve fibre layer and the optic nerve head. Today, OCT is used for in vivo imaging of almost every type of tissue and it also branched out in fields outside medicine, like industrial or pharmaceutical applications. OCT is a continuously improving imaging technique, benefiting from the development of advanced optical components and broadband optical sources. The objective of the work presented in the thesis was the development of both short and, respectively, long cavity akinetic optical devices, employing several types of dispersive optical fibre components in the cavity, like chirped fibre Bragg gratings, single mode or dispersion compensating fibre, and actively radio-frequency tuned semiconductor optical amplifiers, used as gain media. The use of external <b>modulators,</b> like Fabry-Perot <b>assemblies,</b> rotating mirrors and other mechanical devices is therefore completely eliminated, while versatility is added in {{the control of the}} coherence length, output bandwidth, repetition rate and power. The short cavity source was developed in the 1060 nm region, the output power and bandwidth showing a slow decay with the increase of repetition rate up to 250 kHz. Without any booster, the power achieved was 2 mW at 100 kHz. A novel dual-mode-locking mechanism was developed in order to tune an akinetic swept source based on dispersive cavities at a repetition rate close to, but different from the inverse of the cavity roundtrip. Several optical source configurations emitting in the 1060 nm or 1550 nm wavelength region were developed, characterised and tested in OCT applications. For the 1550 nm swept source employing a Faraday Rotating Mirror in a dispersive cavity, sweeping rates in the range of MHz were achieved, from 782 kHz to up to 5 times this value, with proportional decrease in the tuning bandwidth. Linewidths smaller than 60 pm and output powers exceeding 10 mW were measured. OCT topographic imaging was demonstrated. The thesis ends with a proposed broadband investigation of microresonators written in silica glass employing akinetic optical sources at 1550 nm. The work presented in this thesis resulted in several peer reviewed papers, one patent application and several conference presentations, listed after the final conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim The {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus {{organized into}} nucleosomal structures. HBV produces covalently closed double-stranded DNA (cccDNA) that {{is found in}} the nuclei of infected cells as a viral minichromosome. HBV encoded proteins HBx and HBc both bind the cccDNA early after infection. HBx is required for the inactivation of the HBV cellular restriction factor smc 5 / 6 and to establish and maintain cccDNA transcription. HBc binding to the cccDNA in thought to contribute to cccDNA chromatinization and nucleosome spacing whereas its impact on cccDNA transcription is still debated. Increasing evidence indicate that HBV proteins regulating viral minichromosomes also interact with the cellular chromatin and chromatin modifying enzymes to target cellular genes expression through epigenetic modifications. A ChIP-Seq genome wide analysis of HBx chromatin recruitment in HBV replicating cells has defined a broad repertoire cellular genes (4. 000) of and ncRNAs (75 miRNAs and 34 lncRNAs) potentially regulated by HBx with an enrichment in genes/ncRNAs involved in cell metabolism, chromatin dynamics and cancer but also in genes/ncRNAs that modulate HBV replication. HBc has also been shown to bind to cellular chromatin (1000 genes) and to the promoters of a subset of cellular genes involved in inflammatory responses and innate immunity. Core protein (Cp) represents an attractive new therapeutic specific target for HBV chronic infection. Cp is essential for HBV genome packaging, reverse transcription, intracellular trafficking and the re-import of encapsidated HBV genomes into the nucleus, but due to its nuclear functions drugs targeting the Cp may also impact on cccDNA transcriptional activity and host genes reprogramming with a great potential for enhanced antiviral activity. The elucidation of the HBc crystal structure and the clarification of core dimers assembly process has {{led to the development of}} several compounds that target Cp and capsid assembly inhibit HBV replication therapeutic potential. We focused on two different classes of Cp <b>assembly</b> <b>modulators.</b> Heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) act as allosteric effectors to increase the kinetics of assembly, strengthen dimer-dimer association and prevent the proper formation of viral capsids with the formation of aberrant core particles at high concentrations. The phenyl-propenamide derivatives AT- 61 and AT- 130 increase capsid assembly reaction rate, interfere with HBV RNA packaging and to the formation of apparently normal empty capsids. Interestingly, compounds belonging to the HAP chemical class have moved into clinical trials. In this third year of my PhD I further investigated the interplay between the impact of HAP 12 and AT- 130 treatment on viral replication and HBV core recruitment on the cccDNA and I expanded these observation on the regulation of cellular genes targeted by Cp. Methods I made use of three cellular models of HBV infection/replication: a) HepAD 38 cells, a stable clone derived from the hepatocellular cell line HepG 2, carry a complete integrated HBV genome under the control of a tetracycline- off inducible promoter; a HepG 2 -NTCP stable clone expressing high levels of the HBV entry receptor Na+/taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), that allow HBV infection in vitro; primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) from multiple donors infeted with HBV inocula purified from the cell supernatants of HepAD 38 stable cell lines. Cells were treated with the anti-capsid HAP 12 and AT- 130 respectively 1 and 5 μM concentration to assess the effects on viral replication. All relevant virological parameters were evaluated: capsid-associated HBV-DNA (TaqMan real-time PCR); cccDNA levels (TaqMan real-time PCR); pgRNA levels (quantitative real-time PCR). Nuclear cccDNA was visualized by DNA FISH using using HBV specific probes encompassing the whole HBV genome. Anti-HBc, anti-HBx and anti-AcH 4 ChIPs and cccDNA-ChIP experiments were performed in TET-released HepAD 38 cells and in mock and HBV-infected NTCP-HepG 2 cells and PHHs and analyzed by TaqMan real-time PCR using cccDNA and gene specific primers. Results I have shown that HAP 12 and AT 130, in addition to suppress efficiently HBV replication prevents the accumulation of nuclear cccDNA by blocking the recycling of mature core particles into the nucleus in TET released HepAD 38 cells. Similarly, HAP 12 treatment of NTCP-HepG 2 cells at the time of HBV infection results in a drastic reduction of cccDNA formation, suggesting an important role of Cp for rcDNA release into the nucleus, conversion of rcDNA into cccDNA or cccDNA chromatinization. Conversely, when HAP 12 treatment was started 10 days post-infection, when the cccDNA pool is established and stable in HBV infected NTCP-HepG 2 cells, I observed very little or no effect on cccDNA levels, a significant reduction of cccDNA transcription and pgRNA levels together with a very strong inhibition of total HBV DNA and viral replication. These results indicate that HAP 12, in addition to target capsid formation and pgRNA encapsidation in the cytoplasm, also affect cccDNA function in the nucleus. Next, I confirmed that Cp binds to the cccDNA in all the HBV infection/replication models and I showed that Cp recruitment on the cccDNA occurs as early as 2 hours post-infection in HBV infected PHHs, preceding the binding of HBx onto the cccDNA that becomes evident at 4 - 8 hours post-infection. Finally, I investigated the ability of Cp to bind to selected cellular promoters in HBV infected cells and the HAP 12 onto Cp recruitment on these promoters. To this aim I performed anti-HBc ChIP assays in TET released HepAD 38 cells, HBV infected NTCP-HepG 2 cells and HBV infected PHHs and I confirmed Cp binding to the regulatory regions of the Ezh 2 histon methyl-transferase, the cSrc proto-oncogene (that has been also shown to potentiate HBV replication), the E 2 F 1 transcription factor and cell cycle regulator, and the IL 29 /lamda 3 interferon, whereas the IL 6 promoter was consitently not enriched and served as negative control. Importantly, HAP treatment was able to blocks Cp recruitment on genes promoters. Altogether these results identify capsid inhibitors as the first class of “virus specific” compounds capable to target the cccDNA functions and potentially counteract Cp pathogenicity in infected hepatocytes...|$|R
