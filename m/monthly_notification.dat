40|$|The {{existence}} of nonlinear interaction {{in the spread}} of various infectious diseases is extensively discussed in mathematical biology literature. Since these models are predominantly based on the studies of biological objects with almost no reference {{to the complexity of}} social structures, the negligence of socio-spatial parameters in these models is often inherent. Present paper intends to contribute to the understanding of epidemical diffusion process from a socio-spatial perspective. The emphasize is on two directions, namely a qualitative description of the diffusion of epidemics in a regional setup in order to incorporate the spatial aspects of the diffusion process, and an analytical framework to bring together the spatial and nonlinear analysis into the study of irregular phenomena observed in the outbreak of epidemics in human geographic space. A general model is suggested and various hypothesis are tested by using <b>monthly</b> <b>notification</b> of the occurrence of various epidemics in Danish regions. ...|$|E

Based on MUN results during the summer of 2001, 50 farms with high MUN values and 30 with low values were randomly allocated to become either intervention or control farms. From January to November 2002 (the trial period), intervention included <b>monthly</b> <b>notification</b> of individual cow MUN results, interpretation of abnormal average MUN values in subgroups of cows based on parity and days-in-milk, and suggestion of possible nutritional reasons for the abnormal MUNs.

Control farms received the individual cow MUN results, but no additional interpretation. No significant differences in average MUN or standardized milk production between intervention and control farms were seen during the last three months of the trial (the outcome period). However, in herds making a feed change in response to MUN notification and interpretation (71 % of intervention herds), milk production increased 2. 4 lb (1. 1 kg) /cow per day in the month after the feed change when compared to randomly selected herds not making a feed change during the same time period. Most dairy producers receiving the MUN notification and interpretation reports felt they knew how to use MUN reports after the trial, and felt that MUN testing was at least somewhat useful as a nutritional tool. ...|$|E

In utero transmission can occur during primary maternal infection, reactivation or reinfection of seropositive mothers. Objective: To describe the aetiology and clinical features of infants diagnosed with congenital CMV and to document maternal factors that were presented. Methods: Active national surveillance was initiated in 1999 in collaboration with the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Results: <b>Monthly</b> <b>notifications</b> resulted in 70 cases of congenital CMV being identified between 1999 and 2003. Nearly all of the cases were symptomatic with the most common clinical sequelae reported in infected infants being jaundice, thrombocytopaenia, hepatomegaly, petechiae, purpura and splenomegaly. Almost half (43. 5 %) of the infants had central nervous system (CNS) complications, such as microcephaly, chorioretinitis, sensorineural hearing loss, intracranial calcifications, developmental delay or seizures, with over half presenting two or more CNS abnormalities. Maternal febrile illness was noted in 54. 8 % of the cases. The majority of mothers were primiparous (46. 4 %) or secundiparous (39. 3 %), indicating two different population groups at risk of primary CMV infection.

DESIGN [...] Study of drowned and nearly drowned children under 15 years old. SETTING [...] United Kingdom, 1988 and 1989. SUBJECTS [...] Children under 15 years either drowning or admitted to hospital after a submersion incident. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number of nearly drowned children, obtained from consultant paediatricians returning <b>monthly</b> <b>notification</b> cards through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Number of drowned children notified by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and other national epidemiological offices; information from coroners. RESULTS [...] 306 children had confirmed submersion incidents: 149 died and 157 survived after near drowning. The annual incidence in England and Wales was 1. 5 / 100, 000, and mortality 0. 7 / 100, 000. Mortality was lowest in public pools 6 % (2 / 32) and highest in rivers, canals, and lakes (78 %, 56 / 73).

CONCLUSIONS [...] Drowning and near drowning of children are problems in the British Isles. Appropriate supervision and safety barriers seem important for preventing such accidents. Improving information on dangers of drowning given to parents through the child surveillance programmes, encouraging fencing or draining of garden ponds and domestic swimming pools, and increasing supervision of swimming in lakes, rivers, and beaches should reduce the number of accidents...|$|E
40|$|Dengue is {{becoming}} an increasing threat to non-endemic countries. In Japan, the reported number of imported cases has been rising, and the first domestic dengue outbreak in nearly 70 years was confirmed in 2014, highlighting the need for greater situational awareness and better-informed risk assessment. Using national disease surveillance data and publically available traveler statistics, we compared monthly and yearly trends in the destination country-specific dengue notification rate per 100, 000 Japanese travelers with those of domestic dengue cases in the respective country visited during 2006 - 2014. Comparisons were made for countries accounting {{for the majority of}} importations; yearly comparisons were restricted to countries where respective national surveillance data were publicly available. There were 1007 imported Japanese dengue cases (Bali, Indonesia (n = 202), the Philippines (n = 230), Thailand (n = 160), and India (n = 152)). Consistent with historic local dengue seasonality, <b>monthly</b> <b>notification</b> rate among travelers peaked in August in Thailand, September in the Philippines, and in Bali during April with a smaller peak in August. While the number of travelers to Bali was greatest in August, the notification rate was highest in April. Annually, trends in the notification rate among travelers to the Philippines and Thailand also closely reflected local notification trends. Travelers to dengue-endemic countries appear to serve as reliable "sentinels", with the trends in estimated risk of dengue infection among Japanese travelers closely reflecting local dengue trends, both seasonally and annually. Sentinel traveler surveillance can contribute to evidence-based pretravel advice, and help inform risk assessments and decision-making for importation and potentially for subsequent secondary transmission. As our approach takes advantage of traveler data that are readily available as a proxy denominator, sentinel traveler surveillance can be a practical surveillance tool that other countries could consider for implementation...|$|E

40|$|Best {{available}} {{descriptions of}} malaria incidence and mortality dynamics {{are important to}} improve and evaluate the implementation of programs to monitor (e. g., remote sensing) and control disease, especially in endemic zones. High-frequency (e. g., semi-annual and seasonal) cycles in malaria incidence have been observed in various countries and they coincide with cycles in the natural environment (e. g., temperature, heliogeophysical activity, etc.). However, neither trend nor cyclical oscillations beyond a 6 -month (0. 5 -year) period for this vector-borne disease were reported in a recent analysis on <b>monthly</b> <b>notifications</b> in Burundi for the years 1997 – 2003. Since the examination of graphical plots indicated an eventual existence of trans-year (multiannual) variations, we further analyzed the same data in more detail. Here we explore whether low-frequency cycles (beyond seasonality) might exist (e. g., trans-year cycles with periods of 13 – 24 months or longer). Monthly incidence rate per 100 inhabitants from the Province of Karuzi, Burundi, over the years 1997 – 2003 was analysed. The exploration of underlying chronomes (time structures) was done by linear and non-linear parametric regression models, autocorrelation, spectral analysis (e. g., fast Fourier transforms), periodogram regression analysis (PRA) and wavelet transform (WT). By using a periodogram regression analysis, we describe a multicomponent cyclic chronome with periods T> 12 months (19 and 86 months, all at P< 0. 05). Notably, the strongest cyclic pattern in the periodogram of the detrended malaria rates (whereas the peak was suppressed and beyond the semi-annual cycle of 6 months) was ? 1. 5 – 1. 6 years (T= 19. 0 months, R= 0. 32). A dynamic pattern of “shortening” of the length (period) of the cycles was observed during the pre-epidemic interval (from 8 – 9 to 5 – 6 months and from 20 – 22 to 16 – 18 months in years 1997 – 2000) {{that can be used}} to anticipate a forthcoming incidence increase and epidemic levels of malaria at a regional level. Indeed, these cycles in malaria incidence correspond to cyclic components of heliogeophysical activity (HGA) such as the sunspot cycle impulses of 0. 5 – 2. 0 years as well as the quasi-biennial solar magnetic cycle of 1. 5 – 2. 5 years and further, detailed analyses are warranted to investigate such relationships. A multicomponent dynamic cyclical pattern of malaria incidence variations in Burundi (1997 – 2003) exists thus allowing further, more specific analyses and modelling as well as correlations with similar environmental cycles to be explored. These results might also contribute to better estimates for forecasting, prevention and understanding of malaria dynamics and aetiolog...|$|R
40|$|Background: Australia has a {{statutory}} {{incident reporting}} system for radiopharmaceutical maladministrations, but additional research into registry data {{is required for}} the purpose of quality improvement in nuclear medicine. Aims: We (i) used control charts to identify factors contributing to special cause variation (indicating higher than expected rates) in maladministrations and (ii) evaluated the impact of heterogeneous notification criteria and extent of underreporting among jurisdictions and individual facilities, respectively. Methods: Anonymised summaries of Australian Radiation Incident Register reports permitted calculation of national <b>monthly</b> maladministration <b>notification</b> rates for 2007 – 2012 and preparation of control charts. Multivariate logistic regression assessed the association of population, insurance and regulatory characteristics with maladministration notifications in each Australian State and Territory. Maladministration notification rates from two facilities with familiarity of notification processes and commitment to radiation protection were compared with those elsewhere. Results: Special cause variation occurred in only 3 months, but contributed to 21 % of all incidents (42 of 197 patients), mainly because of 'clusters' of maladministrations (n = 24) arising from errors in bulk radiopharmaceutical dispensing. Maladministration notification rates varied significantly between jurisdictions (0 to 12. 2 maladministrations per 100 [*] 000 procedures (P < 0. 05)) and individual facilities (31. 7 vs 5. 8 per 100 [*] 000; χ² = 40; 1 [*]degree of freedom, P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Unexpected increases in maladministration notifications predominantly relate to incident 'clusters' affecting multiple patients. The bulk preparation of radiopharmaceuticals is a vulnerable process and merits additional safeguards. Maladministration notification rates in Australia are heterogeneous. Adopting uniform maladministration notification criteria among States and Territories and methods to overcome underreporting are warranted. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) {{remains a}} major global health problem. Globally, the {{incidence}} and mortality of TB were 122 and 18 per 100 000 population in 2012, while TB notification and death rate were 67. 9 and 2. 8 per 100 000 population in Hong Kong. With improvement in diagnosis and case finding, the TB incidence, prevalence and mortality rate were descending. Also, TB treatment success and detection rates were increasing. TB {{is still an}} infectious disease leading to considerable burden in Hong Kong. Many studies have found seasonal pattern of TB in other countries or cities. However, the reason of seasonality of tuberculosis is still remain unknown. This dissertation assessed yearly trends and seasonal variability of tuberculosis and {{the potential impact of}} meteorological variables on seasonality of TB in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2012. The finding could help us to better understand the pattern and the factors associated with seasonality of TB, and to inform future TB research and health policy strategies for TB control. Method Firstly, we did a literature review of seasonality of TB. Then we assessed the disease burden, trends and seasonality of TB. The data of TB age-specific and sex-specific notifications and notification rate, TB disease form-specific notifications and meteorological observations are mainly aggregated sources downloaded from public websites. Descriptive analysis methods were used to assess the characteristics of disease burden of TB and analytical analysis methods were used to assess the trends of TB age-specific, sex-specific notification rates and disease form-specific TB notifications in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2012. We assessed the seasonality of TB in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2012 with a Serfling model. Lastly, we used linear regression model to assess the potential impact of the meteorological predictors on the seasonality. Results The mean TB notification rate and death rate were 83. 4 and 3. 6 per 100, 000 population respectively in 2001 - 2012. The overall trends of TB notification rate and death rate are descending in Hong Kong for the period. The disease burden of TB was much higher but decline faster for men than that for female. For age-specific descending trends of disease burden of TB, the trends were faster as the age groups getting older. In most of the reviewed studies from 1971 to 2012,the peak of TB cases was mainly in spring and summer and trough in winter. The seasonal pattern of TB of some countries and cities had different characteristics stratified by factors such as gender, sex, latitude and disease form. Most of the studies suggested that vitamin D deficiency, indoor activities, meteorological observations and health care seeking behaviour are the main possible factors contributing to seasonality of TB. TB notifications in Hong Kong exhibited a peak in summer and trough in winter. Except duration of sunshine, all meteorological variables including temperature, humidity, and solar radiation were significantly associated with monthly TB notification rate. The final predictive model included predictors such as time, temperature and solar radiation. 1 deg. C increase in monthly mean temperature was associated with 0. 12 (with 95 % CI of (0. 084, 0. 16)) per 100, 000 population increasing of TB <b>monthly</b> <b>notification</b> rate, while 1 MJ/m 2 increase in monthly global solar radiation was associated with 0. 064 (with 95 % CI of (0. 005, 0. 12)) per 100, 000 population decreasing of TB <b>monthly</b> <b>notification</b> rate. By comparing different models, temperature seemed to explain the observed seasonal pattern, while solar radiation had a more independent effect. Conclusion The study showed a higher TB disease burden in male which increases with age. The peak season of TB transmission should be in winter. We suggest more effective TB control strategies focusing on target groups including children, elders and relapse cases. As a general measure, we may encourage outdoor activities and more exposure to sunlight. We also suggest further studies to explore the relationship between humidity and vitamin D deficiency and seasonality of TB. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{describes}} and {{assesses the}} electronic surveillance of outbreaks {{based on the}} early warning for four endemic diseases – typhoid fever, amebic dysentery, viral hepatitis A and brucellosis – in Lebanon, for the first 28 weeks of 2005 and first 26 weeks of 2007. Methods The electronic early warning system {{is based on the}} mandatory notification of 37 targeted diseases. The four target diseases assessed in this paper are based on <b>monthly</b> <b>notification.</b> Standards were set for case definitions and forms. Physicians and hospitals report to the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), where data is checked and transmitted to a central location for entry into the national database, which stores historical and current data, as well as population estimates based on national surveys. The event date was selected for case dating. Indicators triggering abnormalities include number of cases, rates, and relative ratios. Four relative ratios were selected using the period of 1 week, 4 weeks or 52 weeks for the current and previous years. Screening was conducted on a weekly basis in 2005, and on a daily basis in 2007. Abnormal signals were verified, documented and grouped by alert-episodes for each disease, district, and period. MOPH teams verified and investigated case clustering. Results During the first 28 weeks of 2005 and the first 26 weeks of 2007, screening operations were 68 % and 89 %, respectively, for completeness. Detected abnormal signals were 26 and 166 and identified alert-episodes were 11 and 22, respectively. Verified clusters were 7 and 11; positive predictive value for clusters identification was 64 % and 50 %, respectively. The time interval between first cases and first abnormal signals was on average 4 weeks and 5 weeks, respectively. Conclusion Timely reporting, transmission, data entry, analysis and communication are the elements of timely outbreak detection. The electronic surveillance of outbreaks for epidemic-prone diseases, which are mandatory notified on a monthly basis using indicator-based thresholds, is capable of detecting spatio-temporal clusters and outbreaks; however, with some delay. The national surveillance system needs to be reviewed in order to provide timely data for early warning surveillance and response. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background Midwifery-led care during labour {{and birth}} in the UK is {{increasingly}} important given national commitments to choice of place of birth, reduction of unnecessary intervention and improving women’s experience of care, and evidence on safety and benefits for‘low risk’ women. Further evidence is needed on safety and {{potential benefits of}} midwifery-led care for some groups of‘higher risk’ women and about uncommon adverse outcomes or‘near-miss’ events. Uncommon obstetric events and conditions have been investigated since 2005 using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System. This programme of research will establish the UK Midwifery Study System (UKMidSS) in all UK alongside midwifery units (AMUs) and carry out the first two UKMidSS studies investigating: (i) outcomes in severely obese women admitted to AMUs, and (ii) risk factors for neonatal unit admission following birth in an AMU. Methods We will carry out national cohort and case-control studies using UKMidSS, a national data collection platform which we will establish to collect anonymised information from all UK AMUs. Reporting midwives in each AMU will actively report cases or nil returns in response to <b>monthly</b> <b>notification</b> emails. Denominator data {{on the number of}} women admitted to and giving birth in each AMU will also be collected. Anonymised data on risk factors, management and outcomes for cases and controls/comparators as appropriate for each study, will be collected electronically using information from medical records. We will calculate incidence and prevalence with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), tabulate descriptive data using frequencies and proportions, and use logistic regression to estimate odds ratios with 95 % CIs comparing specific outcomes in case and comparison women and to investigate risk factors for conditions or outcomes Discussion As the first national infrastructure facilitating research into uncommon events and conditions in women starting labour in midwifery-led settings, UKMidSS builds on the success of other national research systems. UKMidSS studies will extend the evidence base regarding the quality and safety of midwifery-led intrapartum care and investigate extending the benefits of midwifery-led care to more women. As a national collaboration of midwives contributing to high quality research, UKMidSS will provide an infrastructure to support midwifery research capacity development</p...|$|E

Here, we aim to study the potential climatic drivers of influenza-like illness (ILI) epidemiology in Vietnam, a tropical country characterized by a high diversity of climates. We specifically focus on quantifying and explaining the seasonality of ILI. MethodsWe used 18 years (1993 – 2010) of <b>monthly</b> ILI <b>notifications</b> aggregated by province (52) and monthly climatic variables (minimum, mean, maximum temperatures, absolute and relative humidities, rainfall and hours of sunshine) from 67 weather stations across Vietnam. Seasonalities were quantified from global wavelet spectra, using the value of the power at the period of 1 year as a measure of the intensity of seasonality. The 7 climatic time series were characterized by 534 summary statistics which were entered into a regression tree to identify factors associated with the seasonality of AH. Results were extrapolated to the global scale using simulated climatic times series from the NCEP/NCAR project. ResultsThe intensity of ILI seasonality in Vietnam is best explained by the intensity of AH seasonality. We find that ILI seasonality is weak in provinces experiencing weak seasonal fluctuations in AH (annual power 17. 6). In Vietnam, AH and ILI are positively correlated. ConclusionsOur results identify a role for AH in driving the epidemiology of ILI in a tropical setting. However, in contrast to temperate regions, high rather than low AH is associated with increased ILI activity. Fluctuation in AH may be the climate factor that underlies and unifies the seasonality of ILI in both temperate and tropical regions. Alternatively, the mechanism of action of AH on disease transmission may be different in cold-dry versus hot-humid settings...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{establish}} the incidence and aetiology of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) in Australia and compare clinical and microbial characteristics of sporadic and outbreak cases.  METHODS—National active surveillance through the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit with <b>monthly</b> case <b>notification</b> from paediatricians, July 1994 to June 1998. Children under 15 years presenting with microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal impairment were identified.  RESULTS—Ninety eight cases were identified (incidence 0. 64 per 105 children < 15 years/annum and 1. 35 per 105 children < 5 years/annum). Eighty four {{were associated with}} diarrhoea (64 sporadic, 20 constituting an outbreak) and 14 were atypical. Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O 111 :H− {{was the most common}} isolate in sporadic HUS and caused the outbreak. However O 111 :H− isolates from outbreak and sporadic cases differed in phage type and subtyping by DNA electrophoresis. STEC isolates from sporadic cases included O 26 :H−, O 113 :H 21, O 130 :H 11, OR:H 9, O 157 :H−, ONT:H 7, and ONT:H−. STEC O 157 :H 7 was not isolated from any case. Only O 111 :H− isolates produced both Shiga toxins 1 and 2 and possessed genes encoding E coli attaching and effacing gene (intimin) and enterohemolysin. Outbreak cases had worse gastrointestinal and renal disease at presentation and more extrarenal complications.  CONCLUSIONS—Linking national surveillance with a specialised laboratory service allowed estimation of HUS incidence and provided information on its aetiology. In contrast to North America, Japan, and the British Isles, STEC O 157 :H 7 is rare in Australia; however, non-O 157 :H 7 STEC cause severe disease including outbreaks. Disease severity in outbreak cases may relate to yet unidentified virulence factors of the O 111 :H− strain isolated. ...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{is still}} a serious public health problem in various countries. One of the long-elusive but {{critical}} questions about TB is what the risk factors are and how they contribute for its seasonality. An ecologic {{study was conducted to}} examine the association between the variation of outdoor PM 2. 5 concentration and the TB seasonality based on the <b>monthly</b> TB <b>notification</b> and PM 2. 5 concentration data of Hong Kong and Beijing. Both descriptive analysis and Poisson regression analysis suggested that the outdoor PM 2. 5 concentration could be a potential risk factor for the seasonality of TB disease. The significant relationship between the number of TB cases and PM 2. 5 concentration was not changed when regression models were adjusted by sunshine duration, a potential confounder. The regression analysis showed that a 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2. 5 concentrations during winter is significantly associated with a 3 % (i. e. 18 and 14 cases for Beijing and Hong Kong, respectively) {{increase in the number of}} TB cases notified during the coming spring or summer for both Beijing and Hong Kong. Three potential mechanisms were proposed to explain the significant relationship: (1) increased PM 2. 5 exposure increases host's susceptibility to TB disease by impairing or modifying the immunology of the human respiratory system; (2) increased indoor activities during high outdoor PM 2. 5 episodes leads to an increase in human contact and thus the risk of TB transmission; (3) the seasonal change of PM 2. 5 concentration is correlated with the variation of other potential risk factors of TB seasonality. Preliminary evidence from the analysis of this work favors the first mechanism about the PM 2. 5 exposure-induced immunity impairment. This work adds new horizons to the explanation of the TB seasonality and improves our understanding of the potential mechanisms affecting TB incidence, which benefits the prevention and control of TB disease...|$|R
40|$|Best {{available}} {{descriptions of}} malaria incidence and mortality dynamics {{are important to}} better plan and evaluate the implementation of programs to monitor (e. g., remote sensing) and control the disease, especially in endemic zones. This was stressed recently by Cibulskis et al (2007) {{in the view of}} completeness of monthly reporting for cerebral malaria admissions in Papua New Guinea (latitude 6 degree S, 1987 - 1996). Notably, regardless of the rate of its completeness, the temporal dynamics of admissions was preserved over the years, however, neither raw data nor results on further analyses about eventual inter-annual cyclic components (periods T&#x 3 e; 1 year) were provided despite obvious graphical patterns for such a specific time structure (chronome). Interestingly, in a recent analysis by Gomez-Elipe et al (2007) on <b>monthly</b> malaria <b>notifications</b> in Burundi, at almost the same latitude (province of Karuzi, &#x 3 e; 3 degree S, 1997 - 2001), the data have shown neither trend not periodic oscillations beyond a 6 -month (0. 5 -year) period. Since the graphical representation of both data sets have indicated an eventual existence of inter-annual variations, and because both are located at the same latitude zone, we have further analyzed the data from Burundi for such periodic oscillations. By using a periodogram regression analysis, we discovered a multicomponent cyclic chronome with periods above 12 months (T= 17. 5 - 18. 0, 27. 5 and 65. 0 - 65. 5 months, all at p&#x 3 c; 0. 05). Notably, the most strong cyclic pattern at p&#x 3 c; 0. 002 in the periodogram of the detrended malaria rates in Burundi remained only that with a peak at about 1. 5 years (period T= 17. 5 - 18. 0 months, R= 0. 51, z= 5. 3). It is possible that likely inter-annual cyclic patterns might exist also in the time structure for cerebral malaria admissions in Papua New Guinea and, if confirmed, these may be found very useful in epidemic forecasting and programs implementation. We explored these cyclic variations and also discussed possible associations with environmental factors exhibiting alike cyclicity...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{report the}} {{epidemiological}} surveillance of intoxication from sanitizers {{using the method}} of active case finding of hospital workers who experienced adverse effects. Data Synthesis: Experience report of university extension activities developed at the Center for Intoxication Control of the Regional University Hospital of Maringá in the period from 2010 to 2011. The activities focused on {{the application of the}} Surveillance-Education-Assistance triad. In all, 25 hospital workers who experienced adverse effects of sanitizers participated in the study. Data collection occurred through documentary research, analysis of <b>monthly</b> reports, and <b>Notification</b> Forms for Adverse Effects. After that, a semistructured interview was conducted with the subjects. Data were compared with the literature, and the results were presented in three moments: description of the active case finding process; exposure of the settings and implementation of the experience, and conclusive analysis of the experience. The main complaints of the interviewees were nasal congestion, burning eyes, sore throat and headache. All the workers reported using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). However, eight interviewees were referred to the occupational medical service and received guidance on the use of specific PPE. Five of them confirmed following the guidelines and all remained in the same job.

Data from the UK TOBY Cooling Register {{provides the opportunity}} to examine how one new effective therapy for newborn infants suspected of suffering asphyxial encephalopathy – therapeutic hypothermia- was implemented in the UK. Methodology/Principal Findings:We analysed returned data forms from inception of the Register in December 2006 {{to the end of}} July 2011.

40|$|Abstract Background Strong {{regional}} heterogeneity {{and generally}} sub-optimal rates of measles vaccination in Italy have, to date, hampered attainment of WHO targets for measles elimination, and have generated {{the need for}} the new Italian National Measles Elimination Plan. Crucial to success of the plan is the identification of intervention priorities based upon a clear picture of the regional epidemiology of measles derived from the use of data to estimate basic parameters. Previous estimates of measles force of infection for Italy have appeared anomalously low. It has been argued elsewhere that this results from Italian selective under-reporting by age of cases and that the true measles force of infection in Italy is probably similar to that of other European countries. A deeper examination of the evidence for this conjecture is undertaken in the present paper. Methods Using <b>monthly</b> regional case <b>notifications</b> data from 1949 to the start of vaccination in 1976 and notifications by age from 1971 – 76, summary equilibrium parameters (force of infection (FOI), basic reproductive ratio (R 0) and critical vaccination coverage (p c)) are calculated for each region and for each of 5 plausible contact patterns. An analysis of the spectra of incidence profiles is also carried out. Finally a transmission dynamics model is employed to explore the correspondence between projections using different estimates of force of infection and data on seroprevalence in Italy. Results FOI estimates are lower than comparable European FOIs and there is substantial regional heterogeneity in basic reproductive ratios; certain patterns of contact matrices are demonstrated to be unfeasible. Most regions show evidence of 3 -year epidemic cycles or longer, and compared with England & Wales there appears to be little synchronisation between regions. Modelling results suggest that the lower FOI estimated from corrected aggregate national data matches serological data more closely than that estimated from typical European data. Conclusion Results suggest forces of infection in Italy, though everywhere remaining below the typical European level, are historically higher in the South where currently vaccination coverage is lowest. There appears to be little evidence to support the suggestion that a higher true force of infection is masked by age bias in reporting. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{notice of}} {{construction}} (NOC) requests a categorical approval for construction {{and operation of}} three types of portable/temporary radionuclide airborne emission units (PTRAEUs). These three types are portable ventilation-filter systems (Type I), mobile sample preparation facilities (Type II), and mobile sample screening and analysis facilities (Type 111). Approval of the NOC application is intended to allow construction and operation of {{the three types of}} PTRAEUs without prior project-specific approval. Environmental cleanup efforts on the Hanford Site often require the use of PTRAEUs. The PTRAEUs support site characterization activities, expedited response actions (ERAs), sampling and monitoring activities, and other routine activities. The PTRAEUs operate at various locations around the Hanford Site. Radiation Air Emissions Program, Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246 - 247, requires that the Washington State Department of Health (WDOH) be notified before construction of any new emission that would release airborne radioactivity. The WDOH also must receive notification before any modification of an existing source. This includes changes in the source term or replacement of emission control equipment that might significantly contribute to the offsite maximum dose from a licensed facility. During site characterization activities, ERAs, sampling and monitoring activities, and other routine activities, the PTRAEUs might require startup immediately. The notification period hampers efforts to complete such activities in an effective and timely manner. Additionally, notification is to be submitted to the WDOH when the PTRAEUs are turned off. The U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) potentially could generate several <b>notifications</b> <b>monthly.</b> The WDOH would be required to review and provide approval on each NOC as well as review the notices of discontinued sources. The WDOH regulation also allows facilities the opportunity to request a single categorical license that identifies limits and conditions of operations for similar multipurpose temporary and or portable emission units. The DOE-RL will submit annually to the WDOH a report summarizing the log books maintained on the individual PTRAEUs that are used during the reporting period. The report will supply information needed to ensure compliance with the condition of operations. The NOC includes a general description of the three types of PTRAEUs, tracking mechanisms, emissions control systems, and radioactivity handling limits (RHLs) for the PTR 4 EUs. The NOC is based on hypothetical data to demonstrate how emission estimates could be calculated. Tracking will be performed and monitoring will be conducted for compliance with both federal and state regulations. Type I units will use a single isotope based on a calculated RHL (source term) to determine emissions, dose, and monitoring requirements. Type I 1 and 111 units will use field data and process knowledge to determine emissions, dose, and monitoring requirements. New PTRAEUs that conform to any of the three types of PTRAEUs described in this application will be added to the next annual report after the units are placed in service. New PTRAEUs, which do not conform to any of the three types of PTRAEUs described in this application, will require approval on an individual basis by the WDOH before startup...|$|R
