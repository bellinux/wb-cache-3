The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the <b>moisture</b> <b>level</b> is between 18 and 25 percent.

For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the <b>moisture</b> <b>level</b> at which they expand the most.

40|$|Rock {{moisture}} content was determined for rock samples on {{different aspects of}} rock outcrops on Livingston Island during a summer season. As {{a result of the}} dominant rainbearing northerly winds the southern aspect usually has rock <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> lower than the northern. The southern aspect, however, experiences high rock <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> during periods of snowmelt; snow accumulates on the southern, lee-side of the rock outcrops. Wetting and drying events are more frequent on the northern exposure, although not as common as at a site open through the full 360 °, while the southern aspect tends to experience continuous, low <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> with infrequent dry events. Contrary to earlier suggestions, freeze–thaw weathering {{does not appear to be}} a major factor during the summer. Although rock <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> are conducive to freeze–thaw, rock temperatures rarely go below 0 °C. Rather, it appears that weathering due to wetting and drying may be more common on the northern aspects than was previously thought while chemical weathering is active on southerly aspects.

These ships are also fitted with Sulzer und Weise seawater fire-fighting pumps and sprinkler systems. These are also ready to wet down the warship's ammunition magazines.

The galleys are fitted with an ANSUL system and the flight deck and hangar with a Noske Kaeser Hy FEx foam fire extinguishing system. Two Pall Rochem reverse-osmosis plants generate 15 cubic metres of fresh water each every 24 hours.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of increased soil <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> on the decomposition processes in a peat-extracted bog. Field experiments, in which soil <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> were manipulated, were conducted using 320 microcosms in the Wainfleet Bog from May 2002 to November 2004. Decomposition was measured using litter bags and monitoring the abundance of macro invertebrate decomposers known as Collembola. Litter bags containing wooden toothpicks (n= 2240), filter paper (n= 480) and Betula pendula leaves (n= 40) were buried in the soil and removed at regular time intervals up to one year. The results of the litter bag studies demonstrated a significant reduction of the decomposition of toothpicks (p< 0. 001), filter paper (p< 0. 001), and Betula pendula leaves (p<O. OO I) when soil <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> were increased to levels approaching those of natural conditions. These conditions significantly reduced the mean mass loss of toothpicks by 30 %, filter paper by 20 % and Betula pendula leaves by 18 % over one year when compared to the control. The abundance of Collembola was monitored using a non-destructive method in the microcosms. By contrast the effect of increased <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> on the abundance of Collembola was more variable and difficult to interpret. The conclusions of this study indicate that the Wainfleet Bog is a highly disturbed peatland and that the greatest reductions in decomposition can be obtained by restoring the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> near those of undisturbed conditions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of soil <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> (field capacity [FC], half field capacity [HFC] and double field capacity [DFC]) on growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization of two crops (Phaseolus mungo Roxb. var. PU- 35 and Triticum aestivum L. var. WH- 147) and seedlings of two multi purpose tree species (Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. [Clone C- 7, ITC, Bhadrachalam] and Albizia procera Benth.). Significant increase in plant growth parameters and phosphorus (P) uptake was recorded after inoculations with AM fungi (Acaulospora scrobiculata Trappe, Glomus cerebriforme McGee and G. intraradix Schenck & Smith). Different AM fungi were effective in terms of plant growth and P uptake at different soil <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> with most of them having maximum efficacy at FC. Maximum AM activity in terms of arbuscules, vesicles, sporocarp formation, colonization index and spore count per 100 g soil was also recorded at FC in studied plants. While ranking the importance of two factors studied viz., soil <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> and inoculation with AM fungi for their effect on the growth of crop / trees, inoculations with AM fungi ranked first (explaining 33 to 86 % variation in plant growth) for P. mungo, T. aestivum and A. procera (forward selection method), whereas soil <b>moisture</b> <b>levels</b> dominantly explained the growth variation in E. tereticornis, except few cases. The results obtained in present study suggest that inoculation of plants with a suitable AM consortium could be more beneficial as compared to individual AM fungi, depending upon the soil moisture content of the fields and plant species.
