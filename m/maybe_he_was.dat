500|$|The {{goal was}} not {{reviewed}} immediately, so {{officials did not}} notice Hull's foot in the crease until minutes later. [...] After video reviews showed Hull's position, the goal was still upheld, leaving the Sabres infuriated. Hašek commented, [...] "Maybe [...] was in the bathroom. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sleeping. Maybe he doesn't know the rule." [...] The following season, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced that video replays {{would no longer be}} used to judge if players are in the crease or not, {{and that it would be}} a judgment call by the officiating crew. After the season ended, Hašek contemplated retirement because of a combination of injuries and a desire to become more involved in his family life. The announcement stunned many of his teammates, particularly Mike Peca and Jason Woolley.|$|E
500|$|Although Karofsky {{begins the}} second season as an {{ordinary}} jock bully, Murphy hinted to Adler {{that there would be}} more in store for the character. According to Adler, Murphy approached him at {{the second season}} premiere and said, we just wrote some really good stuff for you for episode six'." [...] The actor recalls, [...] "I had no idea what that meant, until I read it!" [...] Adler had long wondered why his character behaved the way he did: [...] "I thought there's got to be a reason why he's so angry, why he's such a bully, why he's going {{out of his way to}} make other people's lives a living hell". Although he had considered various ideas for Karofsky—"maybe he was jealous of the glee club, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gay, maybe a million different things"—when he got the script for that episode he [...] "was just as shocked as anybody else" [...] when his character kissed Kurt, though he [...] "thought it was so awesome that they would allow this character to go there." ...|$|E
500|$|Jesus reveals He goes to Earth every 100 {{years or}} so {{to check on the}} world, and since His Father had become highly {{irritable}} after giving up smoking, He needed some time away. He and Peter become friends, and Peter invites Him to dinner, along with Brian. Brian asks Jesus for proof He is Jesus Christ, so Jesus proves He is, by turning everyone's dinner into sundaes and, on Peter's request, makes Lois' breasts enlarge to massive proportions. Peter convinces Him to make his second coming public. Jesus walks on water to retrieve a dollar bill that blew out of Peter's hand. Consequently, He becomes famous and makes celebrity appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and the MTV Movie Awards. He begins to neglect His friendship with Peter, due to Him now being popular. The next day, Peter watches the news, where Tom Tucker reports that Jesus was found in Mary-Kate Olsen's apartment that morning face down and unconscious. Tom reports that police have revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus, who quoted [...] "Jews are responsible for all the world's wars". Jesus is arrested for His illegal prank and is sent to jail. Peter is asked by Jesus to bail Him out. Now in disrepute, Jesus decides that <b>maybe</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> not mature enough to return to the world yet and bids farewell to the family. Before He leaves this world, Jesus gives Peter a present, another record of [...] "Surfin' Bird", and it ends with Stewie groaning in genuine rage when Peter begins annoying his family with the song again.|$|E

2500|$|In 1971, Menzel {{said that}} Arnold may have merely seen spots {{of water on}} his airplane's windows; Maccabee says that this contradicts Arnold's {{testimony}} that he had specifically ruled out water spots or reflections shortly after seeing the nine UFOs. For example, the early Bill Bequette article of June 26 in the East Oregonian has Arnold saying he at first thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seeing reflections off his window, but [...] "he still saw the objects after rolling it down." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the Chicago Tribune, an {{investigation}} began in May after police {{were informed that}} fighting dogs were being bred and raised at the home. Two workers for an animal shelter {{said that they had}} tipped off police. Officials close to the investigation confirmed their role. Neighbors told the news media that they had also called police to complain about barking from the barn and what was described as [...] "a stench" [...] by several. One neighbor said that he had called police several months ago after seeing a dog chained in the yard on a hot day without water. Another neighbor who lives across the street told reporters that he began seeing police in unmarked cars watching the home several weeks earlier, and one investigator had interviewed him about a week before the raid. The Tribune reported that the neighbor said that he told the investigator [...] "...the place was like a gas station, people coming and going constantly at night...I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dealing drugs." ...|$|E
