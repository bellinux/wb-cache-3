2500|$|New Bedford was {{featured}} on America's Most Wanted on February 11, 2006, for three unsolved murders: that of Marcus Cruz in 2001, Cecil Lopes III in 2004, and Dana Haywood in 2005, run {{as part of}} a report on the Stop Snitching phenomenon that has hindered police investigations nationwide. [...] "Americas Most Wanted" [...] senior correspondent Tom Morris, who spoke with sources in New Bedford for the piece, said he usually cannot discuss the number or content of calls in response to a particular segment. But he said he'd make an exception in this case. [...] "I was amazed at how minimal the response was. I'm still wondering if we actually aired the show or not," [...] he said. [...] "We expected people to call in and maybe say 'Hey, I was there July 4 when Dana Haywood was killed' ... but we received no useful information." [...] The show received just a handful of calls and one e-mail thanking its producers for running it, the fewest ever for any episode in the show's history, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> said. [...] "I've been doing this for 13 years," [...] he said. [...] "I was really surprised by this." [...] He said the show, which aired Feb. 11, received good ratings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Carrie!" [...] {{they heard}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> call her sister after an interval, {{and her voice}} sounded faint and flat and unusual. There was the soft hissing of some whispered words outside and a muffled exclamation. Then Mrs. Wilder and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> and Betty came into the room. Mrs. Wilder came first, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> with an alarmed face as if {{sheltering}} behind her. [...] "We {{want to tell you}} something," [...] said Amanda.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Briggs: Servant to <b>Mrs</b> <b>Morris</b> {{and money}} man {{for her and}} Mrs Williams, as the three take bets on horses. He {{is found to be}} married to several women, after his {{marriage}} to <b>Mrs</b> <b>Morris,</b> and is taken up for that.|$|R
6000|$|... "She didn’t {{want to come}} at first," [...] said Mrs. Chalk; [...] "she’d half {{promised to}} go to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris.</b> <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> had heard of her through Harris, the grocer, and he only knew {{she was out of}} a place by accident. He—" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{say it was}} {{the coolest}} thing he ever knew. So did <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris.</b> He showed him your letter, Master Harry. Yes, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> say, 'Dam his imperence!'" [...] added Gumbo.|$|E
6000|$|These, with [...] "The Sailing of the Sword," [...] are my own old favourites. There {{was nothing}} like them before, nor will be again, for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris,</b> {{after several years of}} silence, {{abandoned}} his early manner. No doubt it was not a manner to persevere in, but happily, in a mood and a moment never to be re-born or return, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> did fill a fresh page in English poetry with these imperishable fantasies. They were absolutely neglected by [...] "the reading public," [...] but they found a few staunch friends. Indeed, I think of [...] "Guenevere" [...] as FitzGerald did of Tennyson's poems before 1842. But this, of course, is a purely personal, probably a purely capricious, estimate. Criticism may aver that the influence of Mr. Rossetti was strong on <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> before 1858. Perhaps so, but we read <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> first (as the world read the [...] "Lay" [...] before [...] "Christabel"), and my own preference is for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris.</b>|$|E
60|$|This <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> {{had been}} the first cousin of our poor old friend Black Tom Daly.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> led {{her into}} a {{comfortable}} parlour called The Room. Here tea was made ready, and Cytherea sat down, looking, whenever occasion allowed, at <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> with great interest and curiosity, to discover, if possible, something in her which should give {{a clue to the}} secret of her knowledge of herself, and the recommendation based upon it. But nothing was to be learnt, at any rate just then. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> was perpetually getting up, feeling in her pockets, going to cupboards, leaving the room two or three minutes, and trotting back again.|$|R

60|$|The {{door was}} {{suddenly}} opened. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> Barnes {{rushed into the}} room and gazed wildly around.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris,</b> the butcher, was driving past the Port house at rather a rapid rate {{for a man}} with a heavy wagon, Miss Maria {{appeared}} at her door with her bonnet on. She ran out {{into the middle of the}} street, and so stationed herself that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> was obliged to stop. Then, without speaking, she clambered up to the seat beside him.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> and Lord Godalming {{started for}} the door but the Professor's calm voice called them back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only sixpences," [...] echoed <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris,</b> who was Lord March's partner. But <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> {{must have}} been very keenly alive to the value of sixpence, if the loss of a few such coins could make his round face look so dismal. My Lord Chesterfield sate {{opposite}} Mr. Warrington, sorting his cards. No one could say, by inspecting that calm physiognomy, whether good or ill fortune was attending his lordship.|$|E
5000|$|Mrs. Rebecca G. Howard, a {{well-known}} Olympia {{proprietor of the}} Pacific House, and a faithful communicant and liberal supporter of St John's died July 12, 1881. The following story was told about her: [...] Upon one of his visits Bishop Benjamin <b>Morris</b> brought <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> {{and two of his}} sisters-in-law to the service. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> and her sisters took a pew which happened to be the one always occupied by Mrs. Howard. A few minutes later Mrs. Howard came in, dressed in all her finery and found her pew occupied by strangers. She took a place a few pews away and then turned and stared at <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> and her sisters until they, embarrassed, moved into another pew. Mrs. Howard then triumphantly marched into her accustomed place.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Briggs: Servant to <b>Mrs</b> <b>Morris</b> {{and money}} man {{for her and}} Mrs Williams, as the three take bets on horses.|$|R
60|$|A long {{argument}} followed, {{and at last}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> {{said she}} would let her son know {{about it in the}} morning.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed quite}} {{impossible}} and quite uninteresting to imagine anything happening {{after he was}} dead. Yet the thing was so, and when even his great-great-grandson was dead and decayed and forgotten, when the sham half-timbered house had {{gone the way of}} all shams, and the Times was extinct, and the silk hat a ridiculous antiquity, and the modestly imposing stone that had been sacred to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> had been burnt to make lime for mortar, and all that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> had found real and important was sere and dead, the world was still going on, and people were still going about it, just as heedless and impatient of the Future, or, indeed, of anything but their own selves and property, as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> had been.|$|E
60|$|The lecture was {{listened to}} with great {{attention}} {{by a very}} large and distinguished audience, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> was loudly applauded.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> was right; half an {{hour later}} another Indian, {{accompanied}} by Louis Glotte, came into view from over the hill.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Denning {{established}} that the key question to creating liability was whether <b>Mrs</b> <b>Morris</b> could sue the cleaning firm for the theft of their employee: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's true, she would,' mused Owen. 'Then, Cytherea, {{it comes}} to this--you must have been misinformed by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris,</b> {{since there is no}} other alternative.' ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} no answer, and now Barringford was {{thoroughly}} alarmed. He remembered how <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> {{had asked him to}} keep watch over her son.|$|R
6000|$|Cecilia made matters worse--with {{the best}} intentions. [...] "I'm sure, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris,</b> {{my father was}} only too glad to give Emily his advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{calls me}} Noah, {{as a sort}} of fond way of talking,' said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin. 'You understand?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You forget, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris,</b> that I left Miss Ladd's school, in {{a manner}} which {{justified}} doubt of me {{in the minds of}} strangers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are safe}} with mamma, dear," [...] {{answered}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris,</b> hugging her tightly. [...] "We {{have come to}} the fort {{to get away from the}} wicked Indians." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may leave}} them here," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> promptly. [...] "I have talked {{it over with}} Joseph and with James {{and it will be}} quite suitable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{not find}} me a sending my Liz and Nan," [...] cried <b>Mrs</b> <b>Morris,</b> [...] "no, not if her was to offer me a hundred goulden guineas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] Wrayson explained, [...] "is Mr. Sydney Barnes, {{a brother}} of the <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> Barnes, who was, I believe, a client of yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One man does, and {{the next}} don't. You ought to know what that means. It's the most heart-breaking kind of thing in the world. I'd sooner be without foxes altogether, and ride to a drag;--I would indeed." [...] This {{assertion}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> made in a sadly solemn tone, such as men use when they speak of some adversity which fate and fortune may be preparing for them. [...] "I'd a deal rather die than bear it," [...] says the melancholy friend; or,--"I'd much sooner {{put up with a}} crust in a corner." [...] "I'd rather ride to a drag;--I would indeed," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris,</b> with a shake of the head, and a low sigh. As for life without riding to hounds at all, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> did not for a moment suppose that his friend contemplated such an existence.|$|E
60|$|And, {{strange to}} tell, and much as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> {{would have been}} angered if any one had foreshadowed it to him, {{all over the world}} there were {{scattered}} a multitude of people, filled with the breath of life, in whose veins the blood of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Morris</b> flowed. Just as some day the life which is gathered now in the reader of this very story may also be scattered far and wide about this world, and mingled with a thousand alien strains, beyond all thought and tracing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want," [...] the Colonel said calmly, [...] "that packet {{which you}} have just stolen from <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> Barnes, and {{which you have}} in your pocket there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If we {{only had}} Miss Aldclyffe's countenance and {{assistance}} as I used to have them,' Cytherea returned, 'how strong we should be! O, what power is it that he exercises over her, swaying her just as he wishes! She loves me now. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> in her letter said that Miss Aldclyffe prayed for me--yes, she heard her praying for me, and crying. Miss Aldclyffe did not mind an old friend like <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> knowing it, either. Yet in opposition to this, notice her dead silence and inaction throughout this proceeding.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of September 28th, 1879, in an desolate {{farmhouse}} along an isolated country road in Decatur Michigan, <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> retired to bed at about 8:30. The only other individual in {{the house at the}} time was a woman who worked for them by the name of Jennie Bull. [...] At around 9 p.m. <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Morris</b> were inexplicably shot dead within minutes of one another and were left where they fell. Nothing was taken save for a horse, used for the purposes of escape by the assailant.|$|R
