40|$|The California Integrated Remote Sensing System's San Bernardino County Project was {{devised to}} study the {{utilization}} of a data base {{at a number of}} jurisdictional levels. The present paper discusses the implementation of change-detection and masking techniques in the updating of Landsat-derived land-cover maps. A baseline landcover classification was first created from a 1976 image, then the adjusted 1976 image was compared with a 1979 scene by the techniques of (1) <b>multidate</b> <b>image</b> classification, (2) difference image-distribution tails thresholding, (3) difference image classification, and (4) multi-dimensional chi-square analysis of a difference image. The union of the results of methods 1, 3 and 4 was used to create a mask of possible change areas between 1976 and 1979, which served to limit analysis of the update image and reduce comparison errors in unchanged areas. The techniques of spatial smoothing of change-detection products, and of combining results of difference change-detection algorithms are also shown to improve Landsat change-detection accuracies...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{monitoring}} {{requires more}} automated systems to analyse {{the large amount}} of remote sensing data. A new method of change detection is proposed for identifying forest land cover change using high spatial resolution satellite images. Combining the advantages of image segmentation, image differencing and stochastic analysis of the multispectral signal, this OB-Reflectance method is object-based and statistically driven. From a <b>multidate</b> <b>image,</b> a single segmentation using region-merging technique delineates multidate objects characterised by their reflectance differences statistics. Objects considered as outliers from multitemporal point of view are successfully discriminated thanks to a statistical procedure, i. e., the iterative trimining. Based on a chi-square test of hypothesis, abnormal values of reflectance differences statistics are identified and the corresponding objects are labelled as change. The object-based method performances were assessed using two sources of reference data, including one independent forest inventory, and were compared to a pixel-based method using the RGB-NDVI technique. High detection accuracy (> 90 %) and overall Kappa (> 0. 80) were achieved by OB-Reflectance method in temperate forests using three SPOT-HRV images covering a 10 -year period. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Deforestation still {{nowadays}} {{occurs at}} an alarming rate in tropical regions. Forest monitoring is required to delineate the extents of deforested areas based on high resolution satellite images (SPOT). But classical change detection techniques have failed to detect small clearing spread over the landscape as occurring in African forests. Developed initially for temperate forests, the automated object-based change detection method using segmentation and statistical algorithm was extended to tropical regions. This approach consists in three phases: (1) multidate segmentation and object signature computation, (2) forest/non-forest classification and (3) forest change detection. First, the <b>multidate</b> <b>image</b> was partitioned into objects using segmentation and several summary statistics were derived from the within-object reflectance differences. Second, a automated forest/non-forest classification was applied on the first image to define the initial forest mask. Finally, focused on these regions, the forest change detection algorithm detected deforestation thanks to a statistical test using a multivariate iterative trimming procedure. Tested over a protected area located at the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo, this method produced a deforestation map with an overall accuracy of 84 % as assessed by an independent aerial survey. Given its efficiency to detect complex forest changes and its automated character, this method is seen as adequate operational tool for tropical forest monitoring. 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{suitability}} of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network for prediction of corn and soybean yield and for classification of nitrogen corn stressed vegetation. The results show while {{using a combination of}} vegetation and texture indices, and topographic data, we can successfully predict corn yield with MLP. The regression coefficient between observed and predicted yield for corn and soybean were respectively 92 % and 43 % for the middle season image only. This research also indicates that the information from an image is more important when it is acquired during the period of maximum crop biological activity. Thus, MLP developed on the middle season predicts the corn and soybean yield with respective R[superscript 2] of 89 % and 40 %. The degree of relationship between the inputs and the outputs {{and the quality of the}} data are very important, because they determine the capabilities of the MLP. When the generalization capabilities of the MLP models were tested on a non-corrected crop yield dataset, the results drop to 45 % and 36 % for corn and soybean respectively. The MLP demonstrated also its capability to discriminate corn nitrogen status during the growing season. MLP models based on image spectral and textural indices reach a Kappa coefficient of 72 % for middle season image and 81 % for the combined <b>multidate</b> <b>images.</b> Image texture features also provide useful complementary information for the discrimination of different nitrogen stress levels. The best MLP for predicting corn nitrogen status was the one that integrates image features and topographic parameters. It outperforms the first one with an accuracy of 90 % for middle season image and 95 % for all two images. Evidence that topographic data are a critical discriminatory information source is both obvious and strong. In consequence, crop physiological status monitoring systems require taking into account the combined effects of soil background and canopy architecture. This thesis have highlighted that MLP has a strong potential for detecting corn nitrogen stressed vegetation and that they would help farmers to better manage crop status during the growing season, when there is still time to respond to problems. The other contributions of this study are the development of crop yield data correction and filtering algorithm and the identification of discriminant analysis as the best method for the MLP inputs selection" [...] Résumé abrégé par UMI...|$|R

This proposition is formulated in terms of primary quantitative measures, such as area, length, perimeter, and so forth, of the pattern. Fuzzy descriptions of linguistic summaries help to evaluate {{the degree to which}} a summary describes a pattern or object in the database.

40|$|The synthetic-aperture radar-interferometry {{technique}} {{is used to}} detect the migration of the limit of tidal flexing, or hinge line, of the floating ice tongue of Petermann Gletscher, a major outlet glacier of north Greenland. The hinge line is detected automatically from differential interferograms using a model-fitting technique based on an elastic-beam theory. The statistical noise of the model fit is less than 3 mm, and the hinge line is mapped with a precision of 30 m. Following automatic registration of <b>multidate</b> <b>image</b> data to a precision of 5 m, hinge-line migration is subsequently detected with a precision of 40 m in the horizontal plane across the glacier width. The {{results show that the}} hinge line of Petermann Gletscher migrates back and forth with tide by ± 70 m, in excellent agreement with the migration calculated from ocean tides predicted by a tidal model combined with the glacier surface and basal slope measured by an ice-sounding radar. Superimposed on the short-term hinge-line migration due to tide, we detect a hinge-line retreat of 270 m in 3. 87 years which varies across the glacier width by ± 120 m. The retreat suggests glacier thinning at a rate of 78 ± 35 cm ice a - 1. Coincidentally, an analysis of ice-volume fluxes indicates that the hinge-line ice flux of Petermann Gletscher exceeds its balance flux by 0. 88 ± 1 km 3 ice a - 1, which in turn implies glacier thinning at 83 ± 95 cm ice a - 1 in the glacier lower reaches. Both methods therefore suggest that Petermann Gletscher is currently losing mass to the ocean...|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs {{worldwide}} {{are suffering}} from severe and rapid degradation (Bryant et A, 1998; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Quick, consistent, large-scale assessment is required to assess and monitor their status (e. g., USDOC/NOAA NESDIS et al., 1999). On-going systematic collection of high resolution digital satellite data will exhaustively complement the {{relatively small number of}} SPOT, Landsat 4 - 5, and IRS scenes acquired for coral reefs the last 20 years. The workhorse for current image acquisition is the Landsat 7 ETM+ Long Term Acquisition Plan (Gasch et al. 2000). Coral reefs are encountered in tropical areas and cloud contamination in satellite images is frequently a problem (Benner and Curry 1998), despite new automated techniques of cloud cover avoidance (Gasch and Campana 2000). Fusion of multidate acquisitions is a classical solution to solve the cloud problems. Though elegant, this solution is costly since multiple images must be purchased for one location; the cost may be prohibitive for institutions in developing countries. There are other difficulties associated with fusing <b>multidate</b> <b>images</b> as well. For example, water quality or surface state can significantly change through time in coral reef areas making the bathymetric processing of a mosaiced image strenuous. Therefore, another strategy must be selected to detect clouds and improve coral reefs mapping. Other supplemental data could be helpful and cost-effective for distinguishing clouds and generating the best possible reef maps in the shortest amount of time. Photographs taken from the 1960 s to the present from the Space Shuttle and other human-occupied spacecraft are one under-used source of alternative multitemporal data (Lulla et al. 1996). Nearly 400, 000 photographs have been acquired during this period, an estimated 28, 000 of these taken to date are of potential value for reef remote sensing (Robinson et al. 2000 a). The photographic images can be digitized into three bands (red, green and blue) and processed for various applications (e. g., Benner and Curry 1998, Nedeltchev 1999, Glasser and Lulla 2000, Robinson et al. 2000 c, Webb et al, in press) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Simulated {{data were}} used to {{investigate}} the relationships between image properties and change detection accuracy in a systematic manner. The image properties examined were class separability, radiometric normalization and image spectral band-to-band correlation.

40|$|A large {{variety of}} methods and {{techniques}} for analyzing <b>multidate</b> satellite <b>images</b> {{have been developed to}} detect changes in the Earth's surface. Based on the assumption that changes in land use are reflected in changes in radiance, the preclassificatory method was used in this study, conducted on an arid steppe region belonging to the wilaya of Nama, West Algeria. This method consists in highlighting the radiometric changes between two images of Landsat (TM, 1987) and SpotView (XS, 2007) acquired on different dates but within the same annual period. The interpretation of the two maps derived by thresholding P. V. I. (Perpenducular Vegetation Index) clearly shows the degradation of the environment. The "bare soil" and "low cover" spatial entities increased considerably in 2007 (479 and 1774 km 2 respectively) compared to 1987 (258 and 1205 km 2 respectively), while the other two entities "medium cover" and "dense cover" have experienced an opposite scenario {{at the expense of the}} first two. Thus, the evolution of spatial features of the vegetation cover of the study area can be perfectly monitored and the associated mapping informs very precisely about spatial changes that have occurred over tim...|$|R

40|$|Imaging {{spectroscopy}} {{is used in}} {{this work}} as an essential mapping tool to monitor changes in contaminated river sediments. <b>Multidate</b> hyperspectral <b>image</b> data (HyMap) are utilized to identify spatial mineral patterns, to detect temporal changes in mineralogy and to link these changes with geochemical processes and short-term climate characteristics. River sediments contaminated by acid mine drainage are covered by crusts with variably hydrated iron sulphate. The mineralogy of the crusts and the grain size of the underlying fluvial sediments overlap. The spectra used to build up maps from HyMap data are diagnosed mineralogically with archive spectral libraries from pyrite oxidation minerals from well-known sequences of minerals. The maps compiled from hyperspectral imagery display generalized oxidation shown by the coatings over river sediments following warm and dry periods with low water level. After the wet periods, the area covered by oxidized mineralogical phases recedes in favour of hydrated sulphate. The iteration of image processing algorithms and the mineralogical and potential contamination in a geological context are described. Change detection of the mineral crusts on the river sediments by mapping using hyperspectral remote sensing data may thus enable a quantitative and qualitative environmental evaluation by the regulators...|$|R

40|$|Change {{detection}} on rasterized data {{is extremely}} dependent on accurate radiometric and geometric rectification. The development of processing tools able to minimise these requirements has been recognised {{since the late}} eighties. In the present paper we present a methodology for detecting changes on <b>multidate</b> satellite <b>images</b> with different radiometric and geometric characteristics via Multiresolution Wavelet Analysis. An area in south-eastern Brazil was chosen as case study. In the last 20 years the site was characterised by an increase of mining activities and deforestation. Landsat TM and MSS images from July 1981, November 1985 and August 1998 were used. The idea is to decompose a set of images into averages (overall pattern) and details images at different resolutions. Image differences due {{to the effects of}} spatial misregistration, atmospheric condition and sensor characteristics are depicted across scales. No radiometric rectification was applied to the input images and the spatial misregistration ranged from one to three pixels. To detect deforestation and new mining areas we used details at the third and fourth scales. Deforested areas as well as new mining sites were successfully pinpointed without previous radiometric rectification or threshold definition while differences not related to land cover changes were bypassed. Misregistration effects and small area changes are depicted as fine details. Phenological characteristics, atmospheric effects and differences in sensor calibration are represented at coarser scale levels. Hence, using information from intermediate scale levels one can minimise the problems mentioned above...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Irrigation is {{essential}} for profitable agriculture in the western United States. It is the largest consumer of water and power in Oregon. Conflicting uses of water and power and their scarcity demands judicious planning for allocation of these resources. Creditable baseline data are not only needed for irrigated crop acreages, but also for irrigation methods {{as an indicator of}} amount of water and power used. A data-gathering system is needed which is quick, reliable and comparatively inexpensive. The primary objective of this research was to develop a methodology to use remotely sensed data for irrigation method identification. The main tasks were to: (1) analyze <b>multidate</b> <b>images</b> for different emulsions and scales to identify irrigation methods: (2) develop mission parameters; (3) develop an image interpretation key; (4) investigate the feasibility of using a quantitative approach to irrigation method identification. The North Unit Deschutes Irrigation District of central Oregon was selected to develop and test the methodology. Field layout of different irrigation methods, their association with crops, soils, and slopes were noted for the area imaged by three CIR aerial flights during the 1979 growing season. A detailed crop calendar showing different phenological stages that affect the spectral properties of crops was developed. Images used for analysis included: Landsat MSS color transparencies at 1 : 1, 000, 000 for June 4, June 22, July 18, 1979; Landsat MSS color prints at 1 : 250, 000 for May 17, and June 22, 1979; Landsat RBV images at 1 : 125, 000 for June 8, 1978 and July 28, 1979; U- 2 CIR photographs at 1 : 30, 000 for June 28, 1973 and at 1 : 130, 000 for August 2, 1978; CIR aerial photographs for May 12, July 9, and August 5, 1979 at 1 : 30, 000 and 1 : 23, 000. Two methods of analysis were used. Manual interpretation of the images employed light tables, magnifiers and stereomicroscope. Each test field along the flight line was carefully studied for detection of irrigation patterns using associated tones, colors, textures, and their temporal variations, in addition to crop calendar data, soil, and slope maps, ground information gathered, and black and white images at 1 : 8, 000. Digital analysis of the data for discrimination of irrigated and non-irrigated crop types was discouraging as the data were for the late growing season (July 28, 1979), when most crops were either harvested or in the senescing stage and their spectral signatures overlapped. Conclusions drawn from this study are that: image-oriented analysis rather than quantitative analysis is best suited for irrigation method discrimination; CIR images provide better discrimination than black and white images; while irrigated and non-irrigated crops can be discriminated using multidate 1 : 1, 000, 000 images, for satisfactory discrimination of all irrigation methods, 1 : 30, 000 or larger imagery is needed; and the best time for differentiating irrigation methods is the early growing season. As a result of this research, optimum mission parameters for flying photographic missions were developed and an image interpretation key useful for irrigation methods discrimination was developed...|$|R
