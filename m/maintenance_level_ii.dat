40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} single machine {{scheduling}} subject to machine deterioration. The current maintenance {{state of the}} machine is determined by a <b>maintenance</b> <b>level.</b> While jobs are processed this <b>maintenance</b> <b>level</b> drops by a certain, possibly job-dependent, amount. A <b>maintenance</b> <b>level</b> of less than zero {{is associated with the}} machine’s breakdown and is therefore forbidden. Consequently, schedule maintenance activities that raise the <b>maintenance</b> <b>level</b> again may become necessary and have to be scheduled additionally. In what follows, two general types of maintenance activities are distinguished. In the full maintenance case, maintenance activities are always executed until the machine has reached the maximum <b>maintenance</b> <b>level.</b> In contrast to this, the partial maintenance case allows maintenance activities of individual duration. By combining both cases with regular objective functions such as minimization of maximum tardiness, minimization of the sum of completion times, or minimization of the number of tardy jobs, we obtain a new family of specific single-stage scheduling problems. Besides motivating and introducing these problems, the present paper analyzes the computational complexity of general and specific cases...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the single machine scheduling problem with job-dependent machine deterioration. In the problem, {{we are given}} a single machine with an initial non-negative <b>maintenance</b> <b>level,</b> {{and a set of}} jobs each with a non-preemptive processing time and a machine deterioration. Such a machine deterioration quantifies the decrement in the machine <b>maintenance</b> <b>level</b> after processing the job. To avoid machine breakdown, one should guarantee a non-negative <b>maintenance</b> <b>level</b> at any time point; and whenever necessary, a maintenance activity must be allocated for restoring the machine <b>maintenance</b> <b>level.</b> The goal of the problem is to schedule the jobs and the maintenance activities such that the total completion time of jobs is minimized. There are two variants of maintenance activities: in the partial maintenance case each activity can be allocated to increase the machine <b>maintenance</b> <b>level</b> to any level not exceeding the maximum; in the full maintenance case every activity must be allocated to increase the machine <b>maintenance</b> <b>level</b> to the maximum. In a recent work, the problem in the full maintenance case has been proven NP-hard; several special cases of the problem in the partial maintenance case were shown solvable in polynomial time, but the complexity of the general problem is left open. In this paper we first prove that the problem in the partial maintenance case is NP-hard, thus settling the open problem; we then design a 2 -approximation algorithm...|$|R
