5|$|<b>Meerkat</b> Manor's {{innovative}} {{new methods}} of filming allowed the Kalahari Project scientists a chance to uncover aspects of <b>meerkat</b> life never before seen, including life within the burrows. The film crew {{was also the first}} to capture <b>meerkat</b> infanticide on film.|$|E
5|$|Oxford Scientific Films {{produced}} {{a feature film}} for Discovery Films {{that acts as a}} prequel to the <b>Meerkat</b> Manor series. Originally announced as Flower: Queen of the Kalahari, <b>Meerkat</b> Manor: The Story Begins was directed by Chris Barker and Mike Slee and narrated by Whoopi Goldberg. The film documents Flower's early life as she grows from a young <b>meerkat</b> {{to become one of the}} most successful leaders of the Whiskers clan. The film was introduced at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in the Spotlight section, and then aired in the United States on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008 as a lead-in to a thirty-minute Making of <b>Meerkat</b> Manor: the Story Begins special. It was released to Region 1 DVD in North America on 3 June 2008, with the Making of <b>Meerkat</b> Manor special, and another special, The Science of <b>Meerkat</b> Manor, included as extras.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the show}} faced {{criticism}} from viewers for not intervening when a <b>meerkat</b> was injured and faced death, as a whole, <b>Meerkat</b> Manor enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet's top series in October 2007, {{both on the}} cable channel and through its video-on-demand service. The show's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and allowed viewers a long term, intimate look {{into the lives of}} its <b>meerkat</b> stars, breaking the traditional wall between viewer and subject found with most documentaries. In 2007, <b>Meerkat</b> Manor was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards. It has won three awards at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Galas. The first three series of the programme have been released to DVD in both Region 1 and Region 2. In 2007, a book entitled <b>Meerkat</b> Manor – The Story of Flower of the Kalahari was released in the UK, detailing the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the series' filming began. A television film, , documenting Flower's birth and rise to matriarch of the Whiskers aired on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008.|$|E

Ground level windows also enable young children better views of the <b>meerkats.</b>|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the viewer}} {{backlash}} Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the <b>Meerkat</b> Manor series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young <b>meerkat</b> who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other <b>meerkat</b> deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to hold the camera steady, giving the visual impression of a truck bearing down on a <b>meerkat.</b> To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E
5|$|<b>Meerkat</b> Manor {{was created}} by Caroline Hawkins, {{executive}} producer and series editor at Oxford Scientific Films, and commissioned for Animal Planet International by executive producer and commissioning editor Mark Wild. Filming for a 13-episode series took seven to eight months, and {{was limited to the}} Kalahari spring and summer seasons, as meerkats are less active during winter. Series three was filmed from November 2006 through April 2007, and Series four began filming in October 2007. Most scenes were filmed on location at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the Kalahari <b>Meerkat</b> Project that the meerkats are a part of is based. However, the meerkats seen in commercials and on the show's website were not the same animals portrayed in <b>Meerkat</b> Manor. Instead, tamer-rescued meerkats from the Fellow Earthlings' Wildlife Center were filmed against a green screen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Meerkat</b> Manor {{has been}} well {{received}} by viewers and critics alike. In October 2007, it was Animal Planet's top series, with an audience of more than four million in the United States alone. In the United States, its first episode was viewed by one million viewers, and {{the second and third}} series premieres were watched by approximately 800,000 viewers each. The fourth series premiere did not fare as well, with fewer than 500,000 viewers. The viewership of the on-demand video offerings for <b>Meerkat</b> Manor grew 20% in September 2007, when Discovery offered each third series episode, video capsules of series one and two, top ten moments from the show, and a memorial sequence for Flower. Building on the success of <b>Meerkat</b> Manor's unique format, Animal Planet commissioned two similarly formatted programmes: Orangutan Island, which focuses on a group of orphaned orangutans at the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Center, and Lemur Street, which looks at the lives of two rival gangs of ring-tailed lemurs in Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|The {{episodes of}} the British {{documentary}} <b>Meerkat</b> Manor first premiered on Animal Planet International in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2005. The programme was originally created by Caroline Hawkins, executive producer and series editor at Oxford Scientific Films, and commissioned for Animal Planet International by executive producer and commissioning editor Mark Wild. The original episodes are narrated by Bill Nighy. The Australian and American channels redubbed the episodes {{using their own}} narrators. the Australian episodes are narrated by Mike Goldman. In the US, episodes {{for the first three}} series were narrated by Sean Astin. For the fourth series, Astin was replaced with Stockard Channing. <b>Meerkat</b> Manor is also broadcast in more than 160 countries.|$|E
5|$|While the {{majority}} of the meerkats filmed were partially habituated, the cinematographers had to move carefully to avoid scaring the animals. The crew used radios to keep in contact with one another as they followed the <b>meerkat</b> groups around. Although the park normally prohibits low-flying aircraft, the production crew was given permission to film for three days using a low-flying helicopter. Mounted to its front underside was a new type of camera that was not affected by the shaking of the helicopter. Full-color scenes depicting the birth of <b>meerkat</b> pups were obtained by filming captive meerkats at the Cotswold Wildlife Park in the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Pathological lesions {{associated}} with Mycobacterium bovis infection (bovine tuberculosis; bTB) in free-living <b>meerkats</b> (Suricata suricatta) in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa are described. The pathology of bTB in <b>meerkats</b> was determined through detailed post-mortem examinations of 57 animals (52 <b>meerkats</b> showing clinical signs of bTB, and five not {{showing signs of}} disease). Lymph nodes and tissue lesions thought to be {{associated with}} bTB were cultured for mycobacteria. All 52 bTB-infected <b>meerkats</b> showed gross or microscopical granulomatous lesions, but M. bovis was cultured from only 42 % (22 / 52) of these animals. The majority (96 %, 50 / 52) of diseased <b>meerkats</b> had lesions in multiple sites, the pattern of which suggested haematogenous spread of M. bovis infection in this species. The histological characteristics of the tuberculous lesions, together with the gross pathology and the wide range of body systems affected, indicate that infection in <b>meerkats</b> is acquired principally via the respiratory and oral routes, whereas excretion is most likely via the respiratory tract and suppurating skin wounds. Urine and faeces appear to be unlikely sources of infection. The findings of this study provide information on the transmission, pathogenesis and epidemiology of bTB in <b>meerkats</b> that is likely to be relevant to the understanding of M. bovis infection in other social mammal species such as the European badger (Meles meles) ...|$|R
40|$|We used {{observations}} and manipulation experiments to investigate how <b>meerkats,</b> social mongooses living under high predation pressure, find shelter from predators quickly within their territory. We played back alarm calls to foraging <b>meerkats</b> and dug new boltholes and covered existing ones {{to see whether}} location or other cues were used. <b>Meerkats</b> almost always ran to the bolthole closest to them. This was not done by a simple rule of running back to a bolthole they had just passed, nor by escaping in any direction and finding a bolthole by chance. <b>Meerkats</b> nearly always ignored the boltholes that we dug but ran to those we had covered up. Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} <b>meerkats</b> know in which direction to run when an alarm call is given, without scanning the area for visual or olfactory cues of shelters. As <b>meerkats</b> have more than 1000 boltholes in their territory, our results suggest that they have detailed knowledge of the direction and the distance of specific locations. However, this {{does not necessarily mean that}} they have a spatial map of their territory; our results may be explained by place recognition or reorientation of specific landmark features...|$|R

5|$|The <b>meerkat</b> Flower is {{born in the}} Kalahari Desert on March 15, 2000, to Holly, {{the leader}} of a <b>meerkat</b> group called the Whiskers. After an attack by a rival group, the Lazuli, the Whiskers are forced to {{surrender}} their territory and move to a new home. A hawk kills Holly when Flower is a year old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses Youssarian, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower mates with Yossarian's brother, Zaphod, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As she crosses, she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers attempt to adjust to the loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to drive it off. In doing so, she becomes the new leader of the group. Zaphod returns to the group to be her mate, while Yossarian steps aside and leaves the group. Flower leads the Whiskers back to their original home, and after a brief battle, the Whiskers reclaim it from the Lazuli. At end of the film, an on-screen note describes Flower's death during the third season of <b>Meerkat</b> Manor and the children she left behind.|$|E
5|$|The Lazuli Mob {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} groups of meerkats that inhabit an area of the Kalahari <b>Meerkat</b> Project. The Lazuli are also among the oldest groups, and they are currently the oldest living group. It was formed in 1995 by Avatar females Lazuli, Ziziphus and a wild male Belgarion. The Lazuli were also featured on the documentary of <b>Meerkat</b> Manor. The Lazuli grew very large over the years and many of its members are well known. Lazuli was the first dominant female and the group was named after her. Ziziphus was the second dominant of the Lazuli until her death, then her daughter Cazanna became the long term dominant female. She was joined by a Vivian male named Basil who led dominance for four years. Followed by her daughter Aretha, and then her granddaughter Young. The Lazuli have many ancestors in other groups since some of the members had dispersed to other groups or formed new mobs. The Lazuli are currently one of the most famous groups.|$|E
40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the role of}} specific social interactions in the transmission of Mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis; bTB) in a free-living population of wild <b>meerkats</b> (Suricata suricatta) in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. During a prospective cohort study lasting {{two and a half}} years, I use detailed pathologic investigations, repeated live sampling of individuals and social network analysis (SNA) of observed inter- and intergroup social interactions, to elucidate the epidemiology of bTB in a habituated population of 300 <b>meerkats</b> living in 14 social groups. I show that bTB in <b>meerkats</b> is a disseminated disease which spreads to multiple organs via haematogenous and lymphatic routes. The results suggest that <b>meerkats</b> acquire M. bovis infection principally via the respiratory and oral routes, and excrete it mainly from the respiratory tract and suppurating skin wounds. I find that intergroup transmission appears to occur via roving males that are infected whilst visiting other groups and subsequently return to their original groups, and not via aggressive intergroup encounters involving entire groups. I develop an individual-based dynamic network model to elucidate the relative importance of grooming and aggression in the transmission of M. bovis between <b>meerkats.</b> I found grooming to be more important than aggression in transmitting M. bovis between <b>meerkats</b> within a social group, with groomers at higher risk of infection then groomees. The short lifespan of most <b>meerkats</b> relative to the latent period of M. bovis in this species mean that few individuals reach the infectious stage. This {{is likely to be a}} limiting factor in the spread of bTB in populations of free-ranging wild <b>meerkats.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5|$|The 75-minute film premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival {{before its}} {{television}} premiere on Animal Planet on May 25, 2008. While it was praised for its cinematography, {{for maintaining the}} depth of coverage of the television series, and for its accessibility to newcomers to the series, it was criticized for not offering anything new to fans. The Kalahari <b>Meerkat</b> Project noted that the film was not completely accurate but praised it overall and recommended against analyzing it. Several reviewers praised Goldberg's narration, but the script was criticized as being too simplistic for adult viewers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Meerkats</b> are {{primarily}} insectivores, but also eat other animals (lizards, snakes, scorpions, spiders, eggs, small mammals, millipedes, centipedes and, more rarely, small birds), plants and fungi (the desert truffle Kalaharituber pfeilii). <b>Meerkats</b> are immune to {{certain types of}} venom, including the very strong venom of the scorpions of the Kalahari Desert.|$|R
5|$|The {{show was}} {{primarily}} filmed using Sony DSR-570 cameras, although special equipment {{was needed for}} some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' burrows, mini fibre-optic infra-red cameras were employed; wide-angle shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote-controlled camera platform. An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many <b>meerkat</b> vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. Eye-level shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods.|$|E
5|$|While many documentaries {{maintain}} an emotional distance from their subjects, <b>Meerkat</b> Manor – {{due to its}} extended length, soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and disturbing to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre {{and the nature of}} reality TV.|$|E
5|$|The Whiskers are a {{successful}} group of meerkats that own a two-square-mile {{area in the}} Kuruman River Reserve. The group came into existence in 1998, with four Young Ones females and two Lazuli rovers - reinforced with a wild <b>meerkat</b> who had been released nearby (instead of the potjie) from Van Zylsrus. Holly and Argon took dominance till 2000. After Holly died Risca took dominance with Beetle. She evicted some females who formed the Asphodel and Hobgoblin groups. Eleven Vivian rovers emigrated into Whiskers in 2001. Izit won dominance over Basil, despite Basil being older. Basil left to join to Lazuli. Risca and Izit lost dominance and left to form the Gattaca. Vialli and Zaphod became the next dominant pair. After Vialli died, Flower won dominance in 2002. Yossarian overthrew Zaphod taking male dominance but Zaphod overthrew him sometime after. Flower and Zaphod reign then on. The group split Yossarian and Super Furry Animal taking dominance in the splinter till Baddiel overthrew her sister. The Whiskers reunited and Flower and Zaphod took back dominance. Flower evicted Kinkaju and Mozart with two other females who formed the Starsky. Flower succumbed to a snake bite in January 2007. Her daughter Rocket Dog rose to power after her. The Whiskers split in two and formed the Aztecs. After Rocket Dog died in 2008 and Ella established dominance. Five Whiskers males emigrated into the Lazuli kicking out Thundercat who soon joined the Whiskers. The group recently recovered after a low in numbers. Many Whiskers formed or joined other groups. Some males have joined the Whiskers rivals the Lazuli and Commandos. While many groups were formed by Whiskers members such as the two largest group in the KMP today, the Baobab and Kung Fu. With every move recorded on camera by Cambridge University, the Whiskers became famous as {{the stars of the}} hit television series, <b>Meerkat</b> Manor (2005).|$|E
