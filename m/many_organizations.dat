5|$|The Swedish Language Council (Språkrådet) is the {{official}} regulator of Swedish in Sweden but does not attempt to enforce control of the language, as for instance the Académie française does for French. However, <b>many</b> <b>organizations</b> and agencies {{require the use of}} the council's publication Svenska skrivregler in official contexts, with it otherwise being regarded as a de facto orthographic standard. Among the <b>many</b> <b>organizations</b> that make up the Swedish Language Council, the Swedish Academy (established 1786) is arguably the most influential. Its primary instruments are the glossary Svenska Akademiens ordlista (SAOL, currently in its 14th edition) and the dictionary Svenska Akademiens Ordbok, in addition to various books on grammar, spelling and manuals of style. Even though the dictionaries are sometimes used as official decrees of the language, their main purpose is to describe current usage.|$|E

5|$|The Cold War {{split the}} {{temporary}} wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two superpowers with profound {{economic and political}} differences. The USSR was a Marxist–Leninist state led by its Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which in turn was dominated by a leader with different titles over time, and a small committee called the Politburo. The Party controlled the press, the military, the economy and <b>many</b> <b>organizations.</b> It also controlled the other states in the Eastern Bloc, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist China, particularly following the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. In opposition stood the capitalist West, led by the United States, a federal republic with a two-party presidential system. The First World nations of the Western Bloc were generally democratic with a free press and independent organizations, but were economically and politically entwined with a network of banana republics and other authoritarian regimes throughout the Third World, {{most of which were}} the Western Bloc's former colonies.

5|$|The Morgan {{horse is}} one of the {{earliest}} horse breeds developed in the United States. Tracing back to the foundation sire Figure, later named Justin Morgan after his best-known owner, Morgans served many roles in 19th-century American history, being used as coach horses and for harness racing, as general riding animals, and as cavalry horses during the American Civil War {{on both sides of the}} conflict. Morgans have influenced other major American breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, Tennessee Walking Horse and the Standardbred. During the 19th and 20th centuries, they were exported to other countries, including England, where a Morgan stallion influenced the breeding of the Hackney horse. In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm near Middlebury, Vermont for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed; the farm was later transferred to the University of Vermont. The first breed registry was established in 1909, and since then <b>many</b> <b>organizations</b> in the US, Europe and Oceania have developed. There were estimated to be over 175,000 Morgan horses worldwide in 2005.|$|E
