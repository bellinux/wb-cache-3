Insulin resistance, which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin, occurs primarily within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue.

In this paper we show that this can be prevented by using extra alignment markers to check the alignment during patterning, rather than inspecting vernier patterns after the exposure is completed. Accurate vernier patterns can often only be read after pattern transfer has been carried out. We also show that by using a Penrose tile as a marker it is possible to locate the marker to about 1 nm without fully exposing the resist. This means that the marker can be reused with full accuracy, thus improving the layer to layer alignment accuracy. Lithography tool noise limits the process...|$|E

40|$|Wind {{pressure}} {{is one of}} the major external influences that affect the reliability and durability of buildings and structures. Calculation of the wind load is very important in the design of tanks for storage of environmentally hazardous substances. In the case of a <b>minor</b> <b>defect</b> is not always possible to replace damaged element, so it is advisable to provide the safe operation of tanks, potentially containing some initial defects. One of the least studied problems is the combination of two or more defects in the area of destruction origin. Analysis of causes of tanks failure showed that in most cases it happens due to the stress concentration in the area of the defect or crack at low ambient temperature. That is why the way to reduce the wind load on the tank was proposed. Seventy five geometric models were built to test their effectiveness. A comparison of satellite images and diagrams of the Vernadsky station for proper placement of the wind deflector was done. ???????? ???????? ???????? ????? ?? ???????? ??????? ???????????, ??????? ?????? ?? ?????????? ? ????????????? ?????? ? ??????????. ?????? ?? ???????? ???????? ????? ????? ??? ?????????????? ??????????? ??? ???????? ????????????-??????? ???????. ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ?? ????? ???????, ??? ? ??????????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ??-?? ???????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ??????? ??? ??????? ??? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ?????. ?????????? ???????? ??? ????????? ???????? ???????? ?? ?????????. ??? ???????? ????????????? ????????? ????????? ???? ?????????????? ???????. ????????? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ? ???? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????...|$|E
40|$|CD 44 is {{a closely}} related family of transmembrane glycoproteins, {{which have been}} implicated {{in a number of}} {{physiological}} and pathological phenomena such as embryonic development, hemopoiesis, immune response, tumor growth and metastasis formation. However, mice with a gene-targeted disruption of all CD 44 isoforms do not display any overt embryological or immune abnormalities, having only a <b>minor</b> <b>defect</b> in the hemopoietic system (Schmits et al., 1997). It was therefore concluded that the CD 44 -deficient mice utilize compensatory mechanisms in order to overcome the need for CD 44. The goal of the work in this thesis was to investigate the changes in CD 44 -mutant mice which compensate for the lack of CD 44. The search was based on the ligand binding properties of CD 44 which may define the potential CD 44 -substitutive molecule or molecules. (orig.)
