50|$|The overall {{function}} {{of an image}} intensifier is to convert incident x-ray photons to light photons of sufficient intensity to provide a viewable image. This occurs in several stages. The first is conversion of x-ray photons to light photons by the input phosphor. CsI:Na is typically used due to its high conversion efficiency thanks to high atomic number and <b>mass</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The light photons are then converted to electrons by a photocathode. A potential difference (25-35 kilovolts) created between the anode and photocathode then accelerates these photoelectrons while electron lenses focus the beam down {{to the size of}} the output window. The output window is typically made of silver-activated zinc-cadmium sulfide and converts incident electrons back to visible light photons. At the input and output phosphors the number of photons is multiplied by several thousands, so that overall there is a large brightness gain. This gain makes image intensifiers highly sensitive to x-rays such that relatively low doses can be used for fluoroscopic procedures.|$|E
