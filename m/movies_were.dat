5|$|In either usage, most B movies {{represent}} a particular genre—the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget science-fiction and horror films became more {{popular in the}} 1950s. Early B <b>movies</b> <b>were</b> often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character. Almost always shorter than the top-billed films they were paired with, many had running times of 70 minutes or less. The term connoted a general perception that B <b>movies</b> <b>were</b> inferior to the more handsomely budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, over 100 western <b>movies</b> <b>were</b> {{filmed in}} nearby Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon. The Hotel Monte Vista in Flagstaff hosted many film stars during this era, {{including}} Jane Russell, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne, and Bing Crosby.

50|$|Distinct {{from the}} centers are the {{locations}} where <b>movies</b> <b>are</b> filmed. Because {{of labor and}} infrastructure costs, many films are produced in countries {{other than the one}} in which the company which pays for the film is located. For example, many U.S. <b>movies</b> <b>are</b> filmed in Canada, many Nigerian <b>movies</b> <b>are</b> filmed in Ghana, while many Indian <b>movies</b> <b>are</b> filmed in the Americas, Europe, Singapore etc.|$|R

5|$|The {{economic}} {{policies of the}} New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not. In particular, <b>movies</b> <b>were</b> subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was Life magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.|$|E
5|$|The films' {{subject matter}} were often as {{disturbing}} as {{the manner in}} which they were played; with images of accidents, nuclear explosions, meat processing, spiders and scorpions stalking prey, gory drivers education films, and penis reconstruction surgery. Not all of the <b>movies</b> <b>were</b> horrific, and they often included nature, wildlife, and aquatic footage; as well as a color negative of a Charlie's Angels episode.|$|E
5|$|The popular movie Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, {{released}} in 1957, starring Burt Lancaster as Earp, cemented {{his place in}} Western history as a hero lawman. The movie also altered the public's perception of cowboys, who in Earp's time and locale were outlaws, but in the <b>movies</b> <b>were</b> reinvented as good guys, assisting the lawmen in their fight against the outlaws.|$|E
5000|$|As the <b>movie</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in 2008, {{the music of}} the <b>movie</b> <b>was</b> released on 13 June 2008. Soon before the release of movie in 2012, the most anticipated track of the <b>movie</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Tu Mujhe Soch Kabhi" [...] by KK.|$|R

5|$|After {{starring}} as {{a political}} cartoonist {{who falls in love}} in the 1990 film Funny About Love, Wilder performed in one final movie with Pryor, the 1991 feature Another You, in which Pryor's physical deterioration from multiple sclerosis was clearly noticeable. It was Pryor's last starring role in a film (he appeared in a few cameos before he died in 2005) and also marked Wilder's last appearance in a feature film. His last two <b>movies</b> <b>were</b> not financially successful. Wilder's remaining work consisted of television movies and guest appearances in TV shows.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{ahead to}} the movies of February 2014, Chris Kirk and Kim Thompson at Slate argued that February's <b>movies</b> <b>were</b> {{statistically}} the worst of any month. Their evidence was the average RT ratings for all movies for each month between 2000 and 2013. February's averaged 45%, three points lower than January and September and four below August. February also had the worst month in the entire sample period, with the 2001 releases from that month coming in at 31%; 2010 and 2012 tied for the best February at 54%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Movies</b> <b>were</b> {{popular in}} Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over {{a billion people}} in 1942, 1943 and 1944. By 1934, German {{regulations}} restricting currency exports {{made it impossible for}} American film makers to take their profits back to America, so the major film studios closed their German branches. Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies, Universum Film AG and Tobis, were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content. Scripts were pre-censored.|$|E
50|$|The <b>movie</b> <b>was</b> made in East Pakistan, {{what is now}} Bangladesh. The {{director}} of the <b>movie</b> <b>is</b> Dilip Shom and main casts are Kabori and Khan Ataur Rehman.

5|$|The first Japanese DVD {{release was}} spread across seven volumes; all {{contained}} four episodes with the seventh volume containing both {{the original and}} alternate versions of episodes 25 and 26. This version was identical to the previous laserdisc and VHS release. The <b>Movies</b> <b>were</b> also released as a special set, just like before. In 2000 and 2001, three box sets were released to commemorate the fictional Second Impact which occurred in the year 2000 in the series. The Second Impact Box contained the 26 original episodes and both movies on 9 DVDs - three per Box. The versions were the original broadcast and theatrical versions respectively and therefore different from the previous DVD release. In addition, the video game Girlfriend of Steel {{was included in the}} third box set.|$|E
5|$|Yet most American movie theaters, {{especially}} {{outside of}} urban areas, were still not equipped for sound: {{while the number}} of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929, they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters, which had actually grown in number as well, from 22,204 to 22,544. The studios, in parallel, were still not entirely convinced of the talkies' universal appeal—through mid-1930, the majority of Hollywood <b>movies</b> <b>were</b> produced in dual versions, silent as well as talking. Though few in the industry predicted it, silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory. Points West, a Hoot Gibson Western released by Universal Pictures in August 1929, was the last purely silent mainstream feature put out by a major Hollywood studio.|$|E
