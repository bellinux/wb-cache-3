5|$|Four super {{radiations}} {{of insects}} have occurred: beetles (evolved about 300 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago),</b> flies (evolved about 250 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago),</b> and moths and wasps (evolved about 150 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago).</b> These four groups {{account for the}} majority of described species. The flies and moths along with the fleas evolved from the Mecoptera.|$|E
5|$|The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz {{occurred}} about 1.8 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> at {{the beginning}} of the Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{vampire bat}} lineage diverged from its family 26 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The hairy-legged vampire bat likely diverged {{from the other}} two species of vampire bats 21.7 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{reptiles}} of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic period. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> the {{conifers}} flourished {{and became}} adapted {{to live in}} all the major terrestrial habitats. Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period. These began to dominate the conifers during the Tertiary era (66 to 2 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> when forests covered the globe. When the climate cooled 1.5 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and {{the first of four}} ice ages occurred, the forests retreated as the ice advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next ice age.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> While {{it is difficult to}} determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E

5|$|It {{was mostly}} undisputed that pre-human australopithecines {{did not have}} {{communication}} systems significantly different from those found in great apes in general. However, a 2017 study on Ardipithecus ramidus challenges this belief. Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since {{the appearance of the}} genus Homo some 2.5 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago),</b> and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The Penokean Mountain Range {{formed in}} the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> when an oceanic island arc called the Pembine–Wausau terrane {{collided}} with the southern margin of the Superior craton. From 1880 to 1850 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> the region was volcanically active. This volcanism ceased 1850 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> when a fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone. Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior craton in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening. Rocks of the Pembine–Wassau terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior craton, forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior, crossed parts of three US states (south-central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario, Canada. Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards, forming a foreland basin at around 1850 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> {{in the south and}} 1835 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> in the north. The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin. In the southern basin, crustal thickening caused high-grade metamorphism of the sedimentary fill by 1830 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> A series of post-orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 million years ago,; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{development of}} V.salvadorii {{started with the}} genus Varanus, which originated in Asia about 40 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and migrated to Australia.

5|$|The {{first true}} dipterans known {{are from the}} Middle Triassic (around 240 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago),</b> and they became {{widespread}} during the Middle and Late Triassic. Modern flowering plants did not appear until the Cretaceous (around 140 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago),</b> so the original dipterans {{must have had a}} different source of nutrition other than nectar. Based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets, {{it has been suggested that}} they may have fed on honeydew produced by sap-sucking bugs which were abundant at the time, and dipteran mouthparts are well-adapted to softening and lapping up the crusted residues. The basal clades in the Diptera include the Deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic Nymphomyiidae. Three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record. Many new species of lower Diptera developed in the Triassic, about 220 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Many lower Brachycera appeared in the Jurassic, some 180 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> A third radiation took place among the Schizophora at the start of the Paleogene, 66 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene.

5|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in the upper Oldman Formation and lower Dinosaur Park Formation of Canada.

In the Oldman Formation C. casuarius, the only species of Corythosaurus from the deposits, lived about 77 to 76.5 mya. The holotype {{specimen}} was clearly a carcass that had floated up on a beach, as Unio shells, water-worn bones, and a baenid turtle were preserved all around. Corythosaurus probably lived in a woodland forest, and might have occasionally wandered into swampy areas.|$|E
