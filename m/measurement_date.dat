50|$|The use of {{magnetic}} fields in flow <b>measurement</b> <b>date</b> back to 19th century, when in 1832 Michael Faraday attempted {{to determine the}} velocity of the River Thames. Faraday applied a method in which a flow (the river flow) is exposed to a magnetic field (earth magnetic field) and the induced voltage is measured using two electrodes across the same flow. This method {{is the basis of}} the {{one of the most successful}} commercial applications in flow metering known as the inductive flowmeter. The theory of such devices has been developed and comprehensively summarized by Prof. J. A. Shercliff in early 1950s. While inductive flowmeters are widely used for flow measurement in fluids at room temperatures such as beverages, chemicals and waste water, they are not suited for flow measurement of media such as hot, aggressive or for local measurements where surrounding obstacles limit access to the channel or pipe. Since they require electrodes to be inserted into the fluid, their use is limited to applications at temperatures far below the melting points of practically relevant metals.|$|E

As the interpolation proceeded farther from the primary observation points, the co-kriging gradually used the cross-covariation between the primary and the secondary datasets to improve the predictions (Desbarats et al. 2002). Because the subsets contained observations from various locations, the key role of the auxiliary data in the method {{used in this study}} was to provide a fixed reference in the areas with fewer observations and thus guarantee a minimum coherence between the compared interpolation maps of the complementary subsets.|$|R

50|$|In accounting, {{fair value}} {{is used as}} a {{certainty}} of the market value of an asset (or liability) for which a market price cannot be determined (usually because there is no established market for the asset). Under US GAAP (FAS 157), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the <b>measurement</b> <b>date.</b> This is used for assets whose carrying value is based on mark-to-market valuations; for assets carried at historical cost, the fair value of the asset is not used. One example of where fair value is an issue is a college kitchen with a cost of $2 million which was built five years ago. If the owners wanted to put a fair value measurement on the kitchen it would be a subjective estimate because there is no active market for such items or items similar to this one. In another example, if ABC Corporation purchased a two-acre tract of land in 1980 for $1 million, then a historical-cost financial statement would still record the land at $1 million on ABC’s balance sheet. If XYZ purchased a similar two-acre tract of land in 2005 for $2 million, then XYZ would report an asset of $2 million on its balance sheet. Even if the two pieces of land were virtually identical, ABC would report an asset with one-half the value of XYZ’s land; historical cost is unable to identify that the two items are similar. This problem is compounded when numerous assets and liabilities are reported at historical cost, leading to a balance sheet that may be greatly undervalued. If, however, ABC and XYZ reported financial information using fair-value accounting, then both would report an asset of $2 million. The fair-value balance sheet provides information for investors who are interested in the current value of assets and liabilities, not the historical cost.|$|E

One method of limiting water loss in plant production {{involves the use of}} antitranspirants, which reduce plant transpiration. One of substances used for this purpose is, amongst others, natural terpene polymer - di- 1 -p-menthene (pinolene). Research on the influence of a pinolene-containing antitranspirant (with the commercial name of Vapor Gard) on gas exchange parameters (intensity of net CO 2 assimilation, intensity of transpiration, stomatal conductance for water, substomatal CO 2 concentration), the water balance and the content of assimilation pigments (chlorophyll “a”, “b”, total chlorophyll, carotenoids) in the leaves of the cv. ‘Salsa’ strawberry was conducted in the years 2009 – 2010. The antitranspirant was used once at a concentration of 0. 75 % before flowering.

While not tested, predictions for Douglas-fir should be similarly robust, provided that the 500 Index growth model (the growth model developed specifically for Douglas-fir) is used.
