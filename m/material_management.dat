500|$|The International Aerial Robotics Competition {{was first}} {{held on the}} campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (first mission, 1991–1995). Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center asked that the {{competition}} move to its location for the second mission, where it was held at the entrance to the park during 1996 and 1997. The U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous <b>Material</b> <b>Management</b> and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility then brought the IARC to Richland WA from 1998 to 2000 for the conduct of the third mission. The fourth mission began in 2001 at the U.S. Navy's Webster Field in Maryland, but was moved to the Canada Olympic Village (Calgary, Canada) the following year because Webster Field was unsuitable. Weather, difficulty in airspace management, and extreme electromagnetic interference drove the IARC to an ideal venue where these issues could be managed: the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab, McKenna MOUT site. For the fourth mission scenarios, the existence of the uninhabited McKenna village provides the perfect venue. [...] Due to the nature of the challenge, the fifth mission took place in an indoor location at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. [...] The sixth mission was initiated in the coliseum {{on the campus of}} the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez during August 2010, however the sixth mission was moved to Grand Forks, North Dakota beginning in 2011.

40|$|<b>Materials</b> <b>management</b> is made {{problematic}} by materials shortages, {{delays in}} supply, price fluctuations, damage and wastage, {{and lack of}} storage space. An essential factor adversely affecting the performance of construction projects is the improper handling of materials during site activities. In addition, paper-based reports are mostly used to record and exchange information related to the materials component within a supply chain which is problematic, error-prone, and inefficient. Generally, modern technologies are not being adequately used to overcome human error and are not well integrated with project management systems to make the tracking and <b>management</b> of <b>materials</b> easier and faster. Thus, {{the aim of this}} book is focussing on the implementation of technologies in improving <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> practiceses especially tracking of materials in construction projects. This book will assist readers to understand <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> processes and technologies in construction projects. It explained what is meant by <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> and discussed the <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> on construction projects. Also discussed were the processes and problems of <b>materials</b> <b>management.</b> The implementation of current technologies and potential to implement RFID in <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> practices were also discussed. It clearly identified that these are important for effectively managing <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> in the construction project in order to provide better handling of construction materials to provide an overall performance of construction projects in term of time, budget (cost) and quality. The application of ICT to support current practices of <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> in the construction site is considered improving for effective managing construction materials on site.

Despite the potential benefit of ICT, convincing construction organisations to embrace its use and implementation has proved a difficult task. This study seeks to identify the implementation of ICT for <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> processes in construction projects. The findings from the interviews reveal that the implementation of ICT in the <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> processes for construction projects in Malaysia is at early stage. Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet and handheld devices are found to be the common ICT tools adopted in the <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> processes. The main barrier is found to be the cost involvement at the initial stage or overall implementation of ICT in the <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> processes.

40|$|Supply Chain Management (SCM) {{presents}} the {{new paradigm in}} strategic and operational business management for the 21 st century. By offering a cooperative and integrated model of the value-creation process in a cross-organizational perspective, it also places new challenges on business management methods and instruments used, in theory as in practice. In the field of <b>materials</b> <b>management,</b> the new SCM perspective led to {{major changes in the}} methods used and in the emphasis of the different process steps. This master thesis presents classical as well as supply-chain-based <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> methods, compares them and draws conclusion on their use in theory and practice.   <b>Materials</b> <b>Management</b> (MM) was long neglected by business management and economic theory. The role of <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> as a secondary activity in the organization and its supportive role to production were encouraged in classical <b>materials</b> <b>management.</b> SCM reevaluated the value chain of whole industries and therefore reemphasized the strategic role of <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> for the supply chain. MM is divided into 5 steps or activity fields: supporting activities, sourcing, distribution, storage and disposal. SCM changed the methods used in each separate step. In supporting activities for example SCM requires multi-dimensional, long-term and dynamic instruments to guide decision-making in <b>materials</b> <b>management,</b> using cross-organizational cooperation to succeed, such as advanced purchasing. In sourcing the strategic role of sourcing was reemphasized by SCM and new tools {{such as the use of}} procurement marketing, SCR, green sourcing, TCO, ethical sourcing, PCB, strategic alliances and TPB were introduced, due to the new cooperative paradigm in SCM. In distribution and storage too, cooperative instruments are used to keep up competitiveness, such as VMI and integrated logistics. In disposal, however, SCM provides a totally new philosophy, reducing the focus on waste and enhancing material cycles, environmental programs and new recycling programs, such as reverse logistics. Overall in SCM, the main focus was relocated from scheduling and storage planning that was the main activity of <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> in the classical perspective to strategic sourcing and disposal as the two main processes of <b>materials</b> <b>management.</b> Concluding, the comparison of classical and supply-chain-based <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> showed, that SCM emphasizes on the strategic role of <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> by offering an integrated and process-oriented perspective on the value-creation process. Furthermore supply-chain-based <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> bases on communication, mutual interdependence and decreasing short-term competition to stay competitive in the long run as an entity, represented by the supply-chain. The long-term, complex and dynamic perspective of SCM and the pursuing of multiple and conflicting goals in SCM are mirrored in the methods used in supply-chain-based <b>Materials</b> <b>Management.</b> Recapitulatory, SCM reemphasized the strategic role of <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> as a cooperative, process-oriented primary activity within the supply-chain that has major potential for the competitiveness of the supply chain in the long-run...|$|R

40|$|Construction {{industry}} in Malaysia still lags behind other industries {{in terms of}} implementation of information technology. <b>Materials</b> <b>management</b> needs adequate consideration in complex construction projects due to the involvement of several elements of project. Hence, late delivery of materials can lead to delay that gives negative impact to overall project plan especially in schedule. BIM is considered as {{an effective way to}} solve the problems in the construction project life cycle. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to identify the challenges of BIM integration with <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> and to study the potential of BIM integration with <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> in construction project. This research focuses on the integration of BIM with <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> in construction project at Kuala Lumpur with G 7 contractors involved and consultants. The quantitative (questionnaire) approach was used to gain information from consultants and contractors (G 7). There were 304 copies of questionnaires distributed to the targeted respondents and 93 of the response were collected which was 30. 59 % of total respondent. The data were collected and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21. 0. The findings showed that, most of respondents agreed that lack of awareness, unavailability of data formats, lack of introducing and lack of understanding of BIM as challenges of BIM integration with <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> in construction project. Similarly, most of respondents agreed that BIM can integrated for planning and scheduling, controlling and monitoring, supply chain and storage of <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> as potential of BIM integration with <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> in construction project. The research finding encouraged the consultants and contractors in Malaysian construction project should understand BIM, knowledge of BIM and awareness of BIM in order to integrate BIM with <b>materials</b> <b>management</b> in construction project...|$|R
