50|$|Some <b>metal</b> <b>spinning</b> {{tools are}} allowed to spin on {{bearings}} during the forming process. This reduces friction and heating of the tool, extending tool life and improving surface finish. Rotating tools may also be coated with thin film of ceramic to prolong tool life.

40|$|We use a {{ferromagnetic}} voltage probe {{model to}} study the influence of inelastic scattering on giant magnetoresistance and current-induced torques in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic <b>metal</b> <b>spin</b> valves. The model {{is based on the}} Green's function formulation of transport theory and represents spin-dependent and spin-independent inelastic scatterers by interior voltage probes that are constrained to carry respectively no charge current and no spin or charge current. We find that giant magnetoresistance and spin transfer torques in ferromagnetic <b>metal</b> <b>spin</b> valve structures survive arbitrarily strong spin-independent inelastic scattering, while the recently predicted analogous phenomena in antiferromagnetic <b>metal</b> <b>spin</b> valves are partially suppressed. We use toy-model numerical calculations to estimate spacer layer thickness requirements for room temperature operation of antiferromagnetic <b>metal</b> <b>spin</b> valves.

50|$|Mandrels are not recent inventions. Metal {{machining}} {{utilizing the}} spinning {{process has been}} recorded {{as far back as}} ancient Egyptian times. In <b>metal</b> <b>spinning,</b> a wood or <b>metal</b> <b>spinning</b> mandrel is used, the form of which corresponds with the internal contour of the part to be produced. This method securely clamps the raw material and allows for accurate machining into the desired final form. Since the material is clamped internally, there is no interference to the operator from the lathe/mandrel assembly during production.|$|E

50|$|Woodturning and <b>metal</b> <b>spinning</b> lathes do {{not have}} cross-slides, but rather have banjos, which are flat pieces that sit {{crosswise}} on the bed. The position of a banjo can be adjusted by hand; no gearing is involved. Ascending vertically from the banjo is a tool-post, {{at the top of}} which is a horizontal tool-rest. In woodturning, hand tools are braced against the tool rest and levered into the workpiece. In <b>metal</b> <b>spinning,</b> the further pin ascends vertically from the tool rest and serves as a fulcrum against which tools may be levered into the workpiece.|$|E

50|$|Rule based DFM {{analysis}} for <b>metal</b> <b>spinning.</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>spinning</b> is a lesser known metal forming and fabricating manufacturing process. It is more conventionally {{used for the}} manufacturing of axis-symmetric parts. Its ability to create parts that require high tolerance and high strength makes it an outstanding process to manufacture {{a wide range of}} parts for automobile, aerospace, defence and medical industries. Typical components produced by <b>metal</b> <b>spinning</b> are lamp bases, reflectors, hollowware (pitchers, tankards, vases, candlesticks, etc.), pots, bans bowls and components for electrical equipment. Design for manufacturability (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products {{in such a way that}} they are easy to manufacture. The concept exists in almost all engineering disciplines, but the implementation differs widely depending on the manufacturing technology. DFM describes the process of designing or engineering a product in order to facilitate the manufacturing process in order to reduce the manufacturing costs. DFM will allow potential problems to be fixed in the design phase which is the least expensive place to address them. Other factors may affect the manufacturability such as the type of raw material, the form of the raw material, dimensional tolerances, and secondary processing such as finishing.|$|E

40|$|In a {{superconductor}} {{coupled with}} a ferromagnetic <b>metal,</b> <b>spin</b> and charge imbalances can be induced by injecting spin-polarized electron current from the ferromagnetic metal. We theoretically study a nonequilibrium distribution of quasiparticles {{in the presence of}} spin and charge imbalances. We show that four distribution functions are needed to characterize such a nonequilibrium situation, and derive a set of linearized Boltzmann equations for them by extending the argument by Schmid and Schön based on the quasiclassical Green’s function method. Using the Boltzmann equations, we analyze the spin imbalance in a thin superconducting wire weakly {{coupled with a}} ferromagnetic electrode. The spin imbalance induces a shift δµ (−δµ) of the chemical potential for up-spin (down-spin) quasiparticles. We discuss how δµ is relaxed by spin-orbit impurity scattering...|$|R

40|$|The {{switching}} {{of magnetic}} layers is studied under {{the action of}} a spin current in a ferromagnetic metal/non-magnetic metal/ferromagnetic <b>metal</b> <b>spin</b> valve. We find that the main contribution to the switching comes from the non-equilibrium exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic layers. This interaction defines the magnetic configuration of the layers with minimum energy and establishes the threshold for a critical switching current. Depending on {{the direction of the}} critical current, the interaction changes sign and a given magnetic configuration becomes unstable. To model the time dependence of the switching process, we derive a set of coupled Landau-Lifshitz equations for the ferromagnetic layers. Higher order terms in the non-equilibrium exchange coupling allow the system to evolve to its steady-state configuration. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figure. Submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
