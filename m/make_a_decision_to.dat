5|$|Meanwhile, {{broken and}} {{incoherent}} radio messages between Lieber {{and the search}} party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, {{where it will be}} held and under whose jurisdiction. Orosso is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or try Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak... his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local Indian tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.|$|E

25|$|Unconscionable {{agreements}} can be escaped where {{a person}} was under duress or undue influence or their vulnerability was being exploited when they ostensibly agreed to a deal. Children, mentally incapacitated people and companies, whose representatives are acting wholly outside their authority, are protected against having agreements enforced against them where they lacked the real capacity to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> enter an agreement. Some transactions are considered illegal, and are not enforced by courts because of a statute or on grounds of public policy. In theory, English law attempts to adhere to a principle that people should only be bound when they have given their informed and true consent to a contract.|$|E
25|$|Education writer Richard Wright {{considers}} that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher Jean Buridan. The Buridan's ass puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has {{on both sides}} of him separate bales of hay, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no autonomy. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not {{made on the basis of}} chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.|$|E

In the event that the legislature adjourns to prevent the return of a bill by veto, the bill becomes law three days after the commencement of the next legislative session unless the governor explicitly vetoes it.

500|$|Tatiana's English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, {{recalled}} that Tatiana had grown razor thin in captivity and seemed [...] "haughtier" [...] and more inscrutable {{to him than}} ever. In April 1918 the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra and Maria to Yekaterinburg. The remaining children remained behind in Tobolsk because Alexei, who had suffered another attack of haemophilia, could not be moved. It was Tatiana who persuaded her mother to [...] "stop tormenting herself" [...] and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go with her father and leave Alexei behind. Alexandra decided that level-headed Tatiana must be left behind to manage the household and look after Alexei.|$|E
500|$|Many {{people who}} self-harm state {{that it allows}} them to [...] "go away" [...] or dissociate, {{separating}} the mind from feelings that are causing anguish. This may be achieved by tricking the mind into believing that the present suffering being felt is caused by the self-harm instead of the issues they were facing previously: the physical pain therefore acts as a distraction from the original emotional pain. To complement this theory, one can consider the need to [...] "stop" [...] feeling emotional pain and mental agitation. [...] "A person may be hyper-sensitive and overwhelmed; a great many thoughts may be revolving within their mind, and they may either become triggered or could <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> stop the overwhelming feelings." ...|$|E

Yuri Baluyevsky, former Chief of the General Staff of Russia said that President Dmitry Medvedev didn't want to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go to war for some time. Baluyevsky {{said that it was}} Putin that had ordered to [...] "retaliate" [...] militarily against Georgia [...] "after the first tensions", however [...] "high-level officials" [...] in Moscow had the fear of responsibility [...] "until a kick in one place from Vladimir Vladimirovich in Beijing followed."

2500|$|Two months later, {{criticism}} of the perp walk resumed when Strauss-Kahn's bail terms were reduced from house arrest to his own recognizance after the office of Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. found the housekeeper had been dishonest with them about other aspects of her story than the attack. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had earlier defended the perp walk, criticized it as [...] "outrageous". City Councilman David G. Greenfield introduced legislation that would ban perp walks. [...] "I honestly believe it's unconstitutional," [...] he said. [...] "If we banned it here we could {{send a message to}} the country." [...] Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the media was to blame, not his department. [...] "If they <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> stake out a location when someone is walked out of the front of a precinct ... it's not a decision that the Police Department makes", he said. [...] "We have been walking prisoners out of the front doors of stationhouses for 150 years in the Police Department ... This is how we transport people to court ...

2500|$|Once a bill passes, the {{governor}} has five days to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> sign, veto, or let it pass unsigned. [...] The question then became whether or not Governor Brewer would sign the bill into law, as she had remained silent on the measure while weighing the consequences. [...] Immigration {{had not been a}} prime focus of her political career up to this point, although as secretary of state she had supported Arizona Proposition 200 (2004). [...] As governor, she had made another push for Arizona Proposition 100 (2010), a one percent increase in the state sales tax to prevent cuts in education, health and human services, and public safety, despite opposition from within her own party. [...] These preceding [...] political moves, along with an upcoming tough Republican Party primary in the 2010 Arizona gubernatorial election from other conservative opponents supporting the bill, were all considered major factors in her decision. [...] During the bill's development, her staff had gone over its language line by line with State Senator Pearce, but she had also said she had concerns about several of its provisions. [...] The Mexican Senate urged {{the governor}} to veto the measure and the Mexican Embassy to the U.S. raised concerns about potential racial profiling that may result. Citizen messages to Brewer, however, were 3–1 in favor of the law. [...] A Rasmussen Reports poll taken between the House and Senate votes showed wide support for the bill among likely voters in the state, with 70percent in favor and 23percent opposed. [...] Of those same voters, 53percent were at least somewhat concerned that actions taken due to the measures in the bill would violate the civil rights of some American citizens. [...] Brewer's staff said that she was considering the legal issues, the impact on the state's business, and the feelings of the citizens in coming to her decision. [...] They added that [...] "she agonizes over these things," [...] and the governor also prayed over the matter. [...] Brewer's political allies said her decision would cause her political trouble no matter which way she decided. [...] Most observers expected that in the end, she would sign the bill, and on April 23 she did.|$|E
