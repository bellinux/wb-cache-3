40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the authors}} compare the {{financial}} and associate membership data over the 2007 - 2012 period of the three French <b>mutual</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>banking</b> groups [Crédit agricole, Crédit mutuel, and BPCE (Banques populaires and Caisses d’épargne) ] (see in the Appendix) {{with those of the}} two “capitalist” banking groups (BNP-Paribas and Société générale). This study is part of a broader research including other dimensions of the cooperative model. All the data used come from the annual reports of the five banking groups analyzed over the 2007 - 2012 period, and not from a database. Indeed, a database may raise many relevance problems related to difficulties of consolidation that are specific to cooperative groups. Even if the way to create earnings may imply the same business as in capitalist banks (loans, deposits, shareholdings, investment banking, etc.), {{the way to do it}} may be different in <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> (fair conditions of borrowing, shareholdings in order to finance the economy rather than simply make capital gains, etc.). Thus, the difference between the two types of <b>banks,</b> as <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> say, is both their final goal and the way to reach it. Meanwhile, a major external difficulty is that <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> have to obey the same prudential rules as other banks whereas these norms were created for a capitalist organization and governance model. In the same way, the indivisible reserves, the steadiness of the share value, or the impossibility of external takeovers is among the main characteristics of the <b>cooperative</b> model <b>and</b> they are not taken into account by the financial analysis...|$|R
40|$|Until about 25 years ago, {{almost all}} European {{countries}} had a so-called “three pillar” banking system comprising private banks, (public) savings <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> (<b>mutual)</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks.</b> Since that time, several European countries have implemented far-reaching {{changes in their}} banking systems, which have {{more than anything else}} affected the two “pillars” of the savings <b>and</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks.</b> The article describes the most important changes in Germany, Austria, France, Italy and Spain and characterizes the former and the current roles of savings <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> in these countries. A particular focus is placed on the German case, which is almost unique in so far as the German savings <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> have maintained most of their traditional features.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the impact of}} the {{connections}} of the top executives (Presidents, CEOs and General Managers) of Italian banks on their turnover and on bank performance. We measure managers’ connections by the kilometer distance between the province of the bank's headquarter and the manager's province of birth. We show that top managers tend to be local {{in the sense that the}} distribution of this distance is heavily skewed towards zero. On the basis of this evidence we investigate whether connections affect the duration of the appointment at the bank, and whether connections entrench managers at the expense of the bank's performance. We find that connections generally decrease the probability of bank manager’s turnover, and that the positive effect of performance on tenure is strongly attenuated once connections are taken into account. Furthermore we find that for any bank type performance does not increase with connections. On the contrary, we show that having connected managers hurts performance in <b>Mutual,</b> <b>Cooperative</b> <b>and</b> Rural <b>banks.</b> Overall these findings suggest that connections are collusion devices to share and maintain rents at the expenses of bank performance...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{have long}} debated the {{relationships}} between market structure of banking sector and the profitability. General consensus asserts that more concentrated market is associated with higher profitability: banks with higher market share generally achieve higher profits. This empirical evidence can however hinge on two opposite explanations: {{in the first case}} banks increase their market share (via mergers and acquisitions) in order to exploit the resulting stronger market power and impose higher prices to their clients; the second explanation tells that more cost-efficient banks are able to lower the prices applied to their clients and therefore to gain new clients and finally enlarge their market share. In both cases there is a positive link between market share and profitability, but in the former what actually plays a crucial role is a non-competitive force (Relative Market Power Hypothesis, henceforth RMP), in the latter the relationship is driven by the greater efficiency of banks which enlarge their market share by reducing prices (X-Efficiency Hypothesis, ESX). We run a 4 -years panel data analysis (2008 - 2011) in order to disentangle the above alternatives hypothesis (RMP versus ESX) for the Italian market. First we estimate the cost efficiency for a sample of more than 200 banks by applying the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). In the second step we regress bank spreads on efficiency scores and market structure variables in order to identify which process leads the price setting of Italian banks.

40|$|Developments in risk-transfer {{instruments}} and risk management techniques {{in the last}} two decades have fundamentally changed how banks manage their assets and liabilities. In this document we show that, for all three sectors of German universal banks (private commercial <b>banks,</b> savings <b>banks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks),</b> asset-liability dependency declined over the period 1994 - 2007, the decline was strongest for those banks that use more than sector-average amounts of derivatives. Only in the case of private commercial banks, we do find that lower regulatory capital has coincided with higher asset-liability dependencies. Over our sample period, the difference has diminished since poorly-capitalized private commercial banks have reduced their asset-liability dependencies more intensively than their well-capitalized counterparts. Moreover, we find that profitability matters for the asset-liability dependency but not in the same way for all three sectors. Asset-liability dependency is lower for private commercial banks with higher provision income, savings banks with lower ROE volatilities <b>and</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> with higher ROEs.
