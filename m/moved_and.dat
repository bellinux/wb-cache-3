5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth. The field of geology encompasses {{the study of the}} composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, <b>moved,</b> <b>and</b> changed. The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E

5|$|In 1191, monks at {{the abbey}} {{claimed to have}} found the graves of Arthur and Guinevere {{to the south of}} the Lady Chapel of the Abbey Church, which was visited by a number of {{contemporary}} historians including Giraldus Cambrensis. The remains were later <b>moved</b> <b>and</b> were lost during the Reformation. Many scholars suspect that this discovery was a pious forgery to substantiate the antiquity of Glastonbury's foundation, and increase its renown.|$|E

5|$|In 1999 the Lebanese {{government}} {{started a}} massive campaign to recover antiquities that were stolen or traded {{during the civil}} war. Many artifacts were recovered from warehouses or private homes since Lebanese law dictates that any item more than 300 years old belongs to the state. In 2011, the ground floor restoration lab was <b>moved</b> <b>and</b> a new exhibition hall, named after prince Maurice Chehab was opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the monuments}} at Takalik Abaj {{are not in}} their {{original}} positions but rather have been <b>moved</b> <b>and</b> reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons.

The Albany Devils moved after the 2016–17 season and became the Binghamton Devils.|$|E
5|$|The {{new line}} was {{initially}} not profitable, because Schøyens Bilcentraler had kept its concession to operate buses in the area. Not until World War II was the bus route terminated.

On 6 July, the section from Makrellbekken to Røa was upgraded to double track, and later Volvat was <b>moved</b> <b>and</b> placed inside a tunnel.

5|$|The site of {{the battle}} {{is one of only}} five battlefields in Norfolk that are {{recognised}} by Norfolk County Council. The battle was commemorated by three mediaeval stone crosses: one is on private land; another (now a stump) was relocated by North Walsham Urban District Council in 1932 and can be found near the roadside by the town's water towers; the third cross was <b>moved</b> <b>and</b> used as a parish boundary marker. It is situated on Toff’s Loke, off Norwich Road.|$|E
5|$|Veltmann {{scored a}} {{victory at the}} {{beginning}} of his defense: he <b>moved</b> <b>and</b> was granted that each officer's testimony could only be applied to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work. In principle, this ruling was favorable, but in practice it would only benefit the men if the court had been attentively keeping notes for each accused man. Instead, reporters observed the court to be drowsy at times, with one particular judge regularly nodding off.|$|E
5|$|When {{the highway}} was {{established}} in 1931, it ran from Lehi to Salt Lake City. The state subsequently extended it south into Elberta and north into Bountiful.

5|$|A round Norman-style apse {{was added}} to the church in 1868, the architects being the Lancaster {{partnership}} of Paley and Austin. The incumbent, the Rev. Thomas Clarke, paid for this addition, but died before its construction was complete. Architect J.S.Crowther oversaw further alterations in 1881–83; a baptistery was built, the organ was <b>moved</b> <b>and</b> choir stalls were built in the chancel. Some work was done to the interior of the tower in 1908. Renovations in 1955 included the addition of a central aisle and the removal of some of the church furnishings. The Victorian pulpit was replaced. A small extension was added north of the tower in 2005.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is <b>moved</b> <b>and</b> says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, <b>moved</b> <b>and</b> founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the {{destroyed}} Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life {{until his death in}} 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee– all of which declared independence and went on to {{have a significant impact on}} the history of South India in the coming centuries.|$|E
