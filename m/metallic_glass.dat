In this article we discuss elastic, anelastic and plastic behaviors of <b>metallic</b> <b>glasses</b> from the atomistic point of view, based upon recent results by simulations and experiments. Strong structural disorder affects all properties of <b>metallic</b> <b>glasses,</b> but the effects are more profound and intricate for the mechanical properties.

30|$|A {{bottom-up}} approach to nanofabricate <b>metallic</b> <b>glasses</b> from metal clusters as building blocks is presented. Considering <b>metallic</b> <b>glasses</b> as a subclass of cluster-assembled materials, {{the relation between}} the two lively fields of metal clusters and <b>metallic</b> <b>glasses</b> is pointed out. Deposition of selected clusters or collections of them, generated by state-of-the-art cluster beam sources, could lead to the production of a well-defined amorphous material. In contrast to rapidly quenched glasses where only the composition of the glass can be controlled, in cluster-assembled glasses, one can precisely control the structural building blocks. Comparing properties of glasses with similar compositions but differing in building blocks and therefore different in structure will facilitate the study of structure–property correlation in <b>metallic</b> <b>glasses.</b> This bottom-up method provides a novel alternative path to the synthesis of glassy alloys and will contribute to improving fundamental understanding in the field of <b>metallic</b> <b>glasses.</b> It may even permit the production of glassy materials for alloys that cannot be quenched rapidly enough to circumvent crystallization. Additionally, gaining deeper insight into the parameters governing the structure–property relation in <b>metallic</b> <b>glasses</b> can have a great impact on understanding and design of other cluster-assembled materials.|$|R
