40|$|Objective: To {{propose a}} bio-treatment for cyanide {{residues}} generated by <b>medico-legal</b> <b>procedures</b> {{and to identify}} risk factors from handling. Methodology: cyanide residues, from the Institute of Legal Medicine, Medellin, were characterized by their physical state and identified its management, and risk factors. For the residues degradation 22 pre-essays and 9 bioassays were done with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Thiobacillus ferrooxidans at different cyanide concentrations. Results: there were failures in all risk factors analyzed, predominating the chemical component which sources of pollution. In studies of degradation, Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed a 87 % removal percentage at a concentration of 50 mg / L and Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, 79 % removal at a concentration of 500 mg / L. We conducted a technical guide {{for the management of}} cyanide residues. Conclusions: The evaluation of the routes of cyanide from seizure to final disposal, were found that the Institute of Forensic Medicine had no documented guidelines on the management of them. Biological treatment with bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Thiobacillus ferrooxidans were efficient in the degradation of cyanide...|$|E
40|$|The {{so called}} 'medico-legal {{procedures}} ' {{were introduced in}} the European legislation with the adoption in 1997 of Council Directive 97 / 43 /Euratom on health protection of individuals against the dangers of ionizing radiation in relation to medical exposure (Medical Exposure Directive, MED). According to MED, the exposure due to <b>medico-legal</b> <b>procedures,</b> defined as "those procedures performed for insurance or legal purposes without a medical indication", is a sub-category of medical exposure; therefore radiation protection {{in this area is}} arranged under the common legal framework for protection of patients and individuals participating in health screening, occupational health surveillance or biomedical research programmes. The difficulties in implementing MED's legal requirements were recognized soon after the Directive was adopted. Therefore, in 2002 the European Commission organized an International Symposium with the objective to discuss the various practices involving medicolegal procedures and to look at ways of addressing the associated radiation protection issues. The proceedings of this meeting, including the main discussion points and conclusions, were published by the Commission in 2003 as "Radiation Protection 130...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Ghent Group was {{established}} in 2004 as a forum for forensic psychiatrists from different countries in Europe in order to bridge the gaps in knowledge, experience, practice and care which exist between them due to their different legal traditions and constitutions in dealing with people having mental disorders who come into conflict with the law. METHODS: The Ghent Group considers itself as a loosely organised think tank to which all interested and invited professionals can contribute without statutory restraints. Its aim is to facilitate communication with mentally disordered offenders appearing in court, to understand the procedures of our neighbouring countries and {{to find common ground}} between clinicians. RESULTS: The major focus of the Ghent Group is on teaching and training both at a national level, where one can learn about the methods of training from each other, and at a European level. The group of trainees from different countries experiment in seminars in solving medico-legal cases considering European Human Rights issues and their respective national procedures and institutions. CONCLUSIONS: This helps not only to understand the differences between the national <b>medico-legal</b> <b>procedures</b> but also to deepen the understanding of the principles and practice in one's own country...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the work of}} the coroner. The thesis is sociological in orientation and method, drawing where necessary from other disciplines, e. g. law, philosophy. The study concentrates upon the nature of coroners' categorisations and the production of the socially recognised 'facts of sudden death'. While detailed consideration is given to the inquest and inquest verdicts, the whole range of coroners' work is examined. Differing but complementary research methods are employed to yield essentially qualitative material. Existing sociological studies, e. g. of 'official statistics' and of suicide, are evaluated. Coroners' methods of ascribing meaning to sudden death are examined. An important aim is to render processes of construction 'visible' for sociological study. Part One (Chapters One and Two) opens with a review of theoretical issues in sociology. The methodology of the study is 'located' within sociological theory. Part One continues with an historical discussion of the office of coroner, and an outline of legislation and formal <b>medico-legal</b> <b>procedure.</b> Part Two (Chapters Three, Four and Five) forms the largest section of the study, consisting of material collected by field research, i. e., interviews with the coroners of five counties, systematic observation of inquests, and unpublished/published statistics. Provisional conclusions are discussed as the study progresses, covering topics which include, inter alia: discretionary authority; the inquest as court of law; the differing perceptions of individual coroners; the relevance of historical factors; the Press; methods of constructing the verdict; the roles of doctors, pathologists and police; social control; official statistics; and historical and geographical statistical variations. Part Three (Chapters Six and Seven) draws overall conclusions about coroners' accounts of sudden death. It places coroners work within bureaucratic and ideological contexts. The work of the coroner is situated in terms of the ways society conceives of and deals with death as a whole. Two short appendices add further statistics and further methodological details...|$|R
40|$|Although {{it is not}} a legal {{requirement}} in South Africa, medical practitioners determine the manner of injury death for a surveillance system that is currently the only source of epidemiological data on suicide. This study assessed the accuracy of suicide data as recorded in the system using the docket produced from standard <b>medico-legal</b> investigation <b>procedures</b> as the gold standard. It was conducted in one of three cities where the surveillance system had full coverage for the year 2000. In the medico-legal system, one-third of cases could not be tracked, had not been finalized, or had unclear outcomes. For the remaining cases, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were generally high, varying somewhat across sex and race groups. Poisoning, jumping, and railway suicides were more likely than other methods to be misclassified, and were more common among females and Whites. The study provides encouraging results regarding the use of medical practitioner expertise for the accurate determination of suicide deaths. However, suicides may still be underestimated in this process given the challenge of tracing disguised suicides and without the careful examination of potential misclassifications of true suicides as unintentional deaths. © 2007 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a dearth}} of {{literature}} {{on the extent of}} fetal or newborn abandonment or “dumping” and the <b>medico-legal</b> investigation <b>procedures</b> these cases require. This is despite the fact that these occurrences are a world-wide phenomenon and by definition involve criminal law concerns such as illegal abortion, concealment of birth, murder, or neonaticide, depending on the country concerned. This article contributes to current literature in both respects and provides a retrospective case audit for the period 2004 - 2008 pertaining to all abandoned newborns and fetuses admitted to the Pretoria Medico-Legal Laboratory (PMLL) in South Africa. Demographic details, scope and nature of the medico-legal investigation as well as formulation of cause of death, were recorded. A total of 289 cases were identified for inclusion in this study, 57 % of which were considered to have been non-viable fetuses, whilst 45 of the viable fetuses were deemed to have been stillborn. These instances involve the crimes of concealment of birth and at times illegal abortion, yet prosecution of these cases are relatively unheard of. Signs of live birth were identified in 38 of the cases in the study. Of these infants, 9 were deemed to have died from injuries they have sustained and in a further 9 cases no anatomical cause of death could be identified. Homicidal cases should be brought in cases where death ensued as a result of abandonment however it is not known how many cases were prosecuted. A comparatively large number of cases were found to have been admitted to the Pretoria Medico-Legal Laboratory. This is alarming because South African abortion laws are liberal and services are free at point of access in the public health care sector. A substantial percentage of cases of abandoned infants were found to have shown signs of life after birth implying a homicidal manner of death or death by abandonment but it seems these cases are merely shelved.

40|$|Six sub-Saharan African {{countries}} {{currently have}} laws on sexual violence, including Kenya, and eight others have provisions on sexual violence in other legislation. Effective legislation requires functioning medico-legal linkages to enable both justice {{to be done}} in cases of sexual violence and the provision of health services for survivors of sexual violence. The health sector also needs to provide post-rape care services and collect and deliver evidence to the criminal justice system. This paper reviews existing data on sexual violence in sub-Saharan Africa, and summarises the content of sexual violence legislation in the region and {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} existing medico-legal linkages, using Kenya as a case study. Many sub-Saharan African countries do not yet have comprehensive post-rape care services, nor substantial co-ordination between HIV and sexual and reproductive health services, the legal and judicial systems, and sexual violence legislation. These need to be integrated by cross-referrals, using standardised referral guidelines and pathways, treatment protocols, and <b>medico-legal</b> <b>procedures.</b> Common training approaches and harmonised information across sectors, and common indicators, would facilitate government accountability. Joint and collaborative planning and working at country level, through sharing of information and data between the different systems remain key to achieving this...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The gluteal {{region is}} usually the {{preferred}} site for intramuscular injections. However, reported complications include pain, abscess formation, hematoma formation and peripheral nerve injury, most frequently sciatic nerve injury. Here, we aimed to analyze the demographical, clinical and electrophysiological features of patients with sciatic nerve injury following gluteal intramuscular injections and to summarize the legal procedure in Turkey. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the clinical and electrophysiological features of 33 patients who were admitted to our electrophysiology department between January 1995 and June 2006 with symptoms and signs of sciatic nerve injury which appeared after intramuscular injection in the gluteal region and we reviewed the legal procedure. Results: There were 16 male (48. 5 %) and 17 female (51. 5 %) patients. Age range was between 1. 5 and 81 years. The interval between nerve injury and admission to our laboratory ranged from 20 days to 25 years. 24 patients were admitted within 6 months after the injury, 32, within 1 year and, only one was admitted after 25 years. The patients who were admitted within the first 6 months after the injury, were commonly admitted for diagnosis and determination of prognosis, whereas the patients in the late periods were referred {{as a part of}} medico-legal procedure. All patients expressed burning and shock-like pain radiating to the whole lower extremity. The other symptoms were weakness (50 %), numbness (9. 1 %), and paresthesia (4. 5 %). Electrophysiologically, both divisions of the sciatic nerve were affected in 9 (27. 2 %) and axonal involvement of the lateral division predominated in the remaining patients. Conclusion: Injection neuropathy constitutes the major part of the sciatic nerve injuries. Most frequent symptoms are burning pain and weakness. In any traumatic sciatic neuropathy, the peroneal nerve seems to be involved more frequently resulting from the more lateral and superficial location of the fibers supplying the peroneal nerve. Axonal involvement is generally predominating in injection neuropathies. Patients even in the late period are referred to the electrophysiology laboratory for determination of sequela and <b>medico-legal</b> <b>procedures.</b> All medical staff should be aware of clinical and electrophysiological findings and medicolegal approach in this condition.

40|$|Suicide is {{a serious}} public health problem worldwide, but is {{differentially}} distributed across social groups and regions. The goal of this thesis, focusing on the post-apartheid transitional setting of South Africa, is to advance knowledge {{of the relationship between}} individual social status (race and sex), contextual factors and suicide mortality. The accuracy of the available suicide data is also assessed. All five studies forming the thesis are based on the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System (NIMSS), currently the only source of epidemiological data on suicide mortality in South Africa. Census figures provide denominator data and area attributes. Inputs from experts and additional victim data are gathered from the medico-legal system. The first three studies investigate the relative importance of suicide across sociodemographic groups, compared to other injury deaths (Study I), across six cities (Study II), and within one city ¨C Tshwane (Study III). As in other settings, mortality by suicide is unequally distributed across socio-demographic groups, with the order and magnitude of the differences varying across cities. While Blacks have the highest absolute numbers both overall and across most sex-specific groups and cities, males and Whites are typically most affected when rates are calculated. For all races except Whites, suicides are concentrated in the younger age groups. Study III additionally examines how the cross-sectional clustering of socio-economic and environmental descriptors of Tshwane residential areas impacts on the race- and sexbased suicide outcome. Main dimensions of the living circumstances of residential areas (i. e., socio-economic circumstances, economic need, and matrimony) are found to influence age-adjusted suicide rates for both sexes but minimally so for race groups. Less favourable clusters of circumstances have a protective effect. Suicide data accuracy is assessed in the last two studies. Decisional processes of those medical practitioners asked to determine the apparent manner of death of each case entered in the NIMSS are assessed in semi-structured interviews (Study IV), and dockets produced from standard <b>medico-legal</b> <b>procedures</b> serve as the gold standard against which to compare NIMSS certifications (Study V). Medical practitioners differed in their opinions both regarding the quality of currently available data for suicide determinations, and in the applicability of the U. S. © criteria in South Africa. Despite this, the accuracy of the suicide determinations was high, at least in the one city (Tshwane) studied. In sum, suicide mortality in post-apartheid South Africa varies widely across sex and race, with contextual factors seeming to influence these differing outcomes, more so for sex than for race. Although suicides are outnumbered by other injury deaths overall, {{this is not the case}} for several sex-, race- and age-specific groups, and rates indicate that suicide is a substantial public health burden that should no longer be given low priority in the health system. Medical practitioner expertise appears to provide accurate input for the determination of suicide deaths...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{conduct a}} {{systematic}} {{review of the}} effectiveness of consultation recordings, and identify factors contributing to their successful implementation in healthcare settings. Methods: A systematic review was conducted for quantitative studies examining the effectiveness of consultation recordings in healthcare. Two independent reviewers assessed the relevance and quality of retrieved quantitative studies using standardized criteria. Study findings were examined to determine consultation recording effectiveness and to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. A supplementary review of qualitative evidence was performed to further explicate implementation factors. Results: Of the 3, 373 articles retrieved in the quantitative search, 26 satisfied the standardized inclusion criteria (12 randomized controlled trials, 1 quasi-experiment, and 13 cross-sectional studies). The majority of patients found consultation recordings beneficial. Statistically significant evidentiary support was found for the beneficial impact of consultation recordings on the following patient reported outcomes: knowledge, perception of being informed, information recall, decisionmaking factors, anxiety, and depression. Implementation barriers included strength of evidence concerns, patient distress, impact of the recording on consultation quality, clinic <b>procedures,</b> <b>medico-legal</b> issues, and resource costs. Facilitators included comfort with being recorded, clinical champions, legal strategies, efficient recording procedures, and a positive consultation recording experience. Conclusions: Consultation recordings are valuable to patients and positively associated with patient reported outcomes. Successful integration of consultation recording use into clinical practice requires an administratively supported, systematic approach to addressing implementation factors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} discovery, {{investigation}} and prosecution of, {{as well as the}} men and women involved as suspects and witnesses in, cases of suspected new-born child murder and concealment of pregnancy in Scotland between 1812 and 1930. The study utilises pre-trial and other legal documents relating to these cases to outline both the continuities with other studies and aspects of the subject that are peculiar to Scotland during the period. An examination of the pre-trial documents not only reveals the various responses to suspicions of pregnancy and murder by the local community, it also shows that in a number of cases investigators harboured suspicions that members of the community were involved, either as an accessory to a crime, or withholding evidence. However, this information is largely ignored by prosecutors, {{and the vast majority of}} those tried were the victims’ mothers, an outcome that this thesis argues was a combination of a number of legal and <b>medico-legal</b> processes and <b>procedures.</b> This thesis also argues that the information provided by the pre-trial evidence can provide a more nuanced understanding of these ‘crimes’ – particularly at a local level – that is otherwise obscured by official statistics, that in turn can be used to challenge the prevailing historical consensus that has developed around certain aspects of the subject. The first chapter provides the legal and medico-legal contexts. Chapters Two and Three look at the discovery of, and responses to, the signs of pregnancy, recent delivery and of the bodies of new-born infants. Chapter Three argues that whilst communities were quick to observe the signs of pregnancy, they were less inclined to inform the authorities of their suspicions until after the signs of delivery, or a body, had been discovered. Chapter 4 looks at the profiles of suspects, and also at the geography of the ‘crimes’, and Chapter 5 looks at those men and women suspected of being an accessory to murder, and of helping to conceal a pregnancy or an infant’s death. This chapter reveals that the pretrial documents reveal that in a number of cases investigators suspected relatives, friends, the victims’ fathers, and in some cases even doctors and midwives, to be involved in various ways in cases of suspected new-born child murder. As such it provides a strong challenge to the historiographical consensus that new-born child murder was a sex-specific crime, carried out by the victim’s mother, acting alone. Chapters 6 and 7 explore the role of the police and medical witnesses respectively, both prior to a formal accusation, and during the official investigation. Chapter 7 also includes a detailed look at the medical reports pertaining to the examination of suspects and the post mortem examination of the victims. The final chapter looks at the witnesses and evidence presented at the trial, focusing in particular on the medico-legal issues that made it difficult for prosecutors to secure a successful murder conviction. The chapter argues that whilst these issues could be part of a wider culture of sympathy towards new-born child murder suspects, the evidence from the verdicts and sentencing can also demonstrate a hardening of judicial attitudes over the period...|$|R
