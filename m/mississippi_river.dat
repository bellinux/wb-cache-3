5|$|Tennessee, United States, {{located on}} the banks of the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River.</b> The lands of the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River</b> Basin were {{inhabited}} by Paleo-Indians and later Native American tribes of the Mississippian culture for thousands of years. The Tipton Phase people and the Chickasaw Indian tribe populated the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River</b> valley near Randolph during the Mississippian period. In 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto crossed the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River</b> at or near Randolph. French explorer Cavelier de La Salle built the first French fortification at or near Randolph on his 1682 canoe expedition of the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River.</b>|$|E

5|$|General Kirby Smith {{tried to}} send {{reinforcements}} from his Army of the Trans-Mississippi {{east of the}} <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River</b> to relieve Vicksburg, Mississippi, {{in the spring of}} 1864 following the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill. This was not practicable due to the Union naval control of the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River.</b> Smith instead dispatched Major General Sterling Price and his cavalry on an invasion of Missouri that was ultimately not successful. Thereafter the war west of the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River</b> was principally one of small raids. By May 26 a representative of Smith's negotiated and signed surrender documents with a representative of Major General Edward Canby. Canby in Shreveport, Louisiana, then took custody of Smith's force of 43,000 soldiers when they surrendered, by then the only significant Confederate forces left west of the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River.</b> With this ended all organized Southern military resistance to the Union forces. Smith signed the surrender papers on June 2 on board the U.S.S. Fort Jackson just outside Galveston Harbor.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Grant's career {{suffered}} temporarily in {{the aftermath}} of Shiloh. Halleck combined and reorganized his armies, relegating Grant to the powerless position of second-in-command. Meanwhile, Beauregard remained in command of the Army of Mississippi and led it back to Corinth. In late April and May, the Union armies, under Halleck's personal command, advanced slowly toward Corinth and captured it, while an amphibious force on the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River</b> destroyed the Confederates' River Defense Fleet and captured Memphis, Tennessee. Halleck was promoted to be general in chief of all the Union armies. With Halleck's departure to the East, Grant was restored to command and eventually pushed down the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River</b> to besiege Vicksburg, Mississippi. After the surrender of Vicksburg and the fall of Port Hudson in the summer of 1863, the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>River</b> was under Union control and the Confederacy was cut in two.|$|E
