60|$|One day, {{during a}} visit to the city of Buenos Ayres, I {{discovered}} in a mean street, {{in the southern part of}} the town, a second-hand bookshop, kept by an old snuffy spectacled German in a long shabby black coat. I remember him well because he was a very important person to me. It was the first shop of the kind I had seen--I doubt if there was another in the town; and to be allowed to rummage by the hour among this <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>books</b> on the dusty shelves and heaped on the brick floor was a novel and delightful experience. The books were mostly in Spanish, French, and German, but there were some in English, and among them I came upon Thomson's Seasons. I remember the thrill of joy I experienced when I snatched up the small thin octavo in its smooth calf binding. It was the first book in English I ever bought, and to this day when I see a copy of the Seasons on a bookstall, which is often enough, I cannot keep my fingers off it and find it hard to resist the temptation to throw a couple of shillings away and take it home. If shillings had not been wanted for bread and cheese I should have had a roomful of copies by now.|$|E

40|$|Rapport interne. Today, {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>books</b> remain unused {{all over}} the world. This is a big loss for humanity and future generations. The state of these books is getting worse everyday because their conservation techniques are often poor. The goal of this project {{is to try to}} restore the images <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>books.</b> I will give examples from a book from the renaissance on which I have already worked before and other examples fro the Gutenberg digital library. The ultimate goal of their restoration {{is to be able to}} build digital libraries. This is very important as it enables future generations to discover the large heritage from previous ones. The problem with images <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>books</b> is the poor quality of the books. This is the reason why we always have transparent images of the writing from the back that show on the front and vice versa. This is one of the main problems in images <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>books</b> restoration. Many approaches have been proposed on different types of documents. I am going to focus my discussion on the use of Self Organizing maps (SOM) for this project...|$|R

About 80 % <b>old</b> <b>books</b> were found more or less damaged by this pest. As the result of larval activity, many holes and tunnels were formed in damaged books. Some <b>of</b> them were <b>old,</b> some <b>of</b> them were new tunnels with live larvae and pupae. Many characteristic emergence holes of the adults were found in the book bindings. Around books there was an enormous amount of dust as a result of larval feeding activity. Live and dead adults were found around <b>old</b> <b>books</b> and within the library room, especially near windows. The Integrated Pest Manage-ment program was suggested to the owners and curator of the library to control infestation and to avoid the continuation of the damage.
