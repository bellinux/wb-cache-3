40|$|Osteoarthritis is {{a chronic}} {{degenerative}} disorder {{of the joint}} and {{represents one of the}} most common diseases worldwide. Its prevalence and severity are increasing owing to aging of the population, but treatment options remain largely limited to painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs, which only provide symptomatic relief. In the late stages of the disease, surgical interventions are often necessary to partially restore joint function. Although the focus of osteoarthritis research has been originally on the articular cartilage, novel findings are now pointing to osteoarthritis as a disease of the whole joint, in which failure of different joint components can occur. In this Review, we summarize recent progress in the field, including data from novel ‘omics’ technologies and from a number of preclinical and clinical trials. We describe different in vitro and in vivo systems that can be used to study molecules, pathways and cells that are involved in osteoarthritis. We illustrate that a comprehensive and <b>multisystem</b> <b>approach</b> is necessary to understand the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease and to better guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies for osteoarthritis...|$|E

This mixed-methods study {{examines}} the disciplinary-literacy knowledge {{that high school}} English, mathematics, science, and social studies teachers possess and {{the knowledge and skills}} on which they rely when planning for instruction. Three hundred and eleven high school teachers completed a survey that measured high school teachers' disciplinary-literacy knowledge; four teachers who completed the survey also participated in a think-aloud of unit design and a semistructured interview. Quantitative data were analyzed via descriptive statistics, factor analysis, a one-way multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA], and post-hoc tests. Qualitative data were analyzed using three cycles of coding: descriptive codes, axial codes and frequency counts, and assertion development. All analyses were merged to determine the knowledge high school teachers possess and the knowledge they utilize when planning for instruction. Through this analysis, a theory of teachers' application of knowledge to planning process emerged, and a framework for a <b>multisystems</b> <b>approach</b> to professional development was identified as an avenue to bridge reform and teacher practice. Suggestions for inservice professional-development providers and preservice teacher educators are also offered. Ed. D. (Doctor of Education...|$|R
40|$|Amanda Phelan School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, University College Dublin, Ireland Abstract: With {{a rising}} older person {{population}} with increasing life expectancies, {{the demand for}} care homes will increase in the future. Older people in care homes are particularly vulnerable due to their dependencies related to cognitive and/or functional self-care challenges. Although many care homes provide good care, maltreatment and abuse of older people can and does occur. One major step in preventing and addressing maltreatment in care homes is having comprehensive and responsive policy, which delineates national expectations that are locally implemented. This paper examines the literature related to maltreatment in care homes and argues for policy based on a <b>multisystems</b> <b>approach.</b> Policy needs to firstly acknowledge and address general societal issues which tacitly impact on older person care delivery, underpin how care homes and related systems should be operationalized, and finally delineate expected standards and outcomes for individual experience of care. Such a policy demands attention {{at every level of}} the health care and societal system. Furthermore, contemporary issues central to policy evolution in care homes are discussed, such as safeguarding education and training and fostering organization whistle-blowing protection.

Conclusions: Access to trained providers, educators, and judicial personnel continues to make treating conduct disorder a challenge. There are studies that have shown that treating conduct disorder using combination therapies such as Multisystem Therapy (MST) and medications is effective in managing the {{signs and symptoms of}} the disorder. Implications for Practice: More research is required to examine the long-term outcomes regarding the various methods of treatment. A standardized treatment modality is recommended to include a <b>multisystem</b> therapy <b>approach</b> and pharmacotherapy. Having a standard for treatment provides those caring for children diagnosed with conduct disorder a foundation to work from...|$|R

The proposed motorway passes over one regionally an important karst aquifer feeding Mazzoccolo spring, in the southeast part of Latium Region. This paper deals with {{the analysis of the}} most important environmental impacts on this vulnerable karst aquifer and, as a consequence, on groundwater coming out form the Mazzoccolo Spring, which feeds {{one of the most important}} drinking water supply network in South Latium Region. A <b>multisystem</b> <b>approach</b> has been applied for vulnerability analysis using SINTACS method. The climatic, topographic, geomorphological and hydrogeological data and field investigations of previous works has been employed. On the other hand, this approach was also evaluated by geochemical and isotope tracers techniques of groundwater samples for the identification of environmental impacts. According to the proposed project, the Motorway tunnel has a significant environmental impact, on the vulnerability of the karst aquifer and hence, on the water supply networks. Thus, based on these analyses the highway investment strategy adapted to Variant of the SS 7 (Appian Way) project should ensure the protection of groundwater resources designing a new variant route avoiding the construction of Mola Mountain tunnel...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{coming decades}} the {{proportion}} of very elderly {{people living in the}} Western world will dramatically increase. This forthcoming “grey epidemic ” will lead to an explosion of chronic diseases. In order to anticipate booming health care expenditures and to assure that social security is funded in the future, research focusing on the relationship between chronic diseases, frailty and disability is needed. The general aim of the BELFRAIL cohort study (BFC 80 +) is to study the dynamic interaction between health, frailty and disability in a <b>multisystem</b> <b>approach</b> focusing on cardiac dysfunction and chronic heart failure, lung function, sarcopenia, renal insufficiency and immunosenescence. Methods/Design: The BFC 80 + is a prospective, observational, population-based cohort study of subjects aged 80 years and older in three well-circumscribed areas of Belgium. In total, 29 general practitioner (GP) centres were asked to include patients aged 80 and older. Only three exclusion criteria were used: severe dementia, in palliative care and medical emergency. Two sampling methods for the recruitment of patients were used. Between November 2, 2008 and September 15, 2009, 567 subjects were included in the BFC 80 + study. Every study participant was invited to undergo four study visits. The GP recorded background variables and medical history and performed a detailed anamnesis and clinical examination.

40|$|Cilia are {{polarized}} {{extensions of}} the cells microtubule-based cytoskeleton dedicated to sensory, signaling and motility-related functions. In mammals, {{there are two main}} types of cilia, immotile and motile, where motile cilia generate/modulate fluid flow at the embryonic node, in respiratory airways, cerebral ventricles and the oviduct in addition to sperm propulsion via the flagellum. Defects in cilia motility cause a rare genetic disorder called Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). In this thesis, I present functional and molecular characterisation of two PCD causing genes HEATR 2 and ZMYND 10. Core cilia genes are transcriptionally activated by members of the winged-helix transcription factors of the RFX family. The forkhead transcription factor FOXJ 1, additionally activates motility genes such as the ones encoding components of axonemal dynein motors which transfer the chemical energy released from ATP hydrolysis to kinetic motion necessary for ciliary motility. I present data in this thesis which show that Heatr 2 and Zmynd 10 are both targets of the RFX 3 -FOXJ 1 transcriptional module which co-operatively switches on genes required to make motile cilia Mutations in both HEATR 2 and ZMYND 10 cause the same subtype of PCD (loss of inner and outer arm dyneins in cilia). I characterise a human PCD causing mutation in HEATR 2 in this thesis. Additionally, using genetic null mouse models generated using the CRISPR technology, I describe the phenotypic effects of complete loss of Zmynd 10 in mice. Zmynd 10 mutant mice display characteristic PCD-like features. Adding to my functional studies, I present proteomic data to propose mechanisms by which HEATR 2 and ZMYND 10 proteins control cilia motility. Mass spectrometry and protein interaction studies support distinct roles for HEATR 2 and ZMYND 10 in intracellular transport and pre-assembly of axonemal dynein motors. The <b>multisystem</b> <b>approaches</b> described in this thesis to characterise the roles of HEATR 2 and ZMYND 10 highlight the molecular complexity underlying the assembly and delivery of axonemal dyneins to motile cilia and provide novel functional and molecular insights into the pathophysiology of PCD...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Allostatic load, a {{composite}} measure of accumulated physical wear and tear, {{has been proposed}} as an early sign of physiological dysregulation predictive of health problems, functional limitation, and disability. However, much previous research has been cross sectional and few studies consider repeated measures. We investigate the directionality of associations between allostatic load, self-rated health, and a measure of physical function (walking speed). Methods: The sample included men and women 60 and older who participated in Wave 2 (2004) and Wave 4 (2008) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 6132 in Wave 2). Allostatic load was measured with nine biomarkers using a <b>multisystem</b> summary <b>approach.</b> Self-rated health was measured using a global 5 point summary indicator. Time to walk 8 ft {{was used as a}} measure of function. We fitted and tested autoregressive cross-lagged models between the allostatic load measure, self-rated health, and walking speed in Waves 2 and 4. Models were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, and smoking status at Wave 2 and for time-varying indicators of marital status, wealth, physical activity, and social support. Results: Allostatic load predicted slower walking speed (standardized estimate = − 0. 08, 95...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{dissertation}} is to construct an integrated conceptual model of crises intervention for Gikuyu people that would effectively inform the conceptualization of the nature, the methods employed {{and the purpose of}} utilizing traditional Gikuyu families and Christian resources for crises intervention. It will also inform the values for integration and the usefulness of systems and the crisis theories for the construction of the model for the Gikuyu. Moreover, the dissertation will report the significance of Christian pastoral resources and the relation to Gikuyu. The model is a strategy in the attempt to revive some of the distorted Gikuyu people 2 ̆ 7 s values of family unity (belongingness), which was their norm for intervening into family crises. Family values of unity for the Gikuyu suffered distortion over the years of the Christian missionary work to the Gikuyu in the nineteenth century. The model is limited for use in the Presbyterian Church in Kenya. However, other churches serving Gikuyu people are welcome to use it. The study is intended to be a foundation for the development of authentic literature, focusing upon new approaches toward crises intervention for Gikuyu, intended to mobilize families systems, Christian resources, and other networking systems for better work of crisis intervention. From the systems and the crisis perspectives, the study examines the usefulness of systems and the crisis theories for their relevancy in developing a model of crises intervention for Gikuyu families. It examines the viability of correlation between traditional Gikuyu families resources and the Christian resources, examining how each one is related to the other. The term 2 ̆ 7 crisis intervention 2 ̆ 7 refers to the usefulness and the effect of the work of correlating resources from the two perspectives. Correlation is the criteria for determining the interdependence of the two sources of intervention. The term 2 ̆ 7 model 2 ̆ 7 refers to the proposed methods of approaches utilized in reviving values of families interdependency, unity, and belongingness. The term 2 ̆ 7 differentiation of self 2 ̆ 7 informs the need for family members and significant others to work together for better working crisis, while each maintains individual unique abilities of differentiating intellectual decision-making from those of families emotional fusion. The dissertation uses two methods. The first method is founded on the concepts of families systems and the crisis theories for the construction of an effective model of crisis intervention for the Gikuyu and informing the reasons for its use. Second is the method of correlation which is a theological application to the action of mobilizing and utilizing the traditional Gikuyu resources together with Christian Gikuyu resources. In this second method Christ becomes the common norm of correlation for the purpose of liberation and the giving of hope to the individual and families in crisis. Moreover, through the theological method the integration of the model is accomplished. Before examining the usefulness of systems and crisis theories for analyzing data from the case study of illness, the history of the Gikuyu is examined. The {{purpose of the}} history is to inform the guidelines to which this model of crisis intervention should respond. For clarification purposes, these guidelines are the origin of the Gikuyu people, the nature of their corporate living; and the kinship governing principles. As part of the historical motivation of this dissertation, the role which was played by the social protest of the Gikuyu against Europeans and the missionaries is also examined. The protest was a symbol of dissatisfaction of the Gikuyu upon the mistreatment and the abuse of family values. The dissertation has several illustrations of crises intervention based on various concepts of family therapy which include: Uri Rueveni in networking families in crises, Murry Bowen 2 ̆ 7 s eight interlocking ideas of family therapy, Edward Wimberly 2 ̆ 7 s theory of pastoral care of the Black Church, and also the work of Nancy Boyd-Franklin in <b>multisystems</b> <b>approach</b> to family therapy. In concluding this study, it has been found that Gikuyu family and relational systems can be mobilized to resolve crises within the systems. It has also been discovered that the implication for further research is viable through the analyzing and the questioning of the claims in the data provided in this dissertation...|$|R

As a matter of fact groundwater in the coastal plain between Sabaudia and Terracina, south of Latina, Latium shows a number of problems, including salinization deriving from sea water intrusion or from different processes and from the superimposition of theirselves. The test site is an area of about 80 km 2, most part of which coastal and wetland {{since the beginning of the}} previous century. In the last fifty years, when the wetland became a plan, they have been stood up in it many different human activities like industrial firms, and agricultural plantations, which represent the most part of fruits and vegetables feeding people of Centre Italy. The effects of groundwater overexploitation on seawater intrusion and on groundwater resource availability start nowadays to be sensitive.
