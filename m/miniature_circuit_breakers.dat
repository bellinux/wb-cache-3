50|$|The {{first problem}} is {{resolved}} {{by the use of}} circuit breakers—devices that can be reset after they have broken current flow. In modern systems that use less than about 10 kW, <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> are typically used. These devices combine the mechanism that initiates the trip (by sensing excess current) as well as the mechanism that breaks the current flow in a single unit. Some <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> operate {{solely on the basis of}} electromagnetism. In these <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers,</b> the current is run through a solenoid, and, in the event of excess current flow, the magnetic pull of the solenoid is sufficient to force open the circuit breaker's contacts (often indirectly through a tripping mechanism). A better design however arises by inserting a bimetallic strip before the solenoid—this means that instead of always producing a magnetic force, the solenoid only produces a magnetic force when the current is strong enough to deform the bimetallic strip and complete the solenoid's circuit.|$|E

25|$|An early form of <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> was {{described}} by Thomas Edison in an 1879 patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used fuses.

Hugo Stotz, an engineer who had sold his company to BBC, was credited as the inventor on DRP (Deutsches Reichspatent) 458392. Stotz's invention was the forerunner of the modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this day.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} EMC {{issue was}} lightning strike (lightning electromagnetic pulse, or LEMP) on buildings. Lightning rods or lightning conductors {{began to appear}} in the mid-18th century. With the advent of widespread electricity generation and power supply lines from the late 19th century on, problems also arose with equipment short-circuit failure affecting the power supply, and with local fire and shock hazard when the power line was struck by lightning. Power stations were provided with output circuit breakers. Buildings and appliances would soon be provided with input fuses, and later in the 20th century <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (MCB) would come into use.|$|E

2500|$|A {{residual-current device}} (RCD), or residual-current <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> (RCCB), is {{a device that}} {{instantly}} breaks an electric circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock.

50|$|<b>Miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and fuses may {{be rated}} to {{interrupt}} {{as little as}} 85 amperes and are intended for supplementary protection of equipment, not the primary protection of a building wiring system. In North American practice, approved general-purpose low-voltage fuses must interrupt at least 10,000 amperes and certain types useful for large commercial and industrial low-voltage distribution systems are rated to safely interrupt 200,000 amperes. The rating of power circuit breakers varies according to the application voltage; a circuit breaker that interrupts 50,000 amperes at 208 volts might be rated to interrupt only 10,000 amperes at 600 volts, for example. Direct-current systems such as used with batteries are {{more of a problem}} than alternating current systems, because in the latter current regularly stops.|$|E

Later it acquired the lighting business of a Frankfurt based company Sylvania, a global leader in the lighting business and {{now for the first}} time in its history the company's turnover exceeded US$1 billion. By 2007 Havell's were well known for its electrical switches, energy meters and <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> (MCBs). In March 2007, Havells acquired SLI Sylvania of Netherlands for $300 million, making it the fourth largest lighting business in the world, worth over a billion USD This was, at that time, the biggest overseas takeover by an Indian electrical equipment manufacturer. This takeover helped to give the Havells brand access to over 20,000 dealers across Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The combined Havells-Sylvania generated over a $1 billion in revenue with more than 60% coming from international sales. Due to past mergers Havells’ portfolio includes many well-known brands like the Crabtree, Sylvania, Concord, Luminance, Linolite & SLI Lighting. In 2008 it became one of the first Indian CFL manufacturers to have adopted RoHS, European norms on restriction of hazardous substances in CFLs. In October 2008 Havell's moved to its new corporate headquarters, QRG Towers located at Expressway Noida. With an investment of Rs.500 million in Global Center for Research and Innovation (CRI) construction of a fully automatic plant for Havells Lafert Motors at Neemrana also started in that same year. In, 2010 it acquired 100% interest in Standard Electricals to set up the world's first new generation CMH lamp plant at Neemrana. In 2012, Indian actor Rajesh Khanna endorsed Havells Fan TVC titled Havells Fans Forever. Later in that same year Havells India expressed its plans to expand its presence in Turkey, Russia, Indonesia and Malaysia and is in the process of acquiring various companies in China and Africa.|$|E

25|$|An RCD {{does not}} provide {{protection}} against unexpected or dangerously high current (called spikes or surges) when current is in the usual wires in the circuit, therefore it cannot replace a fuse or protect against overheating or fire risk due to overcurrent (overload) or short circuits if the fault {{does not lead to}} current leakage. Therefore, RCDs are often used or integrated as a single product along with some kind of <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> such as a fuse or <b>miniature</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> (MCB), which adds protection in the event of excessive current in the circuit (the resulting RCD with overcurrent protection called an RCBO). RCDs also cannot detect the situation where a human accidentally touches both conductors at the same time, since the current through an expected device, an unexpected route, or a human, are indistinguishable if the current returns through the expected conductor.|$|R
