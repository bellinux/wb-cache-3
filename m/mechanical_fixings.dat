40|$|A brief {{overview}} of anchorage systems is dealt with introducing experimental tests on eight types of end fixing for reinforced polymers (FRP) sheets glued on RC elements. Particular test set-up and T-shaped specimens have been designed and realized to test <b>mechanical</b> <b>fixings</b> with steel or FRP plates glued or bolted, FRP bars or L-shaped fibers. The experimental results confirm that the various solutions have different performances in improving the debonding load. Numerical analysis confirm the reliability of debonding formulations available; furthermore a simple evaluation of anchorage effectiveness is proposed...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to see if on-site portable pull-out tests in South Africa on post-installed chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>fixings</b> can produce similar results to internationally laboratory tested fixings. The method used in the field study was to use typical South African 25 MPa, 75 mm slump ready mix concrete as supplied by a reputable supplier and to test several types of fixings in common situations, some covered in the European Technical Approval Guidelines (ETAG) and some not. The results were analyzed against published international values and theoretical calculations for the fixings. The findings showed that the results produced using the portable equipment can show values similar to the published and theoretical values. It was also shown that this methodology {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool to reveal installation errors. The pull-out test operator needs to be skilled to ensure a satisfactory outcome of the tests. The implications of the findings have direct bearing on: The on-site pullout testing of post installed anchors in South Africa; The diagnosing of bad anchor installation. And secondarily bearing on: The education of post-installed fixing installers and designers; The lack of standards for post-installed anchors in South Africa; The transportability of data from international research to South African conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} ETICS {{is covered}} by a {{specific}} indication of legislation: the ETAG 004 Guideline for Technical Approval of External Thermal Insulation – Composite Systems With Rendering, issued by EOTA European Organization for Technical Approvals; so all applications should include approved systems, with the ETA European Technical Approval marking, which raised from an Approval Body. From the design point of view, ETICS are differentiated according to the methods of fixing: bonded ETICS, bonded ETICS with supplementary <b>mechanical</b> <b>fixings,</b> mechanically fixed ETICS with supplementary adhesive, purely mechanically fixed ETICS. There are also different types of substrates (masonry walls [made from units of clay, concrete, calcium silicate, autoclaved aerated concrete or stone]; in situ or prefabricated concrete walls; wood structures. ETICS components are many and can {{be very different from}} one system to one other: basically are adhesive (dry mortar, powder requiring addition of extra binder, paste requiring addition of cement, ready-to-use paste), with more of less organic resin; insulation product (basically EPS, mineral wool, and wood wool, but also cork, XPS, PU); rendering system, made by reinforcement (glass fiber, or plastic mesh - standard or reinforced -, or metal lath, or dispersed fibers embedded or dispersed in render coating, formed by base coat, key coat; finishing coat and decorative/protective coat; mechanical fixing devices and ancillary materials and components, as window’s sills, corners, joint-covers, sealants, mastics and so on. Due to the complexity of the structure and number of performance required, in the case of emerging pathologies the checking for causes is very difficult. The paper shows a method for doing this, based on: the study of the influence of local conditions; the respected or not, from every layer and from the relationship between the layers, of the performances fixed by ETAG 004 and by other Specialized Body, as Groupe Spécialisé n° 7 of C. S. T. B.; or extracted by case studies observed by the authors or known in the literature...|$|E
40|$|In current practice, glass shear {{walls are}} {{frequently}} {{used to cover}} wide surfaces in facades. There, a multitude of restraints can be found, depending on specific aesthetic, architectural and structural requirements. Typical practical examples can in fact {{take the form of}} linear adhesive joints, metal frames or <b>mechanical</b> point <b>fixings,</b> etc. From a practical point of view, as a result, it is clear that compared to idealized boundary conditions the actual restraints should be properly taken into account. In this research paper, the shear buckling response of glass shear walls is assessed by means of Finite-Element (FE) simulations and analytical methods. The role of (i) linear adhesive joints, (ii) metal frames with interposed adhesive joints or (iii) point mechanical connectors on the theoretical buckling resistance of these panels is first assessed (e. g. in the form of fundamental buckling shapes and Euler’s critical loads). Analytical fitting curves of general applicability are proposed, so that classical formulations derived from shear buckling theories could be used. Subsequently, the actual shear buckling resistance is also assessed, e. g. by taking into account the effects of possible initial geometrical imperfections, damage in glass or in the adopted restraints. This goal is achieved by means of accurate but computationally efficient FE models able to reproduce (via mechanical connectors, surface-to-surface interactions, etc.) the desired mechanical effect of restraints, as well as any possible local damage in them. As shown, rather close agreement is found with a past normalized buckling curve in use for ideally simply supported glass shear walls. It is thus expected, in view of further investigations and full-scale experimental validation, that the current research outcomes could provide a useful theoretical background for the implementation of standardized buckling design methods...|$|R
40|$|Jüri Kermik {{was among}} 24 {{international}} designers who {{were invited to}} join Finnish furniture designers {{to contribute to the}} EcoDesign 2009 Exhibition in Helsinki. The project which had started in 2008 was coordinated through a staged submission of design statements, sketches and finished designs, culminating in the exhibition which was held in conjunction with the Habitare Furniture Fair, 9 – 14 September 2009. The exhibition, initiated and curated by Professor Yrjö Kukkapuro, showcased nearly 100 proposals for ecological chair designs including new work from Eero Aarnio, Simo Heikkila, Jasper Morrison, Kita Toshiyuki, Zhu Xiaojie, Shigeru Ban and Matteo Thun. Kermik contributed to the exhibition project with the Randwall (eco) Chair which was developed as a continuation of his earlier ‘Encounters’ project. The exhibition was accompanied by a catalogue featuring chair designs and their EcoAnalysis based on aspects of the design such as foresight, planning and design, materials, production process and the lifecycle of the product. There were more than sixty thousand visitors during the five days and positive feedback was received in international and national media. Randwall Chair is designed in the ‘shared space’ where contemporary industrial, digital and traditional methods co-exist. Developed as part of the ‘Encounters’ project it aims to trace invisible connections between Old and New by intentionally overlapping and cross-referencing methodologies, structural types and techniques which are/were inherent to a specific technological age. The structural type of the Randwall Chair evolved from a speculative attempt to ‘reconstruct’ a regional archetype which never existed. Randwall as a geological and linguistic reference point is used to connect it to the region of Sõrve peninsula, Saaremaa. First development models and prototypes of the Randwall Chair, which explored traditional carpenter techniques, were made from ash and birch sourced and seasoned in Sõrve. The narrative methodology of ‘dismantling’ and ‘reconstructing’ a chair has been used to test ways of engaging with sustainable practice at different levels of design and production. The construction and detailing of the Randwall (eco) Chair supports the idea of inter changeability of materials and production techniques, both Old and New. Regional wood can be used in combination with components cut and formed from industrially manufactured board materials such as plywood, engineered wood and recycled plastics. No glue joints are involved in the process of assembly. Traditional joints are modified to interlock key structural parts and the whole chair is fastened with eight <b>mechanical</b> <b>fixings...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} within the project DuraTB - Durable Timber Bridges. The {{goal of the}} project is to develop sustainable timber bridges by developing guidelines for moisture design and developing new and improved bridges and bridge details. This report describes the results from a subproject with the participation of SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden, Martinsons Byggsystem AB, Moelven Töreboda AB and the Swedish Transport Administration. Also waterproofing contractors and entrepreneurs participated in the work. The purpose of the subproject was to investigate primers and waterproofing and to improve the edge details of Swedish timber bridges with stresslaminated decks made of spruce. This report contains a summary of follow-up of blistering on wooden decks, tests of bitumen primers with regard to adhesion and water resistance and tests of new edge solutions for wooden bridges. A review of inspection results {{from more than one}} hundred inspected Swedish timber bridges with asphalt pavement on stress-laminated decks showed that about 30 % had some remarks about the pavement. The most common damages were cracks especially at deck ends in connection to abutments. Bridges with blisters at the time of inspection were few. Laboratory tests of adhesion were carried out which showed that the primer can contribute to the adhesion of the waterproofing bitumen sheet to the wood, although both tensile and tear tests gave large variations in the results so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. The tests showed that both water-based and solvent-based primer can be used. Timber bridge manufacturers want to use the more environmentally friendly waterbased primer in the factory and the more weather resistant and quick drying solvent-based at the building site. The tests showed, however, also some adhesion of waterproofing sheets to a wood surface without primer, even to a damp or dirty surface. Testing of water resistance of primer on wood surfaces showed that the primer provides some moisture protection which is favorable for the wood. The penetration of moisture was less than for untreated wood, but the primer was not completely waterproof. An untreated moist wood surface, however, dried out relatively quickly. At the testing of edge details with installations of edge steel angels on wooden deck specimens, the steel angels showed a tendency to deform under the effect of heat from welding of the waterproofing bitumen sheet. To get a robust solution with little deformation also <b>mechanical</b> <b>fixings</b> to the wood deck was tested and is recommended. Several parties are involved in the construction process, so {{there is a need for}} detailed descriptions for the work. This subproject has contributed to some new sections in the Swedish AMA (General material and work descriptions) used by the construction industry, to improve the information about timber bridges and assist the construction of durable timber bridges.  DuraTB - Durable Timber Bridge...|$|E
