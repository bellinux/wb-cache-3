40|$|Abstract — Ground borne {{vibration}} {{in buildings}} due to railway traffic {{is a major}} concern in densely built up areas. In practice, railway induced vibration is often predicted by means of empirical methods such as the Detailed Vibration Assessment developed by the U. S. Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). The vibration velocity level in the free field is predicted based on a separate characterization of the source and the wave propagation. They are characterized by a force density and a line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility,</b> respectively. The line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> represents the energy transmitted through the soil due to a line source, such as a train on a track. The force density represents the power per unit length introduced into the soil by the source. While the force density is determined indirectly by subtracting the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> from the vibration velocity due to a train passage, the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> is determined directly based on wave propagation tests. In this paper, the determination of the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> is investigated experimentally and numerically. The line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> depends on the dynamic track and soil characteristics, but is also influenced by the experimental setup used during the measurement. The location of the impact points, on the track or the soil, as well as the number of impact points and their spacing have an influence on the determination of the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility.</b> First, the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> is investigated experimentally. Results are obtained from a measurement campaign where transfer functions from the track to the free field have been measured for several impact points. Second, a numerical prediction model is used to simulate the transfer functions from the track to the free field and predict the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> numerically...|$|R

40|$|Vibrations {{induced by}} the passage of trains are a major {{environmental}} concern in urban areas. In practice, vibrations are often predicted using empirical methods such as the detailed vibration assessment procedure of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) of the U. S. Department of Transportation. This procedure allows predicting ground surface vibrations and re-radiated noise in buildings. Ground vibrations are calculated based on force densities, measured when a vehicle is running over a track, and line source <b>transfer</b> <b>mobilities,</b> measured on site {{to account for the}} effect of the local geology on wave propagation. Compared to parametric models, the advantage of this approach is that it inherently takes into account all important parameters. It can only be used, however, when an appropriate estimation of the force density is available. In this paper, analytical expressions are derived for the force density and the line source <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> of the FRA procedure. The derivation of these expressions is verified using a coupled finite element-boundary element method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine those {{occupational}} accidents at construction sites that are related to materials handling as compared with all reportable occupational accidents at construction sites. The main concern is to define the kinds of accidents that occur in materials handling. The data were gathered from two sources: a large Finnish construction company and the database of reports of serious occupational accidents (Sammio). One third of all the reported accidents in the studied construction company occurred during materials transfer and 36 % of the absenteeism days resulted from these accidents. Materials handling thus caused more serious accidents than other work activities (t = - 2. 44, df = 351, p < 0. 005). Minor accidents were mostly due to over-exertion whereas serious accidents were mostly falling from a height and injuries caused by falling and collapsing objects. The manual transfer of materials caused most of the materials transfer accidents in the company and <b>mechanical</b> <b>transfer</b> most of the serious materials handling accidents. Over-exertion can, therefore, be decreased by reducing manual materials handling. On the other hand, replacing manual <b>transfers</b> with <b>mechanical</b> <b>transfers</b> means that there arises a risk of serious accidents.

40|$|We {{show that}} sharp nonmonotic {{variation}} of low temperature electron mobility μ {{can be achieved}} in GaAs/AlxGa 1 -xAs barrier delta-doped double quantum well structure due to quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>transfer</b> of subband electron wave functions within the wells. We vary the potential profile of the coupled structure {{as a function of}} the doping concentration in order to bring the subbands into resonance such that the subband energy levels anticross and the eigen states of the coupled structure equally share both the wells thereby giving rise to a dip in mobility. When the wells are of equal widths, the dip in mobility occurs under symmetric doping of the side barriers. In case of unequal well widths, the resonance can be obtained by suitable asymmetric variation of the doping concentrations. The dip in mobility becomes sharp and also the wavy nature of mobility takes a rectangular shape by increasing the barrier width. We show that the dip in mobility at resonance is governed by the interface roughness scattering through step like changes in the subband mobilities. It is also gratifying to show that the drop in mobility at the onset of occupation of second subband is substantially supressed through the quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>transfer</b> of subband wave functions between the wells. Our results can be utilized for performance enhancement of coupled quantum well devices...|$|R

40|$|The {{health care}} {{industry}} is under siege with muscular skeletal disorders (MSD), {{the vast majority of}} which are directly related to the manual repetitive transfer or repositioning of residents/patients from one position to another. Two purposive sample groups were selected from over 200 nursing home facilities and identified as the “high” injury rate sample group and the “low” injury rate sample group. The research study used a mixed method analysis with a causal-comparative methodology for examining the differences between the sample groups. The first research question explored: Did skilled nursing facilities with a high injury rate compare to low injury rate facilities on the number of <b>mechanical</b> <b>transfer</b> devices? The data analysis indicated that contrary to accept ed theory, there was a demonstrated inverse relationship between injury rate and number of lifts available for use by caregivers. The second question explored: Did the low injury rate sample group differ significantly from the high injury rate sample group when comparing them on the following variables: transfer training, morale, age, turnover, TIPS safety score, and individual efficacy? The data analysis of the six variables indicated that four of the six variables revealed {{a significant difference between the}} two sample groups. The third question analyzed: Did caregivers (LPN, RN, and nurses’ aides) compare proportionally between subgroup resident injury rates? The data analysis indicated a confounding of the job subgroup variables due to company staffing policies and the lack of definitive tracking requirements between licensed caregivers (LPN and RN) job exposures. The final research question examined: Did nursing facilities with a high transfer injury rate compare with nursing facilities with a low transfer injury rate on caregiver dignity concerns for utilizing <b>mechanical</b> <b>transfer</b> equipment? The qualitative analysis using comparative cataloging techniques indicated the high injury rate sample group expressed proportionally more caregiver dignity concerns about mechanically transferring residents. The research highlighted the complexity of issues that need to be addressed for solving the resident transfer injuries experienced by nursing facility caregivers. Therefore, the key to reducing these caregiver injuries is far more complex than just simply having additional <b>mechanical</b> <b>transfer</b> devices available for use...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To trial four-week's {{physiotherapy}} targeting chair transfers {{for people}} with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) and explore the feasibility of reliance on remote outcome measurement to preserve blinding. Scope. We recruited 47 PwPD and randomised 24 to a focused home physiotherapy programme (exercise, movement strategies, and cueing) and 23 to a control group. We evaluated <b>transfers</b> (plus <b>mobility,</b> balance, posture, and quality of life) before and after treatment and at followup (weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12) from video produced by, and questionnaires distributed by, treating physiotherapists. Participants fed back via end-of-study questionnaires. Thirty-five participants (74 %) completed the trial. Excluding dropouts, 20 % of questionnaire data and 9 % of video data were missing or unusable; we had to evaluate balance in situ. We noted trends to improvement in <b>transfers,</b> <b>mobility,</b> and balance in the physiotherapy group not noted in the control group. Participant feedback was largely positive and assessor blinding was maintained in every case. Conclusions. Intense, focused physiotherapy at home appears acceptable and likely to bring positive change in those who can participate. Remote outcome measurement was successful; questionnaire followup and further training in video production would reduce missing data.
