30|$|In this section, an {{efficient}} resource allocation algorithm is presented and {{is defined as}} Algorithm  1. The essence of the proposed algorithm is to ensure fairness in EH-DL <b>timing</b> <b>schedules</b> among the system sensor nodes. In addition, it is aimed to achieve an enhanced rate of information transfer among the network sensor nodes in the UL. To achieve this, the proposed algorithm optimizes the energy and information transfer <b>timing</b> <b>schedules</b> in a joint fashion, according to the mathematical models presented in Section 3 such that optimal time periods are allocated for both EH and information transmission to classes A and B in the network. As a consequence, Algorithm  1 optimally allots an IPS c to individual sensor nodes at a calculated optimal time period. In a similar vein, {{to make sure that}} the sensors in the network are provided with sufficient time for communications in the UL phase, an optimal information transmission time period is calculated and allotted. The implementation of the algorithm is done on the system controller to achieve the optimal control of the switching of the IPS and optimally allocating them to the sensors for enhancing the attainable throughput of the WPSN system.|$|R

The controllers use vehicle detectors in order to detect the number of incoming vehicles. Based on the number of approaching vehicles, the current signal phase is either extended or terminated.
