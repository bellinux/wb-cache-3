40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{training}} neural networks {{when we have a}} large set of data with weak labels and a small amount of data with true labels. In our proposed model, we train two neural networks: a target network, the learner and a confidence network, the meta-learner. The target network is optimized to perform a given task and is trained using a large set of unlabeled data that are weakly annotated. We propose to control the magnitude of the gradient updates to the target network using the scores provided by the second confidence network, which is trained on a small amount of supervised data. Thus we avoid that the weight updates computed from noisy labels harm the quality of the target network model.

40|$|Although {{there are}} a number of studies on English writing skills, the {{relation}} among <b>metalearning,</b> cognitive holding power and writing skills is not well understood. Thus, this study investigated the relation among <b>metalearning</b> capacity (high versus low) and cognitive holding power (CHP; first-order versus second-order) in explaining the English Language writing skills of Egyptian pre-service teachers. We constructed and validated new measures of <b>metalearning</b> and English writing skills, and adapted an existing measure of CHP for use with our Egyptian sample. Participants with high <b>metalearning</b> capacity demonstrated better writing skills than those with low <b>metalearning</b> capacity. In addition, participants with second-order CHP exhibited better writing skills than those with first-order CHP. The two factors made independent contributions (i. e., did not interact) because, we argue that <b>metalearning</b> operates at the level of the individual learner whereas CHP is an attribute of the larger instructional environment (as orchestrated by the teacher). These findings generalize and extend our current understanding of the role of <b>metalearning</b> and CHP in developing writing skills to a new population, and establish the utility of newly developed and adapted instruments and adapted instruments.

40|$|This study operationalises the {{empowering}} {{concept of}} <b>metalearning</b> {{in the specific}} context of engagement with a threshold concept. An experience of <b>metalearning</b> was constituted in two parts. First students’ awareness of themselves as learners is prompted by, and focuses on, a learning profile that is generated online through the completion of the Reflections on Learning Inventory (RoLI). Second, students are given an opportunity to interpret their respective profiles and write a short and undirected reflective account of their interpretation. The second part of the experience focuses not only on students’ awareness but also on their capacity to control their future learning {{on the basis of their}} heightened awareness. An initial <b>metalearning</b> experience was provided early in a microeconomics module encouraging students to reflect on their learning in the context of their prior learning of microeconomics. A second <b>metalearning</b> experience was provided later in the module when the RoLI response context was shifted specifically to the learning of the threshold concept in question. This <b>metalearning</b> experience intervention yielded matched sets of quantitative data (the RoLI responses used to generate the learning profiles) and qualitative data (the reflective accounts based on the interpretation of the learning profiles). Data analysed here emanate from a research project involving three UK universities, two of which are represented in the present study with one foregrounded in terms of a relatively large sample of c. 300 participating students. The findings indicate that a <b>metalearning</b> experience can be successfully constituted and encapsulated within the learning of a threshold concept for a majority of students.

The contributors to the symposium are all practitioner teachers engaged in the scholarship and research of teaching and learning in their own disciplinary fields and institutional contexts.

40|$|Abstract—A typical {{approach}} in supervised learning is to select an accuracy measure and train a predictor that maximizes it. This can be insufficient in remote-sensing applications where predictor performance is often evaluated over multiple domain-specific accuracy measures. Here, we test {{the hypothesis that}} predictors can be trained to maximize performance over multiple accuracy measures. To do this, we evaluate several <b>metalearning</b> algorithms {{on the problem of}} aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval. The multiple accuracy measures included mean squared error, correlation, relative squared error, and fraction of satisfactory predictions. The proposed <b>metalearning</b> algorithms have a two-layer architecture, where the first layer consists of multiple neural networks, each trained using a different accuracy measure, and the second layer aggregates decisions of the first layer predictors. To evaluate AOD predictors, we used nearly 70 000 collocated data points whose attributes were radiances, solar and view angles, and terrain elevation from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instrument satellite observations and whose target AOD variable was obtained from the ground-based AEROsol robotic NETwork (AERONET) instruments. The data were collected at 221 AERONET locations over the globe in the period between 2005 and 2007. AOD prediction accuracies of neural networks were compared to the recently developed operational MODIS C 005 retrieval algorithm and to several other data-mining methods. Results showed that neural networks are better at reproducing the test data than the operational retrieval algorithm and that predictors obtained by <b>metalearning</b> are robust over multiple accuracy measures.

40|$|This paper reports my {{personal}} {{reflection on the}} development and application of a <b>metalearning</b> program for a class of 10 th grade (age: 15 – 16 years) students. Despite new government curriculum guidelines for senior high schools emphasizing critical thinking, creativity, reflection, and self-management by students, EFL teaching in Taiwan remains exam-oriented. Learning typically involves mechanical practice to memorize subject content and prescriptive, teacher-determined answers that are viewed as the only “standard” answers. Inspired by the alternative to passive-receptive learning and direct instruction presented by the concept of <b>metalearning</b> proposed by Biggs (1985), I developed a study program that promotes <b>metalearning</b> capacity. The aim was to equip students to cope with difficult and demanding learning situations and develop their academic independence. <b>Metalearning</b> involves students being aware of themselves as learners and supervising their learning strategy and progress. I assigned reflection activities such as discussions and journaling to aid the students in developing a habit of learning through examining their own and others’ experiences. Students were encouraged to reflect on problem-solving and decision-making and to develop insight and control regarding the learning process. I used the action research methodology for the study design and applied a theoretical framework that was structured around the three axes of experience, reflection, and interaction. The recommendations {{of this study are}} that teachers should participate in individual and collective reflection, adopt a more humane approach to student interaction, express authentic feelings, and engage in dialogue.

In this paper, we give an overview of our general approach and then present an instantiation in a specific auction scenario. In addition, we show how predictions of possible bidder behavior can be incorporated into the adaptive mechanism through a <b>metalearning</b> process. The approach is fully implemented and tested. Results indicate that the adaptive mechanism is able to outperform any single fixed mechanism, and that the addition of <b>metalearning</b> improves performance substantially...|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} thought that {{learning}} algorithms that track the best solution, {{as opposed to}} converging to it, are important only on nonstationary problems.

Second, we show the same point on a larger, more realistic problem, an application of temporaldifference learning to computer Go. Our third result suggests that tracking in stationary problems could be important for <b>metalearning</b> research (e. g., learning to learn, feature selection, transfer). We apply a <b>metalearning</b> algorithm for step-size adaptation, IDBD (Sutton, 1992 a), to the Black and White problem, showing that meta-learning has a dramatic long-term effect on performance whereas, on an analogous converging problem, meta-learning has only a small second-order effect.

40|$|Abstract. Work on <b>metalearning</b> for {{algorithm}} selection {{has often}} been criticized because it mostly considers only the default param-eter settings of the candidate base learning algorithms. Many have indeed argued that the choice of parameter values can have a signif-icant impact on accuracy. Yet little empirical evidence exists to pro-vide definitive support for that argument. Recent experiments do sug-gest that parameter optimization may indeed have an impact. How-ever, the distribution of performance differences has a long tail, sug-gesting that in most cases parameter optimization has little effect on accuracy. In this paper, we revisit some of these results and use met-alearning to characterize the situations when parameter optimization is likely to cause {{a significant increase in}} accuracy. In so doing, we show that 1) a relatively simple and efficient landmarker carries sig-nificant predictive power, and 2) <b>metalearning</b> for algorithm selection should be effected in two phases, the first in which one determines whether parameter optimization is likely to increase accuracy, and the second in which algorithm selection actually takes place. ...|$|E
