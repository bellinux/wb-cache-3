Weak exoelectron activity was found scattered inhomogeneously within a pigeonite basalt rock and in a deep core tube sample. Its erratic appearance and intensity makes any interpretation of radiation history most difficult and is attributed to the activity being carried by only a few scattered crystals. The thermally stimulated emission of exoelectrons is judged an unsuitable technique for tracing the radiation histories of these samples...|$|R

A non-randomized transversal investigation, molecular and serum epidemiologic type, on the occurrence of ACL in 169 HIV-infected patients was undertaken. The patients were followed up at the Integrated Nucleus of Health of the city Maringá, Southern of Brazil.

Above findings may be attributed to anti-retrovirus medicine that controls viral replication and maintains the functionality of the immune system and to a possible anti- Leishmania activity of these drugs.

Thus starch extraction industry plays a significant part in changing potato from a vegetable into a member of main food crops including rice, wheat and maize.

This review focus on analysis and comparing of efficiency, technical requirements, economic and environmental effect of current recycle technologies for waste residue in potato processing, including bio-gas production, protein feed production and extraction of pectin and dietary fiber. Which shows that bio-gas production may have the most brilliant prospect in this field. Further research may be established in industrialization of this bio-gas producing technology, which may also contribute to future mixed culture fermentation technology, an effective way for growing energy crisis. While the other and most ideal solution lies in cleaner production: fully using of potato in food production and no waste residue will be generated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>results</b> are {{not popular}} to disseminate. However, their {{publication}} {{would help to}} save resources and foster scientific communication. This study analysed the bibliometric and semantic nature of <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> publications. The Journal of <b>Negative</b> <b>Results</b> in Biomedicine (JNRBM) {{was used as a}} role model. Its complete articles from 2002 - 2009 were extracted from SCOPUS and supplemented by related records. Complementary <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> records were retrieved from Web of Science in “Biochemistry” and “Telecommunications”. Applied bibliometrics comprised of co-author and co-affiliation analysis and a citation impact profile. Bibliometrics showed that authorship is widely spread. A specific community for the publication of <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> in devoted literature is non-existent. Neither co-author nor co-affiliation analysis indicated strong interconnectivities. JNRBM articles are cited by a broad spectrum of journals rather than by specific titles. Devoted <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> journals like JNRBM have a rather low impact measured by the number of received citations. On the other hand, only one third of the publications remain uncited, corroborating their importance for the scientific community. The semantic analysis relies on negative expressions manually identified in JNRBM article titles and abstracts and extracted to syntactic patterns. By using a Natural Language Processing tool these patterns are then employed to detect their occurrences in the multidisciplinary bibliographical database PASCAL. The translation of manually identified negation patterns to syntactic patterns and their application to multidisciplinary bibliographic databases (PASCAL, Web of Science) proved to be a successful method to retrieve even hidden <b>negative</b> <b>results.</b> There is proof that <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> are not only restricted to the biomedical domain.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> {{arising from}} the use of a commercial kit to detect antibody to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 between July 1995 and March 1996. DESIGN: The 56 laboratories in the United Kingdom that were using the assay were asked to retrieve and retest specimens with an alternative assay for HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. Details of false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> were obtained and these serum samples further investigated. SUBJECTS: 24, 181 patients tested with the assay who were reported as being negative for HIV antibody. An additional 497 patients were confirmed as HIV positive with the assay. RESULTS: Serum samples of 20, 973 of the patients were retested, and four patients were found to have had false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> with the kit; three further patients were found to have had false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> in the course of other laboratory testing. The seven patients with false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> with the kit were of diverse risk group and HIV- 1 subtype. Four had evidence of recent HIV infection.

Sensitivity was calculated as the number of true positive results divided by the number of true positive results plus the number of false <b>negative</b> <b>results.</b> Specificity was calculated as the number of true <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> divided by the number of true <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> plus the number of false positive results.

A true <b>negative</b> <b>result</b> was recorded when the M.I.N.I. module and the DSM- 5 both detected the absence of a symptom ('no/no’).
