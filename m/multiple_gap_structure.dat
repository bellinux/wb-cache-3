40|$|Local superconducting gap {{structure}} is studied {{as a function}} of nanoscale depth in electric-field-induced surface superconductivity such as in SrTiO 3. We examine solutions of Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation in two limiting confinement potential cases of electric field with and without screening effects. As unique properties different from bulk superconductivity, there appear in-gap states even for isotropic s-wave pairing, due to <b>multiple</b> <b>gap</b> <b>structure</b> of sub-band dependent surface superconductivity. These determine the depth-dependence of local superconductivity. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|We re-process the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) long-baseline science {{verification}} data taken toward HL Tauri. As {{shown by}} the previous work, we confirm that the high spatial resolution (0. " 019, corresponding to 2. 7 AU) dust continuum images at λ = 0. 87, 1. 3, and 2. 9 mm exhibit a <b>multiple</b> ring-like <b>gap</b> <b>structure</b> in the circumstellar disk. Assuming that the observed gaps are opened up by currently forming, unseen bodies, we estimate the mass of such hypothetical bodies based on following two approaches; the Hill radius analysis and a more elaborated approach developed from the angular momentum transfer analysis in gas disks. For the former, the measured gap widths are used for calibrating {{the mass of the}} bodies, while for the latter, the measured gap depths are utilized. We show that their masses are likely comparable to or less than the mass of Jovian planets, and then discuss an origin of the observed <b>gap</b> <b>structure.</b> By evaluating Toomre's gravitational instability (GI) condition and cooling effect, we find that the GI might be a possible mechanism to form the bodies in the outer region of the disk. As the disk might be gravitationally unstable only in the outer region of the disk, inward planetary migration would be needed to construct the current architecture of the hypothetical bodies. We estimate the gap-opening mass and show that type II migration might be able to play such a role. Combining GIs with inward migration, we conjecture that all of the observed gaps may be a consequence of bodies that might have originally formed at the outer part of the disk, and have subsequently migrated to the current locations. While ALMA's unprecedented high spatial resolution observations can revolutionize our picture of planet formation, more dedicated observational and theoretical studies are needed in order to fully understand the HL Tau images.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the reflectivity of the optimally doped Ca_ 8. 5 La_ 1. 5 (Pt_ 3 As_ 8) (Fe_ 10 As_ 10) single crystal (T_c = 32. 8 K) over the broad frequency range from 40 to 12000 cm^- 1 and for temperatures from 8 to 300 K. The optical conductivity spectra {{of the low}} frequency region (< 1, 000 cm^- 1) in the normal state (80 K < T ≤ 300 K) is well fitted with two Drude forms, which indicates the presence of multiple bands at the Fermi level. Decreasing temperature below 80 K, this low frequency Drude spectra develops pseudogap (PG) hump structure at around ≈ 100 cm^- 1 and continuously evolves into the fully opened superconducting (SC) <b>gap</b> <b>structure</b> below T_c. Theoretical calculations of the optical conductivity with the preformed Cooper pair model provide an excellent description of the temperature evolution of the PG structure above T_c into the SC <b>gap</b> <b>structure</b> below T_c. The extracted two SC gap sizes are Δ_S = 4. 9 meV and Δ_L = 14. 2 meV, suggesting Ca_ 8. 5 La_ 1. 5 (Pt_ 3 As_ 8) (Fe_ 10 As_ 10) as a <b>multiple</b> <b>gap</b> superconductor with a mixed character of the weak coupling and strong coupling superconductivity.

40|$|Precise <b>gap</b> <b>structure</b> in LiFeAs (Tc = 18 K) {{given by}} ARPES studies offers us {{significant}} information {{to understand the}} pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors. The most remarkable characteristics in LiFeAs <b>gap</b> <b>structure</b> would be that "the largest gap emerges on the tiny hole-pockets around Z point". This result had been naturally {{explained in terms of}} the orbital-fluctuation scenario (T. Saito et al., Phys. Rev.

In this paper, we study the <b>gap</b> <b>structure</b> in LiFeAs by taking the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) into account, motivated by the recent ARPES studies that revealed the significant SOI-induced modification of the Fermi surface topology. For this purpose, we construct the two possible tight-binding models with finite SOI by referring the bandstructures given by different ARPES groups. In addition, we extend the gap equation for multiorbital systems with finite SOI, and calculate the gap functions by applying the orbital-spin fluctuation theory. On the basis of both SOI-induced band structures, main characteristics of the <b>gap</b> <b>structure</b> in LiFeAs are naturally reproduced only in the presence of strong inter-orbital interactions between (xz/yz - xy) orbitals. Thus, the experimental <b>gap</b> <b>structure</b> in LiFeAs is a strong evidence for the orbital-fluctuation pairing mechanism. Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures. Appendix B was added.
