40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of today’s microcontrollers {{is supported by}} the extensive usage of low-power mechanisms. A full power-down requires in many cases a complex, and maybe error prone, administration scheme, because data from the volatile memory have to be stored in a flash based back- up memory. New types of non-volatile memory, e. g. in RRAM technology, are faster and consumes a fraction of the energy compared to flash technology.

50|$|DRAM-based SSDs usually {{incorporate}} {{either an}} internal battery or an external AC/DC adapter and backup storage systems to ensure data persistence while no power is being supplied to the drive from external sources. If power is lost, the battery provides power while all information is copied from random access <b>memory</b> (RAM) to <b>back-up</b> storage. When {{the power is}} restored, the information is copied back to the RAM from the back-up storage, and the SSD resumes normal operation (similar to the hibernate function used in modern operating systems).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} automatic file migration. In a computer system, program and data files are stored on secondary memory such as discs. If {{the capacity of the}} secondary memory is not sufficient to hold all the files, some sort of <b>back-up</b> <b>memory</b> (e. g. magnetic tape) is used to supplement secondary storage. The transfer of files between secondary and back-up storage is refered to here as "migration. " Migration may be done explicitly by each user or automatically by the operating system. This work studies automatic migration strategies. We seek the migration strategy which maximizes the probability that a file that is accessed will be found in secondary memory and which minimizes the migration activity. The problem of deciding. which files should m 1 grate, the file replacement problem, is analogous to the well-studied page replacement problem. It reduces to the problem of predicting the next inter-access interval for a file. An importan...|$|R
40|$|Supercapacitors are {{characteristic}} of fast charging-discharging, high power density and long cycle lifetime. They are finding increasing applications in hybrid vehicles, large <b>memory</b> <b>back-up</b> devices and renewable-energy power plants. The material {{and structure of the}} electrode {{is the key to the}} supercapacitor performance including the power density, the energy density, the rate capability, the charging time and the cyclic stability. Carbon materials as supercapacitor electrodes show high rate capability and excellent long-term cyclic stability. In contrast, metal oxides have high specific capacitance but low rate capability and poor cyclic stability. One effective route to achieve high-performance supercapacitor electrode is to incorporate carbo...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe supercapacitors (SCs), {{also called}} ultracapacitors or {{electrochemical}} capacitors, are devices {{with a very}} high specific power and high capacitance, available {{for a long period}} of time with negligible deterioration, that have been historically proposed in small applications (<b>memory</b> <b>back-up</b> in consumer electronics, storage systems for micro solar power generators) and now are proposed for high power/energy applications, such as hybrid and electric vehicles, power quality systems and smart grids. The advancements in new materials and the rapid growth of more demanding storage systems in a variety of applications have created a lack of universally accepted definitions of these devices and, consequently, a real difficulty in describing developments and progress in the SC field. This paper contains a brief survey of the history of the SC development, which is strongly related to the evolution of the SCV technologies, which are tentatively classified in symmetric, asymmetric and hybrid. A short presentation of key parameters has been given to introduce the description of new applications with large SC devices, covering transport, industrial and electric utility sectors, with some reflections about the foreseen impacts on the future market more than quadrupled in 5 years up to almost $ 877 million worldwide...|$|E

50|$|A major {{limitation}} {{with the}} NES cartridges was {{the inability to}} save directly on the cartridge. The cartridges contain RAM, which are easily writable but lose all stored memory {{as soon as the}} power is turned off. Takeda is credited for his team’s development of the battery <b>back-up</b> <b>memory,</b> which was first used in the North American and European versions of Shigeru Miyamoto’s The Legend of Zelda. It supplies a long-life power source to the RAM chip, maintaining the saved data even when the main power supply is cut or the cartridge is removed. Takeda is also credited with the invention of the Analog controller for the Nintendo 64 system, a style which has since been copied by Microsoft and Sony for their respective systems. Takeda’s R&D3 team was renamed Integrated Research and Development in 2000. In that same year, they worked with Conexant to create broadband and modem peripherals for the Nintendo GameCube. Takeda was promoted in 2002 to Senior Management Director, while still maintaining his position as General Manager.|$|R
5000|$|Combat in Breath of Fire II is {{presented}} using a turn-based approach, where the player inputs commands for each character {{at the start}} of each round with the actions taking place by order of each character's and enemy's [...] "agility" [...] rating. A new Formation feature allows the player to organize their party into different positions, allowing certain members an increase in speed, defense, or attack power. Players win battles by defeating every enemy present, dealing damage by using normal attacks along with magic spells and items. When all enemies are defeated, they yield experience points that go toward leveling up characters, making them stronger and giving them access to new spells. Each Characters' health is represented by numerical hit points that indicate their remaining vitality, and are knocked out if the value reaches zero, with the battle ending if each member of a player's party is knocked out. Progress is recorded using the game cartridge's internal battery <b>back-up</b> <b>memory,</b> which can be accessed at dragon statues throughout gameplay.|$|R
5000|$|Warwolf {{was created}} by Billy Hansen and others at Cybertek Systems Inc. (a cybernetic {{research}} division of Roxxon Energy Corporation) as a hunter assassination cyborg which occurred before the creation of Deathlok. Billy Hansen and his colleagues placed a gray wolf brain into the cyborg body. From his imprisonment, Harlan Ryker remotely activated it {{and sent it to}} attack all his former superiors who might testify against him for the creation of Deathlok. Billy Hansen was the first person Warwolf attacked and killed him upon shattering his car. Then it broke into the National Security Agency facility where it destroyed all records that were pertaining to Harlan Ryker's investigation. Upon traveling to Cybertek's main facility in Paterson, New Jersey where Deathlok was meeting with Jim Dworman. Deathlok discovered that Warwolf had the brain of a gray wolf and made certain that its systems were on non-lethal mode. After Deathlok was unable to stop Warwolf from destroying the computerized files, Warwolf escaped where it moved faster than Deathlok. When Deathlok infiltrated the Danbury Maximum Security Federal Penitentiary to confront Harlan Ryker, Warwolf also showed up and targeted Cybertek's account manager John Rozum. Deathlok managed to prevent Warwolf from attacking John Rozum. Deathlok used his energy pistol to incapacitate Warwolf. Deathlok rescinded the [...] "no killing" [...] parameter and put Warwolf out of its misery since it was undergoing a system failure and that its organic components would fail in 6 hours. There was enough <b>back-up</b> <b>memory</b> that Dworman was able to call up Harlan Ryker's kill orders.|$|R
