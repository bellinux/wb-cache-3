5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is closely related}} to the water pipit and the <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit,</b> and is rather similar in appearance. Compared to the <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit,</b> the Eurasian rock pipit is darker, larger and longer-winged than its relative, and has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong {{supercilium}} and greyer upperparts; it is also typically much warier. The Eurasian rock pipit's dusky, rather than white, outer tail feathers are also a distinction from all its relatives. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a {{sequence}} of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The shrill pseep flight call is intermediate between the soft sip sip sip of the <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> and the water pipit's short, thin fist.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is closely related}} to the Eurasian rock pipit and the <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit,</b> and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to the <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit,</b> the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also {{typically}} much warier. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.|$|E
50|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} seen flying along the cliffs. Some stonechats and <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits</b> gather on the <b>meadow,</b> while rock <b>pipits</b> move along {{the base of the}} cliffs. House martins make mud nests under the {{overhangs}} of the chalk cliffs.|$|R

40|$|Capsule Foraging {{sites with}} low {{vegetation}} height and density, but with high arthropod biomass, are selected. Aims To test {{the hypothesis that}} on intensively grazed moorland, breeding <b>Meadow</b> <b>Pipits</b> forage for nestling food where arthropod prey are most readily available, and therefore that foraging site choice {{is a function of}} prey abundance and vegetation structure. Methods Observations of adults provisioning nestlings were made from hides positioned close to 19 nests within grazed, 3. 3 -hectare experimental plots at Glen Finglas, Scotland. Vegetation height and density and arthropod abundance from mapped foraging sites were compared with control sites. Prey items fed to nestlings were quantified and compared with their relative abundance. Results <b>Meadow</b> <b>Pipits</b> selected foraging sites with significantly lower vegetation height and density, but with significantly higher arthropod biomass. Our data suggest that within foraging sites, <b>Meadow</b> <b>Pipits</b> select particular prey types to provision nestlings, in particular, Lepidoptera larvae, adult Tipulidae and Arachnida. Conclusions In intensively grazed upland systems, it appears that <b>Meadow</b> <b>Pipits</b> select foraging sites that optimize total food abundance and accessibility. In order to understand how anticipated changes to livestock farming in Europe will affect grassland birds, we recommend that future studies should investigate the foraging and vigilance behaviour, diet composition and breeding success of a variety of bird species provisioning nestlings under a range of livestock management scenarios...|$|R
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E
5|$|In autumn and winter, the {{extensive}} flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports {{a large number}} of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The most obvious of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the coot, moorhen and little grebe (or dabchick). The kingfisher is widespread as are the <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in Ireland including lapwing, redshank, sandpiper and godwit.|$|E
5|$|As an {{isolated}} island on major migration routes, Lundy has a rich bird life {{and is a}} popular site for birdwatching. Large numbers of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) nest on the cliffs, as do razorbill (Alca torda), guillemot (Uria aalge), herring gull (Larus argentatus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus pratensis), common blackbird (Turdus merula), robin (Erithacus rubecula) and linnet (Carduelis cannabina). There are also smaller populations of peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and raven (Corvus corax).|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} flower meadows, woodland, ponds, and is {{adjacent}} to the River Cam and Byron's Pool, where Lord Byron once swam. Fauna include otters, brown hares, muntjac deer, skylarks, lapwings, yellowhammers and <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits.</b>|$|R
50|$|James Fisher and Julian Huxley were {{credited}} as ornithological advisers for the film. Nevertheless, Eric Hosking's {{footage of}} the pipits was actually of <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits</b> {{because he could not}} get genuine tawny pipits from German-occupied Europe.|$|R
50|$|The site {{lies between}} two tidal creeks which {{run into the}} River Crouch. It has {{saltmarsh}} and rough grassland with an unusual transition zone between them. Birds include reed buntings, yellow wagtails and <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits,</b> and there are common lizards and slowworms.|$|R
5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. The trailhead comprises a map board, beside which is a low wall with a stone stile through which walkers pass in order to make their first step on the trail. The Way traverses the park, following a wooded shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of the Way is underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending from a broad ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince William’s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between blanket bog and upland heath. The trail descends {{to the floor of the}} Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E

25|$|Few animals live {{in these}} areas; birds, mostly, {{such as the}} willow warbler, the <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit,</b> the {{northern}} wheatear, and these rarer ones: the European golden plover, the Eurasian dotterel, the snow bunting, and the Lapland longspur. The willow ptarmigan is relatively common, whereas the rock ptarmigan is found only on the highest peaks. For many of these species, Fulufjället is the southernmost part of their range in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|Slemish {{is within}} an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and, therefore, helps {{to protect and}} manage the fragile animal and plant {{communities}} that inhabit its slopes. An ideal location for bird watchers, large black ravens, buzzards, wheatears and <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits</b> can be seen regularly.|$|R
50|$|The {{plot of the}} 1944 film Tawny Pipit {{is about}} the rare event {{of a pair of}} tawny pipits {{breeding}} in England. Eric Hosking's footage of the pipits was actually of <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits</b> because he could not get genuine tawny pipits from German-occupied Europe.|$|R
50|$|Viviparous lizards, stoats, polecats, {{rabbits and}} voles {{can be found}} in the dunes. Skylarks, <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits</b> and ringed plovers can be seen and heard over the dunes. Butterflies and moths which can be found here include the dark green {{fritillary}} and gatekeeper butterflies and the scarlet tiger and Portland moths.|$|R
25|$|The {{landscape}} is rocky moorland with a covering of coarse grass and bracken. Several spinneys of woodland (pine and mixed deciduous) are enclosed by stone walls {{and are not}} accessible to the public. There {{are a number of}} magnificent specimens of ancient oaks several hundreds of years old. The park is home to herds of red deer and fallow deer. Birdlife is profuse – the reservoir attracts many species of wildfowl, as does the river and the spinneys provide secluded nesting areas for many other species, including large colonies of rooks. Species such as yellowhammer, reed bunting, skylark and <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> are a common sight in the open areas of the park. Deadly nightshade is allowed to grow within the ruins of Bradgate House, having been originally established there during World War II by Leicester Polytechnic's School of Pharmacy for medicinal purposes.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{drainage}} {{of water}} from the bogs as a result of human activity, most of Wicklow's peat has dried out too much for Sphagnum mosses to grow and moorland and heath vegetation has taken over. Active peat building is still occurring at some sites, most notably the Liffey Head Bog. Common heather (or ling) and bell heather are the most common moorland plants along with bilberry (or fraughan, as it is known in Ireland), bog cotton, deergrass and purple moor grass. Bird species found on the Wicklow moorland include red grouse, <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> and skylark. Birds of prey found in the uplands include kestrels, hen harriers, merlins and peregrine falcons. The latter of these are protected species. The uplands are used for sheep grazing and so the moorland is periodically burned to keep the growth of heather in check and encourage growth of grasses.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-17th century, Eday was {{described}} as being [...] "absolutely full of moorland birds" [...] and today there are red-throated divers on Mill Loch, Arctic skuas and bonxies on the moors and black guillemot offshore. Shore birds include <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit,</b> rock pipit and ringed plover. The woodland at Carrick House attracts a variety of migrants and otters can be seen around the coasts. There are colonies of harbour and grey seals on Muckle Green Holm, Little Green Holm, Faray and Holm of Faray, and white-beaked dolphin, minke whale and killer whale are occasional visitors to the area. A ranger provideds guided walks throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|This site, on the Somerset Levels, {{consists}} of 20 low-lying {{fields in the}} north west corner of King's Sedgemoor, and includes the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Greylake nature reserve which has taken over arable farmland and is now home to lapwings, snipe, curlews, redshanks, yellow wagtails, skylarks and <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Birds {{common to}} the dunes include herring gulls, oystercatchers, lapwings, curlew, skylarks and <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits.</b> The dunes are also home to toads and lizards {{as well as many}} species of insects.

500|$|The first formal {{description}} naming this species was by English naturalist George Montagu in 1798. It {{had previously been}} described in 1766 by Thomas Pennant, in {{the first edition of}} British Zoology, although he did not distinguish it from the common titlark (<b>meadow</b> <b>pipit).</b> It was first shown to be different from that species by John Walcott in the 1789 edition of his Synopsis of British Birds, in which he called it the sea lark. John Latham was the first to give the Eurasian rock pipit a scientific name, Alauda obscura in 1790, but the specimen he examined had been misidentified as to the species and was in fact a dusky lark. In the same year, Montagu, whom Latham had consulted about the bird, discovered the Eurasian rock pipit on the coast of South Wales, where it was known to some fishermen in the region as the [...] "rock lark". He adopted that name for the species and gave it the scientific name Alauda petrosus.|$|E
500|$|Birch Moss Covert {{is a small}} {{woodland}} containing birch, alder and willow trees, as well {{as various}} species of flora and fauna. The small mammal population includes the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), which attract both kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). Foxes, stoats, weasels, and badgers, are often seen. The area is part of Shell's estate, covering about [...] of land managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The trust also manages a small nature reserve located within Manchester United's training ground. This provides a habitat {{for a number of}} species including the red admiral butterfly (Vanessa atalanta), <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus pratensis), and grey partridge (Perdix perdix). Carrington Moss is home to the only recorded pairs of breeding grey partridge in Trafford. Six pairs of Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) were recorded in 2003. The reduction in the population of these and similar birds is attributed to modern farming methods, the loss of broad hedgerows, and the lack of winter stubble. Action for Nature in Trafford has therefore included the site in its Biodiversity Action Plan. The group intends to develop Carrington Moss as a home for other species, such as reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus). Stigmella continuella (a species of moth occurring in southern and north-west England) has been observed in the area.|$|E
2500|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{declared}} a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area (SPA). In summer the salt marsh supports large numbers of breeding birds including black-headed gull, European herring gull, lesser black-backed gull, common tern and common redshank. Skylark, <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit</b> and linnet nest in significant numbers on the grazing marsh. [...] Management of the site involves grazing the salt marsh with cattle to maintain the short sward on which wintering wildfowl (especially Eurasian wigeon and the pink-footed goose) depend. The main area of salt marsh is grazed by approximately 800 cattle from May to October, forming {{one of the largest}} single herds of cattle in the UK. Wildfowling takes place on much of the reserve and improved management has contributed to {{the increase in the number}} of birds visiting the site. A group of volunteers led by the local Wildfowlers Association carries out much of the valuable maintenance work on the reserve.|$|E
50|$|The site is chalk {{grassland}} on a steeply sloping hill, with small areas of woodland and scrub. The richest areas botanically are the lower and steeper slopes, with plants including the nationally scarce pasque flower and field fleawort. Twenty-six species of butterfly have been recorded, and breeding birds include skylarks, <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits</b> and willow warblers.|$|R
50|$|The North Denes area of {{the beach}} is an SSSI due to its dune plants, and is home to numbers of skylarks and <b>meadow</b> <b>pipits.</b> It also hosts {{one of the largest}} little tern colonies in the UK each summer, as well as a small colony of {{grayling}} butterflies.

6000|$|I was {{at first}} struck with the {{singularity}} of Caleb's appearance, and later by the expression of his eyes. A very tall, big-boned, lean, round-shouldered man, he was uncouth almost to the verge of grotesqueness, and walked painfully {{with the aid of}} a stick, dragging his shrunken and shortened bad leg. His head was long and narrow, and his high forehead, long nose, long chin, and long, coarse, grey whiskers, worn like a beard on his throat, produced a goat-like effect. This was heightened by the ears and eyes. The big ears stood out from his head, and owing to a peculiar bend or curl in the membrane at the top they looked at certain angles almost pointed. The hazel eyes were wonderfully clear, but that quality was less remarkable than the unhuman intelligence in them--fawn-like eyes that gazed steadily at you as one may gaze through the window, open back and front, of a house at the landscape beyond. This peculiarity was a little disconcerting at first, when, after making his acquaintance out of doors, I went in uninvited and sat down with him at his own fireside. The busy old wife talked of this and that, and hinted as politely as she knew how that I was in her way. To her practical, peasant mind there was no sense in my being there. [...] "He be a stranger to we, and we be strangers to he." [...] Caleb was silent, and his clear eyes showed neither annoyance nor pleasure but only their native, wild alertness, but the caste feeling is always less strong in the hill shepherd than in other men who are on the land; in some cases it will vanish at a touch, and it was so in this one. A canary in a cage hanging in the kitchen served to introduce the subject of birds captive and birds free. I said that I liked the little yellow bird, and was not vexed to see him in a cage, since he was cage-born; but I considered that those who caught wild birds and kept them prisoners did not properly understand things. This happened to be Caleb's view. He had a curiously tender feeling about the little wild birds, and one amusing incident of his boyhood which he remembered came out during our talk. He was out on the down one summer day in charge of his father's flock, when two boys of the village on a ramble in the hills came and sat down on the turf by his side. One of them had a titlark, or <b>meadow</b> <b>pipit,</b> which he had just caught, in his hand, and there was a hot argument as to which of the two was the lawful owner of the poor little captive. The facts were as follows. One of the boys having found the nest became possessed with the desire to get the bird. His companion at once offered to catch it for him, and together they withdrew to a distance and sat down and waited until the bird returned to sit on the eggs. Then the young birdcatcher returned to the spot, and creeping quietly up to within five or six feet of the nest threw his hat so that it fell over the sitting titlark; but after having thus secured it he refused to give it up. The dispute waxed hotter as they sat there, and at last when it got to the point of threats of cuffs on the ear and slaps on the face they agreed to fight it out, the victor to have the titlark. The bird was then put under a hat for safety on the smooth turf a few feet away, and the boys proceeded to take off their jackets and roll up their shirt-sleeves, after which they faced one another, and were just about to begin when Caleb, thrusting out his crook, turned the hat over and away flew the titlark.|$|E
