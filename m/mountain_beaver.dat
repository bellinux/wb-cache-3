5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and <b>mountain</b> <b>beaver.</b>|$|E

40|$|Various {{species of}} rodents and {{lagomorphs}} {{were used in}} bioassays to determine the effectiveness of protein hydrolysates (specifically hydrolyzed casein and gelatin) as herbivore repellents. Mixed sex groups of captive rabbits, pocket gophers, voles, and <b>mountain</b> <b>beavers</b> were offered hydrolyzed casein or gelatin test diets in single-choice tests following a training period with a hydrolysate-free diet. The effectiveness of either hydrolyzed casein or gelatin was dependent on the species. Hydrolyzed casein was identified as an effective repellent for <b>mountain</b> <b>beavers</b> and pocket gophers as these species showed a strong avoidance of hydrolyzed casein diets. Rabbits demonstrated slightly higher avoidance of the gelatin diets versus hydrolyzed casein. However, hydrolyzed casein and gelatin displayed little potential as repellents for voles as both products were readily consumed. Rather than universal application for all pest herbivores, test diet preferences suggest that repellent application depends on the pest species...|$|R

40|$|As {{the largest}} {{mammalian}} order, rodents are nearly cosmopolitan in distribution, can exploit {{a broad spectrum}} of foods, and can often reach high population densities. One sole representative of the most primitive family of rodents, Aplodontidae, does not share some of these common rodent characteristics. The aplodontoid rodents in the family Aplodontidae and Mylagsulidae radiated during the Miocene from the Allomyinae family (Carraway and Verts 1993). The extinct Mylagaulidae represents the earlier radiation of these rodents who exhibited great specialization (Carraway and Verts 1993). Unlike {{the other members of the}} rodent order, <b>mountain</b> <b>beavers</b> are not prolific breeders; nor are they broad-spectrum habitat invaders, retaining in their morphology the primitive condition of the masseter muscle originating entirely on the zygomatic arch. The mostly extinct Aplodontidae family is now made up of the monotypic genus Aplodontia which has been able to survive since the early Oligocene and in some areas is even considered a pest. <b>Mountain</b> <b>beavers</b> (Aplodontia rufa) are known from a variety of common names including boomer, whistler, and the Native American names sewellel and showt’l. Although the common name suggests relationship to true beaver (Castoridae), this semi-fossorial rodent shares only the behavior of tree clipping with the stream beaver and is usually more abundant at lower elevations than in mountainous areas. In Oregon, <b>mountain</b> <b>beavers</b> have retained the designation of boomer even though their vocalizations do not include booms or whistles. Very few people actually know about, much less have seen, this compact fossorial rodent.

50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>beaver</b> is {{considered}} a living fossil, due {{to the presence of}} a host of primitive characteristics, particularly the protrogomorphous zygomasseteric system. This condition is similar to what is found in most mammal groups, such as rabbits, where no extreme specialization of the masseter muscle has evolved. In the protrogomorphous condition, the masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital foramen as it does in guinea pigs and mice. Likewise, the medial masseter muscle attaches {{to the base of the}} zygomatic arch and does not extend to the region in front of the eye as is seen in squirrels and mice. The <b>mountain</b> <b>beaver</b> is the only living rodent with this primitive cranial and muscular feature (except perhaps the blesmols, which clearly evolved protrogomorphy from a hystricomorphous ancestor). The <b>mountain</b> <b>beaver</b> was once thought to be related to the earliest protrogomorphous rodents, such as the ischyromyids (Paramys). Both molecular and morphological phylogeneticists have recently suggested a more distant relationship to these animals.|$|E
