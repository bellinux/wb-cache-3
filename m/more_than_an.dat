5|$|The concerto {{also calls}} on the soloist to be nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> accompanist to the {{orchestra}} for extended periods, such as the ricochet arpeggios {{at the start of}} the recapitulation. This too was novel for a violin concerto of its time.|$|E

5|$|Although {{completed}} successfully, {{the building}} {{turned out to}} be little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> extravagant nail in Price Brothers' coffin. The Great Depression pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy, and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune. Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and '60s, mostly to the interior of the building.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E
5|$|At 07:30 on 15 December, two {{companies}} of the Carleton and York Regiment attacked. After little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour of fighting, however, the Canadians {{were forced to}} call the attack off. In the afternoon, the two heavily depleted companies of the Royal 22e Régiment fought off a large German counterattack on Casa Berardi, with the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery firing 5,398 rounds in support of Canadian forces.|$|E

5|$|Decay {{was not a}} {{critical}} success, but was received with some positivity by video game journalists. Many reviewers felt the game was fun to play through with a friend, but that its more puzzle-oriented gameplay somewhat detracted from the overall experience. A number of reviews stated that the game simply felt little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> extra add-on for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{had urged}} {{regulation}} of radio broadcasting in his April 1921 speech to Congress. Commerce Secretary Hoover {{took charge of}} this project, and convened a conference of radio broadcasters in 1922, {{which led to a}} voluntary agreement for licensing of radio frequencies through the Commerce Department. Both Harding and Hoover realized something <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> agreement was needed, but Congress was slow to act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, audiences {{had a very}} {{different}} take on his work. Many perceived it as a subversive and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at least}} considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art was nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} stories Laureline {{generally}} {{sits in the}} background while Valérian saves the day in whatever situation the pair have found themselves, but her position changes as the series develops. World Without Stars, {{in which the two}} characters are separated for most of the adventure, allows Laureline to step out from under Valérian's shadow for the first time, and she proves to be <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> equal to Valérian in ensuring that their mission succeeds.|$|E
5|$|Soay has a {{primitive}} hut known as Taigh Dugan (Dugan's house). This is little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> excavated hole under a huge stone with two rude walls on the sides. The story of its creation relates to two sheep-stealing brothers from Lewis {{who came to}} St Kilda only to cause further trouble. Dugan was exiled to Soay, where he died; the other, called Fearchar Mòr, was sent to Stac an Armin, where he found life so intolerable he cast himself into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The bank {{building}} was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it {{and made it}} home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> empty, roofless, concrete shell.|$|E

5|$|The film premiered on June 19, 1998, in the United States, and {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics.

5|$|The {{solubility}} of cerium is {{much higher}} in methanesulfonic acid. Cerium(III) and terbium(III) have ultraviolet absorption bands of relatively high intensity compared with the other lanthanides, as their configurations (one electron <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> empty or half-filled f-subshell respectively) {{make it easier for}} the extra f electron to undergo f→d transitions instead of the forbidden f→f transitions of the other lanthanides. Cerium(III) sulfate is one of the few salts whose solubility in water decreases with rising temperature.|$|E

5|$|According to Angela Davis, neutron {{activation}} analysis that was administered after the shootout showed no gunpowder residue on Shakur's fingers and forensic analysis performed at the Trenton, New Jersey crime lab and the FBI crime labs in Washington, D.C. did not find her fingerprints on any weapon at the scene. According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200yards (183m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour later.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00, {{with the}} {{detached}} division rapidly approaching from astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure {{and attempted to}} pass across {{the stern of the}} rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion to mask an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels turned to face the British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvere the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour of fruitless firing at long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further resistance was hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender.|$|E
