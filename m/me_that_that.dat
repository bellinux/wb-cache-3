[...] Goddard described [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] as [...] "a bleak proclamation of doomed happiness [...] a shattering left-hook of self-loathing, loss and desperation". Years later Morrissey considered the song to be the group's [...] "most special." [...] The singer said he was particularly proud of the song's second verse, which included the lines [...] "Though we may be hidden by rags/We have something they'll never have."

2500|$|In April 2009, West {{took his}} first five-wicket haul in one-day matches during the ICC World Cup Qualifier. In a match against the Oman {{national}} cricket team on 2 April, West took 5/26 in Ireland's 116-run victory, beating his previous best bowling figures in one-day matches of 2/35. Ireland won the tournament and West finished with 14wickets {{at an average of}} 22.92 from 10matches and was Ireland's second highest wicket-taker in the tournament. His haul of 7/88 in the first innings of the 2009 Intercontinental Cup clash against Scotland at Mannonfield in Aberdeen, is a record for Ireland in the competition and the best first-class return since Garfield Harrison's 9/113 against the same opposition in Edinburgh in 1990. West was one of seven Ireland players to be nominated for the 2009 Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year (there were fourteen nominees in all), although he did not make the 4-man short-list. For the summer of 2010, West was unable to play due to injury, and in his absence George Dockrell emerged as Ireland's premier spinner. West announced his retirement from international cricket in April 2011. His decision was caused by a serious injury to his left should; it was believed that he risked damaging it. Reflecting on his time playing for Ireland, West said [...] "Being part of the Ireland team has been the highlight and most enjoyable time of my cricket career. I feel very privileged to {{have had the opportunity to}} represent Ireland, and it is sad for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is now over." ...|$|E
