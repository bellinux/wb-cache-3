40|$|Abstract. Drosophila kelch {{has four}} protein domains, {{two of which}} are found in kelch-family {{proteins}} and in numerous nonkelch proteins. In Drosophila, kelch is required to <b>maintain</b> <b>ring</b> canal organization during oogenesis. We have performed a structure–function analysis to study the function of Drosophila kelch. The amino-terminal region (NTR) regulates the timing of kelch localization to the ring canals. Without the NTR, the protein localizes precociously and destabilizes the ring canals and the germ cell membranes, leading to dominant sterility. The amino half of the protein including the BTB domain mediates dimerization. Oligomerization through the amino half of kelch might allow cross-linking of ring canal actin filaments, organizing the inner rim cytoskeleton. The kelch repeat domain i...|$|R
40|$|Algorithms {{by which}} peers join and leave {{structured}} overlay networks {{can be classified}} as passive or active. Passive topology maintenance relies on periodic background repair of neighbor pointers. When a node passively leaves the overlay, subsequent lookups may fail silently. Active maintenance has been proven only for fault-free networks. We develop an active topology maintenance algorithm for practical, fault-prone networks. Unlike prior work, it a) <b>maintains</b> <b>ring</b> continuity during normal topology changes and b) guarantees consistency and progress {{in the presence of}} faults. The latter property is inherited by novel extension of the Paxos Commit algorithm. The topology maintenance algorithm is formally developed using the B Method and its event-driven extensions for dynamic systems. Messaging and storage overheads are quantified. 1...|$|R

Furthermore, the FtsK N terminus is required to either assemble or <b>maintain</b> FtsZ <b>rings</b> at the division plane. The FtsK C terminus is essential in Caulobacter and is involved in maintaining accurate chromosome partitioning. In addition, the C-terminal region of FtsK {{is required for the}} localization of the topoisomerase IV ParC subunit to the replisome to facilitate chromosomal decatenation prior to cell division.

40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the impact of}} forest management and tree growth rate on the potential uses of Douglas-fir wood, nine physico-mechanical properties were studied on more than 1250 standardized clear specimens. These were collected from trees cut in 11 even-aged stands (6 trees/stand) located in Wallonia (Southern Belgium). Stands were 40 to 69 years old and the mean tree girth was ca. 150 cm. The mean ring width of the 66 trees ranged from 3 to more than 7 mm. Statistical analysis evidenced significant but weak effects of ring width. So, mean ring width and cambial age of the specimens considered jointly only explain 28 to 40 % of the variability of the properties studied.

40|$|In Escherichia coli, spatiotemporal {{control of}} cell {{division}} {{occurs at the}} level of the assembly/disassembly process of the essential cytoskeletal protein FtsZ. A number of regulators interact with FtsZ and modulate the dynamics of the assembled FtsZ ring at the midcell division site. In this article, we report the identification of an FtsZ stabilizer, ZapC (Z-associated protein C), in a protein localization screen conducted with E. coli. ZapC colocalizes with FtsZ at midcell and interacts directly with FtsZ, as determined by a protein-protein interaction assay in yeast. Cells lacking or overexpressing ZapC are slightly elongated and have aberrant FtsZ ring morphologies indicative of a role for ZapC in FtsZ regulation. We also demonstrate the ability of purified ZapC to promote lateral bundling of FtsZ in a sedimentation reaction visualized by transmission electron microscopy. While ZapC lacks sequence similarity with other nonessential FtsZ regulators, ZapA and ZapB, all three Zap proteins appear to play an important role in FtsZ regulation during rapid growth.

40|$|We {{consider}} indexing sliding {{windows in}} main memory over on-line data streams. Our proposed data structures and query semantics {{are based on}} a division of the sliding window into sub-windows. When a new sub-window fills up with newly arrived tuples, the oldest sub-window is evicted, indices are refreshed, and continuous queries are re-evaluated to reflect the new state of the window. By classifying relational operators according to their method of execution in the windowed scenario, we show that many useful operators require access to the entire window, motivating the need for two types of indices: those which provide a list of attribute values and their counts for answering set-valued queries, and those which provide direct access to tuples for answering attribute-valued queries. For the former, we evaluate the performance of linked lists, search trees, and hash tables as indexing structures, showing that the high costs of maintaining such structures over rapidly changing data are offset by the savings in query processing costs. For the latter, we propose novel ways of <b>maintaining</b> windowed <b>ring</b> indices, which we show to be much faster than conventional ring indices and more efficient than executing windowed queries without an index. ...|$|R
