40|$|The {{discovery}} of large ecosystems of cold-water corals (CWC), stretching along continental <b>margins</b> in <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> hundreds {{to thousands of}} meters, has raised many questions regarding their ecology, biodiversity and relevance as deep-sea hard-ground habitat. This study represents the first investigation that explicitly targets bacterial diversity from distinct microbial habitats associated with the cosmopolitan reef-building coral Lophelia pertusa, and also compares natural (fjord) and controlled (aquarium) conditions. Coral skeleton surface, coral mucus, ambient seawater and reef sediments clearly showed habitat-specific differences in community structure and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) number. Especially in the natural environment, bacterial communities associated with coral-generated habitats were significantly more diverse than those present in the surrounding, non-coral habitats, or those in artificial coral living conditions (fjord vs aquarium). These findings strongly indicate characteristic coral-microbe associations and, furthermore, suggest that the variety of coral-generated habitats within reef systems promotes microbial diversity in the deep ocean...|$|R

We evaluated a modification to the local-wavenumber approach to estimate the depth to the top of magnetic sources assuming that the depth to the bottom of the magnetic sources is controlled by the Curie temperature or crustal thickness. We applied this new method to a simple model <b>of</b> a continental <b>margin</b> and to magnetic survey data over the central Red Sea where the Curie isotherm is shallow.

40|$|Characterizing glaciotectonic deformation, {{glacial erosion}} and sedimentation, and basal hydrologic {{conditions}} of ice sheets {{is vital for}} selecting sites for nuclear waste repositories at high latitudes. Glaciotectonic deformation is enhanced by excess pore pressures that commonly persist near ice sheet <b>margins.</b> <b>Depths</b> <b>of</b> such deformation can extend locally to a few tens <b>of</b> meters, with <b>depths</b> up to approximately 300 m in exceptional cases. Rates of glacial erosion are highly variable (0. 05 – 15 mm a− 1), but ratesa− 1 are expected in tectonically quiescent regions. Total erosion probably not exceeding several tens of meters is expected during a glacial cycle, although locally erosion could be greater. Consolidation of glacial sediments that is less than expected from independent estimates of glacier thickness indicates that heads at the bases of past ice sheets were usually within 30 % of the floatation value. This conclusion is reinforced by direct measurements of water pressure beneath portions of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which indicate average headsbed, despite thick ice at subfreezing temperatures. Therefore, in models of subglacial groundwater flow used to assess sites for nuclear waste repositories, a flux upper boundary condition based on water input from only basal melting will be far more uncertain than applying a hydraulic head at the upper boundary set equal to a large fraction of the floatation value...|$|R
