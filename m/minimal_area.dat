40|$|INTRODUCTION: Upper airway {{measurement}} can {{be important}} for the diagnosis of breathing disorders. Acoustic reflection (AR) is an accepted tool for studying the airway. Our objective {{was to investigate the}} differences between cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and AR in calculating airway volumes and areas. METHODS: Subjects with prescribed CBCT images as part of their records were also asked to have AR performed. A total of 59 subjects (mean age, 15 ± 3. 8 years) had their upper airway (5 areas) measured from CBCT images, acoustic rhinometry, and acoustic pharyngometry. Volumes and <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>areas</b> were extracted and compared with software. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation on 20 randomly selected subjects, remeasured 2 weeks apart, showed high reliability (r > 0. 77). Means of total nasal volume were significantly different between the 2 methods (P = 0. 035), but anterior nasal volume and <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> showed no differences (P = 0. 532 and P = 0. 066, respectively). Pharyngeal volume showed significant differences (P = 0. 01) with high correlation (r = 0. 755), whereas pharyngeal <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> showed no differences (P = 0. 109). The pharyngeal volume difference may not be considered clinically significant, since it is 758 mm 3 for measurements showing means of 11, 000 ± 4000 mm 3.

40|$|ABSTRACT] It is {{necessary}} to use the ground observational data to calculate physical value in a wide survey unit (1 km× 1 km) in order to verify {{the reliability of the}} algorithm for speculating physical variable from 1 km satellite data. Since it is difficult to conduct the ground observation within whole wide area survey unit in short time, the <b>minimal</b> survey <b>area</b> which can represent a wide survey unit has to be determined. The objective {{of this study is to}} find the <b>minimal</b> representing <b>area</b> of a wide survey unit through the car survey and radio-controlled helicopter survey we developed in Mongolian grassland. As a result, it can be said that these systems used in the research are a good way to calculate the <b>minimal</b> representing <b>area</b> of a wide survey unit...|$|R

50|$|A minimal {{surface of}} {{revolution}} is a subtype of minimal surface. A minimal surface is defined not as a surface of <b>minimal</b> <b>area,</b> but as a surface with a mean curvature of 0. Since a mean curvature of 0 is a necessary condition of a surface of <b>minimal</b> <b>area,</b> all minimal surfaces of revolution are minimal surfaces, but not all minimal surfaces are minimal surfaces of revolution. As a point forms a circle when rotated about an axis, finding the minimal {{surface of revolution}} is equivalent to finding the minimal surface passing through two circular wireframes. A physical realization of a minimal surface of revolution is soap film stretched between two parallel circular wires: the soap film naturally takes on the shape with least surface area.|$|E

40|$|With {{acoustic}} rhinometry, one {{can detect}} {{a difference in}} response to a topical deconges-tant between normal and allergic subjects at the <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area.</b> The mini-mal cross-sectional area corresponds in most cases to the anterior end of the inferior turbinate or the first valley, which occurs after the nose piece of the acoustic rhinometer on the acoustic rhinometry graph. Allergic patients typically have an increase in nasal mucosal swelling, which leads to a decrease in the nasal volume and area and, subse-quently, to an increase in congestion. In this study acoustic rhinometry was used to test nor-mal and allergic subjects before and after the application of a topical decongestant (1 % phenylephrine [Neo-Synephrine]). Symptoms were measured by a five-point scale.

40|$|AbstractTo {{define the}} clinical, {{angiographic}} and procedural correlates of quantitative coronary dimensions after directional coronary atherectomy, 400 lesions in 378 patients were analyzed {{with use of}} qualitative morphologic and quantitative angiographic methods. Successful atherectomy, defined by a < 75 % residual area stenosis, tissue retrieval {{and the absence of}} in-hospital ischemic complications, was performed in 351 lesions (87. 7 %). After atherectomy, <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> increased from 1. 2 ± 1. 1 to 6. 6 ± 4. 4 mm 2 (p < 0. 001) and percent area stenosis was reduced from 87 ± 10 % to 31 ± 42 % (p < 0. 001). By univariate analysis, device size (p < 0. 001) and left circumflex artery lesion location (p = 0. 004) were associated with a larger final <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area.</b> Conversely, restenotic lesion (p = 0. 002), lesion length ≥ 10 mm (p = 0. 018) and lesion calcification (p = 0. 035) were quantitatively associated with a smaller final minimum cross-sectional area. With use of stepwise multivariate analysis to control for the reference area, atherectomy device size (p = 0. 003) and left circumflex lesion location (p = 0. 007) were independently associated with a larger final <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area,</b> whereas restenotic lesion (p = 0. 010), diffuse proximal disease (p = 0. 033), lesion length ≥ 10 mm (p = 0. 026) and lesion calcification (p = 0. 081) were significantly correlated with a smaller final <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area.</b> The number of specimens excised, the number of atherectomy passes and atherectomy balloon inflation pressure did not correlate with the final <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area.</b> Thus, directional atherectomy results in marked improvement of coronary lumen dimensions, at least in part correlated with the presence of certain clinical, angiographic and procedural factors at the time of atherectomy...|$|R
40|$|Pharyngeal airway {{dimensions}} {{are associated with}} growth, anatomical, postural and mechanical factors, but the interactions of these associations are not yet fully understood. Therefore {{the aim of the}} present study was to examine and relate the pharyngeal airway dimensions to dentofacial morphology, upper cervical vertebral column morphology and skeletal maturation in pre-orthodontic children. Furthermore, parameters with the greatest relevance to airway dimensions were analysed. Subjects and Methods: Airway volume, <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> and upper cervical vertebral column morphology were 3 -dimensionlly assessed on 105 CBCT scans of healthy pre-orthodontic children (44 boys, 61 girls; mean age, 10. 7 ± 2. 4 years). Cephalometric features and skeletal maturity were assessed on generated 2 -dimensional cephalograms. Associations were tested by Spearman correlation analyses and analyses of variance (ANOVA). The effect of gender, age and skeletal maturation and the parameters with the greatest relevance to airway dimensions were tested by linear regression analysis. Results: The airway volume and <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> were greater in children of an older age than younger age (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 01 respectively). After adjustment for the effect of age, skeletal maturity and gender, there were moderate positive associations with maxillary and mandibular width and airway volume (r = 0. 53 **, 0. 60 *** respectively) and weak positive associations with <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> (r = 0. 35 **, r = 0. 35 *** respectively). Anterior face height (r = 0. 51 *) and upper anterior face height (r = 0. 52 *) had moderate positive associations with airway volume whereas sagittal jaw relationship had a weak negative association with <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> (r= - 0. 35 *). Gender, molar occlusion and upper cervical vertebral column morphology were not significantly associated with airway dimensions. Mandibular width and age were the most relevant factors for airway volume (r 2 = 0. 36). Mandibular width and sagittal jaw relationship were the most relevant factors for <b>minimal</b> crosssectional <b>area</b> (r 2 = 0. 16).

Defining these normal values in adult Iranian population, as a criterion for diagnosis and treatment of nasal diseases can be very helpful. One hundred eighty adult Iranians (18 – 60 years old) without nasal breathing complaints underwent acoustic rhinometry. The mean volume and <b>minimal</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> of the nose and also correlation of these variables with age, sex, height, weight, smoking habit, and topical nasal decongestion were assessed.
