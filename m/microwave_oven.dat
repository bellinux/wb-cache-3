5|$|In {{this episode}} Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) and Devon Banks' (Will Arnett) race {{to be the}} new CEO of General Electric comes to an end; in a parody of Amadeus, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) gets the idea to make a pornographic video game with Frank (Judah Friedlander) playing Salieri to his Mozart, and Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) prepares to become the new Head of East Coast Television and <b>Microwave</b> <b>Oven</b> Programming. In keeping with the Amadeus parody, the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (a {{favorite}} of Jeff Richmond, the show's regular composer) is used to score much of the episode.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy, who is Vice President of East Coast Television and <b>Microwave</b> <b>Oven</b> Programming for General Electric, {{makes an}} {{appearance}} on the fictional CNBC show The Hot Box. During the appearance, Jack interacts with the show's host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), with the two flirting during the broadcast. Avery and Jack share Republican viewpoints, and she asks him out for a drink after the show, which he accepts. They eventually embark {{on a number of}} both successful and unsuccessful dates. During one of those dates, Jack invites her to a TGS VIP party he has hastily staged, whereupon he enlists the help of Jon Bon Jovi—at the time NBC's real-life Artist in Residence—to come over and talk to them, in an effort to impress the successful Avery. When Bon Jovi approaches them, though, Jack disregards him due to his own intriguing conversation with Avery, which impresses her even more. After the TGS party, the two go back to Jack's apartment and end up sleeping together.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>ovens</b> have {{a limited}} role in {{professional}} cooking, because the boiling-range temperatures produced in especially hydrous foods impede flavors produced by the higher temperatures of frying, browning, or baking. However, additional heat sources {{can be added to}} <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens,</b> or into combination <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens,</b> to produce these other heating effects, and microwave heating may cut the overall time needed to prepare such dishes. Some modern <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens</b> are part of over-the-range units with built-in extractor hoods.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) {{aspirations}} of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) {{comes to a}} halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and <b>Microwave</b> <b>Oven</b> Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) would not agree to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been dead for weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, The Hot Box, Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.|$|E
5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a <b>microwave</b> <b>oven,</b> Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The TGS with Tracy Jordan crew have {{finished}} taping their fiftieth episode {{and decide to}} celebrate. Their boss, Vice President of East Coast Television and <b>Microwave</b> <b>Oven</b> Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), goes to the writers' room and tells the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), about how the whole company is undergoing cutbacks. After an unsuccessful presentation about TGS, Brad Halster (Roger Bart)—one of the consultants {{in charge of the}} cutbacks—informs Liz that she needs to cut her annual budget by 25 percent. Liz, anxious about her employees losing their jobs, decides to use sexual bartering to solve the problem and asks Brad on a date, which he accepts. Liz dresses in the trashiest outfit she can find, and goes on her date. The next day, she discovers that cutbacks are still taking place at TGS, and confronts Brad. Realizing that he was being used, Brad charges Liz with sexual harassment and she is suspended from work for two weeks. Jack tells Liz that the budget review process will start over again, this time under his supervision.|$|E

5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a <b>microwave</b> <b>oven.</b>|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{found only}} in large {{industrial}} applications, microwave ovens increasingly became a standard fixture of residential kitchens in developed countries. By 1986, roughly 25% of households in the U.S. owned a <b>microwave</b> <b>oven,</b> up from only about 1% in 1971; the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that over 90% of American households owned a <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> in 1997. In Australia, a 2008 market research study found that 95% of kitchens contained a <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> and that 83% of them were used daily. In Canada, fewer than 5% of households had a <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> in 1979, but more than 88% of households owned one by 1998. In France, 40% of households owned a <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> in 1994, but that number had increased to 65% by 2004.|$|E

25|$|Since CD-Rs {{in general}} cannot be logically erased to any degree, the {{disposal}} of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc in a <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> for 10–15 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal reflective layer, but this same arcing may cause damage or excessive wear to the <b>microwave</b> <b>oven.</b> Many office paper shredders {{are also designed to}} shred CDs.|$|E
25|$|The magnetron, {{the core}} {{component}} {{in the development of}} radar, and the first microwave power oscillators are developed at the University of Birmingham during World War II (the <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> owes its existence to these developments).|$|E

25|$|Though {{radiative}} cooking of {{meat with}} dairy produce is not listed by the classical rabbis as {{being among the}} biblically prohibited forms of cooking such mixtures, a controversy remains about using a <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> to cook these mixtures.

25|$|At {{least one}} hazard in {{particular}} is well known and documented. As {{the lens of the}} eye has no cooling blood flow, it is particularly prone to overheating when exposed to microwave radiation. This heating can in turn lead to a higher incidence of cataracts in later life. A <b>microwave</b> <b>oven</b> with a warped door or poor microwave sealing can be hazardous.|$|E
