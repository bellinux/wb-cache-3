25|$|In any semiconductor, {{the band}} gap means that only photons with {{that amount of}} energy, or more, will {{contribute}} to producing a current. In the case of silicon, the majority of visible light from red to violet has sufficient energy to <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen.</b> Unfortunately higher energy photons, those at the blue and violet end of the spectrum, have more than enough energy to cross the band gap; although some of this extra energy is transferred into the electrons, the majority of it is wasted as heat. Another issue is {{that in order to}} have a reasonable chance of capturing a photon, the n-type layer has to be fairly thick. This also increases the chance that a freshly ejected electron will meet up with a previously created hole in the material before reaching the p-n junction. These effects produce an upper limit on the efficiency of silicon solar cells, currently around 12 to 15% for common modules and up to 25% for the best laboratory cells (33.16% is the theoretical maximum efficiency for single band gap solar cells, see Shockley–Queisser limit.).|$|E
25|$|The {{times of}} the paths near the {{classical}} reflection site of the mirror will be nearly the same, so {{as a result the}} probability amplitudes will point in nearly the same direction—thus, they will have a sizable sum. Examining the paths towards the edges of the mirror reveals that the times of nearby paths are quite different from each other, and thus we wind up summing vectors that cancel out quickly. So, there is a higher probability that light will follow a near-classical reflection path than a path further out. However, a diffraction grating can be made out of this mirror, by scraping away areas {{near the edge of the}} mirror that usually cancel nearby amplitudes out—but now, since the photons would not reflect from the scraped-off portions, the probability amplitudes which would all wind up pointing, for instance, at forty-five degrees can have a sizable sum. Thus, this would let light of the right frequency to <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> sum to a larger probability amplitude, and as such possess a larger probability of reaching the appropriate final point.|$|E
25|$|The {{respiratory}} system (also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. The {{anatomy and physiology}} that <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> varies greatly, {{depending on the size}} of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs. Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles, but atria in birds. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration.|$|E

50|$|To {{develop a}} dynamic model of {{strategy}} and performance requires components that explain how factors change over time. Most {{of the relationships}} on which business analysis are based describe relationships that are static and stable over time. For example, “profits = revenue minus costs”, or “market share = our sales divided by total market size” are relationships that are true. Static strategy tools seek to solve the strategy problem by extending this set of stable relationships, e.g. “profitability = some complex function of product development capability”.Since a company’s sales clearly change over time, {{there must be something}} further back up the causal chain that <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen.</b> One such item is ‘customers’ - if the firm has more customers now than last month, then (everything else being equal), it will have more sales and profits.|$|R

Douglas was impressed when Chow was able to teach her how to perform the Amanar vault in a single afternoon. Douglas considered a move to Texas to train with a renowned coach there, but after that coach declined to train her out of loyalty to Walker, Douglas selected Chow. Chow was initially skeptical, since Douglas had been just one of hundreds of kids at the clinic in Virginia Beach. However, Chow subsequently informed Douglas's Excalibur coaches that he had agreed to train her, but pointed out that he did not recruit her, saying, [...] "I would never recruit anybody to my program."

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role {{of general}} {{practice}} in preventing disease and promoting health is strongly supported by research and health policies. OBJECTIVE: This {{article examines the}} role of general practitioners in illness prevention and health promotion activities. DISCUSSION: Despite time and other barriers, such as competing priorities, {{to the implementation of}} preventive activities, prevention is part of routine general practice. In providing care for the whole person {{over a long period of}} time prevention and treatment are not separate entities and the line between these are necessarily blurred. From a pragmatic point of view, if a practice is to increase its activity in prevention there needs to be a driver that <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> and strategies to suit the structure of the individual practice. Introducing small interventions and making use of the practice team is a good place to start in a range of health promotion activities including opportunistic education, brief interventions for patients with disease risk factors, and specific interventions for a known disease.
