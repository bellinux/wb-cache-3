40|$|Anastrozole {{represents}} new, {{strong and}} selective nonsteroid aromatase inhibitor. The {{purpose of this}} report was to show the effect of anastrozole in two patients with breast cancer who were previously treated with aminoglutethimide. A female patient aged 55 years (menopausal, unknown status of steroid receptors) has been living 246 <b>months</b> <b>with</b> breast cancer (63 <b>months</b> <b>with</b> metastatic disease), and treated with tamoxifen aminoglutethmide, and anastrozole. Therapeutic effect lasting 45 <b>months</b> was achieved <b>with</b> aromatase inhibitors. Female patient aged 56 years (menopausal, unknown status of steroid receptors) has been living 163 <b>months</b> <b>with</b> breast cancer (130 <b>months</b> <b>with</b> metastatic disease). There were 124 months response to hormonotherapy - tamoxifen (66 months), aminoglutethimide (54 months), and anastrozole (4 months). Therapeutic effect lasting 45 <b>months</b> was achieved <b>with</b> aromatase inhibitors. Anastrozole was selected in both patients because of metastatic involvement of the pleura with bilateral effusion.

40|$|Background. The {{relationship}} between {{air pollution and}} exacerbation of respiratory diseases is well established. Nevertheless, its association with hemoptysis has been poorly investigated. This paper describes the relationship of air pollutants with severe hemoptysis. Methods. All consecutive subjects with severe hemoptysis during a 5 -year period were included. The {{relationship between}} the contamination measurements {{and the frequency of}} embolizations was analyzed using Poisson regressions. In these regressions, the dependent variable was the monthly number of embolizations in a given month and the independent variable was either the concentration of an air contaminant during the same month, the concentration of the air contaminant during the previous month, or the difference between the two. Results. A higher total number of embolizations per month were observed over the <b>months</b> <b>with</b> increases in the concentration of NO. The number of embolizations was 2. 0 in the 33 <b>months</b> <b>with</b> no increases in the concentration of NO, 2. 1 in the 12 <b>months</b> <b>with</b> small increases, 2. 2 in the 5 <b>months</b> <b>with</b> moderate increases, 2. 5 in the 4 <b>months</b> <b>with</b> large increases, and 4. 0 in the 5 <b>months</b> <b>with</b> very large increases. Conclusion. There is association between hemoptysis and increases in the concentration of atmospheric NO in Badalona (Spain) ...|$|R
