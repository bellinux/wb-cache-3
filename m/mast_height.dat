The submarine scored two hits on the coastal minelayer Nasami, which disappeared {{in a cloud of}} smoke and debris. The nearer destroyer began closing the range, and Trigger missed it with four aft tubes. She caught up with the convoy again and fired five torpedoes at the last ship. Two hits produced flames that reached <b>mast</b> <b>height</b> and several secondary explosions that marked the end of the 11,933-ton converted submarine tender Yasukuni Maru.

500|$|Finding the British Barr & Stroud {{coincidence}} rangefinder design superior to existing French designs, the Dantons mounted {{a pair of}} [...] FQ rangefinders atop the conning tower and a [...] rangefinder on each turret top {{for use by the}} turret commanders. Integrating these into the overall fire-control system took some time so eight Ponthus & Therrode stadimeters, which required knowledge of the target's <b>mast</b> <b>height</b> and overall length, were used in the interim. During the war, the rangefinders were replaced by longer, more precise instrument. A triple [...] model was installed above the conning tower and 2-meter models replaced the smaller ones on the turret roofs.|$|E
500|$|The 13 Beaufighters from No. 30 Squadron RAAF {{approached}} the convoy at low level {{to give the}} impression they were Beauforts making a torpedo attack. The ships turned to face them, the standard procedure to present a smaller target to torpedo bombers, allowing the Beaufighters to maximise the damage they inflicted on the ships’ anti-aircraft guns, bridges and crews in strafing runs with their four [...] nose cannons and six wing-mounted [...] machine guns. On board one of the Beaufighters was cameraman Damien Parer, who shot dramatic footage of the battle. Immediately afterward, seven B-25s of the 38th Bombardment Group’s 71st Bombardment Squadron bombed from about , while six from the 405th Bombardment Squadron attacked at <b>mast</b> <b>height.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although this {{technique}} {{allows you to}} judge the approximate length of a proposed model from its true footage, only square-riggers will fit the approximate height and beam by the above factors.

50|$|For {{high power}} transmitters, <b>masts</b> with <b>heights</b> of {{about half the}} {{radiated}} wavelength are preferred because they concentrate the radiated power toward the horizon.

500|$|The Allied Air Forces {{had used}} 233,847 rounds of ammunition, and dropped 261 500-pound and 253 thousand-pound bombs. They claimed 19 hits and 42 near misses with the former, and 59 hits and 39 near misses from the latter. Of the 137 bombs dropped in low level attacks, 48, or 35percent, were {{claimed to have}} hit, but only 29, or 7.5percent, of the 387 bombs dropped from medium altitude. This {{compared}} favourably with efforts in August and September 1942 when only 3percent of bombs dropped were claimed to have scored hits. It was noted that the high and medium altitude attacks scored few hits but dispersed the convoy, while the strafing runs from the Beaufighters had knocked out many of the ships' anti-aircraft defences. Aircraft attacking from multiple directions had confused and overwhelmed the Japanese defences, resulting in lower casualties and more accurate bombing. The results therefore vindicated not just the tactics of <b>mast</b> <b>height</b> attack, but of mounting coordinated attacks from multiple directions. [...] The Japanese estimated that at least 29 bombs had hit a ship during the battle. This was a big improvement over the Battle of Wau back in January, when Allied aircraft attacked a Japanese convoy consisting of five destroyers and five troop transports travelling from Rabaul to Lae, but managed to sink just one transport and beach another.|$|E
