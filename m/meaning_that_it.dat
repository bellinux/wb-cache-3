5|$|Gliese 3634 is a M-class dwarf star, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is small, emits reddish light, {{and has a}} {{relatively}} low temperature for a star.

Gliese 3634 is 0.020 times as luminous as the Sun, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> radiates about 2% {{of the amount of}} energy that the Sun does. It was described as an intermediately active star in its discovery paper. Gliese 3634 lies 19.8 parsecs (approximately 64.6 light years) away from Earth, {{a relatively}} close star. Gliese 3634 b is the only planet to have been confirmed in the star's orbit, although initial analysis of the data suggests that a secondary body of an unknown nature also exists, with an orbit of more than 200 days and a mass approximately twice that of Neptune's.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic {{language}} {{that allows the}} creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive verb like {{the object of a}} transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent ("subject") of a transitive verb.|$|E

5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids are {{important}} to the forest ecology, as both predators and prey. In some forest types, such as tabonuco forest, they are the major arboreal invertebrate predators; spiders being the most abundant representative. The Maricao Commonwealth Forest's 27 spider species belong to five families: Uloboridae, Pholcidae, Theridiidae, Linyphiidae and Araneidae. Theotima minutissima, a small spider species found in abundance in the Caribbean National Forest, is believed to be parthenogenetic, <b>meaning</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> reproduces without fertilization by a male.|$|E

It grows vigorously from seed over a period of 2–5 years, and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed, cut or eroded peat. E.angustifolium is protogynous.|$|E

Linktown, Seafield, Hayfield, Smeaton and Templehall East areas in Kirkcaldy fall within the 5–10% banding of most deprived communities in Scotland.|$|E
