50|$|There are {{thousands}} of <b>maritime</b> <b>museums</b> in the world. Many belong to the International Congress of <b>Maritime</b> <b>Museums</b> (ICMM), which coordinates members' efforts to acquire, preserve, and display their material. There is a risk that too many <b>maritime</b> <b>museums</b> might dilute the experience for the public, while a poorly managed museeum might put other municipalities off the idea of hosting such a museum.|$|R
50|$|<b>Maritime</b> <b>museums</b> are museums that {{specialize}} in the presentation of maritime history, culture, or archaeology. They explore the relationship between societies and certain bodies of water. Just {{as there is a}} wide variety of museum types, there are also many different types of <b>maritime</b> <b>museums.</b> First, as mentioned above, <b>maritime</b> <b>museums</b> can be primarily archaeological. These museums focus on the interpretation and preservation of shipwrecks and other artifacts recovered from a maritime setting. A second type is the <b>maritime</b> history <b>museum,</b> dedicated to educating the public about humanity's maritime past. Examples are the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park and Mystic Seaport. Military-focused <b>maritime</b> <b>museums</b> are a third variety, of which the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and Battleship IOWA Museum are examples.|$|R
50|$|The Council of American <b>Maritime</b> <b>Museums</b> (CAMM) was {{established}} in 1974 to be a network for professionals working in North American <b>maritime</b> <b>museums.</b> It has a membership of some eighty museums in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Bermuda.|$|R
5|$|Objects from Titanic {{have been}} {{exhibited}} for many years, though {{only a few}} were retrieved before {{the discovery of the}} wreck in 1985. The <b>Maritime</b> <b>Museum</b> of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia has a collection of wooden fragments and an intact deckchair plucked from the sea by the Canadian search vessels that recovered the victims' bodies. Various other museums, including the National <b>Maritime</b> <b>Museum</b> in Greenwich and the SeaCity Museum in Southampton, have objects donated by survivors and relatives of victims, including some items that were retrieved from the bodies of victims. More donated Titanic artifacts {{are to be found in}} the Merseyside <b>Maritime</b> <b>Museum</b> in Liverpool and the Titanic Historical Society's museum in Indian Orchard, Springfield, Massachusetts. The latter's collection includes items such as the life jacket of Madeleine Astor, the wife of millionaire Titanic victim John Jacob Astor IV, a rivet which was removed from the hull before Titanic went to sea, an ice warning which never reached the bridge, a restaurant menu and a sample square of carpet from a First Class stateroom.|$|E

5|$|Searches were resumed for {{the lost}} Endeavour Reef cannons, but expeditions in 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unsuccessful. They were finally {{recovered}} in 1969 by a research team from the American Academy of Natural Sciences, using a sophisticated magnetometer to locate the cannons, a quantity of iron ballast and the abandoned bower anchor. Conservation work on the cannons was undertaken by the Australian National <b>Maritime</b> <b>Museum,</b> after which two of the cannons were displayed at its headquarters in Sydney's Darling Harbour, and eventually put on display at Botany Bay and the National Museum of Australia in Canberra (with a replica remaining at the museum). A third cannon and the bower anchor were displayed at the James Cook Museum in Cooktown, with the remaining three at the National <b>Maritime</b> <b>Museum</b> in London, the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.|$|E

5|$|The punchbowls are a 'harlequin pair', {{similar but}} not exactly matching. The bowls have been donated independently, {{one to the}} State Library of New South Wales (SLNSW) in 1926 {{and the other to}} the Australian National <b>Maritime</b> <b>Museum</b> (ANMM) in 2006. The Library bowl is the more widely known of the pair. Its {{earliest}} provenance places it in England in the late 1840s, where it is said to originally have been commissioned for William Bligh; another source suggests Henry Colden Antill. It passed through several owners in Britain before it was presented to the State Library. The Museum bowl's first provenance is from England in 1932 and {{it has been suggested that}} it was made to the order of Arthur Phillip. Its whereabouts were unknown until it appeared in the Newark Museum, United States, in 1988, on loan from Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.. Through donations, the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Museum</b> later acquired the punchbowl from Frelinghuysen.|$|E
