5|$|The five largest ancestry {{groups in}} South Dakota are: German (40.7%), Norwegian (15.3%), Irish (10.4%), Native American (8.3%), and English (7.1%). German-Americans {{are the largest}} ancestry group in <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, {{although}} there are also large Scandinavian populations in some counties. American Indians, largely Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (Sioux) are predominant in several counties, mostly {{in the western part}} of the state. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 2,000 species of antlion found in <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, with the {{greatest}} diversity being in warmer areas. The best known species are those in which the larvae dig pits to trap their prey, {{but by no means}} do all species do this. Antlions live in a range of usually dry habitats including open woodland floors, scrub-clad dunes, hedge bases, river banks, road verges, under raised buildings and in vacant lots.|$|E

5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year in <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E

5|$|Malaria {{has been}} {{successfully}} eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, {{in conjunction with the}} monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. Malaria was eliminated from <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USA in the early 20th century by such methods, {{and the use of the}} pesticide DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program.

5|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening in <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Originally, people chewed raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness. Sugarcane {{was a native of}} tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. Different species seem to have originated from different locations with Saccharum barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming from New Guinea. One of the earliest historical references to sugarcane is in Chinese manuscripts dating back to 8th century BC that state that the use of sugarcane originated in India.|$|E
5|$|The Zimbabwe dollar {{was again}} {{reformed}} on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar {{at the ratio}} of 1000000000000 (1012) to 1 with the original intention of phasing out the latter by 1 July 2009. The 2009 banknote series was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009. The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink and an iridescent strip. <b>Most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design were recycled from designs of past issues {{and do not have}} a watermark although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the barn}} owl has been much studied; the items {{consumed}} can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet {{have been made in}} <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. Even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce, earthworms {{do not seem to be}} consumed.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} Pennsylvania arrived from Asia between 12000BCE and 8000BCE, when the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age were receding. Fluted point spearheads from this era, {{known as the}} Paleo-Indian Period, {{have been found in}} <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. Archeological discoveries at the Memorial Park Site 36Cn164 near the confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek collectively span about 8,000years and represent every major prehistoric period from the Middle Archaic to the Late Woodland period. Prehistoric cultural periods over that span included the Middle Archaic starting at 6500 BCE; the Late Archaic starting at 3000 BCE; the Early Woodland starting at 1000 BCE; the Middle Woodland starting at 0 CE; and the Late Woodland starting at 900 CE. First contact with Europeans occurred in Pennsylvania between 1500 and 1600 CE.|$|E
5|$|The nearest {{railway station}} {{to the stadium}} is Bordesley, on the Birmingham to Stratford Line between Moor Street and Small Heath stations, which has regular {{services}} only on match days. The stadium is a 20-minute walk from New Street station, which is served by direct trains from <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, and slightly less far from Moor Street, which is served by Chiltern Railways trains from London Marylebone. Birmingham Coach Station, served by National Express coaches, is a 15-minute walk away, and buses run from the city centre past the ground. There is very limited parking at the stadium itself, but a secure outdoor car park is available at Birmingham Wheels Park, less than 15 minutes walk away, and parking is permitted in the streets surrounding the ground.|$|E
5|$|The type was {{withdrawn}} from service in 1946; as of June that year the RAAF had 235 Vengeances on hand, but only required two. The aircraft were disposed of {{over the next}} six years, most being sold for scrap. Twelve Vengeance airframes were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy between 1948 and 1951 to be used for ground handling and fire-fighting training. Only a single complete RAAF Vengeance, the former A27-99, was preserved. As of 1986 this aircraft was on display at the Camden Museum of Aviation in the outskirts of Sydney. At this time, <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airframe of the former A27-247 were also held by the Aviation Heritage Museum in Perth.|$|E

5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fortress}} {{were finished}} during the First World War, and many minor works were started and completed {{during the course}} of the war. Even though Sweden remained neutral during the First and Second World War, the start and outcome of both had large impact on the fortress. Finland's independence during the First World War created a buffer state between Sweden and Imperial Russia's successor state, the Soviet Union, which radically changed the strategic value of northern Sweden, put the usefulness of Boden Fortress into question. Only the most basic needs were satisfied during the interwar period; even apparent needsbased on the experiences from the warsuch as better air defence and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by armoured forces were neglected. Thanks to local commanders, construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones were done with the help of garrisoned troops. Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training, and the telephone network was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company. This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material.|$|E
5|$|Populations of the {{peregrine}} falcon have bounced back in <b>most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. In Britain, {{there has been}} a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. In Southampton, a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on pain of a possible prison sentence, from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In {{many parts of the world}} {{peregrine falcon}}s have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.|$|E
5|$|The hilly {{area around}} Aarhus {{consists}} of a moranial plateau from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of tunnel valleys. The most prominent valleys of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake, Årslev Lake and Tåstrup Lake, and the Egå Valley to the north, with the stream of Egåen, the bog of Geding-Kasted Mose and Geding Lake. <b>Most</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two valleys have been drained and subsequently farmed, {{but in the early}} 2000s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the stream of Lyngbygård Å in the west and valleys to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the pre-quaternary. By contrast, the Aarhus River Valley and the Giber River Valley are late glacial meltwater valleys. The coastal cliffs along the Bay of Aarhus consist of shallow tertiary clay from the Eocene and Oligocene (57 to 24 million years ago).|$|E
