5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers project {{directly}} to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals {{directly to}} the deep nuclei. The <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E
5|$|Divergence and convergence: In {{the human}} cerebellum, {{information}} from 200 million <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells. Because {{of the way}} that they are lined up longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down to a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells. Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of inputs, processes them very extensively through its rigorously structured internal network, and sends out the results via a very limited number of output cells.|$|E
50|$|In the {{cerebellum}} {{one of the}} {{two major}} pathways is that of the <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers.</b> <b>Mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> project directly to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei.

40|$|Hippocampal <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> project {{preferentially}} to the stratum lucidum, the proximal-most lamina of the suprapyramidal {{region of}} CA 3. The molecular mechanisms that govern this lamina-restricted projection are still unknown. We examined the projection pattern of <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> in mutant mice for semaphorin receptors plexin-A 2 and plexin-A 4, and their ligand, the transmembrane semaphorin Sema 6 A.

We also report that the plexin-A 2 loss-of-function phenotype is genetically suppressed by Sema 6 A loss of function. Based on these results, we propose {{a model for the}} lamina-restricted projection of mossy fibers: the expression of plexin-A 4 on <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> prevents them from entering the Sema 6 A-expressing suprapyramidal region of CA 3 and restricts them to the proximal-most part, where Sema 6 A repulsive activity is attenuated by plexin-A 2...|$|R
5|$|Different {{areas of}} the brain exhibit {{different}} forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is observed. For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus. The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor, others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether. The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is observed. For example, LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.|$|E
5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{learning}} requires both NMDA and AMPA receptors, consolidation requires NMDA receptors, and the {{retrieval of}} spatial memories requires AMPA receptors.

40|$|We {{investigated}} rearrangements of connectivity between hippocampal <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> and CA 3 pyramidal neurons. We {{found that}} <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> establish 10 - 15 local terminal arborization complexes (LMT-Cs) in CA 3, which exhibit major differences {{in size and}} divergence in adult mice. LMT-Cs exhibited two types of long-term rearrangements in connectivity in the adult: progressive expansion of LMT-C subsets along individual dendrites throughout life, and pronounced increases in LMT-C complexities {{in response to an}} enriched environment. In organotypic slice cultures, subsets of LMT-Cs also rearranged extensively and grew over weeks and months, altering the strength of preexisting connectivity, and establishing or dismantling connections with pyramidal neurons. Differences in LMT-C plasticity reflected properties of individual LMT-Cs, not <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers.</b> LMT-C maintenance and growth were regulated by spiking activity, mGluR 2 -sensitive transmitter release from LMTs, and PKC. Thus, subsets of terminal arborization complexes by <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> rearrange their local connectivities in response to experience and age throughout life...|$|R

500|$|The pre- and postsynaptic {{activity}} {{required to}} induce LTP are other criteria by which LTP is classified. Broadly, this allows classification of LTP into Hebbian, non-Hebbian, and anti-Hebbian mechanisms. Borrowing {{its name from}} Hebb's postulate, summarized by the maxim that [...] "cells that fire together wire together," [...] Hebbian LTP requires simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic depolarization for its induction. Non-Hebbian LTP {{is a type of}} LTP that does not require such simultaneous depolarization of pre- and postsynaptic cells; an example of this occurs in the <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> hippocampal pathway. A special case of non-Hebbian LTP, anti-Hebbian LTP explicitly requires simultaneous presynaptic depolarization and relative postsynaptic hyperpolarization for its induction.|$|E
500|$|Theories in the [...] "learning" [...] {{category}} {{almost all}} derive from publications by Marr and Albus. Marr's 1969 paper {{proposed that the}} cerebellum is a device for learning to associate elemental movements encoded by climbing fibers with <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> inputs that encode the sensory context. Albus proposed in 1971 that a cerebellar Purkinje cell functions as a perceptron, a neurally inspired abstract learning device. The most basic difference between the Marr and Albus theories is that Marr assumed that climbing fiber activity would cause parallel fiber synapses to be strengthened, whereas Albus proposed {{that they would be}} weakened. Albus also formulated his version as a software algorithm he called a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller), which has been tested in a number of applications.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} neuron play {{dominant}} {{roles in the}} cerebellar circuit: Purkinje cells and granule cells. Three types of axons also play dominant roles: <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> and climbing fibers (which enter the cerebellum from outside), and parallel fibers (which are the axons of granule cells).

40|$|AbstractSynapse {{formation}} requires {{changes in}} cell morphology and the upregulation and localization of synaptic proteins.

50|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it.

50|$|In this case, {{the pathway}} is so {{named for a}} unique synapse formed by its projections, the <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> rosette. Fine {{branches}} of the <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> axons twist through the granule cell layer, and slight enlargements giving a knotted appearance indicate synaptic contacts. These contacts have {{the appearance of a}} classic Gray's type 1 synapse, indicating they are glutamatergic and excitatory. Sensory information relayed from the pons through the mossy fibers to the granule cells is then sent along the parallel fibers to the Purkinje cells for processing. Extensive branching in white matter and synapses to granular cells ensures that input from a single <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> axon will influence processing in {{a very large number of}} Purkinje cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of the cerebellar glomeruli is about 2.5 um in diameter, and is enwrapped by glial sheathing. Glomeruli are centered on the large axonal terminals of glutamatergic afferent <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers.</b> Each of these terminals {{come into contact with}} dendrites from 50-60 different granule cells. The granule cells themselves each have a single or multiple dendrites, and each participate in a different glomerulus. Glomeruli also contain the GABAergic (inhibitory) synapses of Golgi cells onto granule cells, and the glutamatergic (excitatory) synapses from <b>mossy</b> <b>fibers</b> onto Golgi cells. Each glomerulus contains approximately 50 granule cell dendrites, 210 total dendritic digits, and 230 synaptic junctions.|$|R

This brain region contains three main neuronal cell types- Purkinje cells, granule cells and <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> cells.

Granule cells express Wnt-7a to promote axon spreading and branching in their synaptic partner, <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> cells. [...] secretion of Wnt-7a to <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> cells causes growth cone enlargement by spreading microtubules. Furthermore, Wnt-7a retrograde signaling recruits synaptic vesicles and presynaptic proteins to the synaptic active zone. Wnt-5a performs a similar function on postsynaptic granule cells; this Wnt stimulates receptor assembly and clustering of the scaffolding protein PSD-95.|$|E
50|$|These nuclei receive {{inhibitory}} (GABAergic) inputs from Purkinje {{cells in}} the cerebellar cortex and excitatory (glutamatergic) inputs from <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> and climbing fiber pathways. Most output fibers of the cerebellum originate from these nuclei. One exception is that fibers from the flocculonodular lobe synapse directly on vestibular nuclei without first passing through the deep cerebellar nuclei. The vestibular nuclei in the brainstem are analogous structures to the deep nuclei, since they receive both <b>mossy</b> <b>fiber</b> and Purkinje cell inputs.|$|E

Intrahippocampal colchicine injections, which selectively destroy dentate granule cells, significantly decrease the dynorphin-ir and enkephalin-ir levels in rat hippocampus.
