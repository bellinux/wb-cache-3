5000|$|Prior to the December setbacks, the <b>Moukhabarat</b> (Arabic: المخابرات السورية), the Syrian Intelligence Service, assassinated {{several members}} of the {{predominantly}} Christian Kataeb and Ahrar parties in order to turn one against the other, but the local leaders of these parties were aware of the Syrian plans. Congregating surreptitiously in and around Zahle, the <b>Moukhabarat</b> then facilitated the entry into the town of a small dissident Christian militia commanded by Elias El-Hannouche (nicknamed [...] "Hannache"), the Free Tigers (also known as the [...] "Hannache Group"). Tensions between the local right-wing LF militiamen and the newcomers soon began to mount. The catalyst to the initial setbacks ensued when Hannache and its Free Tigers attempted to seize control of the offices of the National Liberal Party (NLP) in Zahle. On December 22, 1980, clashes broke out between local LF members and the Hannache's Free Tigers, which resulted ultimately in the expulsion of the latter from Zahle. After previous failed attempts, the Syrians tried to enter the city, but the LF responded swiftly and during the confrontation a total of five Syrian soldiers were killed. As a result, the Syrian Forces shelled the overpopulated city for six consecutive hours, to pressure the Zahlawis to hand over the militiamen responsible for the killings. To further increase the psychological pressure on the town's inhabitants and its LF garrison, the Syrian checkpoints dispersed around {{the outskirts of the city}} blocked the flow of foodstuffs and other supplies going in and out from Zahle, and Syrian MIGs flew over the city for a long period of time. [...] On the international level, the disproportionate Syrian reaction triggered widespread international criticism. France for example, described the shelling as a barbaric act; Washington described the shelling as a deplorable Syrian act. Consequently, the shelling stopped due to the international pressure; the turmoil cooled off between January and March due to heavy snow storms the city endured during the winter of 1980-81. The two sides, however, remained alert while preparing for the upcoming conclusive battle.|$|E
