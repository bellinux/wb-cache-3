5|$|On August 13, 2015, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} {{programming}} and development deal, Sesame Workshop announced that first-run episodes of Sesame Street would move to premium television service HBO (which had not aired any original children's programming since 2005) in late 2015. Sesame Workshop sought the deal because of declining revenue from viewer donations, and decreases in distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales (particularly through Sesame Workshop's dependence upon revenue from DVD sales), with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion (HBO already had involvement in public television {{at the time of the}} deal, providing funding for the talk show Charlie Rose); the deal also came in the wake of changing viewer habits of American children over the previous ten years. HBO will hold first-run rights to all newer episodes of the series starting with season 46, after which they will air on PBS member stations following a nine-month exclusivity window, with no charge to the stations for airing the content; however, HBO has not announced whether first-run episodes will air on the pay service's main channel or its <b>multiplex</b> <b>channel</b> HBO Family. The agreement also gives HBO exclusive rights to stream past and future Sesame Street episodes on HBO Go and HBO Now – assuming those rights from Amazon Video and Netflix. On August 14, Sesame Workshop announced that it would phase out its in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, as a standalone service; instead of shutting it down entirely, it intends to scale back its offerings to either provide access to a reduced slate of free content or act as a portal for Sesame Streets website.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other pay {{television}} networks (including the multiplex channels of sister channel Cinemax), HBO does not brand its programming with on-screen logo bugs {{of the main}} network and each respective <b>multiplex</b> <b>channel</b> – although its multiplex channels do display logo bugs during promotional breaks between programs.|$|E
25|$|The first {{changes made}} {{following}} the original rollout of the multiplex occurred in 2001, with the rebranding of BET Movies: Starz! as Black Starz! after BET {{withdrew from the}} partnership during its acquisition by Viacom (which owned rival pay service Showtime at the time) in 2001. A seventh Starz <b>multiplex</b> <b>channel</b> was launched in 2004: Starz! Kids was created as a movie service featuring films aimed at children between 2 and 11 years of age, maintaining a format {{similar to that of}} Starz! Family. Unlike the other Starz multiplex channels, Starz! Kids was launched on cable systems on a case-by-case basis instead of on a broader national scale.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the service}} provider, Encore Avenue {{provided}} up to four <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> - two 24-hour <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels,</b> {{both of which were}} simulcast in both standard definition and high definition.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the service}} provider, MoviePlex {{provides}} up to six <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> - three 24-hour <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels,</b> which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition - {{as well as a}} subscription video-on-demand service (MoviePlex On Demand).|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} the only first-run {{original}} program produced specifically for any of Showtime's seven <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> (the bulk of the network's first-run original programming airs on the main Showtime channel, and is replayed on its various <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels,</b> including Pop).|$|R
25|$|The tie to Encore branding-wise {{continued}} even as Starz {{was given}} its own slate of multiplex channels {{in the late}} 1990s. The first of these to debut was Starz! 2 in 1996, maintaining a set lineup of four different movies scheduled at the same times each day (inspired by the scheduling used by movie theaters) with the slate of films changing each Friday. This was followed in 1997 by the debut of {{a joint venture with}} BET Networks called BET Movies: Starz! 3. Two additional multiplex channels began operations in May 1999. Starz! Family carried family-oriented theatrical and home video film releases, was launched possibly in response to HBO's own family-oriented <b>multiplex</b> <b>channel,</b> HBO Family, which debuted three years earlier. The other service was Starz! Cinema, a channel featuring critically acclaimed independent films and movies outside of the mainstream cinema. Starz! 2 was also renamed Starz! Theater to better reflect its format.|$|E
25|$|On May 20, 2012, Dish Network removed Sundance Channel {{from its}} channel lineup. Two weeks later on June 4, 2012, Dish {{relocated}} AMC, WE tv, and IFC to higher channel positions with AMC being {{split into two}} separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds (AMC moved from channel 130 to channel 9609 for the SD feed and 9610 for the HD feed, WE tv moved from channel 128 to channel 9608 and IFC was moved from channel 393 to channel 9607); the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with HDNet, Style and MoviePlex <b>multiplex</b> <b>channel</b> Indieplex. The move {{is believed to be}} in response to an ad run during a June 3 airing of an episode of Mad Men urging Dish Network customers to inform the company to keep the three AMC Networks channels on the satellite provider with Dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels' ratings.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Multiplex</b> <b>channel</b> Starz Kids & Family also {{features}} some series programming, which {{are aimed at}} young children and pre-teens. That channel runs two program blocks: [...] "Building Blocks", a block airing on Monday through Saturday mornings that features animated series (such as Dragon Hunters, Gawayn, Zombie Hotel, Savage Family Wild and Matt's Monsters) and the [...] "Six Block" [...] (originally named [...] "Camp Block" [...] from its launch in March 2011 until the two-hour block was moved from mid-afternoon slots varying on the movie schedule to a set timeslot of 6:00p.m. Eastern Time in January 2012), a teen-focused block airing weekday evenings before primetime that features mainly imported series from English-speaking countries outside of the United States like Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom (such as Wingin' It, Majority Rules and Sadie J). The two blocks {{are similar to those}} seen on sister channel Encore's <b>multiplex</b> <b>channel</b> Encore Wam between 1994 and 2009.|$|E
50|$|Three of the <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> - EPIX2, EPIX Hits, and EPIX Drive-In - {{maintain}} less extensive distribution {{than that}} of the primary Epix channel; as such, the availability of any of the three channels varies depending on the carrier (provider availability of the <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> is noted within the descriptions in the table below). Epix broadcasts its primary channel on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules, while its <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> are programmed solely on an Eastern Time Zone schedule.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the service}} provider, Super Channel {{provides}} up to eight <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> - four 24-hour <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels,</b> {{all of which are}} simulcast in both standard definition and high definition - as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (Super Channel On Demand). Super Channel broadcasts its primary <b>channel</b> and <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> on an Eastern Time Zone schedule, operating a singular feed for all channels, this results in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the service}} provider, Epix {{provides}} up to eight <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> - four 24-hour <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels,</b> three of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition (with the exception of EPIX Drive-In, which broadcasts solely in standard definition) - {{as well as a}} subscription video-on-demand service (Epix on Demand).|$|R
2500|$|... "HBO The Works" [...] {{continued}} in use as the brand for the HBO multiplex until 2004. Individually, the HBO <b>multiplex</b> <b>channel</b> suite has no [...] "official" [...] marketed name , although HBO and Cinemax's respective multiplex packages are marketed collectively as the [...] "HBO/MAX Pak". HBO Family and HBO Latino had {{the distinction of}} being the only multiplex channels of HBO that have their own websites, as all of the others were integrated within the main HBO site; the separate sites and sections for both channels were eliminated in 2010, around the time the HBO Go service was launched.|$|E
2500|$|The entire {{multiplex}} was overhauled on March 28, 2005, {{as part of}} {{an extensive}} rebranding of the Starz and Encore services. While Encore debuted a slightly modified logo and applied the [...] "Encore" [...] brand to the names of its six multiplex channels, Starz underwent a more dramatic makeover, with a completely redesigned logo – which included the exclamation mark being dropped from the channel's name – and a standardized graphics package that was implemented across all of its channels (with some modifications for each channel's format). The programming formats of several channels changed entirely: Starz! Theater was relaunched as Starz Edge, a movie channel aimed primarily at men 18 to 34 years old (nicknamed [...] "The New Generation" [...] by the channel). Starz! Kids and Starz! Family were combined into a single channel called Starz Kids and Family, to make room for a new channel focusing on comedic feature films called Starz Comedy. Black Starz! also changed its name to Starz InBlack. The only <b>multiplex</b> <b>channel</b> (other than the primary feed) that retained its original name was Starz Cinema.|$|E

25|$|Depending on {{the service}} provider, Starz {{provides}} up to twelve <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> – six 24-hour <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels,</b> {{all of which are}} simulcast in both standard definition and high definition – as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (Starz On Demand). Starz broadcasts its primary and <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> on Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Starz channel), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.|$|R
25|$|Depending on {{the service}} provider, HBO {{provides}} up to thirteen <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> – seven 24-hour <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels,</b> {{all of which are}} simulcast in both standard definition and high definition – as well as a subscription video-on-demand service (HBO On Demand). Off-the-air maintenance periods of a half-hour up to two hours occur during overnight periods at scattered times on each channel once each month.|$|R

50|$|Depending on {{the service}} provider, Showtime {{provides}} up to fifteen <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> - eight 24-hour <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels,</b> seven of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition (with the exception of Showtime Family Zone, which broadcasts solely in standard definition) - {{as well as a}} subscription video-on-demand service (Showtime On Demand). Showtime broadcasts its primary and <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Showtime channel), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.|$|R

TMN Encore broadcasts its primary and <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> on an Eastern Time Zone schedule. Because The Movie Network Encore operates a singular feed and its original license was restricted to broadcast solely in a geographical area covered by the Eastern, Atlantic, and Newfoundland time zones, this results in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being 4 and half hours at most.|$|R

The original HD channel initially operated as MHD from launch of the HD feed in January 2006 until April 1, 2008. Until September 2010, TMN Encore HD (at that time known as Mpix HD) alternated between simulcasts of Mpix and its <b>multiplex</b> <b>channel</b> MorePix; at that point it began simulcasting its main channel exclusively. A high definition simulcast of TMN Encore 2 was launched on September 23, 2012.|$|E

5000|$|The entire {{multiplex}} was rebranded {{to bring}} the individual channels back {{in line with the}} overall Encore brand on March 28, 2005, due to focus tests that revealed that viewers did not know the themed channels were directly related to the service's main channel. All of the <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> had the [...] "Encore" [...] brand incorporated into the names of each channel, though three of the Encore <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> underwent more extensive name changes: True Stories rebranded as Encore Drama, Love Stories became Encore Love and WAM!: America's Kidz Network became simply Encore Wam. Additional changes to the Encore multiplex came on August 1, 2011, with the launch of a Spanish-language simulcast of Encore's primary channel called Encore Español, and the respective rebrands and refocusings of Encore Mystery and the teen-targeted Encore Wam into Encore Suspense and Encore Family (the latter channel adopting a format similar to that of sister service Starz Kids & Family); Encore Westerns and Encore Action became the only Encore <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels</b> to retain the naming schemes that were in use since the multiplex's original 1994 launch (prior to the incorporation of the [...] "Encore" [...] name in the branding of the <b>multiplex</b> <b>channels).</b>|$|R
