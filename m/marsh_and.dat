5|$|Edward Drinker Cope – An American paleontologist, Cope {{spent nearly}} {{all his money}} in attacking <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> {{financing}} further digs for bones out west; he dies destitute.|$|E
5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from a piece in The Philadelphia Inquirer which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> Powell. Marsh himself kept the Herald story alive with a fiery rebuttal, {{but by the end}} of January the story had faded from all {{the newspaper}}s, and little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E
5|$|Othnielosaurus is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur {{that lived}} about 155to 148million years ago, during the Late Jurassic-age Morrison Formation {{of the western}} United States. It is {{named in honor of}} famed {{paleontologist}} Othniel Charles <b>Marsh,</b> <b>and</b> was formerly assigned to the genus Laosaurus. This genus was coined to hold fossils formerly included in Othnielia, which is based on remains that may be too sparse to hold a name; as such, it is part of decades of research to untangle the taxonomy left behind by <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> his rival Edward Drinker Cope from the Bone Wars. Othnielosaurus has usually been classified as a hypsilophodont, a type of generalized small bipedal herbivore or omnivore, although recent research has called this and the existence of a distinct group of hypsilophodonts into question.|$|E
50|$|Its {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> lakes in sub-Saharan Africa. They build a floating nest in <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> swamps, laying 2-5 eggs. This species is partially migratory, undertaking seasonal movements.|$|R

5|$|The Stanleys were {{positioned}} {{on the south}} side of the battlefield, on rising ground towards Stoke Golding and Dadlington. The Earl of Oxford turned north to avoid the <b>marsh</b> (<b>and</b> possibly Richard's guns). This manoeuvre put the marsh on Oxford's right. He moved to attack Norfolk's vanguard. Norfolk was subsequently killed.|$|E
5|$|The first bird hides were {{constructed}} in 1984, overlooking the East <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> Teal Pools. Quarrying ceased in 1989, and by 1991 the Trust had moved their headquarters {{to the site}} and erected a small visitor centre.|$|E
5|$|The site spans 185 {{million years}} of {{geological}} history, coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, {{this area has}} been desert, shallow tropical sea and <b>marsh,</b> <b>and</b> the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the rocks.|$|E

5|$|Although {{much of the}} SSSI is {{in private}} hands, {{considerable}} areas are managed by large conservation organisations. As well as the two NNRs, there is an RSPB reserve at Titchwell <b>Marsh,</b> <b>and</b> Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserves are at Cley and Salthouse Marshes. The NWT also manages the Holme Dunes NNR. In addition to Blakeney Point, the National Trust owns land at Brancaster Staithe.|$|E
5|$|Ashford's first bypass {{was opened}} on 19 July 1957 by the then Minister of Transport, Harold Watkinson. The main road through Ashford {{is now the}} M20, which opened in stages between 1981 and 1991. Junctions 9 and 10 serve the town. The other main roads are the A28 to Canterbury, the A2070 to Romney <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> Rye and the A251 to Faversham.|$|E
5|$|Bolton's cup run started slowly, with {{a replay}} {{required}} to overcome non-league Reading. A 4–1 victory over Southampton secured a quarter-final berth at Sheffield United. As a Second Division {{team with a}} poor away record, Wanderers were clear underdogs in the quarter-final, particularly in view of Sheffield United's strong home form. Nevertheless, Bolton prevailed 2–0 courtesy of goals by Sam <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> Billy Yenson. At this point Marsh had scored in every round of the competition. A 1–0 defeat of Derby County in the semi-final took Bolton to the final.|$|E

50|$|Baccharis halimifolia, {{usually found}} in wetlands, is unusually salt-tolerant, and often found along salty or {{brackish}} shores of <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> estuaries, and the inland shores of coastal barrier islands. In Florida, {{it is also}} found along ditches, in old fields, and in other disturbed areas. Other habitats in the northeastern United States include freshwater tidal <b>marshes</b> <b>and</b> open woods and thickets along the seacoast.|$|R

5|$|Despite Riggs' publication, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> his taxa, labeled the Apatosaurus mount of the American Museum of Natural History Brontosaurus. Because of this decision the name Brontosaurus was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what Riggs considered Apatosaurus, and the museum's popularity meant that Brontosaurus {{became one of the}} best known dinosaurs, even though it was invalid throughout nearly all of the 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Pero's {{footbridge}} was constructed, {{linking the}} At-Bristol exhibition with Bristol tourist attractions. In 2000, the At-Bristol centre opened on semi-derelict land at Canon's <b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> {{some of the}} existing Grade II listed buildings were refurbished and reused. It was funded with £44.3 million from the National Lottery, the Millennium Commission, South West of England Regional Development Agency, and a further £43.4 million from Bristol City Council and commercial partners, including Nestlé. Private investors are also constructing studio apartment buildings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Marsh</b> <b>and</b> then Hatcher {{assumed that}} the animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center (formerly the Virginia Marine Science Museum) is {{a popular}} {{aquarium}} near the oceanfront that features the 300,000-gallon Norfolk Canyon Aquarium, containing sand tiger, nurse and brown sharks, as well as sting rays and other large open-ocean dwellers. There is also a 70,000-gallon sea turtle aquarium, sea turtle hatchling laboratory, hands-on ocean exploration exhibits, jellyfish and octopus aquariums, and even a life-size model of a humpback whale. Other features include the Owls Creek salt <b>marsh</b> <b>and</b> a nature trail.|$|E
5|$|The large tidal bay of Langstone Harbour lies to {{the east}} of Portsea Island. In the {{northern}} part, off the coast of Farlington, is the Farlington Marshes, a 125-hectare (308-acre) grazing <b>marsh</b> <b>and</b> saline lagoon. One of the oldest local reserves in the county, built from reclaimed land in 1771, it provides an important habitat for migratory wildfowl and waders.|$|E
5|$|The {{pollution}} {{issue is}} a main concern of citizens of Calhoun County, and has attracted demonstrations against industry in Point Comfort. However, Alcoa has worked with state and federal officials, spending $110million {{to reduce the size}} of the superfund site, as part of a 2005 settlement. Cooperation aims to create 70 additional acres of salt <b>marsh</b> <b>and</b> 11 acres of oyster reef habitat.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was {{complicated by the}} American spoils system. After Andrew Jackson assumed the U.S. presidency in March 1829, many competent Indian agents were replaced by unqualified Jackson loyalists, argues historian John Hall. Men like Thomas Forsyth, John <b>Marsh,</b> <b>and</b> Thomas McKenney were replaced by less qualified men such as Felix St. Vrain. In the 19th century, historian Lyman Draper argued that the Black Hawk War {{could have been avoided}} had Forsyth remained as the agent to the Sauks.|$|E
