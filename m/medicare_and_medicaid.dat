5|$|Obama's most {{significant}} legacy {{is generally considered}} to be the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's {{most significant}} regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The act {{includes}} {{a host of}} delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. These include Medicare payment changes to discourage hospital-acquired conditions and readmissions, bundled payment initiatives, the Center for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> Innovation, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, {{and the creation of}} Accountable care organizations.|$|E

Two months after Conner said she ended the affair, Birchtree Healthcare was cited by state regulators for numerous violations of health and safety rules. By July 2002, the state had pulled all <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> payments from the facility, which soon went bankrupt. Conner further alleged that the state investigation of Birchtree was retaliation by Patton for her ending of the affair.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2010, {{the day of}} President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Ryan reintroduced a {{modified}} version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010. The modified plan would have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2016 {{there were}} 32 states (including Washington DC) that had adopted the Medicaid extension, while 19 states had not. Those states that {{expanded}} Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on {{average in the}} first quarter of 2016, while those that did not expand Medicaid had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose Medicaid funding if they didn't expand Medicaid under the ACA, several states rejected expanded Medicaid coverage. Over half of the national uninsured population lived in those states. In a report to Congress, the Centers for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 million to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.|$|E

5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid).</b> See Post-World War II economic expansion for further discussion.|$|E
