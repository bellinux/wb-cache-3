25|$|November 23: After {{becoming}} {{a free agent}} following the conclusion to the 2011 season, the Braves decided to decline arbitration to shortstop Álex González. If the team had accepted his arbitration they would have received a compensatory draft pick {{between the first and}} second rounds of the 2012 MLB draft if González signed with another team. The move <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> González would not return as the starting shortstop in 2012. González looked to receive a multi-year contract on the free agent market, something the Braves were not willing to offer due to rising prospects such as Tyler Pastornicky and Andrelton Simmons. On December 8, González signed a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers for one year and a vesting option for the 2013 season.|$|E
25|$|According to simulations, a two-lane {{roundabout}} {{with three}} right turns should offer 12–20% greater traffic flow than a conventional, three-lane roundabout {{of the same}} size. The reason is reduced weaving that makes entering and exiting more predictable. Because there are only ten points of conflict (compared with 8 for a conventional single lane roundabout, or between 32 and 64 with traffic signal control), this design is often safer as well. Research and experiments show that traffic accidents are reduced by 72% on turbo roundabouts compared to multi-lane roundabouts, which have 12 points of conflict. Research at Windesheim University also shows that turbo roundabouts reduce accidents including casualties by some 75% when compared to regular intersections, and by 61% compared to single-lane roundabouts. The same research <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> it is safer for cyclists not to have priority over motor vehicles on the roundabout, than to have it.|$|E
25|$|The Company <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{published}} timetables {{were only}} {{to indicate the}} times before which a train would not depart and the specified times for each stop were only given as a rough guide. Trains normally made three regular and eight conditional stops, but 'expresses' did run which did not stop between Bideford and Westward Ho!. With two engines in steam the frequency could be every half-hour, but a train every hour or so was the norm in summer, normally taking about 20 minutes from Bideford to Northam or 15 minutes for the 'express'. Fifteen trains ran in each direction in the July 1906 Bideford to Northam timetable and lighter service of four ran on Sundays. The 1910 Bradshaw's Timetable shows trains taking thirty minutes for the journey from Bideford to Appledore, ten trains in each direction, with an extra run on the Market Days (Tuesdays and Saturdays) and no trains on Sundays. The winter timetable for 1 November 1917 to 30 April 1918, which was destined never to be used, was down to seven trains in each direction and no Sunday service. Horse-drawn buses ran from Westward Ho! to Clovelly and through tickets were issued from Instow to cover the journey by ferry, railway and road transport. The bus service cost £51 18s 0d (£51.90) {{to run for the}} six months ending 31 December 1906.|$|E

Pearce won the match by {{disqualification}} when referee Joe Furrer found Creed holding a foreign object that Pearce had actually used.|$|R
500|$|Sir Geoffrey Archer was {{appointed}} Governor-General of Sudan in 1925 {{in place of}} Sir Lee Stack. One of his early decisions was to initiate {{the formation of the}} Sudan Defence Force, with a command completely separate from the Egyptian army. He dropped the Egyptian title [...] "Sirdar" [...] for the supreme commander, and did not wear the Egyptian tarboush. He <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he was commander in chief of a purely Sudanese army, while reassuring Sudanese officers who had served in the Egyptian army that they would be retained if they had not taken part in the mutiny. The British authorities, who had again became hostile to Mahdism, banned enlistment of Ansar into the Sudanese Defence Force.|$|E
500|$|While in Italy, Madonna {{met some}} of her {{relatives}} from Pacentro, the village in which her grandfather and grandmother, Gaetano and Michelina Ciccone had been married. However, {{it was not the}} glorious home coming that she had expected; {{some of her}} relatives <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they were scandalized by her appearance and behavior. One good thing came from the visit, there were talks of making her an honorary citizen of the town. Ultimately, a statue of Madonna, wearing conical bra was elected in her name, {{at the center of the}} town. The Vatican was outraged by the plans of erecting the statue, with the Pope's spokesperson commenting: [...] "The statue would be too sexy and might corrupt the morals of Italy's fine young people." ...|$|E

Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, {{this is a guy who}} has never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one. We’ll see pretty quickly that it’s an uneasy alliance and it’s going to cause a lot of drama." ...|$|E

500|$|The Paris {{delegation}}, led by Bertrand Delanoë, {{argued that}} Tony Blair and the London delegation {{had broken the}} IOC rules. On 11 July 2005, Delanoë stated: [...] "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee. I do not {{say that they were}} flirting with the yellow line, I say that they crossed the yellow line". A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes, which included free flights, food, vouchers for long-distance calling and other financial accommodations. Immediately after announcing the initiative, London withdrew it, most likely as a result of Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a [...] "bidding war". Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal, an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street. It was not until 4 August 2005 that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement: [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> in my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out". Delanoë's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders; Claude Goasguen, president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party of the Council of Paris, stated: [...] "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".|$|E
2500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Test series, a match was played in Sydney in which a United Australian Eleven defeated The Hon. Ivo Bligh's Eleven by four wickets. This seems to have given rise in Melbourne to some debate about whether it should have counted as a Fourth Test. However, The Sydney Morning Herald <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> this game {{was not part of the}} international [...] "rubber" [...] which had in fact been won by England. There were also other matches played between the English and the individual State cricket teams over the tour.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{few years}} from 1991, the show adopted a live vocal to {{pre-recorded}} backing track policy. Performing [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain dropped his voice an octave and changed the opening line to [...] "Load up on drugs, kill your friends"; the band also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they were not playing their instruments. (Cobain later said during {{an interview that he}} wanted to sound more like Morrissey during the performance.) It also exposed a number of poor live singers, and was dropped as a general rule. [...] It was not helped {{by the fact that it}} coincided with a sudden upsurge of chart success for dance tracks which were heavily sample-based and whose sound could not easily be reproduced in a TV studio – sampled vocals from other tracks had to be sung live.|$|E
50|$|Filipp Ivanovich Golikov, (Russian: Филипп Иванович Голиков; July 30, 1900 - July 29, 1980) was a Soviet {{military}} commander. He is {{best known}} for not passing on to Stalin intelligence about Nazi invasion plans in June 1941, either because he did not believe them or because Stalin <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> {{he did not want to}} hear them. He was promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1961.|$|R
5000|$|Merton <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> however, that unanticipated {{consequences}} and latent functions {{are not the}} same. Latent functions are one type of unanticipated consequences; functional for the designated system. According to Merton, there are also two other types of unanticipated consequences: [...] "those that are dysfunctional for a designated system, and these comprise the latent dysfunctions, and those which are irrelevant to the system which they affect neither functionally or dysfunctionally ... non-functional consequences".|$|R

This is something that he really was going to promote and support, and he has done that, and in a sense he is the abortion president." [...] Among others, Rep. Janice Hahn complained because Dobson used the National Day of Prayer for partisan purposes. She said, [...] "Dobson just blew a hole into this idea of being a nonpartisan National Day of Prayer. It was very disturbing to me...and really a shame. James Dobson hijacked the National Day of Prayer — this nonpartisan, nonpolitical National Day of Prayer — to promote his own distorted political agenda." ...|$|E
2500|$|Announcing the ban, Sheikh Hamdan <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> [...] "no-one {{would be}} {{permitted}} to ride camels in camel-races unless they had a minimum weight of 45 kg, and are not less than 15 years old, as stated in their passports." [...] He said a medical committee would examine each candidate to be a jockey to check that the age stated in their passport was correct and that the candidate was medically fit. Sheikh Hamdan said all owners of camel racing stables {{would be responsible for}} returning children under 15 to their home countries. He also announced the introduction of a series of penalties for those breaking the new rules. For a first offense, a fine of 20,000 AED was to be imposed. For a second offense, the offender would be banned from participating in camel races for a period of a year, while for third and subsequent offense, terms of imprisonment would be imposed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1944 the {{periodic}} variations broke off, and RR Tel brightened {{by more than}} 7 magnitudes {{over the course of}} about four years. [...] Starting about mpg 14 in late 1944, survey plates recorded it brighter than magnitude 8 early in 1945, and the star was observed at mpg 7.4 in September–October 1946, 7.0 in March 1948, and 6.0 in July 1948. [...] In 1948 it was noticed, and received the designation Nova Tel 1948. [...] In July 1949 the star began fading slowly. [...] The information about RR Tel's pre-outburst behavior as seen in the Harvard survey plates was published in February 1949, and the already long duration of the outburst, years as opposed to days or weeks, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> RR Tel had to be very different from the novae which had been previously observed; it was called a slow nova in acknowledgement of that not understood difference.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} in the media that Duke endorsed 2016 presidential nominee Donald Trump for president. Duke responded on his personal website by saying that he had not actually endorsed Trump. He later clarified that while he viewed Trump as [...] "the best of the lot", due to his stance on immigration, Trump's support for Israel was a dealbreaker for him. Duke claimed that [...] "Trump has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he's 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, so how much is left over for America?" [...] In December 2015, Duke said Donald Trump speaks more radically than he does, advising that Trump's radical speech is both a positive and a negative. In February 2016, Duke urged his listeners to vote Trump, saying that voting for anyone besides Donald Trump “is really treason to your heritage.” In 2016, someone claiming to be David Duke filed a lawsuit in a federal court attempting to bar Trump from the Florida presidential primary. The real Duke referred to the hoax as [...] "the biggest, dirtiest trick I've seen recently".|$|E
2500|$|On his return, Sunderland {{formally}} {{reverted to}} Anglicanism, taking the oaths in April 1691 and quietly recommenced {{sitting in the}} House of Lords. In May William {{paid a visit to}} him at his home in Althorp, Northamptonshire, to discuss public affairs. Over the next years the King frequently visited him and gave him confidence, but Sunderland did not dare to fully enter public life until September 1693, when he took a house in the city. He repeatedly advised the King to select all of his ministers from one political party, and eventually effected a reconciliation between William and his sister-in-law, the later Queen Anne. He was an influential adviser, inducing William to accept only Whigs in his government. William, never vindictive, was untroubled by Sunderland's past services to James, who had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Sunderland was the one man he would never forgive, though he had made tentative advances towards the fallen King. Most of William's servants had at sometime betrayed him, and he valued Sunderland for his frankness and ability to voice unwelcome truths. It has been suggested that Sunderland's notorious rudeness actually appealed to the King, who detested flattery and could himself be distinctly rude. Once when William said that, while the Whigs personally liked him better than the Tories, the Tories were better friends to Monarchy, Sunderland shrewdly replied: [...] "but you must consider that you are not their Monarch". He even wrote a letter telling the King that if his Ministers were not fit for his service, it was his own fault for not choosing better men.|$|E
