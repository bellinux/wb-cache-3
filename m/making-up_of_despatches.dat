30|$|When {{breaking}} up the cars of each train should be directed to the classification track {{in accordance with their}} purpose for the subsequent <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> new trains. If in the process of rolling down of cars to different tracks of classification yard, the time intervals between them are not long enough for switching of points, some of the cars will be misrouted. As a result, {{there is a need to}} re-hump the cars, which leads to economic losses associated with additional operation of shunting locomotives and increase in the idle time of cars at the yard. In addition, accidental change of destination track of cars can lead to their over-speed coupling with the cars standing at the track, as a result, damaging the cars and cargoes. Therefore, providing time intervals between the cars necessary to prepare the routes for their rolling down to the desired destinations is an important task. Solution of this task will make it possible to reduce the cost <b>of</b> breaking- and <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> trains at the yards and improve the safety of the humping process.|$|R
30|$|Sorting humps are {{the main}} {{technical}} means providing the breaking- and <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> freight trains. Efficiency of their operation impacts largely on both the cost price {{and the safety of}} freight traffic on the railways. Automation of sorting process by implementing microprocessor control systems is the main direction of increasing hump yard capacity, enhancing safety in trains breaking-up, and improving working conditions on hump yards. However, the high complexity and cost of such systems limits their use on the railways. Therefore, the search for ways to improve microprocessor control systems for sorting humps, aimed at reducing their cost, is a crucial task.|$|R

5000|$|Thornton-Cleveleys (originally simply-named Cleveleys) was a small-sized {{railway station}} which served the two English Lancashire towns of Thornton and Cleveleys, but was {{situated}} in the centre of Thornton. Located on the now disused line between [...] and , the station also had a shunting yard for the <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> freight trains for [...] and beyond. During its life it was also known at times as Thornton station and Thornton for Cleveleys station. In the 1860s and early 1870s the line was of great importance being the direct route from London to Glasgow. Before the Shap route was opened, passengers (allegedly including Queen Victoria) would travel from Euston to Fleetwood and then onwards via steamer to Scotland.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{staining}} mucin is described. The stain used is alcian blue 8 GS The method is rapid and easy in application. The results {{are clear and}} permanent. I disadvantages of most staining methods employed for the demon-X stration of mucin in histological sections of animal tissues are as follows: 1. Doubtful specificity. Not only mucins accept the stain; other elements such as nuclei, connective tissues, &c, may do so as well. 2. Loss of stain. In some cases where mucin is stained in a specific manner by dilution of the stain used, by adjustment of the pH of the stain solution, or by metachromatic properties of the stain, it is frequently difficult or impossible to dehydrate, clear, and mount the section without either immediate or later loss of the stain. 3. The stained mucin may have other stains added to it during additional operations. 4. The staining methods may be involved or may require the <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> reagents which are often unstable...|$|R

40|$|The {{complete}} {{edition of the}} unpublished manuscript Suplemento al Tesoro de la lengua castellana by Sebasti√°n de Covarrubias provides some necessary clues {{to the understanding of}} its author's lexicographic criteria and of a number of personal details, which, in the course of time, have made Covarrubias' work to be considered as something original and unique among the huge Spanish lexicography. Those details of biographic, anecdotic, popular, gastronomic type do not constitute strictly lexicographical information, but this kind of information together with some other of purely lexicographical interest permits us to recompose Covarrubias' skill as a lexicographer, his everyday work in the <b>making-up</b> <b>of</b> the first monolingual dictionary of the Spanish language.

40|$|Most {{research}} on order splitting {{have focused on}} the reduction of safety stock in the multiple sourcing setting. Moreover, all works study the use of order splitting for the continuous review inventory systems. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the multiple-delivery arrangement in the sole sourcing environment. In addition, we concentrate on the reduction of cycle stock for periodic review systems. We show that splitting an order into multiple deliveries can signi"cantly reduce the total cost especially if the cost <b>of</b> <b>despatching</b> an order for an item is not small. Although the use of information technology such as EDI decreases the ordering cost and thus shortens the period length, order splitting remains a cost-e!ective approach as long as the cost <b>of</b> <b>despatching</b> an order is not close to zero.
