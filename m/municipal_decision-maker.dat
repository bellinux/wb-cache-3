Projects address different dimensions of wellbeing, focusing in particular on municipal wellbeing services and patient-centered health care solutions. Designing for Wellbeing highlights new working methods in design, such as service design and the opportunities it provides for <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> {{and the general public}} using the services. The projects are aimed at finding ways of encouraging people to adopt healthier lifestyles and helping designers and <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> to design more pleasant and healthier environments. Examples of the services include redesigning the Villa Breda service home for the elderly in Kauniainen to include cultural services and social events for today’s active retirees, developing the environments and practices in psychiatric care units in Helsinki, reinventing the suburban neighborhoods in Helsinki and Lahti, designing better online services for basic health care and creating smoke-free public environments...|$|R

A multivariate causal model is estimated to measure the effects of social and institutional context, service infrastructure, and billing and payment practices. The analysis shows that cost-recovery outcomes vary widely and are quite sensitive to factors that can be influenced by <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers.</b> Substantive implications for a typical South African municipality are clarified through simulations of the effects of upgrading infrastructure, introducing various cost-recovery measures, and extending basic services to poor households.

40|$|Material flow {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} model different scenarios which help better identify and quantify water supply and wastewater pollution problems {{in the city of}} Kumasi, Ghana. Results show that despite a relative abundance of water resources in the surrounding area of the city, drinking water consumption will remain at a low level (from 49 + 4 l/cap/day in 2006 to 59 + 5 l/cap/day in 2015). Changing sanitation practices to using more flush toilets will require significantly more water if these toilets are to be used adequately. The water-nutrient balance shows that total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) outputs of the modelled area are 10 times higher than system inputs, most of this being attributed to human wastes from sanitation. A number of possible measures to reduce nutrient flows into water bodies were identified and quantified, showing the usefulness of the applied model in providing estimates for <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers...</b>|$|R

With {{a growing}} {{majority of people}} living in cities, urban dwellers and <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> will need to reduce their emissions and other impacts on the regional and global climate while dealing with the unavoidable near-term and potential longer-term impacts of climate change. To facilitate effective societal response to climate change, a busy, distracted, and so far only marginally interested public needs to be engaged on the topic. This poses significant challenges to communication and sustained outreach efforts. This letter draws on critical insights from a three-year multi-disciplinary project that involved academics and practitioners from various disciplines and sectors of (mostly US) society and explored how to communicate climate change in ways that facilitate societal response. The letter raises questions about key audiences, appropriate messengers, framings and messages, reception of climate change information, and the choice of communication mediums and formats to achieve different communication and engagement goals...|$|R
40|$|Dealing with {{waste is}} {{a major issue in}} our {{endeavour}} to create a sustainable society. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a model for assessing sustainable development in waste management systems. The model should provide a valid, reliable, useful and efficient assessment tool for waste management planners. The objective has been to improve methodologies that can support decision-making processes for sustainable waste management. The study is based on a series of case studies in which suitable indicators of sustainability aspects for different types of waste have been developed and incorporated into a model {{that can be used to}} assess the potential for sustainable development of waste management systems. Some important methodological conclusions can be drawn: 1. <b>Municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> prioritise both environmental and financial issues as well as social aspects when they evaluate waste management methods (Paper IV). 2. <b>Municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> and <b>municipal</b> officers consider a holistic systems approach preferable to one that is based only on costs or only on the environmental effects (Paper IV). 3. A method that includes social aspects as well as economic and environmental ones might reach different conclusions than one that only considers eco-efficiency (Paper I). 4. A systems analysis is very dependent on definitions of the complementary systems, so a thorough understanding of possible technological development is crucial for the reliability of the analysis (Paper II). 5. Methods generating results on a very aggregated level, without employing a full life-cycle perspective, or omitting one or more aspects of sustainability, are not valid for sustainable waste management decision making (Papers I, III and IV) 6. A wide-spread opinion among local decision makers and municipal officers, that national directives and objectives for waste management are poorly adapted to the conditions of sparsely populated regions (Paper IV), does not seem to find support from systems analysis using sustainable development indicators (Papers I and II). In addition to the methodological findings, the study also reveals how different options for waste management in a sparsely populated Scandinavian region perform differently in relation to a sustainable development. The study includes solid municipal waste, wastewater and demolition waste. </p...|$|R
40|$|The 21 st {{century is}} fast being {{recognised}} as the ‘century of cities’. More {{than half of}} the world’s population lives in cities now, and the importance of efficient urban land use and ‘smart’ development has become ever greater over recent decades. Cities are the key centres of human activity and the engines of economic growth in the world today. A world which has been drastically transformed by rapid technological change, expanding globalisation, profound cultural shifts and new economic perspectives. One, moreover, bring a whole range of fresh opportunities and challenges. Traditional ways in which cities were planned and managed increasingly turn out to be less relevant and less sustainable in such times of accelerating change and greater complexity in the global environment. The central thrust of this paper is around the adage: “Imagine ahead – plan backwards”. The paper explores the challenges facing 21 st century cities, their municipal governments and constituent planning agencies. It examines the role of different ‘futures’ approaches applied in order to assist urban planners and <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> in dealing with the issues that lie ahead. It presents examples of different ways in which cities reposition themselves, envision their futures and deal with challenges and opportunities brought about by global and local change...|$|R
40|$|<b>Municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> {{face the}} {{difficult}} task of determining the amount of funds to be allocated for fire department services. This decision affects both the insurance class {{of the city and the}} total cost of fire protection. Total fire protection cost is the sum of the tax dollars spent for fire department services (public expenditures) and fire insurance premiums paid by residents and businesses (private expenditures). This paper presents an integer programming model to minimize the sum of these two costs. Since insurance costs reflect only property losses the model does not explicitly include the consequences of loss of life or injury. Since the protection of persons is an important part of the fire protection mission it is important to realize that the model produces a lower bound for the value and level of fire department services. We go on to show how the results can be used to provide a method of inputing a life hazard benefit for decisions which produce more fire protection than suggested by the cost-minimizing model. The model was applied in Boulder, Colorado; the ways in which the results may be incorporated into the political decision process are also described. planning: urban, programming: integer, applications, government: services, fire...|$|R
40|$|How {{and why is}} urban {{agriculture}} {{taken up}} into local food policies and sustainability plans? This paper uses {{a case study of}} urban agriculture policymaking in New York City from 2007 to 2011 to examine the power-laden operation of urban environmental governance. It explores several ‘faces of power,’ including overt authority, institutionalized ‘rules of the game,’ and hegemony. It also investigates how multiple actors interact in policymaking processes, including through the construction and use of broad discursive concepts. Findings draw upon analysis of policy documents and semi-structured interviews with 43 subjects engaged in food systems policymaking. Some <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> questioned the significance of urban agriculture, due to the challenges of quantifying its benefits and the relative scarcity of open space in the developed city. Yet, these challenges proved insufficient to prevent a coalition of civic activists working in collaboration with public officials to envision plans on food policy that included urban agriculture. Actors created the ‘local/regional food system’ as a narrative concept in order to build broad coalitions and gain entry to the municipal policy sphere. Tracing the roll-out of plans reveals the way in which both the food systems concept and specific policy proposals were repeated and legitimized. Unpacking the dynamics of this iterative policymaking contributes to an understanding of how urban environmental governance happens in this case...|$|R
40|$|Cities {{can be seen}} {{as complex}} systems of {{heterogeneous}} processes with a high variety of different influences (e. g. social, infrastructural, economic, and political impacts). This especially applies for tasks concerning urban development of existing assets. The optimization of traffic flows, reduction of emissions, improvement of energy efficiency, but also urban climate and landscape planning issues require the involvement of many different actors, balancing different perspectives, and divergent claims. The increasing complexities of planning and decision processes make high demands on professionals of various disciplines, government departments, and <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers.</b> In the long term, topics like urban resilience, energy management, risk and resource management have {{to be taken into account}} and reflected in future projects, but always related to socio-spatial and governmental aspects. Accordingly, it is important to develop models to be able to understand and analyze the outcomes and effects of governmental measures and planning to the urban environment. Thus, a more systematic approach is needed – going away from welldefined city models to city system models. The purpose is to describe urban processes not only quantitatively, but to grasp their qualitative complexity and interdependencies, by modeling and simulating existing urban systems. This contribution will present the City System Model (CSM) concept closely related to an Urban Energy Planning use case, will highlight the methodology, and focus on first results and findings from an ongoing interdisciplinary research project and use case to improve the basis of information for decision-makers and politicians about urban planning decisions...|$|R

Two attractive second home island destinations is being compared in Ven, Landskrona and Gudhjem, Bornholm. The study addresses issues such as the local effects of a regulation of the second home market get at a local level, and the effects generated by deregulation, as well as local people's opinions about second home regulation in a popular second home area in southern Sweden.   This has been examined using a mix between qualitative method and quantitative methods, and the study is based on six semi-structured interviews from informants from Ven, Bornholm, and Gudhjem which has been analyzed throughout a thematic analysis. In addition to the interviews, diagrams from the Central Bureau of Statistics of Sweden and Statistics Denmark, and various real estate websites, and a field observation from Ven and Gudhjem will be presented. The result shows that show that the discussion on residence requirement has been going on for a long time in Sweden and Ven, but the local organizations found more disadvantages than advantages and are now looking in to other solutions, while other locals believes that there are more advantages with a residence requirement. In Denmark it’s revealed that there is recently started discussion between <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> and local organizations about the regulations, and if it should be abolished or not. It turns out that the directions of the local effects being positive or negative depends a lot on the resort's contemporary expertise in local organizations, the population basis and to what extent the resort attracts people to stay there permanently for a living. The results also implies that some regulations in Denmark will not be deregulated, while it is still an active political discussion in Denmark...|$|R

Our article focuses on the last ones and questions some ecosystem services they offer, in order to know if they are urban green spaces like others. This study comes in the framework of the research program SERVEUR (funded by the French Centre-Val de Loire region), which is interested in the services given by urban green spaces. Here we set out one case-study, the Bergeonnerie allotments in Tours (France). To identify the services these allotments offer, we conducted: - in situ observations and surveys of Bergeonnerie allotments users, - interviews of some <b>municipal</b> stakeholders and <b>decision-makers</b> of several cities of the region Centre-Val de Loire. The in situ study revealed that allotments offered not only provisioning services – according to the MEA [1] ecosystem services list, in this case food. They also provide cultural services, becoming a source of well-being for the gardeners but not only. We could observe that some other people come in these green spaces, like in other ones, to walk. They are places of sociability and education, what the <b>municipal</b> stakeholders and <b>decision-makers</b> confirm. Allotments give more benefits for the population than expected; they are more than places used to cultivate vegetables...|$|R
40|$|As issues {{regarding}} food security {{have become more}} prevalent in the developed world, the popularity of methods to combat these issues, such as urban agriculture (UA), have risen. In this environment, <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> and planners have started to make food and urban agriculture a priority. This thesis contributes to that end by exploring how planning tools, policies and regulations {{have an effect on}} urban agriculture in Canada. An inventory of urban agriculture activities was created for large and mid-sized cities across Canada to determine the prevalence and location of activity types. Ten cities with the highest and most varied types of UA were chosen for more in-depth case study exploration. A policy scan and semi-structured interviews with planners were conducted for each of the case study municipalities to determine if planning had contributed to the success of UA in their community. The results of the inventory revealed fourteen different types of urban agriculture present across Canada, with community gardens being the most popular. In terms of geographic distribution, the majority of UA activity is concentrated on the east and west coasts. Large cities tend to have not only a wider variety of UA, but also more urban agriculture per capita than mid-sized cities. Of the planning tools examined, case study results indicate that zoning and by-laws have the most biggest impact on UA. Although many of the case study cities incorporate food or UA in their municipal plans, these were generally not seen as having much of an effect. Factors outside of planning such as local food history and context, a “green ethic”, interest in getting back to the land, and the support of key individuals were shown to have a larger influence on the prevalence of UA. 	Recommendations for planners that want to have a greater influence on UA include ensuring that zoning and by-laws are permissive; incorporating food and UA into official plans; monitoring indicators related to UA; having public engagement strategies that are specifically targeted to issues of food and urban agriculture; and cultivating a close relationship with the local food policy council...|$|R

40|$|Santa Fe’s WaterMAPS model helps <b>municipal</b> policy-level <b>decision-makers,</b> {{water utility}} and {{resource}} managers, and operations staff {{make decisions on}} how to best manage and conserve water supplies. The City of Santa Fe, with CDM, has developed Santa Fe WaterMAPS (Water Management and Planning Simulation), a STELLA-based water system simulation model that characterizes the relationship between water resources attributes. By maximizing operational use of surface water, for example, the City conserves the groundwater resources for drought protection. The model allows for easy manipulation of highly-variable attributes (e. g., surface water supply, conservation, demand), so that the effects on the behavior on other integral parts of the system, like reservoir storage, groundwater supply, nearby stream systems, or water rights, can be assessed. The model informs both daily operational and long-range planning decision and gives utility managers and operators the unique ability to test the implications of operations decisions before implementation. In daily operations, the model helps operators choose which source to prioritize for use – particularly in lower demand seasons – based on factors such as historical hydrology, operation and maintenance costs, resource availability, best use of imported water, and effects of groundwater pumping. The model is also a long-range planning tool and {{has been used to}} optimize the use of existing supplies and to evaluate which future water supply options will best meet oftenconflicting objectives such as cost, reliability, and sustainability...|$|R
40|$|The urban heat {{island effect}} {{is linked to}} the built {{environment}} and threatens human health during extreme heat events. In this study, we analyzed whether characteristic land uses within an urban area are associated with higher or lower surface temperatures, and whether concentrations of “hot” land uses exacerbate this relationship. Zonal statistics on a thermal remote sensing image for the City of Toronto revealed statistically significant differences between high average temperatures for commercial and resource/industrial land use (29. 1 °C), and low average temperatures for parks and recreational land (25. 1 °C) and water bodies (23. 1 °C). Furthermore, higher concentrations of either of these land uses were associated with more extreme surface temperatures. We also present selected neighborhoods to illustrate these results. The paper concludes by recommending that <b>municipal</b> planners and <b>decision-makers</b> formulate policies and regulations that are specific to the problematic land uses, in order to mitigate extreme heat...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} report investigates {{the impact of}} skills development programmes on the informal traders in the City of Johannesburg (COJ). The research would like to determine if skills development provided by municipality has benefited individual traders, in terms of financial performance and increased employment. The researcher will ascertain the progress between informal traders who receive training {{and those who did}} not participate in the training programme. The report would further establish if there were any impacts at all. Was the impact directly influenced by municipal training or was because of some externalities such as trader’s innovation or trader’s organisations? To what extent has training been able to reduce the skills gap in the informal business? This research is responding to the lack of previous work on the impact of training offered to informal traders. There is a strong commitment on the part of COJ to dialogue with informal traders. Informal trading is regarded as integral part of broader economy (The Star: 2006 : 21). The research was conducted through in-depth interviews with informal traders operating at Metro Mall in the City Business District (CBD). The researcher conducted interviews with service providers and municipality. The hypothesis suggests that informal traders who receive training are more productive than those who did not participate. The lack of skills in the informal business prompted the COJ to deliver skills training in an attempt to improve the condition of the informal traders. (Simon McGrath 1994), referred to this scenario as “planning for what was traditionally unplanned”. The argument is that training does not make successful informal traders. The report will argue that while training is important to informal traders who arrive in Johannesburg lacking skills, training should be monitored and be accompanied by incentives for example to help those who may not have a start-up capital. The selection criteria will have to be reviewed such that most informal traders are given equal opportunity to acquire skills necessary for the development of their business. As long as these factors, remain un-addressed there are limited potential growth in the informal business. Training should be an integral process linked to various structures such that survivalist activities are replaced by sustainable entrepreneurial business. The duty of the planners as the practitioners in the built environment is to ensure that informal trading coexist with formal business without one affecting negatively on the other. They also have a duty of influencing <b>municipal</b> <b>decision-makers</b> in ensuring that informal traders training programmes reinforce the enabling environment that would allow them to benefit and improve their business undertakings. This may be accomplished by restricting competition from illegal informal traders operating outside the mall, providing incentives to informal traders after the training and organise special events that would attract more customers at the mall. This is because “planning is a profession concerned with the management and development of human beings and their settlements within urban and rural settings. It is about the organisation of human activity in a way that will help to realise their hopes and dreams for future” (www. wits. ac. za/depts/wcs/archschool. html) ...|$|R
