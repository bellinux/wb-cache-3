25|$|I am {{forced to}} the appalling {{conclusion}} that I {{would never have}} become a writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization {{of the extent to}} which this event has motivated and formulated <b>my</b> <b>writing.</b> I live with the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which I have had no choice except to write my way out. The 25th anniversary edition of Queer published in 2010, edited by Oliver Harris, called into question Burroughs's claim, and clarified the importance for Queer of Burroughs's traumatic relationship with the boyfriend fictionalized in the story as Eugene Allerton, rather than the shooting of Vollmer.|$|E
500|$|When Walter Devereux {{returned}} to England in December 1575, the Spanish agent in London, Antonio de Guaras, reported:As {{the thing is}} publicly talked of in the streets, {{there can be no}} harm in <b>my</b> <b>writing</b> openly about the great enmity between the Earl of Leicester and the Earl of Essex, in consequence, it is said, of the fact that while Essex was in Ireland his wife had two children by Leicester. ... Great discord is expected in consequence.|$|E
500|$|She {{rejects the}} notion that her song lyrics are autobiographical, telling The Times in 1998: [...] "the {{tortured}} artist myth is rampant. People paint me {{as some kind of}} black witchcraft-practising devil from hell, that I have to be twisted and dark to do what I am doing. It's a load of rubbish". What is more, she later told Spin: [...] "some critics have taken <b>my</b> <b>writing</b> so literally to the point that they'll listen to 'Down by the Water' and believe I have actually given birth to a child and drowned her." ...|$|E

500|$|Breaking Benjamin's lyrical content {{evolved as}} a product of Burnley's sobriety, the front man noting that the lyricism in Dear Agony is more thought out. Rito Asilo of the Inquirer writes that Burnley [...] "owes the {{improved}} clarity and coherence in Breaking Benjamin's music to sobriety." [...] Burnley has said that before sobriety, anything that made sense thematically was a coincidence, and that he would take shots if he were dissatisfied with a lyric. Breaking Benjamin's lyrics have been noted for their vague, angst-heavy themes, Burnley saying that [...] "I try to keep <b>my</b> <b>writing</b> vague so people can draw their own conclusions." ...|$|E
500|$|Shen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays {{consists}} of some 507 separate essays exploring {{a wide range}} of subjects. It was Shen's ultimate attempt to comprehend and describe a multitude of various aspects of nature, science, and reality, and all the practical and profound curiosities found in the world. The literal translation of the title, Dream Brook Brush Talks, refers to his Dream Brook estate, where he spent the last years of his life. About the title, he is quoted as saying: [...] "Because I had only <b>my</b> <b>writing</b> brush and ink slab to converse with, I call it Brush Talks." ...|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Achebe {{was awarded}} a Rockefeller Fellowship for six months of travel, which he called [...] "the first {{important}} perk of <b>my</b> <b>writing</b> career"; Achebe set out for a tour of East Africa. One month after Nigeria achieved its independence, he travelled to Kenya, where he was required to complete an immigration form by checking a box indicating his ethnicity: European, Asiatic, Arab, or Other. Shocked and dismayed at being forced into an [...] "Other" [...] identity, he found the situation [...] "almost funny" [...] and took an extra form as a souvenir. Continuing to Tanganyika and Zanzibar (now united in Tanzania), he was frustrated by the paternalistic attitude he observed among non-African hotel clerks and social elites.|$|E

500|$|In {{the preface}} to the book, Villas states that vegetarians {{and those that do}} not eat pork for {{religious}} reasons are [...] "haunted instinctively by the sensuous, irresistible enticement". He asserts, [...] "There's no one who doesn't love bacon. It's the greatest food God has ever created." [...] Villas asks, [...] "Who, under any circumstances, is not rendered almost helpless by the tantalizing sound of bacon sizzling slowly in a skillet, by the taunting backwoods aroma that permeates the air ...?" [...] He notes that [...] "the greatest and most beloved food on earth" [...] is one of the worlds oldest forms of cooked meat. The author comments on the surge in interest in bacon products in the years prior to the book's publication, [...] "Just the 40 percent increase in bacon consumption in the United States {{over the past five years}} might have justified <b>my</b> <b>writing</b> this book." [...] The book includes photographs by Andrea Grablewski.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{currently}} {{resides in}} San Miguel de Allende, {{a city in}} central Mexico, but for years she lived and wrote in San Antonio, Texas, in her briefly controversial [...] "Mexican-pink" [...] home with [...] "many creatures little and large." [...] In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the Americas Review why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, [...] "I've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. <b>My</b> <b>writing</b> is my child and I don't want anything to come between us." [...] She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write. In {{the introduction to the}} third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Cisneros wrote: [...] "It's why I moved from Illinois to Texas. So that the relatives and family would allow me the liberty to disappear into myself. To reinvent myself if I had to. As Latinas, we have to... Because writing is like putting your head underwater." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} sportscasters, writers and journalists point to Tunis' books as {{inspiration}} for their careers. Tunis is mentioned by author Daniel Okrent in the dedication for The Ultimate Baseball Book {{as one of}} [...] "those responsible for the earliest roots of this project". Writer and editor Tad Richards says, [...] "I remember telling my mother... 'When I {{grow up to be}} a writer, and people ask me about the greatest influence on <b>my</b> <b>writing</b> career, I'm going to say John R. Tunis. Among Tunis' many childhood fans are sports writer and children's author Thomas J. Dygard, Pulitzer Prize finalist Lee Martin, journalist Charles Kuralt [...] and football legend Johnny Unitas. New York Post columnist and editor Pete Hamill picked The Kid From Tomkinsville as one of his five favorite sports novels, writing that [...] "virtually every sportswriter I know remembers reading it as a boy." [...] In Partial Payment: Essays on Writers and Their Lives, literary critic Joseph Epstein devotes one chapter, [...] "A Boy's Own Author", to Tunis. Epstein admits that re-reading many childhood favorites can be disappointing, but found upon revisiting Tunis that his books are [...] "pretty serious, and I was utterly absorbed in them".|$|E

500|$|After {{filming the}} {{underwater}} shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay. He wanted {{to honor the}} people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanics crew and passengers. [...] "I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life," [...] he said. [...] "And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it." [...] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californians role in Titanic demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had [...] "a very clear picture" [...] of what happened on the ship that night. [...] "I had a library that filled one whole wall of <b>my</b> <b>writing</b> office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially {{if we were going to}} dive to the ship," [...] he said. [...] "That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oates's spouse Raymond Smith died of {{complications}} from pneumonia on February 18, 2008, and the death impacted Oates profoundly. In April 2008, Oates wrote to an interviewer, [...] "Since my husband's unexpected death, I really have very little energy [...] My marriage—my love for my husband—seems to have come first in my life, rather than <b>my</b> <b>writing.</b> Set beside his death, the future of <b>my</b> <b>writing</b> scarcely interests me at the moment." [...] After six months of near suicidal grieving for Raymond Smith, Oates met Charles Gross, {{a professor in the}} Psychology Department and Neuroscience Institute at Princeton, at a dinner party at her home. In early 2009, Oates and Gross were married.|$|E

I learned a lot about human nature, and human behaviour, as a journalist ... there is more in life, more in situations, than meets the eye".|$|E
