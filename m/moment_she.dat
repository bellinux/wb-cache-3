5|$|Her {{first scene}} was for The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorehead 8 with her agent Slim Shady (Dez) {{and his best}} friend, Moorehead. It was {{intended}} to only be an oral scene, but {{in the heat of}} the <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> had intercourse with both. The next day she shot a scene with Miles Long in Joey Silvera's Service Animals 4. A few months later, she realized that she did not need an agent and started to represent herself.|$|E
5|$|Maria Theresa {{replaced}} Maria Josepha as {{heir presumptive}} to the Habsburg realms the <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> was born; Charles VI had issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 which had placed his nieces behind his own daughters {{in the line}} of succession. Charles sought the other European powers' approval for disinheriting his nieces. They exacted harsh terms: in the Treaty of Vienna (1731), Great Britain demanded that Austria abolish the Ostend Company in return for its recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction. In total, Great Britain, France, Saxony-Poland, United Provinces, Spain, Venice, the Papal States, Prussia, Russia, Denmark-Norway, Savoy-Sardinia, Bavaria and the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire recognised the sanction. France, Spain, Saxony-Poland, Bavaria and Prussia later reneged.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1567, in a swoop {{known as}} the Surprise of Meaux, Huguenot forces {{attempted}} to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war. Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray. The war was ended by the Peace of Longjumeau of 22–23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued. The Surprise of Meaux marked {{a turning point in}} Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots. From that <b>moment,</b> <b>she</b> abandoned compromise for a policy of repression. She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one could expect from Huguenots was deceit, and she praised the Duke of Alba's reign of terror in the Netherlands, where Calvinists and rebels were put to death in the thousands.|$|E

5|$|The Ulstermen {{eventually}} rouse, {{one by one}} at first, {{and finally}} en masse. The final battle begins. Cú Chulainn stays on the sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps {{his side of the}} bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he does not think it right to kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone.|$|E
5|$|Clara and Merry flee {{back to the}} {{ceremony}} and the Doctor faces the creature, realising it feeds off memories, stories, and feelings. He tries to overfeed it by offering {{the sum total of}} his Time Lord memories; Merry also leads the citizens in a song of hope, confusing Akhaten who then disappears. However, the Doctor's memories are not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears. Clara returns to help, offering Akhaten the leaf that blew into her father's face on the day he met her mother, which contains an infinite amount of untold potential that Clara's mother never saw because she died early. Akhaten, overwhelmed by the infinite potential it has consumed, implodes on itself and the Rings are saved. The Doctor returns Clara to her home on the same day they left and gives her back her mother's ring, telling her that all the creatures she saved wanted her to have it back. Suddenly Clara remembers seeing the Doctor at her mother's funeral and asks why he was there. He tells her that she reminds him of someone who died and she rebukes him for using her as a replacement, but he assures her she is not a replacement and Clara leaves. However, the <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> is gone, the Doctor's expression becomes grim and closes the TARDIS door from which Clara left.|$|E

25|$|After her husband's death, Laura Upthegrove {{lived under}} an assumed name in western Florida for a time. In {{the next two}} years, she was arrested on several {{occasions}} before eventually opening a gas station at Canal Point on Lake Okeechobee. She later {{moved in with her}} mother in Upthegrove Beach. On August 6, 1927, she died during an argument with a man trying to buy moonshine from her. In the heat of the <b>moment,</b> <b>she</b> swallowed a bottle of disinfectant and died within minutes. It is unclear whether it was an accident, as some claim she mistook it for a bottle of gin, but it was widely reported that she had committed suicide. She was 30 years old.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Swan Lake {{was based}} on the story of Ondine, a German myth with a theme common in Romanticism that was adapted by Hans Christian Andersen for his story The Little Mermaid. Ondine was a beautiful and immortal water nymph. The only threat to her eternal happiness was if {{she fell in love with}} a mortal and bore his child, as she would then lose her immortality. Ondine duly fell in love with a dashing knight, Sir Lawrence, and they were married, the knight pledging unfailing love and faithfulness to her with his every waking breath. A year after their wedding Ondine bore Lawrence a son. From that <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> began to age. As Ondine’s beauty faded, Lawrence lost interest in her.|$|E
25|$|Jodie Whittaker {{was cast}} as Beth Latimer, {{the mother of}} the murdered boy. She was hired after Buchan and McClure joined the series. Her {{audition}} consisted of several scenes from the first episode. Whittaker admitted that she was very nervous about accepting a role in a series whose scripts had not yet been completed. Chris Chibnall, however, told her that none of the actors would know who the murderer was (not even the actor who played the killer) until the last possible <b>moment.</b> <b>She</b> found that highly appealing, for it raised the anxiety level in the actors and reduced each actor's willingness to trust the other characters. She was also impressed by the heart-breaking way the first episode was written, and how many interesting characters there were in the series.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Orage {{attacks the}} train, causing the brakes to malfunction.

Meanwhile, Dauragon orders Wong to transport Dominique to the shuttle Galeos. Wong protests, telling Dauragon he is using the Mikado Group for evil, something of which his father would not approve. Dauragon attacks Wong as the trio enter, and the dying Wong tells them Dauragon must be stopped. Dauragon then reveals that Dominique is his sister. He and the panther attack the trio, defeating them, and the floor falls out underneath them.|$|E

25|$|Light's {{personality}} dramatically changes {{after he}} has a Death Note compared to when he does not. This can be seen when Light puts himself in L's captivity because he 'might be Kira'. Light tells Ryuk to relinquish his ownership of the Death Note after saying 'get rid of it'. Afterwards, Light loses all memory of the Death Note and he reverts to his normal personality. Without the Death Note, he has cares for {{the people around him}} and is reluctant to manipulate them. He even refuses to 'use' Misa Amane to get information out of her when L asks him to; however, later in the story, when Light regains his memories, he seems to have no problem 'using' Kiyomi Takada and manipulating her feelings in order to get what he wants. Despite serving Light faithfully, he repays her devotion with a painful death the <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> is no longer of use to him, expressing no emotion other than elation at the fact that her death has moved him closer to his goal.|$|E
25|$|Boyer {{told the}} police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. She claimed that after they left a local nightclub together, she had {{repeatedly}} requested that he take her home, but he instead took her against her will to the Hacienda Motel. She claimed that once {{in one of the}} motel's rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and that she was certain he was going to rape her. According to Boyer, when Cooke stepped into the bathroom for a <b>moment,</b> <b>she</b> quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She claimed that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke's clothing by mistake. She said she ran first to the manager's office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long in responding, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager ever opened the door. She said she then put her clothing back on, hid Cooke's clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called police.|$|E

25|$|Troubled {{by family}} upsets, Frank is devastated in 1990 {{when his mother}} Mo (Edna Dore) {{develops}} dementia. Her deterioration is rapid. In a lucid <b>moment,</b> <b>she</b> writes Frank a letter asking him not to let her end up like her grandmother, who had gone senile, saying she would rather die than suffer the same fate. Frank is torn, but attempts to adhere to his mother's wish by almost smothering her with a pillow while she sleeps. However, he cannot {{go through with it}} and instead sends Mo to live with his sister Joan Garwood (Mary Miller) in Colchester. In 1992 Frank receives a huge tax demand, swiftly followed by a large VAT bill. This forces him to sell his B and the adjoining house and move his family into a small flat. Pat establishes her own cab firm, PatCabs, which starts making them some money. However, on Christmas Eve that year, Pat runs over and kills a teenage girl and is later sentenced to six months in prison. Frank struggles alone and the Butchers end 1993 in financial ruin. In desperation, Frank asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) to set fire to his car lot so he can claim on insurance in March 1994. The car lot catches fire as agreed, but unknown to Phil and Frank, a homeless man is sleeping in one of the cars and burns to death. Frank is arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, but is later released due to lack of evidence. However, doubts remain as to whether he conspired to defraud his insurance company and an investigation takes place. Frank tries covering his tracks by claiming his accounts have burnt but Pat gives the business's books to the investigating agent. The pressure becomes too much for Frank, who is suffering severe guilt over the death of the homeless man. He becomes so depressed and despondent, no one can get through to him. Unable to cope, Frank leaves Walford and his family without warning in April 1994, and does not contact them to say where he is.|$|E

Another attendee of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall seeing any fall {{by the end of the}} concert.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} more mixed or {{negative}}, with many criticizing the negative reveal {{of the feminist}} Lilith House. Keith McDuffee of AOL TV thought that the episode raised more questions than it answered: such as [...] " [...] seem to accept that several rapes were faked, and then Veronica seems to just leave without that question being answered," [...] arguing that the abrupt ending to the scene constituted an out-of-character <b>moment</b> (<b>she</b> should have acted more negatively). In addition, he criticized Bell's performance, commenting [...] "Speaking of Veronica, she seemed like she was on something tonight. Just outright acting silly-odd, dancing around with some pretty lame jokes." ...|$|E
