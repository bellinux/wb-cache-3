5|$|Crisis Core uses a {{real-time}} {{combat system}} in which the player can move Zack around, initiate attacks, special abilities and spells, use items, and block or dodge attacks. Zack's abilities in battle are set by what <b>materia</b> he currently has equipped. Up to six <b>materia</b> can be equipped at any one time, which can impart special attacks, magic spells, or passive bonuses such as health increases or the ability to display the statistics of the current foe in combat. <b>Materia</b> are gained throughout the game through exploration, as rewards from side missions, as spoils of battle, or from shops. <b>Materia</b> can be fused together to make more powerful versions with improved bonuses; for example, fusing an attack <b>materia</b> with an elemental magic <b>materia</b> can create a new attack skill <b>materia</b> that inflicts elemental magic damage in addition to physical damage. Special items collected in the game can also be used in <b>materia</b> fusion to further increase the materia's power.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} brings one <b>materia</b> {{into the}} party when they join, carrying one spell {{that can be used}} in combat. <b>Materia</b> have a limited number of uses before they must be recharged at one of the game's magic shops. Like party members, <b>materia</b> gain experience when used, and can be leveled up to a maximum level of nine. Characters can swap <b>materia</b> among themselves, with unequipped <b>materia</b> being used mid-battle for such things as healing party members, compensating for the limited amount of healing items.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the visuals and audio, the overall gameplay system remained mostly unchanged from that used since Final Fantasy V, using research done to promote player control. The initial decision was for battles to feature shifting camera angles. Battle arenas had a lower polygon count than field areas, which made picking out distinctive features for each one more difficult. The summon sequences benefited strongly from the switch to the cinematic style, as the team had struggled to portray their scale using 2D graphics. In his role as producer, Sakaguchi placed much of his effort into developing the battle system, also proposing the <b>Materia</b> system. <b>Materia</b> provided more character customization than previous Final Fantasy games: battles no longer revolved around characters with innate skills and roles in battle, as <b>Materia</b> could be reconfigured between battles. Nomura {{also contributed to the}} gameplay, creating the Limit Break system as an evolution of the Desperation Attacks used in Final Fantasy VI. The Limit Breaks served a purpose in gameplay while also bringing out each character's personality in battle.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, President Shinra becomes {{suspicious}} of the Turks activities, believing that someone within the organization is leaking sensitive information. He concludes {{that it must be}} Veld, and removes him from command, instead placing the company's security leader Heidegger in charge. In his first operation however, Heidegger nearly destroys Junon, and the President reinstates Veld. In his first mission back in command, Veld plans to defeat AVALANCHE. An assault is launched at a Mako Reactor, during which Rufus Shinra is revealed to be the traitor supporting AVALANCHE. He is captured by the Turks and placed under house arrest. At the same time, Shears defects to the Turks in an effort to save the gravely ill Elfé. Veld discovers that Elfé is his daughter Felicia, whom he thought dead in a botched Shinra operation, and resigns from the Turks. With Elfé continuing to weaken, Fuhito takes over the command of AVALANCHE. It is revealed that a <b>Materia</b> owned by Elfé is Zirconiade, an ancient and powerful summoned monster that Fuhito intends to use to destroy humanity and stop them harming the planet. However, the <b>Materia</b> is broken, and is slowly draining Elfé's life energy. To save her, the four Support <b>Materia</b> must be found. Fuhito holds one, and the Turks and Shears hold another.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{not wanting}} Rufus' {{betrayal}} become known, the President orders the Turks' destruction. Despite this imminent threat, the Turks manage to find two more Support <b>Materia.</b> Under Fuhito's control, {{the remainder of}} AVALANCHE is turned into a vicious army of uncontrollable Ravens, and he manages to steal all the <b>materia</b> needed. In the final battle, Fuhito summons Zirconiade, fusing the summon with his own body, and Shears sacrifices himself to save Elfé. Fuhito transforms into a monster, but he is defeated by the Turks. After the battle, Tseng falsely claims that both Veld and Elfé are dead, so as {{to protect them from}} being hunted by Shinra. The Turks are then reorganized, with Tseng reinstated as their immediate leader, but they are now sworn to loyalty to Shinra as part of the bargain for their survival. The original Turks find new lives for themselves in hiding, and are later seen helping in the evacuation of Midgar during the events of VII.|$|E

5|$|Willow bark {{preparations}} {{became a}} standard {{part of the}} <b>materia</b> medica of Western medicine beginning at least with the Greek physician Hippocrates in the fifth century BC; he recommended chewing on willow bark to relieve pain or fever, and drinking tea made from it to relieve pain during childbirth. The Roman encyclopedist Celsus, in his De Medicina of ca. 30 AD, suggested willow leaf extract to treat the four signs of inflammation: redness, heat, swelling and pain. Willow treatments also appeared in Dioscorides's De <b>Materia</b> Medica, and Pliny the Elder's Natural History.

40|$|Visando compreender a relação entre saúde, imprensa e políticas públicas sobre tabaco no Brasil, foram analisadas <b>matérias</b> sobre tabaco divulgadas na imprensa brasileira no ano de 2006. Através de {{clipping}} jornalístico de oito principais jornais e revistas do país, as <b>matérias</b> sobre tabaco foram identificadas e posteriormente submetidas à análise de conteúdo, que permitiu categorização e classificação dos textos. A frequência de <b>matérias</b> de 2006 foi comparada aos anos de 2000 e 2003. Foi observado predomínio de <b>matérias</b> com abordagem factual (46, 7 %). A maioria das <b>matérias</b> fez menção a consequências negativas, como problemas de saúde física (44, 2 %), morte (20 %) e dependência (14, 2 %). Na análise das manchetes e lides, as principais categorias observadas foram políticas de controle e o movimentos antitabagistas e divulgação de pesquisas. A frequência de <b>matérias</b> de 2006 (N= 120) foi semelhante ao ano de 2003 (N= 124) e inferior a 2000 (N= 174). A cobertura jornalística sobre tabaco em 2006 foi predominantemente restrita aos danos a saúde e ações antitabagistas. A elevada proporção de abordagem factual e a estabilização da frequência de <b>matérias</b> (2003 - 2006) podem indicar um empobrecimento na discussão sobre o tema no país.

In the clipping process of eight newspapers and magazines, the information about Tobacco were identified and then submitted to content analysis allowing categorization and classification of the texts. The frequency of the texts in 2006 was {{compared to that of}} in 2000 and 2003. We observed a higher prevalence of factual approach among the texts (46. 7 %). Most of the texts mentioned the negative consequences, such as physical health problems (44. 2 %), death (20 %) and dependence (14. 2 %). The analysis of the headlines and lead-ins showed control policies, anti-smoking movements and spreading of results as the main categories observed. The frequency of the articles in 2006 was similar to that of in 2003 and lower to that of in 2000. The journalistic coverage on Tobacco in 2006 was restricted predominantly to harm to health and anti-smoking movements. The high proportion of the factual approach and the stabilization in the frequency of texts (2003 - 2006) might suggest an impoverishment of the discussion on this issue in the country...|$|R
