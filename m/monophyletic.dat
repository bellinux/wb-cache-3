5|$|While Graham and Barrett (2004) had {{determined}} that subgenus Hermione was <b>monophyletic,</b> using {{a much larger}} accession Santos-Gally et al. (2011) did not. However the former had excluded species of hybrid origins, while the latter included both N. dubius and N. tortifolius. If these two species are excluded (forming a clade with subgenus Narcissus) then Hermione can be considered <b>monophyletic,</b> although as a section of Hermione, Tazettae is not <b>monophyletic.</b> They also confirmed the monophyly of Apodanthi.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany curricula and textbooks, fungi are {{more closely related}} to animals than to plants and are placed with the animals in the <b>monophyletic</b> group of opisthokonts. Analyses using molecular phylogenetics support a <b>monophyletic</b> origin of the Fungi. The taxonomy of the Fungi {{is in a state of}} constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa {{contains}} three subclasses: Hexacorallia, {{which contains}} the Actiniaria; Octocorallia; and Ceriantharia. These are <b>monophyletic,</b> but the relationships within the subclasses remain unresolved.|$|E
5|$|However, an {{analysis}} in 2009 using both morphological and molecular phylogenetics comparisons concluded the molluscs are not monophyletic; in particular, Scaphopoda and Bivalvia are both separate, <b>monophyletic</b> lineages {{unrelated to the}} remaining molluscan classes; the traditional phylum Mollusca is polyphyletic, and {{it can only be}} made <b>monophyletic</b> if scaphopods and bivalves are excluded. A 2010 analysis recovered the traditional conchiferan and aculiferan groups, and showed molluscs were <b>monophyletic,</b> demonstrating that available data for solenogastres was contaminated. Current molecular data are insufficient to constrain the molluscan phylogeny, and since the methods used to determine the confidence in clades are prone to overestimation, it is risky to place too much emphasis even on the areas of which different studies agree. Rather than eliminating unlikely relationships, the latest studies add new permutations of internal molluscan relationships, even bringing the conchiferan hypothesis into question.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{reported in}} 2001 used RNA sequences {{to establish that}} C.tuberosa forms a <b>monophyletic</b> group with C.cookei and C.cirrhata; this finding was later corroborated in a 2006 publication.|$|E
5|$|The Platyhelminthes {{excluding}} Acoelomorpha contain {{two main}} groups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, {{both of which}} are generally agreed to be <b>monophyletic</b> (each contains all and only the descendants of an ancestor that {{is a member of the}} same group). Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether these could be combined in a single <b>monophyletic</b> group, but a study in 2008 concluded they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is {{not clearly}} understood {{and a number}} of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a <b>monophyletic</b> grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be <b>monophyletic,</b> and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented here comes from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA within the group and on nuclear markers.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the family}} Lamiaceae, the large genus Salvia {{had long been}} {{believed}} <b>monophyletic,</b> based {{on the structure of}} its stamina. Several smaller genera, including Dorystaechas, Perovskia, and Meriandra were also included in tribe Mentheae, but were thought more distantly related. In 2004, a molecular phylogenetics study based on two cpDNA genes (rbcL and trnL-F) demonstrated that Salvia is not <b>monophyletic,</b> but comprises three identifiable clades. Clade I is more closely related to Perovskia than to other members of Salvia.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 study {{suggested}} the genus Pereskia was basal within the Cactaceae, but confirmed earlier suggestions {{it was not}} <b>monophyletic,</b> i.e., did not include all the descendants of a common ancestor. The Bayesian consensus cladogram from this study is shown below.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is {{subdivided}} into three subclasses: Octocorallia, Hexacorallia and Ceriantharia, which form <b>monophyletic</b> groups and generally show differentiating reflections on symmetry of polyp structure for each subclass. The relationships within the subclasses are unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Antlions {{are poorly}} {{represented}} in the fossil record. Myrmeleontiformia is generally accepted to be a <b>monophyletic</b> group, and within the Myrmeleontoidea, the antlions' closest living relatives {{are thought to be}} the owlflies (Ascalaphidae). The predatory actions of the larvae have attracted attention throughout history, and antlions have been mentioned in literature since classical times.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{has been}} placed in the {{subfamily}} Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Attaleinae, together with the genera Allagoptera, Beccariophoenix, Butia, Cocos, Jubaea, Jubaeopsis, Lytocaryum, Parajubaea, Syagrus and Voanioala. Within this subtribe, Attalea {{has been found to}} be a <b>monophyletic</b> group, and sister to the clade containing Allagoptera, Polyandrococos, Parajubaea, Butia and Jubaea.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{into higher}} taxa for these groups {{has been and}} remains problematic. A phylogenetic study {{suggests}} the Polyplacophora form a clade with a <b>monophyletic</b> Aplacophora. Additionally, it suggests a sister taxon relationship exists between the Bivalvia and the Gastropoda. Tentaculita may also be in Mollusca (see Tentaculites).|$|E
5|$|Dugongidae, unlike Trichechidae, is paraphyletic, {{comprising}} the Dugonginae and Hydrodamalinae (which are both <b>monophyletic)</b> and the paraphyletic Halitheriinae. The tusks of modern day dugongs may have originally {{have been used}} for digging, but they are now used for social interaction. The genus Dugong probably originated in the Indo-Pacific area.|$|E
5|$|Hexacorallia {{includes}} {{coral reef}} builders: the stony corals (Scleractinia), sea anemones (Actiniaria), and zoanthids (Zoantharia). Genetic studies of ribosomal DNA has shown Ceriantharia to be a <b>monophyletic</b> {{group and the}} oldest, or basal, order among them.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, a {{minority}} scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, are not rodents {{and should be}} reclassified as a separate order of mammals (similar to lagomorphs). Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of rodents as <b>monophyletic</b> is justified.|$|E
5|$|It is now {{agreed that}} spiders (Araneae) are <b>monophyletic</b> (i.e., {{members of a}} group of organisms that form a clade, {{consisting}} of a last common ancestor and all of its descendants). There has been debate about what their closest evolutionary relatives are, and how all of these evolved from the ancestral chelicerates, which were marine animals. The cladogram on the right is based on J. W. Shultz' analysis (2007). Other views include proposals that: scorpions are more closely related to the extinct marine scorpion-like eurypterids than to spiders; spiders and Amblypygi are a <b>monophyletic</b> group. The appearance of several multi-way branchings in the tree on the right shows that there are still uncertainties about relationships between the groups involved.|$|E
5|$|Mayfly {{phylogeny}} {{was further}} studied using morphological and molecular analyses by Ogden {{and others in}} 2009. They found that the Asian genus Siphluriscus was sister to all other mayflies. Some existing lineages such as Ephemeroidea, and families such as Ameletopsidae, were found not to be <b>monophyletic,</b> through convergence among nymphal features.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetics {{have shown}} that C.cirrhata forms a <b>monophyletic</b> clade with the {{remaining}} two species of Collybia. Because C.cirrhata {{is the only one}} of the three Collybia species lacking sclerotia, it has been suggested that this character trait is an anapomorphy—that is, unique to a single, terminal species within a clade.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{recent studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that rather than forming a single <b>monophyletic</b> group (a clade), the halfbeak family actually includes a number of lineages ancestral to the flyingfishes and the needlefishes. In other words, as traditionally defined, the halfbeak family is paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the Ixodida {{within the}} Acari {{is shown in}} the cladogram, based on a 2014 maximum parsimony study of amino acid sequences of twelve mitochondrial proteins. The Argasidae appear <b>monophyletic</b> in this study.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the phylum Nemertea is <b>monophyletic</b> (meaning that the phylum {{includes}} all and only descendants of one ancestor that was also a member of the phylum). The synapomorphies (trait shared by an ancestor and all its descendants, but not by other groups) include the eversible proboscis located in the rhynchocoel.|$|E
5|$|A {{very large}} and {{internally}} consistent alignment of 1,719 proteins at the metazoan scale, published in 2017, showed that (i) sponges – represented by Homoscleromorpha, Calcarea, Hexactinellida, and Demospongiae – are <b>monophyletic,</b> (ii) sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals, (iii) ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and (iv) placozoans emerge as the third animal lineage, followed by cnidarians sister-group to bilaterians.|$|E
5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be <b>monophyletic,</b> the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, except that the bamboo lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|E
5|$|F. rubiginosa is {{exclusively}} pollinated in {{a symbiotic}} relationship with Pleistodontes imperialis, a species of fig wasp. Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term the P. imperialis species complex. They diverge {{to a greater degree}} than some distinct wasp species, yet form a <b>monophyletic</b> group; this indicates that the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} {{the results of}} a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B.ser. Tetragonae was found to be <b>monophyletic,</b> and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi.|$|E
5|$|Insects can {{be divided}} into two groups {{historically}} treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish (Zygentoma). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles, while Zygentoma and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. The Zygentoma themselves possibly are not <b>monophyletic,</b> with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Zygentoma).|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus, who {{classified}} most {{kinds of}} sessile animals {{as belonging to}} the order Zoophyta in the class Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus Spongia as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned to a separate subkingdom, Parazoa ("beside the animals"), separate from the Eumetazoa which formed {{the rest of the}} kingdom Animalia. They have been regarded as a paraphyletic phylum, from which the higher animals have evolved. Other research indicates Porifera is <b>monophyletic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{studies have}} {{supported}} the monophyly of three of these subfamilies (not Pereskioideae), but have not supported all of the tribes or even genera below this level; indeed, a 2011 study found only 39% of the genera in the subfamily Cactoideae sampled in the research were <b>monophyletic.</b> Classification of the cacti currently remains uncertain {{and is likely to}} change.|$|E
5|$|Several {{molecular}} phylogenetic analyses {{show that}} L.deterrimus, L.sanguifluus, Lactarius vinosus and L.fennoscandicus form {{a group of}} related species, which might include the North American species L.paradoxus and L.miniatosporus. Although L.deliciosus var. deterrimus qualifies as synonym for L.deterrimus, the families, which had been characterized in North America as Lactarius deliciosus var. deterrimus, are not closely related with the European types. They also seem not to form a <b>monophyletic</b> group.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia attenuata resolves as a basal member of and next closest relative, or 'sister', to a clade containing B.elegans and, within that, a <b>monophyletic</b> B.subg. Isostylis. An Eocene fossil cone named Banksia archaeocarpa, around 50 million years old, resembles that of B.attenuata.|$|E
5|$|The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) made rapid {{progress}} {{in establishing a}} modern <b>monophyletic</b> classification of the flowering plants by 2009. Despite establishing this relative degree of monophyly (genetic homogeneity) for the Liliaceae family, their morphology remains diverse and there exists within the Liliaceae clade or grouping, a number of subclades (subgroups). Particularly enigmatic were Clintonia, Medeola, Scoliopus, and Tricyrtis.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} John Veron and {{his co-workers}} analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again concluding that the traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect. They also established that stony corals are <b>monophyletic,</b> including all the descendants of a common ancestor, but that they are divided into two groups, the robust and complex clades. Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.|$|E
5|$|The algae are a polyphyletic {{group and}} {{are placed in}} various divisions, some {{more closely related to}} plants than others. There are many {{differences}} between them in features such as cell wall composition, biochemistry, pigmentation, chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves. The algal division Charophyta, sister to the green algal division Chlorophyta, is considered to contain the ancestor of true plants. The Charophyte class Charophyceae and the land plant sub-kingdom Embryophyta together form the <b>monophyletic</b> group or clade Streptophytina.|$|E
5|$|The brolga was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} genus Grus but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create <b>monophyletic</b> genera, four species, including the brolga, {{were placed in the}} resurrected genus Antigone that had originally been erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853.|$|E
5|$|The {{consistency}} of beetle morphology, in particular their possession of elytra, has long suggested that Coleoptera is <b>monophyletic,</b> though {{there have been}} doubts about {{the arrangement of the}} suborders, namely the Adephaga, Archostemata, Myxophaga and Polyphaga within that clade. The twisted-wing parasites, Strepsiptera, are thought to be a sister group to the beetles, having split from them in the Early Permian.|$|E
