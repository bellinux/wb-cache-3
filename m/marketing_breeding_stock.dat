5000|$|The phenotypical {{traits that}} are {{evaluated}} with all species of livestock are muscle, structural correctness, frame size, style and balance. These certain traits will vary with certain species {{as well as}} if the animal is shown for <b>market</b> or for <b>breeding</b> <b>stock.</b> For meat animals, muscling is an important trait. There are several indicators of muscle, mainly being on the top line and rear of the animal. For dairy animals, qualities that improve milk production are vital. For poultry, feathers are important, and traits such as broken or cut feathers are a disqualification. Structural correctness is another trait refers to how well the animals skeleton is put together, more specifically their bone structure.|$|R
30|$|Nomadic {{pastoral}} {{production of}} camels is highly vulnerable to recurring droughts and subsequent ethnic conflicts over water and pastures (Guliye et al. 2007; Thornton et al. 2007). This {{has contributed to}} forcing part of the pastoral communities to abandon the traditional nomadic pastoral production in search for businesses, employment opportunities, security and social amenities in the urban centres (Bebe et al. 2007; Seré et al. 2008). The migrating pastoral households have introduced camel keeping within the vicinity of urban centres where they keep lactating herds to supply milk to urban consumers. Grazing of the lactating herds is restricted within pastures around the urban centre, so as to remain closer to market outlets. This practice is marked with changes in production objectives from subsistence to <b>market</b> orientation. <b>Breeding</b> <b>stock</b> is reared within the herd (Bebe et al. 2007). The camel herd management practices just described have evolved into a peri-urban camel milk production system. In this evolving system, the proportion of camel heifers born that survive to first calving is important in sustaining the herds {{and the extent to}} which households obtain tangible and intangible benefits from their camel herds.|$|R
5000|$|The prairie {{and desert}} lands of what today is Mexico {{and the western}} United States were well-suited to [...] "open range" [...] grazing. For example, American bison had been a {{mainstay}} of the diet for the Native Americans in the Great Plains for centuries. Likewise, cattle and other livestock were simply turned loose in the spring after their young were born and allowed to roam with little supervision and no fences, then rounded up in the fall, with the mature animals driven to <b>market</b> and the <b>breeding</b> <b>stock</b> brought close to the ranch headquarters for greater protection in the winter. The use of livestock branding allowed the cattle owned by different ranchers to be identified and sorted. Beginning with the settlement of Texas in the 1840s, and expansion both north and west from that time, through the Civil War and into the 1880s, ranching dominated western economic activity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{worldwide}} distribution of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) has not prevented this species from becoming endangered due to twentieth century whaling. In Australia {{there are two}} known feeding aggre-gations of blue whales, which most likely are the pygmy subspecies (B. m. brevicauda). It is unknown whether individuals from these feeding aggregations belong to one <b>breeding</b> <b>stock,</b> or multiple <b>breeding</b> <b>stocks</b> that either share or occupy separate feeding grounds. This was investigated using ten microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA con-trol region sequences (N = 110).

40|$|This paper reports {{preliminary}} {{results from the}} development of an assessment process that aims to include all seven Southern Hemisphere humpback whale <b>breeding</b> <b>stocks</b> in a single joint assessment, with the purpose of allowing highlatitude historic catches (i. e. catches taken south of 40 ˚S, where mixing amongst the populations occurs), to be allocated to <b>breeding</b> <b>stocks</b> in proportion to abundance, rather than on set ratios. The approach can be broadened to allow for uncertainties in the placement of the boundaries assumed to link high latitude catches to <b>breeding</b> <b>stocks.</b> Because of the interaction between populations arising from the procedure to allocate high latitude catches amongst <b>breeding</b> <b>stocks,</b> the conventional SIR-based Bayesian approach proved impractical to expand. Instead uniform priors on the various preexploitation level (K) parameters were assumed with the intent to later iteratively adjust these to account for their being informative about the values of the intrinsic growth rate (r) parameters. Initial results (which will need later refinement) are presented purely for the purposes of illustrating the application of the approach...|$|R
