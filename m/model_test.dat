25|$|A 1 to 80 scale section {{model of}} the deck in the {{erection}} stage, and a 1 to 400 scale full aeroelastic {{model of the}} entire bridge were constructed. It is a Monte-Carlo simulation of the typhoon wind climate. The full model was tested in different stages of construction in turbulent boundary layer flow, complete with the local topography to model the wind conditions at the site. The model tests identified critical stages of erection that allowed the construction schedule of the bridge to be tailored to avoid the typhoon season. The comparison of <b>model</b> <b>test</b> results and the full scale monitoring will assist engineers {{to better understand the}} behaviour of long span bridges in wind and to improve current design methods.|$|E
25|$|In March–April 1903 the NTC's {{consultants}} {{reviewed the}} drafts {{of the hull}} and {{found it to be}} superior to Navarin and Poltava but inferior to the original Borodino. Dmitry Skvortsov (1859–1910), the builder of Borodino, warned about unacceptable drag of the proposed shape. Alexey Krylov, then chief of the Navy's ship model basin, performed towed scale <b>model</b> <b>test</b> and came to the same conclusion. Krylov, who was preparing for a sea voyage to Port Arthur to pursue his own academic interests, did not blow the whistle. After the October Revolution Krylov wrote that the hull of Andrey Pervozvanny was so poorly shaped that it required twice as much engine power as more efficient hulls, but in 1903 he kept this conclusion to himself and submitted a critical but very carefully written report.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Finnish National Board of Navigation {{began looking for}} a {{replacement}} for the aging Karhu-class icebreakers Karhu, Murtaja and Sampo which had {{been built in the}} late 1950s and were no longer wide enough to escort modern merchant ships. Furthermore, the old icebreakers were expensive to operate and, despite their small size, required a relatively large crew of 53. The development of the new class of icebreakers, dubbed Karhu II in the preliminary papers, intensified when Wärtsilä opened a new ice <b>model</b> <b>test</b> facility in 1983. The first new icebreaker, Otso, was ordered from Wärtsilä Helsinki shipyard on 19 March 1984 with a price of FIM 235 million and commissioned in January 1986. The second ship, identical to the first one, was ordered in December 1985 and delivered to the owners on 29 January 1987. Her name, Kontio, {{is one of the many}} epithets for bear in the Finnish language. Afterwards, the three Karhu class icebreakers were decommissioned and sold.|$|E

However, high discharge in river is rare. Physical <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> at high discharges will probably lead biased hydrological relationship. To improve hydrological relationship at low discharges, in this study, we considered the diversion rating curve of the Yuanshanzi Diversion Work. The 1 / 100 -scaled physical <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> at low and high discharges (90 - 1620 m 3 /s) were performed and coupled the diversion discharges of 5 flood events (2009 - 2010) in field. The official diversion rating curve was built only based on physical <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> at high discharges (837 - 1620 m 3 /s). The results of physical <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> in this study suggested the official diversion rating curve should be modified considering all tests. The modifi-cations showed the official diversion rating curve was over-estimated. A complete series of physi-cal <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> and considering field situations, in this study, indicated expanded physical <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> and constantly field measurements were therefore necessary for hydraulic structure, which provided information to modify used hydrological relationship to fit real situations...|$|R

2500|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of Otso, all Finnish state-owned icebreakers built after the Second World War had been fitted with two bow propellers to reduce the friction between ice and the hull of the vessel in difficult ice conditions. However, the quad-shaft propulsion system was expensive to build and maintain, and the forward propeller bossings considerably increased the resistance of the ship. Although Finnish icebreaker captains voiced their concerns about the maneuverability and icebreaking capability of a vessel without bow propellers especially in heavy ice ridges and at crawling speeds, extensive model testing at Wärtsilä's new ice <b>model</b> <b>test</b> basin showed that the ice resistance could be reduced by replacing the bow propellers with a [...] "clean" [...] hull and adopting an air bubbling system to lubricate the hull. The patented Wärtsilä Air Bubbling System (WABS) onboard Otso consists of three compressors with a combined output of 1,900kW that pump air through 46 nozzles located below the waterline {{on both sides of the}} vessel. At low speeds, the system can also be used for manoeuvering. In addition, she has large ballast tanks and high-capacity pumps that can be used for rapid heeling and trimming to release the icebreaker if she is immobilized by compressive pack ice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Results {{from six}} {{centrifuge}} <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> are presented. Four of the <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> involve layered soil deposits subject to base shaking; two <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> involve uniform soil deposits of sand subject to base shaking. The layered soil models {{consisted of a}} saturated liquefiable fine sand overlain by a layer of relatively impermeable silica flour (silt). Pore water pressures, accelerations, and settlements were measured during all six tests. Results from the <b>model</b> <b>tests</b> involving layered soils suggest that during liquefaction, a water interlayer or very loose zone of soil develops between the sand and the silt due to the difference in permeabilities. Soil volcanos or boils were seen on the surface for all four of these layered <b>model</b> <b>tests.</b> The locations of these boils, in each test, were found concentrated in the weakest zones of the overlying silt layer; cracking of the weak silt zones provided a release or a vent for the excess e water pressure generated {{as a result of}} particle rearrangement in the,,quefiable fine sand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis for the bachelors degree {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and subsequent evaluation of the fawn mortality during haymaking in the hunting district HS Kalec, county Plzeň-sever (Pilsen-North), located {{in the western part}} of the Czech Republic. The first part of this thesis describes Roe Deer (Capreolus Capreolus), its population in this territory, biology, ethology and its management. The second part describes the project as such involving three <b>model</b> <b>testing</b> areas that were selected and marked out in the hunting district HS Kalec; before the haymaking time from June 15 to June 24, 2015, adequate protection measures were undertaken in these areas. Locality of the first <b>model</b> <b>testing</b> area number 1 was attended (walked) by gamekeepers with dogs. Locality of the second <b>model</b> <b>testing</b> area number 2 was treated with the game scent repeller and also equipped with acoustic disturber. The third <b>model</b> <b>testing</b> area number 3 was only monitored. These <b>model</b> <b>testing</b> areas were re-visited after hay crop and the result is that in the vicinity of the <b>model</b> <b>testing</b> area number 3 two fawns were cut and killed. In both other <b>model</b> <b>testing</b> areas no cut fawns were found. After hay crop and subsequent determining the actual number of cut fawns, these testing areas were compared mutually and the results will be stated in this thesis for the bachelors degree. The essential aspect was to evaluate the fawns mortality in the specific hunting district based on the obtained facts. Relation to the mitigation measures set in place was examined. This work resulted in saving three fawns. Outcomes of this thesis have provided rather interesting findings that can be further exploited in the gamekeeping management. Particularly in relation to the roe deer management in the gamekeeping practice. Keywords/tags: roe deer, fawns, killing, hunting district (HS Kalec, Žihle...|$|R
