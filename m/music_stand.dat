25|$|The two musical {{panels are}} {{commonly}} known by variants of the titles Singing Angels and Music-making Angels, and are both 161cm x 69.3cm. Each features a choir; {{on the left}} angels gather behind a wooden carved <b>music</b> <b>stand</b> positioned on a swivel, to the right a group with stringed instruments gather around a pipe organ, played by a seated angel, shown full-length. The presence {{of the two groups}} {{on either side of the}} Deësis reflects a by then well-established motif in representations of the heavens opening; that of musical accompaniment provided by celestial beings. As was common in the Low Countries in the 15th century, the angels are dressed in liturgical robes, a custom that migrated from Latin liturgical drama to the art of the period.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of the Church has an extensive range of early eighteenth century wooden fittings, which, because of the subsequent abandonment of the Church, has survived in a largely unaltered state where nineteenth century improvers would have swept them away. There is a large gallery at the west end, accessed by a stone spiral staircase. The gallery has wooden bench seating for a choir, and an enclosed area and a pyramidal <b>music</b> <b>stand.</b> The {{main body of the}} Church has box pews, some facing east, others, alongside the pulpit, face south toward the pulpit, indicating the liturgical emphasis toward the pulpit, where the sermons are delivered, rather than the altar, where the mass is celebrated. The pulpit itself is positioned part-way down the south wall, and is a wood-panelled triple combination of pulpit, reading desk and clerk's desk, which is re-worked from 17th century items.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} of {{downtown}} is the Church of San Francisco, finished {{at the beginning of}} the 18th century and from then on the most important in town, serving as the cathedral until the 20th century. It and the attached cloister is all that is left of a large complex that included several chapels and an orchard that extended for blocks to the east and south. On the facade, there is a depicting of Saint James fighting the Moors, cutting the head off of one. The main altar is Neoclassic, and replaced what reputedly was a masterpiece of Baroque design. This has happened frequently in the city; those Baroque altars not plundered over the course of Mexican history were replaced by newer designs. Older Baroque side altarpieces are still here, and are covered in gold leaf. Other notable pieces here include a large Baroque <b>music</b> <b>stand</b> and the seating of the choir section both done by architect Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras of Celaya in the 18th century. There are also sculptures done by Mariano Montenegro and Mariano Arce.|$|E

A large number of reviewers called the game and its characters [...] "cute". While {{a few of the}} reviewers praised the game's music, Jeremy Peeples of Hardcore Gamer found that it lacked staying power. He noted, however, that the music could be muted without also muting the sound effects, allowing people to play their own music.|$|E

500|$|A second {{ceremony}} marking Perry Como Day {{took place}} August 24, 1977, {{but the most}} ambitious project began in 1997 – a statue of the singer. The planned statue had the blessing of Como's wife, Roselle, who died the year before it was unveiled on May 15, 1999. As part of the festivities, Como's stool and <b>music</b> <b>stand</b> from The Perry Como Show and the equipment he used at Steve Fragapane's barber shop were donated to the borough. Como was not present at the unveiling because of poor health. The inscription on the base, [...] "To This Place God Has Brought Me", was a favorite saying of Como's; the musical feature was added in 2002.|$|E
500|$|Of Shaw's various {{reviewing}} {{activities in}} the 1880s and 1890s it was as a music critic that he was best known. After serving as deputy in 1888, he became musical critic of The Star in February 1889, writing under the pen-name Corno di Bassetto. In May 1890 he moved back to The World, where he wrote a weekly column as [...] "G.B.S." [...] {{for more than four}} years. In the 2016 version of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Robert Anderson writes, [...] "Shaw's collected writings on <b>music</b> <b>stand</b> alone in their mastery of English and compulsive readability." [...] Shaw ceased to be a salaried music critic in August 1894, but published occasional articles on the subject throughout his career, his last in 1950.|$|E
2500|$|The first Cardiacs release {{featuring}} the [...] "classic" [...] line-up was their third album, The Seaside (although Cawthra featured throughout on drums, keyboards and voice; and Simmonds and Johnson also appeared on several tracks). The album {{was released on}} Cardiacs own record label, Alphabet (which later became Alphabet Business Concern). The bizarre and sinister [...] "Alphabet Business Concern" [...] mythology now began to become {{a significant part of}} Cardiacs' artistic presentation, and the band members would promote and add to it at every opportunity. The band evolved an elaborate and theatrical stage show, involving [...] "bandsmen's uniforms, make-up, Sarah's <b>music</b> <b>stand,</b> (and) Tim's mile-wide grin". The finale included sprayed champagne, confetti cannons, appearances by The Consultant and Miss Swift (on behalf of the Alphabet Business Concern) and a mock-heroic/distressed exit for Tim Smith.|$|E

2500|$|The {{left-hand}} group shows eight fair haired angels wearing crowns {{and gathered}} {{in front of}} a <b>music</b> <b>stand</b> singing, although none of them looks towards the score on the stand. As in a number of the other panels, here van Eyck used the device of the open mouth to give a sense of life and motion to his figures. Borchert writes that the emphasis on the open mouths is [...] "specifically motivated by the desire to characterize the angel's facial expressions according to the various ranges of polyphonic singing. To that end the position of the angel's tongues are carefully registered, as are that of their teeth." [...] Art historian Elisabeth Dhanens notes how [...] "One can easily see by their singing who is the soprano, who is the alto, who is the tenor and who is the bass".|$|E
2500|$|The short version, as {{its name}} suggests, is only {{accompanied}} by a two-minute edit of the song. It features Superfly and several bands in a recording studio, as they perform a recording of the song together. Much of the video features close-ups, and non-steady camera work. The close-ups feature {{such things as the}} band members' instruments, and recording materials such as the sheet music or the recording machinery. The bulk of shots centre around vocalist Shiho Ochi as she performs the song in front of a <b>music</b> <b>stand,</b> with headphones. In some scenes of the video, individual shots are frozen and replaced with [...] versions featuring washed out colours, and occasionally writing (such as the word [...] ) while Ochi sings the words in the lyrics. The performance is interspersed with shots of Ochi working on the post-production of the recording in the booth, or on a laptop.|$|E
2500|$|Guánica is {{a modern}} town that {{maintains}} roots and connections to a traditional past. Known as el pueblo de la amistad (The town of Friendship), it is also occasionally referred to as el pueblo de las doce calles (the town of the twelve streets). The central part of town consists of five streets running north-south crossing seven other streets that run east-west, resulting in a compact grid of 24 square blocks, {{one of which is}} the town plaza. Facing the plaza is the Catholic Church, city hall, a school, and many shops; the plaza itself contains greenery, walks, and a <b>music</b> <b>stand.</b> In recent years this central area of the twelve streets has been extensively supplemented by suburbs in the south and west. Hills surround the town and harbor, including the 450-foot (140 m) hill to the east of town, itself topped by the tiny Fort Caprón. Two large factories, one producing fertilizer, partially distract the eye from the pleasant landscape, but both have been important to the economy of the town, at one time dominated by the sugar plantations of Central Guanica. The resort chain known as Club Med once attempted to set up a luxury resort on beaches east of the town, but withdrew due to local opposition which was apprehensive about both environmental and community degradation. East of the town some [...] of land, including three miles (5km) of beach, have been intermittently for sale. It is a fishing village; commercial fishermen still ply their traditional trade beyond the harbor entrance.|$|E

2500|$|Lennon, being {{mindful of}} Elvis Presley's [...] "All Shook Up", wanted {{something}} equally as stirring: [...] "I don't {{know where the}} 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [...] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' {{it was the first}} time in my life that I had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song". The song also included a number of falsetto [...] "wooooo"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of [...] "Twist and Shout", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, [...] "From Me to You". As Lennon later said: [...] "We stuck it in everything". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: [...] "We went into the living room and said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, [...] "I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the <b>music</b> <b>stand,</b> 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it—bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was a huge}} long {{room with}} many windows opening upon the park, and each window--there were {{a dozen or more}} {{reaching}} from the floor up--had its elaborate silk or satin curtains, heavily fringed, a canopy (is it?) above, its completely white shutters folding into the deep thickness of the wall. At either end of that great still place was an immense marble chimney-piece; the end by the bookcase showed the wolf and Romulus and Remus, with Homer and Virgil for supporters; the design of the other end I have forgotten. Frederick, Prince of Wales, swaggered flatly over the one, twice life-size, but mellowed by the surface gleam of oil; and over the other was an equally colossal group of departed Drews as sylvan deities, scantily clad, against a storm-rent sky. Down the centre of the elaborate ceiling were three chandeliers, each bearing some hundreds of dangling glass lustres, and over the interminable carpet--it impressed me as about as big as Sarmatia in the store-room Atlas--were islands and archipelagoes of chintz-covered chairs and couches, tables, great Sevres vases on pedestals, a bronze man and horse. Somewhere in this wilderness one came, I remember, upon--a big harp beside a lyre-shaped <b>music</b> <b>stand,</b> and a grand piano....|$|E

60|$|From {{talks with}} certain of our {{passengers}} whose home was Honolulu, {{and from a}} sketch by Mrs. Mary H. Krout, I was able to perceive what the Honolulu of to-day is, {{as compared with the}} Honolulu of my time. In my time it was a beautiful little town, made up of snow-white wooden cottages deliciously smothered in tropical vines and flowers and trees and shrubs; and its coral roads and streets were hard and smooth, and as white as the houses. The outside aspects of the place suggested the presence of a modest and comfortable prosperity--a general prosperity --perhaps one might strengthen the term and say universal. There were no fine houses, no fine furniture. There were no decorations. Tallow candles furnished the light for the bedrooms, a whale-oil lamp furnished it for the parlor. Native matting served as carpeting. In the parlor one would find two or three lithographs on the walls--portraits as a rule: Kamehameha IV., Louis Kossuth, Jenny Lind; and may be an engraving or two: Rebecca at the Well, Moses smiting the rock, Joseph's servants finding the cup in Benjamin's sack. There would be a center table, with books of a tranquil sort on it: The Whole Duty of Man, Baxter's Saints' Rest, Fox's Martyrs, Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, bound copies of The Missionary Herald and of Father Damon's Seaman's Friend. A melodeon; a <b>music</b> <b>stand,</b> with 'Willie, We have Missed You', 'Star of the Evening', 'Roll on Silver Moon', 'Are We Most There', 'I Would not Live Alway', and other songs of love and sentiment, together with an assortment of hymns. A what-not with semi-globular glass paperweights, enclosing miniature pictures of ships, New England rural snowstorms, and the like; sea-shells with Bible texts carved on them in cameo style; native curios; whale's tooth with full-rigged ship carved on it. There was nothing reminiscent of foreign parts, for nobody had been abroad. Trips were made to San Francisco, but that could not be called going abroad. Comprehensively speaking, nobody traveled.|$|E
