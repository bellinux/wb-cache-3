40|$|The {{majority}} of MgB 2 -based conductors are presently manufactured {{in association with}} iron, either as a single sheath material or as a protective layer between the superconducting ceramic core and an external sheath material such as Cu [1, 2]. This choice results from the stability of Fe towards reaction with MgB 2 in comparison with other metals [3, 4]. However, Fe is not totally inert during high-temperature treatments, especially when a mixture of Mg and B powders are loaded in the tube instead of pre-reacted MgB 2. An interface reaction layer consisting of Fe 2 B may form and reduce the actual cross-section of the ceramic core carrying the superconducting current. Depending on the manufacturing process, the thickness of this layer can reach up to several <b>micrometers,</b> <b>setting</b> serious limitations {{to the size of}} the MgB 2 filaments in multi-core conductors. The formation of the interface reaction layer can be followed in-situ by X-ray diffraction in transmission geometry, using a high-energy synchrotron beam. We compare here the behavior of two kinds of Fe-sheathed conductors prepared either with a “standard ” mixture of micrometer-sized Mg and B powders or using nanometer-sized precursors mechanically alloyed by high-energy ball milling. For the “standard ” wires, commercial Mg (≈ 30 µm) and B (≈ 1 µm) powders (Alfa Aesar) wer...|$|R

40|$|The band {{intensity}} of the 9. 6 micrometer (nu sub 3) band of ozone was investigated. The nu sub 3 band strength was determined from ultraviolet spectra over the interval 9. 36 - 11. 00 <b>micrometers.</b> A <b>set</b> of 34 absorption measurements were made at pressures of about 730 torr and mass paths of 0. 002 - 0. 025 atm cm (STP). The ozone amounts were corrected to the Harn (1961) absorption coefficients. The data indicate that the weak-line approximation is valid at least to 0. 025 atm cm (STP). A least-squares fit yields a band strength (298 K) of 355 /cm/atm cm STP {{with a standard deviation}} of 10 /cm/atm cm STP, in close agreement with results reported by McCaa and Shaw (1968) and Young and Bunner (1974) ...|$|R

So, usage {{of this phenomenon}} has been increased {{in the areas of}} biomedical, drug delivery and point of care analysis applications for manipulating, separating, trapping, sorting of bioparticles such as cells, bacteria, viruses, proteins, DNA etc., This paper mainly deals with separating selective particles from different particles in a non-uniform electric field applied micro channels using CFD ACE+ simulations without intensive experimental trials. Simulations have been performed on parallel types of electrode arrays. Behavior {{of particles}} (vertical and translational movements) in suspending medium was identified at different frequencies, phases and voltages. Based on these results we have simulated separating the spherical microbeads of 10 <b>micrometer</b> from <b>set</b> of different sized microbeads by switching the frequencies and phases of electrodes.

40|$|International audienceA new {{coating process}} {{involving}} a short stretching distance (1 mm) {{and a high}} draw ratio (around 200) is considered. The resulting thin molten polymer film (around 10 <b>micrometers)</b> is <b>set</b> down on a solid primary film and then covered by another solid secondary film. In experimental studies, periodical fluctuation in {{the thickness of the}} coated layer may be observed. The processing conditions markedly influence the onset and the development of these defects and modeling will help our understanding of their origins. The membrane approach which has been commonly used for cast film modeling is no longer valid and two dimensional time dependent models (within the thickness) are developed in the whole domain (upstream die and stretching path). A boundary-value problem with a free surface for the Stokes equations is considered and stability of the free surface is assessed using two different numerical strategies: a tracking strategy combined with linear stability analysis involving computation of leading eigenvalues, and a Level Set capturing strategy coupled with transient stability analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} {{air pollution}} caused by dust due to tillage activities in agricultural fields {{has long been}} a concern in the San Joaquin Valley of California. To understand the dust pollution processes, a high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a chemistry component including (WRF/Chem) developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. WRF/Chem including observed PM 10 emission rates (aerosol particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 <b>micrometers)</b> was <b>set</b> up to simulate airborne dust distribution at a tillage site near Los Banos, California in October 2007. Performance of the WRF/chem model in simulating the meteorological background and PM 10 concentration distribution is evaluated with the California Irrigation Management Information System datasets and Technical Support System observed PM 10 data. Results show that the WRF/chem model can provide reasonable background winds, surface level air temperature, and humidity information. It also captures the dynamical distribution of the PM 10, but it produces a higher PM 1 0 concentration than observations. Several other case studies in different fields were also conducted and compared with observations to further validate our results...|$|R
30|$|According to Bajzer et al. [10], at {{the steady}} state, {{the number of}} receptors at {{the surface of a}} cell is given by R_ 0 =V_r/k_t, where V_r is the zero order rate of {{insertion}} of receptors into the membrane and k_t is the turnover rate constant of ligand-free receptors. Using the values of V_r and k_t found in [10], we are led to R_ 06, 000 receptors. Also, as explained in our earlier work [3], the surface of one cell can be approximated to be 142.86 square micrometers, while a human erythrocyte normally has 2, 000 insulin binding sites, or 14 sites per square <b>micrometer.</b> Therefore, we <b>set</b> the initial number of activated receptors to be 2, 000 receptors [3].|$|R
40|$|For {{the future}} storage-ring {{experiments}} at the FAIR facility besides a large target area density (10 13 - 10 15 cm- 2) a small interaction length (< 5 mm) is also required, {{especially for the}} low-Z gases hydrogen and helium. State-ofthe-art internal targets are realized by producing a supersonic gas jet, i. e., by expanding a gas through a nozzle into vacuum, providing a target with a thickness < 10 13 cm- 2 spreading out over several millimeters in the interaction region. Recent experiments suggested that significantly higher target densities could be achieved by expanding the liquid at significantly lower temperatures [1]. In particular, a liquid discharged into vacuum delivers a uniquely functional target {{in the form of}} a droplet beam, where the droplet size, which can be as large as few <b>micrometers,</b> is univocally <b>set</b> by the source parameters...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{post-processing}} algorithm for CNC machine NC {{code was}} developed for altering NC code based on measurements from a stand-alone coordinate metrology system that measures the orientation and offset of the part and machine coordinate systems (CS). With this post-processing algorithm, the ability to machine a monolithic part larger than the working area of a machine in multiple sections becomes possible. A series of test parts were machined with a Haas Vertical Milling Machine (VMM) and a Leica laser tracker as proof of concept and to determine the errors introduced into the machining process by adding the additional metrology system. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that adding the stand-alone metrology system increases the magnitude of errors to approximately {{the accuracy of the}} metrology system itself, about 50 <b>micrometers.</b> The initial <b>set</b> of test parts machined showed errors at a factor of 25 larger than expected. It was determined that a component used to determine the machine's spindle location was introducing significant error into the process. The component was replaced and new parts machined that showed a significant improvement but still with errors larger than expected. Machine squareness errors showed the importance of measuring CS features within the same plane. Finally, it was determined that the definition of the part CS is sensitive to how the part is fixtured to the machine. Sub-scale machining is a viable process for machining large components with a slight increase in feature location error...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Modeling the {{anisotropic}} reflectance of snow will {{be important}} for various applications, like climatology, meteorology and water management. Accurate climatic and meteorological modeling of energy balance needs to take the anisotropic effect into account. This {{is also the case}} for accurate snow-cover mapping for water management. This paper describes the development of an empirical model for the anisotropic spectral reflectance of snow based on airborne DAIS- 7915 spectrometer data covering the spectral range 0. 4 - 12. 6 <b>micrometer.</b> The data <b>set</b> used is from the Jotunheimen mountain area in Norway. Flight lines were in the solar plane and orthogonal to this, and a swath angle range of ± 26 degrees was obtained. Combined with the effect of terrain slopes, an actual terrain incidence angle range of ± 40 degrees was obtained. An accurate terrain model was derived from digital aerial photographs. Areas without snow were masked out based on another infrared high-resolution digital aerial orthophoto. Field measurements confirmed homogeneous conditions allowing a large area of data to be used. Field measurements were also applied for calibration. The raw angle-to-reflectance data were smoothed and represented in a 3 D data storage model for further applications. The observation angles varied between – 45 º and 36 º and the solar zenith angle varied between 24 º and 55 º. A hot-spot region representing forward scattering showed about 8 % increase in radiance values. This anisotropy remained constant up to wavelengths of about 1700 nm. No anisotropic effects were detectable beyond this wavelength...|$|R
