5|$|The trotter type is {{the lightest}} Finnhorse. A trotter section horse {{should be of}} light {{conformation}} yet muscular, with a relatively long body and long legs. At the studbook evaluation, a trotter-type horse must <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> in racing results and/or in breeding value index as decreed by Suomen Hippos. A trotter's disposition is evaluated during the drivability test. However, type {{is not part of}} the studbook evaluation standard for trotters.|$|E
5|$|All leaders work as unpaid volunteers, {{of which}} there are around 120,000. In {{addition}} to this number, the association employs 198 full-time and part-time staff to support the work of its adult volunteers. Senior volunteers in The Scout Association are called 'Commissioners'. Every County/Area/Region and District is headed by a Commissioner who is responsible for ensuring the Districts/Groups under their jurisdiction <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> set by the association. They receive support from Regional Development Officers in England, who are employed by the Regional Development Service and deployed locally to help support the association's objectives. Commissioners in the other nations receive support from Field Commissioners, employed and directed differently. District Commissioners report to the County/Area/Regional Commissioner, who in turn report to the UK Chief Commissioner.|$|E

Guest star Maya Stojan reprises her role as Agent 33, before being replaced by Wen when the character takes on {{the appearance of the}} latter's character Melinda May. This leads to the climactic fight between both of Wen's characters, realized through choreographed stunt work and CGI; the crew worked harder to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of Tancharoen following his acclaimed action work on , including the stunt team, who had worked on that series, and the costume and set designers, who looked to accommodate the fight.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Russell Mallory (1812 – November 9, 1873) {{served in}} the United States Senate as Senator (Democrat) from Florida from 1850 to the secession of his home state and the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War. For much of that period, he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. This was a time of rapid naval reform, and he insisted that the ships of the United States Navy should be as capable as those of Great Britain and France, the foremost navies in the world at that time. He also wrote a bill, and guided it through Congress, that provided for compulsory retirement of officers who did not <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the profession.|$|E

Fully renovated the stadium contains 32,580 seats, and a health spa and fitness. The Boris Trajkovski Sports Center {{is the largest}} sports complex in the country. It was opened in 2008 and named after president Boris Trajkovski, who died in 2004. It includes room dedicated to handball, basketball and volleyball, a bowling alley, a fitness area and an ice hockey court. Its main hall, which regularly hosts concerts, holds around 10,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

Option 2 was to restructure the program to provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an additional cost of $6.4billion and would be operational by 2012. Option 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the additional cost for this option was estimated at $5.6billion and the entry into service by 2012. The last option was to upgrade and extend life of current fleet {{at a cost of}} $1.4billion; however this would not <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.|$|E

25|$|The NHPA {{established}} the historic preservation {{plan for the}} United States not based on a U.S. governmental model but rather on that of a highly decentralized system allowing the states to carry out activities which would allow {{the federal government to}} <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the 1966 act.

Most who died on the island were infected with typhus, which sprang up from the conditions there in 1847. Grosse Isle is the largest burial ground for refugees of the Great Famine outside Ireland. After Canadian Confederation in 1867, the buildings and equipment were modernized to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the new Canadian government's immigration policies.

Of these, three held ground vehicles, another three were used to store ammunition and two contained aviation-related equipment. At this time the program was managed by the Blount Island Command, which also oversees the Marines' ship-based propositioning programs.

25|$|As the Japanese {{forces in}} China were {{mainly on the}} {{offensive}} and suffered relatively few casualties, few Japanese soldiers surrendered to Chinese forces prior to August 1945.

The conditions these POWs were held in generally did not <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> required by international law. The Japanese government expressed no concern for these abuses, however, as it did not want IJA soldiers to even consider surrendering. The government was, however, concerned about reports that 300 POWs had joined the Chinese Communists and had been trained to spread anti-Japanese propaganda.|$|E
