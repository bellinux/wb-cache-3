50|$|Filters can be {{constructed}} with different layers, called <b>mixed</b> <b>bed</b> filters. Sand is a common filter material, but anthracite, granular activated carbon (GAC), garnet and ilmenite are also common filter materials. Anthracite is a harder material and has less volatile compared to other coals. Ilmenite and garnet are heavy compared to sand. Garnet consists several minerals, causing a shifting red colour. Ilmenite is an oxide of iron and titanium. GAC {{can be used in}} the process of adsorption and filtration at the same time. These materials can be used both alone, or combined with other media. Different combinations give different filter classification. Monomedia is a one layered filter, commonly consisting of sand and is today replaced by newer technology. Deep-bed monomedia is also a one layered filter which consist of either anthracite or GAC. The deep-bed monomedia filter is used when there is a consistent water quality and this gives a longer run time. Dual media (two layered) often contain a sand layer in the bottom with an anthracite or GAC layer on top. Trimedia or mixed media is a filter with three layers. Trimedia often have garnet or ilmenite in the bottom layer, sand in the middle and anthracite at the top.|$|E

50|$|Following {{condensation}} of the {{low pressure}} exhaust steam in the condenser, the feed water is passed to a condensate sump mounted under the condenser. From this receiver the condensate is drawn by one or two extraction pumps and passed through a discharge strainer. The low pressure feed heating system consists of five Direct Contact heaters with one high level deaerator to provide a high feed pump suction head. The Direct Contact L.P. heaters are arranged in two banks, comprising three and two heaters respectively. Within each bank the heaters are stacked above each other so that the condensate drains from the lower pressure heater below by gravity. The heights of the heaters are approximately inversely proportional to the bled steam pressures. The advantages of Direct Contact heaters are essentially that thermal efficiency is improved, capital cost is reduced due to fewer numbers of extraction pumps being required, and the system is entirely ferrous. The main extraction pump discharges the condensate to No.1 D.C. heater from which it cascades down to No.2 and then to No.3 D.C. heater by gravity. Two lift pumps deliver the condensate to No.4 D.C. heater, from which it cascades through No.5 D.C. heater to two deaerator lift pumps. The deaerator lift pumps discharge the condensate to the deaerator and from there it passes to the boiler feed pump suction main through microwire and magnetic filters. The main boiler feed pump is driven by a steam turbine which receives its steam from the main H.P. turbine exhaust. It comprises a single cylinder eleven stage turbine turning at 5,000 rev/min (31.42 Rad/min) and driving a multi-stage pump to give a delivery pressure of 2,067 tonne/m2 (2,940 lbf/in2). Two electrically driven Starting and Standby feed pumps are provided. The high pressure heating system consists of two parallel banks of two heaters being numbered 7 and 8 stages in the system. Each of the H.P. heaters is vertical and of the non-contact type. From the H.P. heaters the condensate, at a temperature of 253 degrees Celsius (455 degrees Fahrenheit), is passed into the boiler economiser. During unit shutdowns {{the whole of the}} feed system can be ‘blanketed’ with nitrogen gas. This is an attempt to reduce the rate at which copper and ferrous oxides form, hence reduce the ‘carrying over’ of these oxides to the boiler drum. Boiler feed water make-up is supplied by the Water Treatment Plant. This has a continuous rating of 3,672,000 Litres (970,000 gallons) in 24 hours at 153,300 Litres (40,500 gallons) per hour. The plant comprises three groups of cation, anion and <b>mixed</b> <b>bed</b> ion exchange resin units, together with vacuum degassing and pressure filtering plant. Each group processes 76,650 Litres (20,250 gallons) per hour and normally two groups are in service at one time, with the third on standby or being regenerated.|$|E

However, the current global and domestic production of biodiesel is far below the petro-diesel consumption and demand. To increase the availability of biodiesel in the market, new methods of biodiesel production must be developed {{to take advantage of}} the plentiful low quality waste derived feed stocks that currently present problems to biodiesel production using conventional methods. This research presents one new approach based upon using heterogeneous highly cross linked <b>mixed</b> <b>bed</b> solid phase catalysts to facilitate the production of biodiesel from feed stocks with high concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA). The performance of the heterogeneous <b>mixed</b> <b>bed</b> catalysts method developed in this research was evaluated and optimized for catalyst concentration and reaction duration while the mixing rate, reaction temperature, initial FFA composition of the feed stock and the alcohol-to-oil molar ratio were kept constant.

Through experimentation, it was found that FFA removal with the <b>mixed</b> <b>bed</b> resin is due to ion exchange with the quaternary ammonium functional group and not catalysis to form esters.

This variation could be attributed to the difference in the fatty acid content and the different number of titratable histidines and acid amino-acid residues in the albumin from different sources. It can be concluded from the specific conductance of these isoionic solutions that ions other than H+, OH− and protein are effectively removed by a <b>mixed</b> <b>bed</b> ion-exchange column.

To overcome this difficulty, a three-dimensional numerical model was developed using a finite difference method (FDM) flow model coupled with a distinct element method (DEM) particle model. The main aim was to investigate, at a high spatial resolution, the physical processes occurring during the initiation of motion of single grains at the sediment-water interface and in the shallow subsurface of simplified sediment beds under different flow velocities. Increasing proportions of very fine sand (D 50 = 0. 08 mm) were mixed into a coarse sand matrix (D 50 = 0. 6 mm) to simulate <b>mixed</b> sediment <b>beds,</b> starting with a pure coarse sand bed in experiment 1 (0 wt% fines), and proceeding through experiment 2 (6. 5 wt% fines), experiment 3 (10. 5 wt% fines), and experiment 4 (28. 7 wt% fines). All <b>mixed</b> <b>beds</b> were tested for their erosion behavior at predefined flow velocities varying in the range of U 1 - 5 = 10 - 30 cm/s.

40|$|Natural wind-eroded soils {{generally}} {{contain a}} mixture of particle sizes. However, models for aeolian saltation are typically derived for sediment bed surfaces containing only a single particle size. To treat natural mixed beds, models for saltation and associated dust aerosol emission have typically simplified aeolian transport either {{as a series of}} non-interacting single particle size beds or as a bed containing only the median or mean particle size. Here, we test these common assumptions underpinning aeolian transport models using measurements of size-resolved saltation fluxes at three natural field sites. We find that a wide range of sand size classes experience "equal susceptibility" to saltation at a single common threshold wind shear stress, contrary to the "selective susceptibility" expected for treatment of a <b>mixed</b> <b>bed</b> as multiple single particle size beds. Furthermore, we observe strong size-selectivity in the mobility of different particle sizes, which is not adequately accounted for in current models. At all field sites, mobility is enhanced for particles that are 0. 4 - 0. 8 times the median bed particle diameter, while mobility declines rapidly with increasing particle size above this range. We further observe that the most mobile particles also experience the largest saltation heights, which helps to explain variations in size-selective mobility. These observations refute the common simplification of saltation as a series of non-interacting single particle sizes. Sand transport and dust emission models that use this incorrect assumption can be both simplified and improved by instead using a single particle size representative of the <b>mixed</b> <b>bed.</b> Comment: 35 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, 3 supplementary figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{most widely}} used bed {{material}} in the existing fluidized bed systems is silica sand. Upon burning fuels with high alkali content, such as biomass, in a bed of silica sand, alkali silicates are formed as molten glassy phase that easily stick and form agglomerates, defluidization of the reactor and unplanned operational stops. Several materials have been tested as alternative bed materials, often containing aluminate minerals. Due to the relatively high cost of such bed materials the most dominant practice is still the use of silica sand even with high alkali fuels and the bed sintering is controlled by continuous replacement of the bed material. The present study investigates the possibility of <b>mixing</b> <b>bed</b> materials and thereby optimizing the existing process by combining the low cost of silica sand with the sintering inhibiting properties of bauxite.

The performance of the mixture of bed materials was then evaluated based on the tendency to chemically interact with the alkali compounds, the formation of agglomerates and the effect on the overall performance of the reactor. Thermodynamic predictions of the expected compounds at the given conditions were also used to compare with the experimentally obtained results. It was observed that <b>mixing</b> <b>bed</b> materials led to change in the observed mechanism of agglomeration and is beneficial for the fluidization.
