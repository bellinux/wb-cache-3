50|$|The communication-based model, {{advanced}} by Duncan and Moriarty (as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011) contends {{that there are}} three levels of IMC integration; Duncan and Moriarty affirm that the lowest level of IMC integration is level one where IMC decisions are made by marketing communication level <b>message</b> <b>sources.</b> These sources include personal sales, advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, public relations, packaging and events departments. The stake holders concerned at this stage are consumers, local communities, media and interest groups (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). At the second stage of IMC integration Duncan and Moriarty (as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011) establish that level one integration departments still have decision making power but are now guided by marketing level <b>message</b> <b>sources.</b> At stage two integration the <b>message</b> <b>sources</b> are those departments in which product mix, price mix, marketing communication and distribution mix are settled; appropriately, stakeholders at this stage of integration are distributors, suppliers and competition (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). It {{should also be noted that}} it is at this stage of integration that consumers interact with the organisation (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). Moving forward, the last stage Duncan and Moriarty's Communication Based Model (as cited in Laurie and Mortimer, 2011) is stage three where <b>message</b> <b>sources</b> are at the corporate level of the organisation; these <b>message</b> <b>sources</b> include administration, manufacturing operations, marketing, finance, human resources and legal departments. The stake holders at this level of IMC integration are employees, investors, financial community, government and regulators (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). At the final stages of IMC integration, IMC decisions are made not only by corporate level departments but also by departments classed in stages one and two. It is the inclusion of all organisational departments by which a horizontal, non linear method of communication with consumers is achieved. By unifying all fronts of the marketing firm, communications are synchronised to achieve consistency, consonance and ultimately strong corporate identity.|$|R

40|$|Authenticating {{the source}} of a message in a large {{distributed}} system can be difficult {{due to the lack of}} a single authority that can tell for whom a channel speaks. This has led many to propose the use of a path of authorities, each able to authenticate the next in the path, such that the first in the path can be authenticated by the message recipient and the last can authenticate the <b>message</b> <b>source.</b> In this paper we suggest the use of multiple paths to provide redundant confirmation of the <b>message</b> <b>source,</b> and focus on two related notions of path independence that seem to bolster authentication. We formalize the problems of locating maximum sets of paths with these independence properties in a graph-theoretic framework, give evidence that they are not polynomial-time solvable, and propose approximation algorithms for these problems.

40|$|In {{recent years}} we have {{witnessed}} the urgent demand {{in a wide variety}} of applications for wireless sensor networks, such as military surveillance, disaster relief, environmental monitoring, etc. In these applications, usually a base (sensor) station is responsible for monitoring the entire network and collecting the data (information). If any emergency or certain events of interest occur in any region, the base station, referred to as a <b>message</b> <b>source,</b> will propagate the information to all other nodes. However, such a scenario may not be practical. Quite often, the <b>message</b> <b>source</b> is not a fixed node. Instead, there may be multiple message sources in charge of different regions or events. On the latter circumstance, the challenging issue therefore becomes how to propagate information efficiently when message sources vary from time to time. None of conventional broadcast algorithms performs well in this case since at each time, the change of <b>message</b> <b>source</b> incurs a huge implementation cost of re-building a broadcast tree. To deal with this difficult problem, we make endeavor in studying the theorems and the algorithms for multiple source broadcast. The targeted algorithms should be source-independent to serve the practical need. In this paper, we formulate the Minimum-Latency Multi-Source Broadcast problem. We propose a novel solution using a fixed shared backbone, which is independent of the message sources and can be used repeatedly to reduce the broadcast latency. To the best of our knowledge, our work is deemed the first attempt to design such a multi-source broadcast algorithm with a derived theoretical latency upper-bound.
