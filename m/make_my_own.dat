500|$|With the new storyline ready, Cloris Leachman {{was quickly}} hired to play Ruth Martin. [...] As the season's filming progressed, Leachman tired of playing a farm woman. She wouldn't sign a contract, {{and refused to}} do PR for the show's sponsor, Campbell's Soup, telling the company, [...] "I <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> soup. I don't eat yours." [...] Audiences found Leachman and co-star Jon Shepodd as Paul Martin [...] "too stiff". The two worked adult glances and touches such as holding hands, hugs, pecks on the lips into their {{on-screen}} performances {{in order to give}} their characters more depth. [...] Toward the end of the season, George Chandler was hired to play a grandfatherly character and to bring some warmth to the show, but Leachman was soon feuding with him; their disagreements appeared in the gossip columns. [...] With ratings plummeting and public resentment aroused, show owner Jack Wrather summarily fired Leachman and Shepodd in February 1958 when filming for the 19571958 season was completed.|$|E
500|$|The concerts were a {{considerable}} financial outlay for Bache, {{who did not}} have a regular salary until 1881 and had to sustain himself through teaching. By 1873, he wrote, he had to [...] "decide whether I shall sacrifice myself entirely to the production of Liszt's orchestral and choral works (which after all can never be immortal as Bach, Beethoven and Wagner: here I feel that Bülow is right). Or shall I <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> improvement the object of my life, and not spend a third of my income in one evening." [...] Bülow became concerned enough about the situation to waive his fee after one concert he conducted, and to contribute £50 out of his own pocket. Liszt was also concerned, writing, [...] "For years [...] has sacrificed money for the performance of my works in London. Several times I advised him against it, but he answered imperturbably, 'That is my business.'" [...] Whenever Bache was asked about finances for the concerts, he would tell whoever was asking that the cost was [...] "a just recompense" [...] and add that even if Liszt had charged him for his lessons {{at the same rate as}} the average village piano teacher, he would still be deeply in his debt.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Hole in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000. Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I was going to do with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know if I was going to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994.

Shortly after, the silhouettes of three women appear behind Flo Rida while the clip is intercut with shots of a rotating disco ball and several women on a circular bed. Several women are then seen dancing on or around cars while Flo Rida stands in front of them. A waitress comes in to serve them an unidentified beverage.

500|$|On {{the final}} cut privilege, Spielberg was {{dissatisfied}} with the film. Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. [...] "I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately," [...] Spielberg explained. [...] "Anyway, Close Encounters was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted to <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> director's cut. They agreed {{on the condition that}} I show the inside of the mothership so they could have something to hang a [...] campaign on. I never should have shown the inside of the mother ship." [...] In 1979, Columbia gave Spielberg $1.5million to produce what became the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by a total of ten minutes, so that the Special Edition was three minutes shorter than the original 1977 release. The Special Edition featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the SS Cotopaxi in the Gobi Desert, and a view of the inside of the mothership. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition was released in August 1980, making a further $15.7million, accumulating a final $303.7million box office gross. Roger Ebert [...] "thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. ...

With over a minute left in the game, Marshall caught the go-ahead touchdown pass {{and then began to}} pull a glove from his pants. Denver wide receiver Brandon Stokley rushed over to Marshall to urge him to put the glove away, as it could be considered a touchdown celebration prop, which is against NFL rules (a 15-yard penalty on the kickoff could be assessed). Marshall later explained that he was intending to put on the glove (which was white with one half of it painted black) as a means to honor racial progress and unity in the United States, following the country electing Barack Obama as President two days earlier. Regarding the attempted touchdown celebration, Marshall said, [...] "I know at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised that black glove and that fist as a silent gesture of black power and liberation.
