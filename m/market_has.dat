5|$|In March 1939, Aberdeen {{changed the}} black and gold colours to red and white, {{reflecting}} the silver and red colours of the official City of Aberdeen arms. The first red strips were worn with white shorts, with either red or white socks from 1939 until the 1965–66 season. In 1966, Aberdeen adopted red shorts, making the official kit all-red, {{similar to that of}} Liverpool, who made a similar change at around the same time. This arrangement has continued to the present day, with several variations in design, in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt <b>market</b> <b>has</b> expanded. In the late 1970s an Admiral strip featured five vertical white stripes {{on the left side of}} the shirt and shorts, and the early 1980s shirts—as worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup final—featured white vertical pinstripes. Later design changes included significant amounts of blue, and a one-season reversion to white shorts, although the all-red scheme returned in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Live English top-flight {{football}} {{has remained}} off free-to-air television in Britain, with few exceptions. It {{was not until}} 2006 that BSkyB's monopoly on Premier League television rights was broken; this came after {{an investigation by the}} European Commission which concluded that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Setanta Sports was awarded two packages, but encountered financial difficulties by 2009 and went into administration. Their rights were sold to ESPN, who showed a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season and subsequently 23 from 2010–11 to 2012–13. In June 2012, the Premier League awarded BT rights to 38 games over three seasons, starting from 2013–14. BT's introduction into the football broadcasting <b>market</b> <b>has</b> been considered a threat to BSkyB's dominance, particularly as the company was awarded exclusive rights to live UEFA Champions League football in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Miran Pastourma is a famed pastourma and sujuk charcuterie {{business}} and market in Athens, Greece. The <b>market</b> <b>has</b> been in operation since 1922.

The founder of the shop, Miran Kourounlian, {{is thought to be}} the man who brought pastourma to Athens for the first time. Miran is considered the largest company {{of its kind in the}} European Union. The flavour of pastourma coming from the historical enterprise permeates Euripides Street in the centre of Athens. Miran and its neighbor Arapian Cold Cuts are considered two of the historical establishments of Athens. Miran has been in the same spot in Euripidou Street since its opening in 1922. Miran is the recipient of multiple gourmet prizes.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the ratio}} of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a {{television}} station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require {{that there must be}} eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market).Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana <b>market</b> <b>has</b> two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns both XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV along with being the license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary Bay City Television).|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of papers {{published}} {{in the last decade}} have attempted to show that energy <b>markets</b> <b>have</b> grown more integrated. These articles attempt to infer that various <b>markets</b> <b>have</b> become more "unified" because the correlation (in various forms) of prices between <b>markets</b> <b>has</b> increased during the last several years. This article suggests that a more appropriate modeling technique based on the theory of arbitrage as presented in Spiller and Wood (1988 a and b), is better suited to answering this question. In this paper, the arbitrage technique is extended and applied to light crude oil markets in the 1990 s. Arbitrage costs between markets are estimated. In addition, the hypothesis that crude oil <b>markets</b> <b>have</b> converged during this period is tested. Substantial though mixed support is gained for this hypothesis. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{market for}} replica shirts has grown enormously, with the revenue {{generated}} for leading clubs {{and the frequency}} with which they change designs coming under increased scrutiny, especially in the United Kingdom, where the market for replicas is worth in excess of £200m. Several clubs have been accused of price fixing, and in 2003 Manchester United were fined £1.65m by the Office of Fair Trading. The high prices charged for replicas have also led to many fans buying fake shirts which are imported from countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. Nonetheless, the chance for fans to purchase a shirt bearing the name and number of a star player can lead to significant revenue for a club. In the first six months after David Beckham's transfer to Real Madrid the club sold more than one million shirts bearing his name. A <b>market</b> <b>has</b> also developed for shirts worn by players during significant matches, which are sold as collector's items. The shirt worn by Pelé in the 1970 FIFA World Cup Final sold at auction for over £150,000 in 2002.|$|E
