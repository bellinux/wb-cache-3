50|$|However, conflating the {{categorical}} and multinomial distributions {{can lead}} to problems. For example, in a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, which arises commonly in natural language processing models (although not usually with this name) {{as a result of}} collapsed Gibbs sampling where Dirichlet distributions are collapsed out of a hierarchical Bayesian model, {{it is very important to}} distinguish categorical from multinomial. The joint distribution of the same variables with the same Dirichlet-multinomial distribution has two different forms depending on whether it is characterized as a distribution whose domain is over individual categorical nodes or over multinomial-style counts of nodes in each particular category (similar to the distinction between a set of Bernoulli-distributed nodes and a single binomial-distributed node). Both forms have very similar-looking probability mass functions (PMF's), which both make reference to multinomial-style counts of nodes in a category. However, the multinomial-style PMF has an extra factor, a <b>multinomial</b> <b>coefficient,</b> that is a constant equal to 1 in the categorical-style PMF. Confusing the two can easily lead to incorrect results in settings where this extra factor is not constant with respect to the distributions of interest. The factor is frequently constant in the complete conditionals used in Gibbs sampling and the optimal distributions in variational methods.|$|E
