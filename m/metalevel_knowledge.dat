Roughly speaking, base-level knowledge {{has to do with}} information about some particular domain, while <b>metalevel</b> <b>knowledge</b> has to do with knowledge about that information. A typical base-level fact might be, "Iraq invaded Kuwait," while a typical metalevel fact might be, "To show that a country c is aggressive, first try to find another country that has been invaded by c. " Base-level information is of necessity domaindependent, since the facts presented will involve the particular domain about which the system is expected to reason. Metalevel information, however, can be either domain-dependent (as in the example of the previous paragraph and as typically described in [Silver, 1986]), or domain-independent. Typical domain-independent metalevel rules are the cheapest-first heuristic or the results found in Smith's work on control of inference [Smith, 1986, Smi [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Metamodeling {{is often}} identied {{as a key}} layer in the devel-opment of an {{information}} system because it formally denes the modeling primitives {{that will be used}} in subsequent modeling activities. We use the Conceptual Graph (CG) theory for illustration purposes. The simplicity of the CG notation and its exibility to represent <b>metalevel</b> <b>knowledge</b> through the use of contexts makes it a serious contender for the repre-sentation of a metamodeling theory. Therefore, this paper presents a CG based metamodeling framework for the modeling of information systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} {{are widely}} used methods in design and other engineering tasks. Providing libraries of reusable model fragments i a promising way of supporting engineering modelling. The paper discusses means of structuring such libraries in a generic and reusable way. Model content facts can be organized {{on the basis of}} the ontologies that are generally important in physical systems engineering. In addition, the paper suggests that such libraries need to support various kinds of modelling assumptions about model fragments. Modelling can be usefully approached as a form of assumption management, asa means of reflecting the <b>metalevel</b> <b>knowledge</b> that is employed by experienced ngineers. A categorization f modelling assumptions is proposed that aims at further support for reusability and shareability...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} are discussed {{of using a}} logic system for knowledge representation {{that is based on}} descriptions, rather than predicates, and that embodies two fundamental ideas for structuring knowledge that are distilled from semantic networks and frame-based languages: inheritance and attributions. Taxonomic reasoning on a lattice of descriptions combined with deduction strategies defined at the <b>metalevel</b> provide the <b>knowledge</b> base with the capability to deal with complex problem-solving tasks...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the types of}} peer discussion that occur during lecture-based tutorial sessions. It focuses in particular on whether discussions of this kind have certain characteristics that might indicate success in the post-testing phase. The data were collected during an introductory physics course. The main data set was gathered {{with the aid of}} audio recordings. Data-driven content analysis was applied in the analysis to facilitate the placement of students’ discussions in particular categories related to different types of discussions. Four major discussion types were found: discussions related to the content <b>knowledge,</b> <b>metalevel</b> discussions including metaconceptual and metacognitive elements, discussions related to practical issues, and creating a base for discussion, seen here in the order of their prevalence. These categories were found to possess individual substructures that involved, for example, asking and answering questions, participating in a dialogue, or disagreeing with a peer. Analyzing the substructures of the categories revealed that there were evident differences between the groups, some of them related to the group size. With regard to the characteristics of discussions considered to be connected to a better learning outcome, it was observed that a great number of lines uttered related to the physics content or metalevel discussions seemed to have a direct bearing on success in the post test at the group level. For individual students, answering content-related questions posed by their peers might also indicate success in the post test. We would encourage researchers to continue this type of research in order to discover the essential characteristics of students’ discussions that facilitate learning...|$|R
