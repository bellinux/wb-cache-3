5|$|First year {{students}} cover legal foundation courses: Torts (4 credits), Contracts (6 credits), Property (6 credits), Civil Procedure (5 credits), Criminal Law (3 credits) and Legal Process (6 credits). Legal Process teaches students legal {{research and}} writing. First-year students also take an orientation course {{to the community}} service program in the first semester and an additional legal research course in the second semester. First-year students <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> any electives.|$|E

25|$|Estradiol has a {{profound}} effect on bone. Individuals without it (or other estrogens) will become tall and eunuchoid, as epiphyseal closure is delayed or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place. Bone structure is affected also, resulting in early osteopenia and osteoporosis. Also, women past menopause experience an accelerated loss of bone mass due to a relative estrogen deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Tashiro was {{released}} on Parole in July 20, 2014. Thereafter, he began his stay at DARC Jeanne (DARC stands for Drug Addiction Rehabilitation Center. Ironically, with Masashi Tashiro being known for his puns, {{the name of this}} Rehab Center is also a pun on Jeanne D'Arc). He appeared at a press conference on March 18, 2015, announcing the Opening of the Asagaya Loft A. There's a chance that Tashiro may want to return, but the entertainment industry <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> kindly to it.|$|E

25|$|Packaged and {{processed}} foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so {{may be a}} special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions. Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients. Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients. For example, while some vegetarians may be unaware of animal-derived rennet's role {{in the production of}} cheese, and may therefore unknowingly consume the product, other vegetarians <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> issue with its consumption.|$|E
25|$|The cost {{of living}} in Hawaii, {{specifically}} Honolulu, is high {{compared to that of}} most major U.S. cities, although it is 6.7% lower than in New York City and 3.6% lower than in San Francisco. These numbers <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> into account some costs, such as increased travel costs for flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the contiguous U.S. While some online stores offer free shipping on orders to Hawaii, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and certain other U.S. territories.|$|E
25|$|The exams {{somewhat}} overlap, {{with the}} medium-hard AMC 10 questions being {{the same as}} the medium-easy ones on the AMC 12. Since 2002, two administrations have been scheduled, so as to avoid conflicts with school breaks. Students are eligible to take an A exam and a B exam, and may even take the AMC 10-A and the AMC 12-B, though they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> both the AMC 10 and AMC 12 from the same date. If a student takes both exams, they may use either score towards qualification to the AIME or USAMO.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, this duty can be {{discharged}} by advising the client {{of the consequences}} in a forthright matter, and ensuring the client takes the engineer's advice. In very rare cases, where even a governmental authority <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> appropriate action, the engineer can only discharge the duty by making the situation public. As a result, whistleblowing by professional engineers is not an unusual event, and courts have often sided with engineers in such cases, overruling duties to employers and confidentiality considerations that otherwise would have prevented the engineer from speaking out.|$|E
25|$|A man {{may only}} take a second wife if a judge authorizes it, and only {{if there is an}} {{exceptional}} and objective justification for it, the first wife consents, and the man has sufficient resources to support the two families and guarantee all maintenance rights, accommodation and equality in all aspects of life. Moreover, a woman can stipulate in her marriage contract that her husband <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> a second wife, and a first wife must consent to the second. The first wife may also petition for divorce if the husband takes another wife.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Amendment {{protects the}} {{interest}} {{people have in}} keeping their persons, houses, papers, and effects free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Though most of the Court's container jurisprudence deals with the search of the container rather than the initial seizure, there existed some general principles. First, the seizure <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place without a warrant, supported by probable cause, and describing particularly the things to be seized. Second, over time, exceptions to the warrant requirement had evolved, allowing for seizure without probable cause in exigent circumstances not allowing for the time to obtain a warrant.|$|E

25|$|During the match, {{the captain}} of the batting side may request the rolling of the pitch for a period of not more than 7 minutes before the start of each innings (other than the first innings of the match) and before the start of each {{subsequent}} day's play. In addition, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start is delayed, {{the captain of}} the batting side may request to have the pitch rolled for not more than 7 minutes, unless the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect {{on the state of the}} pitch. Once the game has begun, rolling <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place other than in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The final planned {{phase of}} the stadium's {{expansion}} includes the construction of permanent seating and an upper deck in the south end zone, completely enclosing the playing field. The stadium's seating capacity {{is expected to reach}} 112,000 once the south end zone is fully enclosed, which would mean DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium would surpass Michigan Stadium as the largest football stadium in North America. However, the date of the final construction phase to fully enclose the south end zone has not been set nor have any funds been raised. Varying sources claim this phase <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> place for upwards of 10 to 15 years, though on March 11, 2014 an announcement was made that an exploratory committee has been formed regarding the expansion of the stadium in conjunction with the construction of the Dell Medical School on campus.|$|E
25|$|The Book of Isaiah clearly {{claims that}} God {{is the source}} of at least some natural disasters, but Isaiah doesn't attempt to explain the {{motivation}} behind the creation of evil. In contrast, the Book of Job {{is one of the most}} widely known formulations of the problem of evil in Western thought. In it, Satan challenges God regarding his servant Job, claiming that Job only serves God for the blessings and protection that he receives from him. God allows Satan to plague Job and his family in a number of ways, with the limitation that Satan <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> Job's life (but his children are killed). Job discusses this with three friends and questions God regarding his suffering which he finds to be unjust. God responds in a speech and then more than restores Job's prior health, wealth, and gives him new children.|$|E
