5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the general {{election}} of 2006, Reinfeldt, as leader of the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party,</b> participated {{in the creation of the}} Alliance for Sweden. It united the centre-right in a coalition of the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party,</b> the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Christian Democrats. Reinfeldt is said to have been instrumental in uniting the four parties, which previously were known for being notoriously divided, in order to present a powerful alternative to the Social Democrats. The parties presented a joint election manifesto for the alliance.|$|E

50|$|On 26 February, {{following}} the defection of government MPs to the Opposition (including Justice Minister Jonas James), Carcasses reshuffled his Cabinet to offer positions to Opposition members. Four Opposition MPs joined his government, {{in exchange for}} Cabinet positions. Stephen Kalsakau (Reunification of <b>Moderate</b> <b>Parties)</b> was appointed Minister of Climate Change. Paul Telukluk (Reunification of <b>Moderate</b> <b>Parties)</b> became Minister for Internal Affairs, replacing Christophe Emelee, who was reshuffled {{to the position of}} Minister for Justice. Daniel Toara was dismissed from his position as Minister for Trade, to make way for Willie Jimmy (Liberal Party).

5|$|After {{defeat in}} 2014, Reinfeldt {{announced}} he would step down as both Prime Minister of Sweden and as party leader of the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party.</b> He {{stepped down from the}} office of Prime Minister on 3 October 2014, being succeeded by Stefan Löfven. He resigned from the Riksdag on 31 December 2014 and stepped down as party leader on 10 January 2015, being succeeded by Anna Kinberg Batra.|$|E

The Alliance got a majority of votes cast, but with 173 seats no absolute majority in parliament.

On the government side, the Union of <b>Moderate</b> <b>Parties</b> (centre-right) also initially endorsed Kenneth Natapei, before putting forward its own candidate. Ultimately, five other candidates {{took part in the}} election alongside Natapei : Alatoi Ishmael Kalsakau (independent), Nadia Kaneggai (People's Progressive Party), Allan Carlot (Natatok), Georgie Calo (Union of <b>Moderate</b> <b>Parties)</b> and Jocelyn Mete (independent).|$|R
5|$|From 2009, the Swedish economy {{emerged as}} one of the world's fastest {{recovering}} economies with high competitiveness. Sweden was noted for having proved to overcome the crisis better than any other developed countries, and this was highlighted by the Government as a force in the run-up to 2010 general election. As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010. This was the first time ever that the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party</b> was re-eleted after completing a full first term.|$|E
5|$|Reinfeldt {{became the}} Prime Minister of Sweden on 6 October 2006, serving {{concurrently}} as Leader of the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party.</b> The 41-year old Reinfeldt {{became the youngest}} person to become Prime Minister since Rickard Sandler became Prime Minister {{at the age of}} 40 in 1925. With victories in 2006 and in 2010, Reinfeldt was the Moderate Party's longest-serving prime minister and the only person to lead the party to two consecutive general election victories. His Government compromised four parties (including his own) which prior to the election had formed a coalition named Alliance for Sweden, later turned into the Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Reinfeldt's {{first term}} in office was marked by the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis and recession. His popularity fell until the economy of Sweden {{emerged as one of}} the strongest in Europe; this brought a resurgence of support for him, resulting in his government's re-election in 2010. Despite the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party</b> getting its highest share of the vote since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1921, Reinfeldt's government was reduced to a minority government, owing to the rise of Sweden Democrats; but he remained in power as the first centre-right Prime Minister since the Swedish-Norwegian Union to be re-elected.|$|E
50|$|The Vanua'aku Pati, led by Donald Kalpokas, {{obtained}} 18 seats. The ruling Union of <b>Moderate</b> <b>Parties</b> obtained 12, {{while the}} National United Party obtained 11, and the Melanesian Progressive Party 6.|$|R

5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} saw the {{beginnings}} of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had its foundation in the Reformation. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party</b> over fears of fanaticism by the former and the acceptance of Enlightenment ideas by the latter. Ecclesiastical patronage, the right of local lairds or other notables to appoint ministers to a parish, had been abolished at the Glorious Revolution, but it was reintroduced in the Patronage Act of 1711, resulting in frequent protests from the kirk.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party,</b> Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party</b> in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
50|$|The Vanua'aku Pati, {{which had}} been {{governing}} since independence, obtained 24 seats, while the Union of <b>Moderate</b> <b>Parties</b> obtained 12. Walter Lini of the Vanua'aku Pati remained Prime Minister. Voter turnout was 74.9%.|$|R
50|$|The francophone Union of <b>Moderate</b> <b>Parties</b> and the anglophone National United Party {{formed a}} {{coalition}} government, with Serge Vohor (UMP) as Prime Minister and Walter Lini as deputy Prime Minister. Voter turnout was 72.4%.|$|R

5|$|Feijó's {{administration}} {{was unable to}} suppress the uprisings in both the north and south. By 1837, his government's credibility and support had vanished. Feijó resigned in August 1837 and Pedro de Araújo Lima (later the Marquis of Olinda), a Reactionary from Pernambuco Province, became interim regent and {{was elected to the}} office the next year. He appointed his colleagues to ministry portfolios. Honório Hermeto, who had been reelected to another term as general deputy until 1841, remained in the Chamber as the party's leader to bolster the new Reactionary cabinet. The ever-weak <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party</b> collapsed, and Feijo's Moderates allied with other groups with which they shared no common principles or ideology. During the late 1830s and early 1840s, this alliance evolved into the second Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{religion}} {{in the eighteenth century}} includes all forms of religious organisation and belief in Scotland in the eighteenth century. This period saw the beginnings of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had been created in the Reformation and established on a fully Presbyterian basis after the Glorious Revolution. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party.</b> The legal right of lay patrons to present clergymen of their choice to local ecclesiastical livings led to minor schisms from the church. The first in 1733, known as the First Secession and headed by figures including Ebenezer Erskine, {{led to the creation of}} a series of secessionist churches. The second in 1761 led to the foundation of the independent Relief Church.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Moderate</b> <b>Party</b> has a pro-European Union policy stance—including {{support for}} exchanging the SEK for the Euro—and also {{supports}} Sweden joining NATO. As one of Europe's new conservative leaders, Reinfeldt {{is seen as}} an important ally of the United States. His party {{is a member of the}} conservative International Democrat Union, together with the Republican Party in the United States and the British Conservative Party, even though its policies are somewhat more liberal than these. During the 2000 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt visited the United States to support the campaign of George W. Bush. Prior to the 2004 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt again expressed his support for Bush. In an interview with the newspaper Stockholm City on 8 March 2004, Reinfeldt said that he preferred Bush over the Democratic Party contender John Kerry, and in a poll conducted by the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet in April 2004, Reinfeldt like a large majority of his party favoured Bush over Kerry.|$|E
50|$|On 24 April 2011 (Easter Sunday), Parliament ousted Prime Minister Sato Kilman by twenty-six {{votes to}} twenty-five in a motion of no confidence. The Opposition had not {{formally}} proposed {{a candidate to}} replace him, and Parliament elected Serge Vohor (Union of <b>Moderate</b> <b>Parties)</b> as new Prime Minister. It was Vohor's fourth accession to the premiership. He quickly named his new Cabinet (detailed below). Other than Vohor himself, it included only one minister from the Union of <b>Moderate</b> <b>Parties</b> (Charlot Salwai, who was given the Education portfolio), whereas the Vanua'aku Pati received four ministries. Eta Rory, {{the only woman in}} Parliament, was appointed Minister for Agriculture.|$|R
