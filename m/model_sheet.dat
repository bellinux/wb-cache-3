500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, {{because they have to}} go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion <b>model</b> <b>sheet</b> into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The really sad thing is people took that... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere. People didn't get back to me for comments and the sad thing is that's the way the internet works. They don't want the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to writer Spencer Rothbell, {{the show}} was created with a naturalistic tone, similar to {{cartoons}} of the 1990s, combined with a more modern feeling. Given this naturalism, writers can reference works that have inspired for them or fit the genre of an episode. He ultimately {{felt that it was}} about [...] "empowering kids and having fun". Rothbell also avoids [...] "pigeonholing" [...] into one type of story, and that while some plots are mostly character-driven, others are [...] "based on one idea that we think is really funny". Inspiration also came from the shows Page watched as a child, which invoked more poignant and relatable situations. Despite this, elements of fantasy are allowed, and that conveying both incongruous to one another was one technique he particularly enjoyed. Boles noted that the art direction called for inconsistent character design to avoid having to fit <b>model</b> <b>sheet</b> with the universe perfectly—a result of what he dubs the Simpsons effect. Attention is also paid to background characters in order to expand variety in its plot and universe.|$|E
2500|$|Rocko's design {{changed as}} his {{character}} evolved. The {{first version of}} the character was Travis. Murray said [...] "I liked him, but changed him considerably for Rocko." [...] Murray said that the version placed in the Rocko's Modern Life proposal was [...] "much looser, and closer to my independent film style." [...] Murray did not consider how the character would be animated, as Murray {{did not believe that}} the character would be animated. When the pilot for Rocko's Modern Life was approved, Murray began streamlining the character so that others could easily draw him. Murray said that one could perceive a difference between the character as he appears in the original <b>model</b> <b>sheet</b> used in the original animation versus the character as he appears in the animation produced abroad. Murray continued to streamline Rocko so that overseas studios could easily draw him. Murray and the directors had become so accustomed to quickdrawing Rocko that the changes in the character, in his words, [...] "naturally occurred, lending more to the happy personality Rocko had developed into ( [...] less the victim, paranoid one from the beginning)." ...|$|E

50|$|As {{the feature}} was {{compiled}} by Jones (along with Friz Freleng) {{the omission of}} Clampett is not surprising. (The other two directorial fathers Bugs claims to have had are Avery, who directed A Wild Hare, his first official short, and McKimson, who is the least known of the three best-known Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies directors, but drew the definitive Bugs Bunny <b>model</b> <b>sheet.</b> Depending on the source, number one could be either Jones or Freleng.)

5000|$|The rabbits third {{appearance}} {{comes in}} Hare-um Scare-um (1939), directed again by Dalton and Hardaway. This cartoon—the first {{in which he}} is depicted as a gray bunny instead of a white one—is also notable as the rabbits first singing role. Charlie Thorson, lead animator on the film, gave the character a name. He had written [...] "Bugs Bunny" [...] on the <b>model</b> <b>sheet</b> that he drew for Hardaway. In promotional material for the cartoon, including a surviving 1939 presskit, the name on the <b>model</b> <b>sheet</b> was altered to become the rabbits own name: [...] "Bugs" [...] Bunny (quotation marks only used, on and off, until 1944). In his autobiography, Blanc claimed that another proposed name for the character was [...] "Happy Rabbit." [...] In the actual cartoons and publicity, however, the name [...] "Happy" [...] only seems to have been used in reference to Bugs Hardaway. In Hare-um Scare-um, a newspaper headline reads, [...] "Happy Hardaway." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thorson {{had been}} {{approached}} by Tedd Pierce, head of the story department, and asked to design a better rabbit. The decision was influenced by Thorsons experience in designing hares. He had designed Max Hare in Toby Tortoise Returns (Disney, 1936). For Hardaway, Thorson created the <b>model</b> <b>sheet</b> previously mentioned, with six different rabbit poses. Thorsons <b>model</b> <b>sheet</b> is [...] "a comic rendition of the stereotypical fuzzy bunny". He had a pear-shaped body with a protruding rear end. His face was flat and had large expressive eyes. He had an exaggerated long neck, gloved hands with three fingers, oversized feet, and a [...] "smart aleck" [...] grin. The end result was influenced by Walt Disney Animation Studios tendency to draw animals {{in the style of}} cute infants. He had an obvious Disney influence, but looked like an awkward merger of the lean and streamlined Max Hare from The Tortoise and the Hare (1935), and the round, soft bunnies from Little Hiawatha (1937).|$|E

50|$|However, off-model {{can also}} be an {{intentional}} choice {{on the part of}} an animator. John Kricfalusi argued that off-model animation allows originality and can help a scene come to life, as strictly sticking to poses and expressions as dictated in <b>model</b> <b>sheets</b> can be too restricting.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{animatic}} {{has been}} approved, {{it and the}} storyboards are sent to the design departments. Character designers prepare <b>model</b> <b>sheets</b> for all important characters and props in the film; these are used to help standardize appearance, poses, and gestures. These <b>model</b> <b>sheets</b> will show how a character or object looks {{from a variety of}} angles with a variety of poses and expressions so that all artists working on the project can deliver consistent work. Sometimes, small statues known as maquettes may be produced, so that an animator can see what a character looks like in three dimensions. At the same time, the background stylists will do similar work for the settings and locations in the project, and the art directors and color stylists will determine the art style and color schemes to be used.|$|R
