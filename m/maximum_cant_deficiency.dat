40|$|We examine {{three aspects}} of the {{dynamics}} of the Cooper-rider truck travelling in a curve with constant radius. First the critical speed is found. Second we investigate the existence of multiple steady solutions to the curving problem. Third- and it is related to the second problem- we shall examine the position of the truck frame and the wheelsets during curving. One inter-esting result is that for a given superelevation there exist curve radii for which the critical speed is exceeded, when the vehicle negotiates the curve with the allowed <b>maximum</b> <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency.</b> These critical speeds are lower than the critical speed on straight track...|$|E

5000|$|For {{reasons that}} will be {{mentioned}} below, passenger vehicles usually traverse a curve at a speed higher than the balance speed. The amount by which the actual speed exceeds the balance speed is conveniently expressed via the so-called <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> i.e., by the amount by which the superelevation {{would need to be}} increased to raise the balance speed to the speed at which the vehicles actually travel. Letting gaugese denote the rail gauge from low rail gauge side corner to high rail field side corner, letting super_el denote the actual superelevation, and letting Vact denote the actual speed, it follows from the definition that the <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> CD, is given by the formula ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>maximum</b> {{value of}} <b>cant</b> (the {{height of the}} outer rail above the inner rail) for a {{standard}} gauge railway is about 150 mm. For high-speed railways in Europe, <b>maximum</b> <b>cant</b> is 180 mm (when slow freight trains are not allowed).|$|R
5000|$|In 1941-41 the Pacific Railway Equipment Company built three {{experimental}} pendulum-suspension [...] "chair" [...] cars (coach), {{which saw}} {{service on the}} San Diegan, among others. Mounted on high springs, the car tilted inwards on curves to counterbalance the <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> with the induced centrifugal force.|$|R
50|$|One {{solution}} to this problem is to tilt the rails into the turns, an effect known as superelevation. This has the effect of making the lateral forces more inline with the floor, reducing sideways forces. The problem is that this approach only matches the forces perfectly at a single speed; traffic moving slower than the design speed would feel as if it is tipping over into the inside of the turn, while those moving faster than the design speed would still feel leftover centrifugal force. Long experience had shown that the <b>maximum</b> amount of <b>cant</b> applied to lines with mixed traffic was 6.5 degrees, which would be effective at speeds into the 100 mph range, but began to demonstrate <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> at speeds above 125 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "cant deficiency" [...] {{is defined}} {{in the context of}} travel of a rail vehicle at {{constant}} speed on a constant radius curve. Cant itself is a British synonym for the superelevation of the curve, that is, the elevation of the outside rail minus the elevation of the inside rail. <b>Cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> is present when a vehicle's speed on a curve is greater than the speed at which the components of wheel to rail force are normal to the plane of the track. In that case, the resultant force (aggregated force of gravitational force and centrifugal force) exerts the outside rail more than the inside rails, in which it creates lateral acceleration toward outside of the curve. In order to reduce <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> the speed can be reduced or the superelevation can be increased. The amount of <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> is expressed in term of required superelevation to be added in order to bring the resultant force into balance between the two rails. In the contrary, it is said to be [...] "cant excess" [...] if the resultant force exerts more against the inside rail than the outside rail, for instance, a high superelevation curve with a train traveling at a low speed.|$|R

50|$|Track {{unbalanced}} superelevation (<b>cant</b> <b>deficiency)</b> in the United States {{is restricted}} to 75 mm, though 102 mm is permissible by waiver. The maximum value for European railways varies by country, {{some of which have}} curves with over 280 mm of unbalanced superelevation to permit high-speed transportation.

Locomotive No 10, then still named Doctor Syn (the {{exchange}} of names with locomotive No 9 {{did not take}} place until later in the year), broke away from its tender, leaving its train near the Coastguard Cottages at Lade.

40|$|Growing {{competition}} from other modes of transportation has forced railway companies throughout the world to search for increased performance. Travelling time is the most obvious performance indicator {{that may be improved}} by introducing high-speed trains. Trains with capability to tilt the bodies inwards the curve is a less costly alternative than building new lines with large curve radii, which is needed for the non-tilted high-speed trains. Today, tilting has become a mature technology accepted by most operators, but not favoured by many. Research has been conducted on areas with potential to improve the competitiveness of tilting trains. Track shift force may be critical for a high-speed tilting train and improved levels of track irregularities must be considered. The risk of overturning may give restriction on <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> at high speeds. Motion sickness in both non-tilting and tilting trains is still being reported. The sensory conflict is the most common explanation of motion sickness. The running times improve with increased <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> top speed and tractive performance; however the benefit of increased top speed and tractive performance is small above a certain level. Guidelines for installation of cant are given that optimize the counteracting requirements on good comfort in non-tilting trains and low risk of motion sickness in tilting trains...|$|R
50|$|In practice, {{trains are}} not running on {{equilibrium}} cants at curves. The situation is called unbalance, {{which can be}} {{in one of the}} two following ways. For a given speed, if the actual cant is less than the equilibrium cant, the amount of cant difference is called <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency.</b> In the other word, it is the amount of missing cant to achieve the balance. On the contrary, for a given speed, if the actual cant is higher than the equilibrium cant, the amount of over cant from the balance is called cant excess.|$|R
40|$|Centre bearing {{forces and}} wear losses in three piece bogies have been {{simulated}} using VAMPIRE®. Bogie rotational resistance has been modelled at centre bearings and constant contact side bearers accounting for uneven loading during track transitions. The detailed model handles cylindrical centre bearings accounting for rim wall contact {{as well as}} the centre plate planar friction connections and uneven loading. The simulations have been performed for a range of curve radii assuming gauge face lubricated track. Wagons of moderate or high friction resistance to bogie rotation at centre bearings and side bearers have shown altered wheel wear, reducing maintenance cycle times in operations for rollingstock. In this paper, simulation studies have examined the effects of <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> / excess and transition curvature on the wear performance of wagons and individual wheelsets, in particular the high wearing leading wheelsets. Wheel wear is shown to be altered due to changes in bogie rotation friction moments retained through the curve when <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> of the curve is altered. The simulation results also show that transition curvature design can be used to reduce high wheel/rail wear in 3 piece bogies generated by high bogie rotation resistance. In the same way, transition curvature design can be used to alter the wheelset angle of attack during constant curving on 3 piece bogies...|$|R
30|$|The {{lines as}} links {{connecting}} particular stations as the nodes of HSR network are mainly characterized by their three-dimensional layout and geometry of tracks. The most relevant parameters of geometry of tracks are {{the distance between}} their centers, gauge, the maximum axle load, gradient, the minimum horizontal and vertical radius of curvature, the <b>maximum</b> <b>cant</b> and the <b>maximum</b> <b>cant</b> gradient, {{and the length of}} transition curves corresponding to the minimum curve radius. For example, in Europe, except track gauge (1, 435  mm), all other parameters are dependent on the maximum design speed. In addition, the HSR tracks can be broadly ballasted and ballast less [7, 8]. The former are present at the most already built HSR lines, while the latter have been considered particularly for the lines with long segments of tunnels and/or bridges such as those in Japan. 1 In addition, they have been expected to increase the capacity of HSR lines, operating speed, reduce the maintenance costs through reducing the frequency of maintenance operations, and consequently increase the level of safety.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> is {{generally}} looked at {{with respect to}} ideal track geometry. As geometry of real track is never perfect it may be desirable to supplement the static considerations laid out above with simulations of vehicle motion over measured geometries of actual tracks. Simulations are also desirable for understanding vehicle behaviour traversing spirals, turnouts, and other track segments where curvature changes with distance by design. Where simulations or measurements show non-ideal behaviour traversing traditional linear spirals, results can be improved by using advanced spirals. Good track geometry including advanced spirals is likely to foster passenger acceptance of higher CD values.|$|R

The overall dynamic structure of track geometry alignment decides the nature of high speed of railway. The track geometry, track interaction and simulation are three parts of work which deals for increasing the speed of train.

One historical approach to determining safe <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> was the requirement that the projection to the plane of the track of the resultant of the centrifugal and gravitational forces acting on a vehicle fall within the middle third of the track gauge.

A tilting railway vehicle is described via appropriate modelling and a frequency domain analysis illustrates the problems associated with straightforward feedback control. A Kalman-Bucy filter is developed based on 3 inertial measurements (body lateral acceleration, roll and yaw rate) to provide a more effective feedback signal. The filter is re-formulated to estimate not only the states but also the cant, cant rate and curve radius of the track on which the vehicle is travelling. Then a controller is developed based on the estimator `true' <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> output.

[...] This FRA regulation is based on AAR standards based on a single study in the 1950s on a rail line in Connecticut. [...] In Germany, where axle loads are typically lower {{than those in the}} USA, tilting trains are allowed to operate with 12 in CD in some cases. CD above 6 in can be considered too uncomfortable for passengers (e.g. things on tables might slide off), except for tilting trains.|$|R
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between speed and tilt {{can be calculated}} mathematically. We start with the formula for a balancing centripetal force: θ is the angle by which the train is tilted due to the cant, r is the curve radius in meters, v is the speed in meters per second, and g is the standard gravity, approximately equal to 9.80665 m/s²:Rearranging for r gives:Geometrically, tan θ can be expressed (approximately, for small angles) {{in terms of the}} track gauge G, the cant ha and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> hb, all in millimeters:This approximation for tan θ gives:This table shows examples of curve radii.

Already {{in the same year}} a 28 km long section of track between Gütersloh and Neubeckum was made available for high-speed trials for speeds up to 250 km/h. Locomotive 103 118 with special gear ratios achieved a maximum speed of 252.9 km/h in September 1973. Vehicles were also built to test catenary for high-speed operations. The minimum curve radius was 3,300 metres and <b>maximum</b> <b>cant</b> was 120 mm. Experiments were carried out on different types of track (including slab track), catenary and turnouts.|$|R
5000|$|One {{solution}} is to place speed restrictions on curved sections of track; another is to bank the railbed on the curve, with the outer rail higher than the inner rail so the net force passes straight through {{the floor of the}} coach. Banking the track is known as [...] "cant" [...] or superelevation. These measures were gradually adopted on the railways between 1835 and 1860. The use of track cant can only be applied where the speed of the train is fixed in advance. Slower, or stationary, traffic sharing the same line will experience forces pulling inwards, and, conversely, faster traffic will still experience forces pulling outwards. Long experience has shown that, to avoid discomfort on slower trains, track cant should not exceed 6°; and, for trains moving more quickly, <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> should not exceed 4.5°.|$|R
40|$|The Gautrain Rapid Rail Link (GRRL) is a {{rail transit}} system in South Africa that links Johannesburg and Pretoria, {{as well as}} Johannesburg and the O. R. Tambo International Airport. Travelling at speeds of up to 160 km/h, the Gautrain system {{is the first of}} its kind on the African continent. This {{dissertation}} covers an investigation into the relationship between the vertical and lateral forces, speed and superelevation in a GRRL curve. The research described in this dissertation is based on an experiment which involved running a test train through a curve at various speeds, changing the cant of the curve by tamping and repeating the train runs. The cant was changed due to high wheel wear rates. The curve already had a <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> and this <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> was subsequently increased by reducing the curve’s cant. Assessing the before and after tamping test data validated the existence of the expected relationships between the vertical and lateral rail forces, the speed and the cant. The change in cant had a minimal effect on the magnitude of the vertical forces, although a transfer of loading between the high and low legs did occur. The theory indicates that the 14 % reduction in cant in this curve given all of the other curve characteristics should have resulted in an increase in the lateral forces. There was however a roughly 50 % reduction in the maximum lateral forces after the cant was reduced that can be explained from a train dynamics point of view. In addition, there was an increase in safety due to a reduced derailment ratio at this curve’s normal operating speed of 85 km/h. It is not unreasonable to presume that a 50 % reduction in the maximum lateral forces could lead to a halving of the wear rate of the rail and wheels in this curve with similar results to be expected in other curves on the rail network.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} of {{introducing}} falling friction coefficients into curving simulations for studying curve squeal noise is presented. Generation of squeal {{at the wheel of}} a railway vehicle in a curve is caused by unstable vibration, caused in turn by a lateral wheel/rail force which reduces with increasing lateral creepage. To model vehicle curve squeal, the wheel/rail tangential force in the curving simulation is calculated by a modified version of FASTSIM, which uses a sliding velocity-dependent friction characteristic. Using the falling friction characteristics, a UK passenger vehicle is modelled with SIMPACK. Curving behaviour is simulated for a range of curve radii and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> The wheel/rail contact properties are then obtained to study the possibility of the occurrence of squeal using a frequency-domain method.

40|$|Experimental evidence, as {{obtained}} from line tests, shows that, under some circumstances, {{the level of}} hunting motion experienced by a railway vehicle negotiating a curve can be higher than for the same vehicle running {{at the same speed}} on tangent track. Starting from this experimental observation, this paper aims to propose a physical explanation for the different hunting behaviour of a railway vehicle running in a curve. After presenting the available experimental evidence, a qualitative examination of the phenomenon is provided. A multi-body model of the vehicle running in a curve is defined and validated against line measurements. This model is then used to numerically evaluate the hunting behaviour of the vehicle {{in a wide range of}} curve radii relevant for high-speed lines. In this way, the experimental findings are extended to curve radius and <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency</b> values that were not observed in line tests, due to the use of a specific track section and to the range of speeds covered by the tests...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{a railway}} vehicle's speed on {{existing}} track, its dynamic performances are negatively affected. To {{compensate for the}} deteriorated dynamic behaviour, a re-design of the suspension system {{has been carried out}} in the years. For trains which are operated at very high speed in combination with high <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency,</b> a purely passive solution is not always sufficient. Thus, an active solution offering better possibilities of improving the vehicle’s dynamic performances are sought for. Active suspensions in trains have been studied for a number of years. Two general categories can be identified: one improving running stability and wheelset guidance and another improving passenger ride comfort. However, due to relatively high implementation and maintenance costs, only few applications are being used in service operation. One of these active suspensions has recently been tested on V 300 Zefiro train, the new Italian high speed train. In fact, V 300 Zefiro is being homologated up to a speed of 350 km/h with a high <b>cant</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The main target of active lateral suspensions on V 300 Zefiro train is to improve passenger ride comfort. In a conventional bogie, the carbody’s inertia forces in curves are transferred through the suspension and eventually through the bumpstops to the bogie frame. With an active lateral suspension, these inertia forces are transferred to the bogie frame through the lateral actuators in order to avoid bumpstop contact, and finally to the wheelsets resulting in a change in wheel-rail contact forces. This force transfer, together with the passenger comfort, should carefully be addressed in order to evaluate all consequences of the developed control logic with respect to the track. The present paper focuses on the dynamic characterization of the active lateral suspensions (with particular focus on V 300 Zefiro) based on the measurement of displacement and transmitted force in real working conditions, {{as well as on the}} influence of the active lateral suspensions on the centring capabilities of the carbody with respect to the bogie and on the resulting wheel-rail contact force components (being the instrumented active lateral suspensions mounted on bogies having load measurement wheelsets) ...|$|R
