40|$|Mandatory minimum quality {{standards}} for size, grade, or maturity are a controversial provision included in many U. S. {{fruit and vegetable}} marketing order programs. These mandatory rules, which apply to all producers of the regulated fruit or vegetable, prevent the sale of any product that does not meet minimum specified standards. California kiwifruit growers approved a federal marketing order in 1985 with a provision establishing minimum {{quality standards}} in grade, size, and maturity that were first used for kiwifruit during the 1987 - 88 marketing year. This paper examines the effects of <b>minimum</b> <b>maturity</b> standards (MMS) on the average price differentials between kiwifruit from California and from New Zealand. The analysis of terminal market data found evidence of a “lemon ” type problem for eight out of 20 cases for which data sets were available. Results {{are consistent with the}} proposition that <b>minimum</b> <b>maturity</b> standards corrected a lemon problem of asymmetric information on sweetness of California kiwifruit in the Boston, Los Angeles and Philadelphia terminal markets.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{guarantee}} liability valuation, the sophisticated fund-of-funds structure, of some Canadian segregated fund products, often requires us to model multiple market indices simultaneously in order to benchmark the return of the underlying fund. In this thesis, we apply multivariate GARCH models with Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise to project the future investment scenarios of the fund. We further conduct a simulation study to investigate the difference, among the proposed multivariate models, in the valuation of the Guaranteed <b>Minimum</b> <b>Maturity</b> Benefit (GMMB) option. Based on the pre-data analysis, the proposed multivariate GARCH models are data driven. The goodness-of-fit for the models is evaluated through formal statistical tests from univariate and multivariate perspectives. The estimation and associated practical issues are discussed in details. The impact from the innovation distributions is addressed. More importantly, we demonstrate an actuarial approach to manage the guarantee liability for complex segregated fund products...|$|R

40|$|The {{variable}} annuity market in Japan is still young, but growing rapidly. Most variable annuities in Japan are sold {{with one or}} more investment guarantees, such as a Guaranteed <b>Minimum</b> <b>Maturity</b> Benefit (GMMB), which guarantees that the ultimate annuity principal will not fall below a pre-set level regardless of the underlying investment performance. Of interest to financial institutions selling variable annuities is the cost associated with such a guarantee. Although the Black-Scholes option pricing formula can be applied readily, the resulting price might be inaccurate because returns on the Japanese stock price index do not seem to behave as assumed in the formula. In this study, we propose a method for valuing investment guarantees {{on the basis of a}} GARCH-type model, which better captures the characteristics of the stock price index. A difficulty in option-pricing with GARCH is the identification of a risk-neutral probability measure. We solve this problem by considering the conditional Esscher transform. Computational details of the proposed method are illustrated by valuing costs of two popular investment guarantees in Japan. Esscher transform Investment guarantees Variable annuities...|$|R

40|$|Within the horticultural industry, clonal {{propagation}} is desirable {{allowing for the}} maintenance of true lines, with more uniform cropping and flowering characteristics. Clonal propagation through tissue culture can be expensive, requiring equipment and facilities not always available to the breeder, whilst more traditional methods of {{clonal propagation}} may be slow, producing limited numbers. Many Alliums produce bulbils or have the ability to produce bulbils if appropriate conditions prevail. Allium ampeloprasum var. babingtonii always produces both sterile florets and bulbils in the inflorescence as well as daughter bulbs and bulblets. The ability to manipulate the inflorescence towards the production of bulbils may lead to improved methods of clonal propagation. Literature suggests that bulbil production may involve reversion or partial reversion of floral primordia at critical stages in inflorescence development. Wax embedding, sectioning and staining techniques have been used to examine bulb physiology, and allowed the construction of a developmental timetable.

40|$|International audienceLiterature about {{innovation}} {{attests to}} a high variability at the new product development process (NPDP) level. Numerous models are proposed to describe the innovation process, including: ‐ Kline and Rosenberg and the Fuzzy Front‐Ends ‐ The idea life cycle ‐ The open innovation model ‐ The Stage Gate model However, even taking into account these meta‐models, the description at the micro‐level of the sequence of tasks and methodologies during the period between idea emergence and new product launching is scarcely identical, considering companies of the same sector and similar projects. Hence, adjusting the NPDP to the context and objectives of the company represents a key success factor. Consequently, one theoretical challenge consists in finding interrelations between some initial characteristics of an innovative project and recommendations in {{the progress of the}} development phase. This requires the identification of some descriptive criteria characterising an innovative project, focusing on criteria that are documented and evaluable from the start, more precisely the fuzzy front Page 2811 P 108 ends of the project. Then the objective is to define methodology assisting decision‐making in the field of new development process design based on these descriptive variables. The research approach integrates a literature review about evaluation criteria available during the fuzzy front ends, including the degree of newness and the inner impacts of the new project (changes to product, production, sales). Secondly, choosing the stage gate model as a reference, a list of best project management practices is elaborated and a maturity grid is defined for each of these practices.
