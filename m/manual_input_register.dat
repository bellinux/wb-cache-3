The eyes as input can indicate intention to interact with a service, providing implicit pointing as a result. In this paper we investigate the use of gaze and <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> for the positioning of gaze-acquired content on personal devices. We evaluate two main techniques, (1) Gaze Positioning, transfer of content using gaze with <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> to confirm actions, (2) Manual Positioning, content is selected with gaze but final positioning is performed by <b>manual</b> <b>input,</b> involving a switch of modalities from gaze to <b>manual</b> <b>input.</b> A first user study compares these techniques applied to direct and indirect <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> configurations, a tablet with touch input and a laptop with mouse input. A second study evaluated our techniques in an application scenario involving distractor targets. Our overall results showed general acceptance and understanding of all conditions, although there were clear individual user preferences dependent on familiarity and preference toward gaze, touch, or mouse input...|$|R

Objective were to (1) assess the feasibility of a voice-commanded camera control system, and (2) identify factors that differ between voice and manual control of camera functions. Subjects participated in a remote manipulation task that required extensive camera-aided viewing. Each subject was exposed to two conditions, voice and <b>manual</b> <b>input,</b> with a counterbalanced administration order. Voice input {{was found to be}} significantly slower than <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> for this task. However, in terms of remote manipulator performance errors and subject preference, {{there was no difference between}} modalities. Voice control of continuous camera functions is not recommended. It is believed that the use of voice input for discrete functions, such as multiplexing or camera switching, could aid performance. Hybrid mixes of voice and <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> may provide the best use of both modalities.

5000|$|By comparison, the Sun Microsystems SPARC {{architecture}} provides simultaneous visibility {{into four}} sets of eight registers each. Three sets of eight registers each are [...] "windowed". Eight registers (i0 through i7) form the <b>input</b> <b>registers</b> to the current procedure level. Eight registers (L0 through L7) are local to the current procedure level, and eight registers (o0 through o7) are the outputs from the current procedure level {{to the next level}} called. When a procedure is called, the register window shifts by sixteen registers, hiding the old <b>input</b> <b>registers</b> and old local registers and making the old output <b>registers</b> the new <b>input</b> registers.The common <b>registers</b> (old output <b>registers</b> and new <b>input</b> <b>registers)</b> are used for parameter passing.

40|$|The thesis investigates {{integrating}} {{the use of}} speech <b>input</b> and <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> devices in human-computer systems. The domain of computer aided design (CAD) {{is used as a}} case study. A methodology for empirical evaluation of CAD systems is presented. The methodology is based on a framework that describes the input/output processes presumed to underlie performance in design activities, using behaviour protocols and performance indices as data. For modelling system behaviour, a framework derived from the Blackboard architecture of design is described. The framework employs knowledge sources to represent different behaviour types recruited during CAD performance. Variability in user behaviour throughout the investigation is explained with reference to the model. The problems that expert CAD users experience in using <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> devices are first documented in an observational study conducted at their workplace. This demonstrates that the unitary use of <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> resulted in non-optimal behaviour. Possible solutions to these problems, using speech input for some command and data entry tasks, are explored in three experiments. In each experiment, a comparative analysis of alternative systems is made using data obtained from naive and novice users. In Experiment 1, the use of speech as a unitary solution to the problems of <b>manual</b> <b>input</b> was also found to result in non-optimal behaviour and performance. The solution explored in Experiment 2 was to allocate some commands and alphanumeric data to each input device, using the frequency of use principle. This approach, however, entailed the additional problem of remembering which device to use. Experiment 3 evaluated the separate allocation of commands to speech input and numeric plus graphical data to <b>manual</b> <b>input.</b> Additionally, performance aids and feedback facilities were provided to users. This clear-cut assignment of device to task characteristics and the use of such aids led to an enhancement in speech performance, in addition to improving behaviour. The findings from this research are used to develop guidelines for an integrated CAD system involving speech and <b>manual</b> <b>input.</b> The guidelines, which are intended for use by end users, CAD implementors and system designers, were validated in the workplace by the latter. Lastly, the thesis contextualises the research within an ergonomics framework, mapping the research development from problem specification to application and synthesis. Problems with the investigation are also discussed, and suggestions made as to how these might be resolved...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} method of Quantum State Tomography (QST) {{relies on the}} measurement {{of a set of}} noncommuting observables, realized in a series of independent experiments. Ancilla Assisted QST (AAQST) proposed by Nieuwenhuizen and co-workers (Phys. Rev. Lett., 92, 120402 (2004)) greatly reduces the number of independent measurements by exploiting an ancilla register in a known initial state. In suitable conditions AAQST allows mapping out density matrix of an <b>input</b> <b>register</b> in a single experiment. Here we describe methods for explicit construction of AAQST experiments in multi-qubit registers. We also report nuclear magnetic resonance studies on AAQST of (i) a two- qubit <b>input</b> <b>register</b> using a one-qubit ancilla in an isotropic liquid-state system and (ii) a three-qubit <b>input</b> <b>register</b> using a two-qubit ancilla register in a partially oriented system.

We also show that there is a simple decision problem that can be solved in constant time (actually in two steps) using non-deterministic computation, while there is no deterministic linear time algorithm with epsilon n log n bits read and write memory which solves the problem. More precisely if we allow kn time for some fixed constant k, then there is an epsilon > 0 so that the problem cannot be solved with epsilon n log n bits of read and write memory if n is sufficiently large. The decision problem is the following: "Find two different <b>input</b> <b>registers,</b> so that the Hamming distance of their contents is at most c log n"...|$|R
