Due to strict legal {{requirements}} {{to ensure the}} functionality of high-risk medical devices, both manufacturing costs and quality costs contribute significantly to total production costs. Thus, quality costs {{have to be taken}} into consideration during the stage of technology planning. Due to the high variety of potential interactions between individual component properties as well as between component properties and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes,</b> the analysis of the influence of the manufacturing history on an efficient design of inspection processes is extremely complex. Furthermore, the effects of test strategies and quality costs on the planning of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> <b>sequences</b> can not be modeled to date.

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of aero engine components, three key <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> can be identified. These are welding, heat treatment and mechanical cutting. Depending on what is required in terms of mechanical- and geometrical properties in the final product these processes are typically combined in a certain sequence. It is consistently these three processes, and the modelling and simulation of them using the finite element method, that are of concern to the work presented in this thesis. Product development phases such as the detailed design phase and the process planning phase are typically simulation intensive in aerospace industry. Normally, both more extensive component and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> data are available at these stages compared to in the previous concept development phase. It is however becoming increasingly important to enable predictions of manufacturability to be made early in the product development process. Changes made in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> chart after a product offer is released will result {{in an increase in}} cost and a decrease in profit of that component. The aim of the work presented here is thus to develop strategies and computational technologies suitable for simulation of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> in early stages of product development. An example of a computational technology developed in this work is the method of element deactivation used to simulate distortion effects of mechanical cutting. Within the area of simulation of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> most research work and most publications focus on one individual process being simulated. This has been of great importance for the evolution of computational methods and analysis tools used both in industry and academia. However, when the focus of using simulations often is to determine process parameters in order to obtain desired product properties in the final product, it is essential to include the entire <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> <b>sequence</b> in these simulations. In order to enable a <b>sequence</b> of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> to be simulated, engineering information data need to be transferred between simulations of the individual processes. A system for engineering information data exchange in the context of manufacturing simulations is presented in this work. An approach commonly used for concept generation is knowledge based engineering (KBE). In KBE-systems, rules are implemented that embodies the enterprises’ product- and process knowledge. In this thesis, an integrated system where mechanical cutting simulations are performed within a knowledge based engineering software framework is presented. The thesis also deals with friction modelling in the rotary friction welding process and what is appropriate, in terms of computational matters, when attempting to simulate friction welding in a concept development context. The main theme in the thesis is thus to develop strategies, methods and computational technologies suitable for simulation of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> such as rotary friction welding and mechanical cutting in early stages of product development.

40|$|This {{research}} focussed on {{the automatic}} {{generation of the}} optimal method of manufacture, and the cost thereof, {{at an early stage}} in design. It used geometric and tolerance data, combined with a database of centrally stored manufacturing knowledge. This allowed the construction of potential manufacturing routes, and the evaluation of their cost. In order to find the least costly method of manufacture for a given component, with defined geometry and tolerance, it is necessary to take a holistic view of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b> This thesis shows that the typical sequential approach of choosing the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process,</b> followed by <b>sequencing,</b> will not necessarily find the global optimum. Dynamic process seletion is required to consider both the choice of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> and the <b>sequence</b> together to avoid sub-optimisation. Backward and forward propagation from a final <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process,</b> using a random mutation hill climber, was used to construct potential <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> sets. For each process set constructed, the inner optimisation loop was used to find the optimal sequence of manufacturing operations, {{with the aid of a}} repair operator to ensure feasibility. Prior to finding the optimal manufacturing sequence, the forming shape for all potential forming processes was required; this research encompasses a methodology to automatically deduce this shape. This methodology demonstrated convergence to the global optimum on a contrived test case, and has demonstrated accurate results on a real commercial test case. Major areas for improvement could be a combination of the developed methodology with feature recognition, to enable maximum usefulness as a fully automated process planning and cost evaluation tool. In summary this research demonstrates that the lack of a holistic view can cause sub-optimal results, and proposes a methodology which provides a holistic perspective. The methodology has been proved to be accurate, generic and expandable...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{precision}} mechanical components such as bearings, fuel injectors and gears, which are made of hardened steels, and have to be machined to a high degree of precision. Because of the stringent performance and functional requirements for these components, surface quality in terms of surface topography, microhardness, microstructure, and residual stresses must be specified and achieved through the appropriate <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> <b>sequence.</b> The availability of hard cubic boron nitride (CBN) cutting tools has opened up the possibility of achieving these requirements by a finish machining process, while requiring little or no grinding. A study has been made of the nature of surfaces of M 2 high speed steel produced by finish machining with CBN tools. This has involved measurement of forces, surface finish, residual stresses, form errors and metallurgical changes associated with CBN turning of hard steels. The force measurements have enabled a characterization of the mechanics of the finish machining process in terms of the mechanical and thermal loads. It is found that the specific energy for machining M 2 steel is around 7 Joules/mm 3 which is ten times smaller than that found in grinding. Using forces, an estimate has been made of the friction coefficient at the tool-chip interface and the shear plane temperature. The surface finish and form measurements show that roughness values down to 0. 13 μ m Ra, and straightness, roundness, cylindricity, and parallelism values of 1 μm or smaller can be attained through the proper selection of process parameters. Various aspects of machining residual stresses have been investigated such as the effect of process parameters on the stress state, principal stresses, repeatability of the process in the context of residual stress generation and the evolution of residual stresses from heat treatment through to finish machining. A qualitative correlation has been established between work surface temperature and the residual stress state, just as in the grinding of hardened steels. The effect of process parameters on microhardness, microstructure and chip formation has also been investigated. The implications of this study to the finish machining of precision mechanical components are discussed. ...|$|R

Here, the authors describe a novel tool chain called web services property <b>sequence</b> <b>chart</b> monitor to monitor temporal, timing and probabilistic properties in composite service based on scenario-based property specifications called property <b>sequence</b> <b>chart,</b> timed property <b>sequence</b> <b>chart</b> and probabilistic timed property <b>sequence</b> <b>chart,</b> respectively. The tool chain provides a completely graphical front-end that eliminates the {{need to deal with}} any particular textual and logical formalism. Furthermore, the framework and implementation detail of the tool chain are also presented. Finally, the feasibility and usability of the tool have been validated by the case studies and performance measurement. Department of Computin...|$|R
40|$|Products {{with high}} product variety are often {{made in a}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> (or a supply chain) {{consisting}} of multiple stages, with products taking certain features or "personalities" at each stage. The product may start as a common single engine. As the product moves along <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process,</b> more features are added, and the product assumes more identities of the final end product. When demands of the end products are variable from period to period, the production volumes of the intermediate stages in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> are also variable. It is widely recognized that variabilities of production volumes may add cost to the process. This paper is motivated by our observations in industry, where some companies have reengineered the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> by reversing two consecutive stages of the process. Such changes could lead to variance reduction, thereby improving {{the performance of the}} process. We develop formalized models that characterize the impact of such changes: operations reversal. These models are used to derive insights on when such reversal would be advisable. Restructuring, <b>Process</b> Design, Operations <b>Sequencing...</b>|$|R
