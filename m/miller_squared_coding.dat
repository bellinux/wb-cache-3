This {{was done by}} passing the data through a 400 Hz to 500 kHz Bessel bandpass filter and linearly adding noise. The power spectral density of the noise was shaped to match the noise out of an analog magnetic tape recorder running at 30 inches per second (in. /s). This provided a simulation of an optimum wideband 2. 0 MHz tape recorder running at 30 in. /s (no flutter, tape dropouts, etc.). The bit rate, pattern, and code to be tested were then selected. The SNR was varied until the bit error probability was approximately 10 ⁻⁶ With a commercial Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) bit synchronizer with a "good" dc restorer and a pseudo-random pattern at 1. 0 megabits per second (Mb/s) (33. 3 kilobits per inch (kb/in.) equivalent packing density), NRZ-L had a 4 dB SNR advantage over DM and a 14 dB advantage over BIΦ/-L for a BEP of 10 ⁻⁶ through the bandpass channel. At 1. 5 Mb/s, NRZL had a 6 dB advantage over DM and a 10 ⁻⁶ BEP was not achievable with BIΦ/-L coding. For a synchronizer with no dc restoration NRZ-L had only a 1 dB advantage over DM at 1. 0 Mb/s and also only a 1 dB advantage at 1. 5 Mb/s. M² gave the same results as DM for pseudo-random data. However, M² was relatively insensitive to patterns while DM and NRZ-L required a higher SNR with a "good" dc restorer and lost synchronization completely with no dc restorer for worst case 16 -bit repeating patterns...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} scheme by which an Orthogonal Latin <b>Square</b> <b>code</b> (OLS) can be {{modified}} to correct burst-errors of specific length. The method discussed in this paper models it as a graph coloring problem where {{the goal is to}} resolve conflicts in the existing OLS code in order for it to correct burst-errors. Conflicts are resolved by reordering and/or reorganizing existing parity relations by inclusion of extra check bits. The graph coloring approach tries to minimize the number of additional check bits required. The final OLS code after reordering and/or reorganizing would be capable of correcting burst-errors of specific length in addition to its original error correction capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Differential space-time coding (DSTC) {{technique}} {{has become a}} good choice when channel estimations are difficult to obtain in multiple antennas system. On the basis of analyzing the existing DSTC schemes, by introducing multi - level quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) and matrix transform method, we develop a multi - amplitude differential space-time block coding (STBC) scheme for <b>square</b> or non-square <b>code</b> matrix in MIMO systems, and give the derivation of calculation formula e of the coding advantage in detail. The developed scheme can effectively avoid the performance loss of conventional DSTC schemes based on PSK modulation (i. e. single amplitude DSTC) in high spectrum efficiency. It {{can be applied to}} non-square code matrix case, and thus overcomes the shortcoming that existing DSTC schemes are only suit able for <b>square</b> <b>code</b> matrix. Compared with single amplitude DSTC schemes, our scheme has higher spectrum efficiency by carrying information not only on phases but also on amplitudes. Moreover, our scheme has linear decoding complexity, higher coding advantage, and higher code rate for more than two antennas. The simulations results show that the proposed scheme can provide lower BER than the existing single amplitude differential STBC schemes for both <b>square</b> and non-square <b>code</b> matri ces. </p...|$|R

30|$|A recent {{breakthrough}} in wireless communications, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique, vastly expands the capacity {{and range of}} communications. An information-theoretic framework for investigating communication security in wireless MIMO links is proposed in [7]. One of the principal conclusions there is that proper exploitation of space-time diversity at the transmitter can enhance information security and information-hiding capabilities. Particularly, if a source with constant spatial inner products (see Section 3.1) is transmitted over an uninformed link, the cutoff rate of the channel will be equal to zero and the minimum probability of decoding error {{will be forced to}} one.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars employing space-time coding (STC) to achieve diversity. To this end, after briefly outlining {{the model of the}} received echo, a suitable detection structure is derived, and its performance is expressed in closed form {{as a function of the}} clutter statistical properties and of the space-time code matrix. Interestingly, this receiver requires prior knowledge of the clutter covariance, but the detection threshold is functionally independent thereof. At the transmitter design stage, we give two criteria for code construction: the first is based on the classical Chernoff bound, the second is an information-theoretic criterion. Interestingly, the two criteria lead to the same condition for code optimality, which in turn specializes, under the assumption of uncorrelated clutter and <b>square</b> <b>code</b> matrix, in some well-known full-rate space-time codes. A thorough performance assessment is also given, so as to establish the optimum achievable performance for MIMO radar systems...|$|R
