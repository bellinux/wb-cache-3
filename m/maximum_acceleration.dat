This upgrade, when completed in 2012, is expected to provide improved reliability, an 8% decrease in journey times between stations, and a 16% overall decrease in journey times.

30|$|The {{test results}} shown in Fig.  3; Table  1 will {{indicate}} the following characteristic behavior of nailed plywood-timber joints under composite waves: (1) Nailed plywood-timber joints are prone to fail in typical static failure modes in relatively higher probability, when they are shaken under strong input <b>maximum</b> <b>accelerations</b> equivalent to their ultimate limits. (2) When input <b>maximum</b> <b>accelerations</b> are not so strong, they can withstand comparatively longer the typical static failures. If active shakes continue only for short time under the input <b>maximum</b> <b>accelerations</b> within their damage limits, then, nailed plywood-timber joints are able to survive with no fatal failures. If active shakes continue for long time or repeat intermittently, however, they {{are in danger of}} fatal failures even though the input <b>maximum</b> <b>accelerations</b> do not exceed their damage limits. In this case, nailed plywood-timber joints are prone to fail in relatively higher probability of low-cyclic bending fatigue failure of nails than typical static failures.|$|R

Flight restrictions followed immediately, limiting maximum speed to Mach 0.8 due to control reversal, and limiting <b>maximum</b> <b>acceleration</b> to 5.5g (54m/s²) due to wrinkling of the fuselage skin. To compound the problem, parts shortages and maintenance difficulties earned the aircraft the nickname, [...] "Mechanic's Nightmare". On 24 May 1948, the entire F-84B fleet was grounded due to structural failures.|$|E

The tracks in the game include hills, loops, tunnels, corkscrews, and pipes. Players can drift into turns without losing momentum by using the control stick and trigger button. The game introduces 26 new vehicles, and reprises the 4 from the original F-Zero game. Each has its own performance abilities affected by its size and weight, and a grip, boost, and durability trait graded on an A to E (best to worst) scale.

500|$|The CSMIP Cape Mendocino {{station was}} {{installed}} in 1978 and was located just [...] from the epicenter on the slope of a ridge in the coast ranges. The instruments there had been mounted on a concrete platform adjacent to a roadway and remained firmly secured to the rock platform following the shocks. A landslide came within [...] of the device and left debris on the road, but a lack of large rocks close to the instrument and no cracking of the rocks near the platform left geologists with no clear explanation for the extraordinarily high vertical component reading of 1.85g. The tri-axial analog accelerometer that was in use was physically limited to that value and all three traces had uniformly significant values at three seconds into the recording. A post-earthquake lab test of the seismometer and an inspection of the photographically enlarged accelerogram revealed that the limit was hit twice, with a maximum deflection of 31mm, as the needle bounced off the unit's mass. An extrapolation of the vertical record led to a <b>maximum</b> <b>acceleration</b> estimate of 2.2g for that site, and the unit was eventually replaced with a higher capacity digital device.|$|E

Tracks include enclosed tubes, cylinders, tricky jumps, and rollercoaster-esque paths. Some courses are littered with innate obstacles like dirt patches and mines. A heavy {{emphasis is placed on}} track memorization and reflexes, which aids in completing the game. Each machine handles differently, has its own performance abilities affected by its weight, and a grip, boost, and durability trait graded on an A to E (best to worst) scale. Before a race, the player is able to adjust a vehicle's balance between <b>maximum</b> <b>acceleration</b> and maximum top speed. Every machine has an energy meter, which serves two purposes. First, it is a measurement of the machine's health and is decreased, for example, when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track. Second, the player is usually given the ability to boost after the first lap. Boosting greatly increases the racer's speed for a few seconds, but also drains their energy. Pit areas and dash plates are located at various points around the track for vehicles to drive over. The former replenishes energy, while the latter gives a speed boost without using up any energy. The less time spent in the pit area, the less energy will regenerate. Courses may also have jump plates, which launch vehicles into the air enabling them to cut corners.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{two aspects}} {{concerning}} {{the influence of}} the ballast on vibrations of railway bridges. The first one is the additional stiffness due to the ballast.  For that, a special finite beam element with a non-linear longitudinal stiffness associated to the slip at the interface between the ballast and the bridge is implemented and used to calculate vertical accelerations during and after the passage of a train. The second one is the load distribution of the axle loads through the ballast. To investigate this, a parametric study is carried out on a two dimensional model with plane elements. Based on this load distribution, different load shapes are created, which are used in dynamic analyses in Matlab on three different bridge models. The conclusions are that a linear and a bi-linear longitudinal stiffness at the interface give similar <b>maximum</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Moreover, the critical train velocities are increased with the additional stiffness of the ballast. The study also shows thatdistributed loads, in general, lowers the <b>maximum</b> <b>accelerations,</b> especially on short bridges...|$|R
2500|$|Nintendo World Report's Daniel Bloodworth {{thought the}} Grand Prix mode, {{which should be}} the focus of the game, is [...] "woefully lacking". Bloodworth criticized track length of the first 3 cups; he clocked-in at [...] per lap and {{finished}} three cups within 20 minutes on standard difficulty. He concluded [...] "combined with the low difficulty and re-used environments and music, it all ends up feeling rather unsatisfying." [...] While the fourth cup is more difficult, Bloodworth was taken back by its sudden spike in difficulty—even when playing every cup on Expert or Master. Also, many of its courses were rehashes from the first F-Zero game and GP Legend. During Siliconera's playtest, they praised Climaxs track design and varying levels of difficulty between courses—easier courses are relatively straight compared to later ones which require honed drifting skill. They mentioned the game demanded players to have quick reflexes and master the track layout on difficulties beyond novice since the AI-controlled opponents are unforgivable. Siliconera noted players have to be proficient at both types of speed boosting. Bloodworth explained a properly timed double speed boost can substantially alter the momentum of a race. Compared to GP Legends controls, Siliconera thought the spin attack [...] "is a neat trick to use, that adds a new element to the game."

30|$|In this study, {{dynamic tests}} of nailed plywood-timber joints are {{conducted}} under a band-limited white-noise wave using a uniaxial hydraulic shaking table. The principal results are as follows: dynamic responses of nailed plywood-timber joints under a band-limited white-noise wave are reasonably {{related to the}} static load-slip relationships and the dynamic responses under harmonic waves of them. When nailed plywood-timber joints are shaken under a composite wave of wide frequency range, they resonate transitionally {{with one of the}} frequency components one after another decreasing their equivalent resonant frequencies along their static load-slip curves. Nailed plywood-timber joints are in danger of ultimate failures even though the input <b>maximum</b> <b>accelerations</b> do not exceed their damage limits, if they are shaken for long times with or without intermittences. In this case, nailed plywood-timber joints are prone to fail in low-cyclic bending fatigue failure of nails.
