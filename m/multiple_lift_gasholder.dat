40|$|A two {{dimensional}} advanced panel far-field potential flow {{model of the}} undistorted, interacting wakes of <b>multiple</b> <b>lifting</b> surfaces was developed which allows {{the determination of the}} spanwise bound circulation distribution required for minimum induced drag. This model was implemented in a FORTRAN computer program, the use of which is documented in this report. The nonplanar wakes are broken up into variable sized, flat panels, as chosen by the user. The wake vortex sheet strength is assumed to vary linearly over each of these panels, resulting in a quadratic variation of bound circulation. Panels are infinite in the streamwise direction.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 29 - 31) Back pain is {{the most}} common and costly musculoskeletal problem in the workplace around the world. No previous study has compared the effects of asymmetrical lifting (lifting with a twist) on both upper body and lower body skeletal muscles with <b>multiple</b> <b>lifting</b> loads. It was hypothesized that the asymmetrical lifts of 20, 35, and 50 pounds could require a significantly higher muscle activation on the nine measured muscles when compared to symmetrical lifts of the same load. The dependent variables were the mean EMG activation of twelve selected muscles during the concentric upward lifting phase. The independent variables were the lifting method with two levels: symmetrical versus asymmetrical, and the lifting load with three levels of 20, 35, and 50 pounds. The results were analyzed with twelve two by three ANOVAs. The results from the twenty-two participants showed no statistical significant differences among the different conditions on mean EMG muscle activation between symmetrical and asymmetrical lifts. These results suggest that untrained individuals that lift heavy objects during their profession may exert the same muscular effort among <b>multiple</b> <b>lifting</b> loads and twisting while lifting may not alter the activation of certain muscles...|$|R

40|$|Integer {{programs}} (IPs) are mathematical {{models that}} can provide organizations {{with the ability to}} optimally obtain their goals through appropriate utilization and allocation of available resources. Unfortunately, IPs are NP-complete in the strong sense, and many integer programs cannot be solved. Introduced by Gomory, lifting is a technique that takes a valid inequality and strengthens it. Lifting can result in facet defining inequalities, which are the theoretically strongest inequalities; because of this, lifting techniques are commonly used in commercial IP software to reduce the time required to solve an IP. This thesis introduces two new algorithms for exact simultaneous up <b>lifting</b> <b>multiple</b> sets into binary knapsack problems and introduces sequential simultaneous lifting. The Dynamic Programming <b>Multiple</b> <b>Lifting</b> Set Algorithm (DPMLSA) is a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm bounded by O(nb) effort that can exactly uplift an arbitrary number of sets.

50|$|As a {{camshaft}} normally {{has only}} one lobe per valve, the valve duration and lift is fixed. The camshaft rotates at half {{the rate of the}} crankshaft. Although many modern engines use camshaft phasing, adjusting the lift and valve duration in a working engine is more difficult. Some manufacturers use systems with more than one cam lobe, but this is still a compromise as only a few profiles can be in operation at once. This is not the case with the camless engine, where lift and valve timing can be adjusted freely from valve to valve and from cycle to cycle. It also allows <b>multiple</b> <b>lift</b> events per cycle and, indeed, no events per cycleâswitching off the cylinder entirely.|$|R

50|$|A lift hill, or chain hill, is an upward-sloping {{section of}} track on {{a roller coaster}} on which the roller coaster train is {{mechanically}} lifted to an elevated point or peak in the track. Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast {{throughout the rest of}} the roller coaster ride's circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a lift hill, as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a lift hill. Although uncommon, some tracks also contain <b>multiple</b> <b>lift</b> hills.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the aerodynamic characteristics of complex <b>multiple</b> <b>lifting</b> surfaces in inviscid subcritical flows has been developed and programmed on UNIVAC 1100 / 60 computer. 13; Each lifting surface is represented by a network of non-planar horse shoe vortices distributed on the mean surface and trailing to infinity.

40|$|Abstract â Existing {{works on}} {{distributed}} averaging explore linear iterations based on reversible Markov chains. The convergence of such algorithms is bounded to be slow {{due to the}} diffusive behavior of the reversible chains. It has been observed that certain nonreversible chains lifted from reversible ones mix substantially faster than the original chains [1], [2]. We show {{that the idea of}} nonreversible lifting lends itself naturally to a fast distributed averaging algorithm, where each node maintains multiple estimates, corresponding to <b>multiple</b> <b>lifted</b> states in the Markov chain.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} was to evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} Revised National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lifting equation (RNLE) to predict risk of low-back pain (LBP). BackgroundIn 1993, NIOSH published the RNLE as a risk assessment method for LBP associated with manual lifting. To date, there has been little research evaluating the RNLE as a predictor of the risk of LBP using a prospective design.
