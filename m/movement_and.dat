40|$|Eye <b>movements</b> <b>and</b> brain {{oscillations}} to symbolic {{safety signs}} with different comprehensibility Yohana Siswandari 1 and Shuping Xiong 1, 2 * Background: The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate eye <b>movements</b> <b>and</b> brain oscillations to symbolic safety signs with different comprehensibility. Methods: Forty-two young adults participated in this study, and ten traffic symbols consisting of easy-to-comprehend and hard-to-comprehend signs were used as stimuli. During the sign comprehension test, real-time eye <b>movements</b> <b>and</b> spontaneous brain activity [electroencephalogram (EEG) data] were simultaneously recorded. Results: The comprehensibility level of symbolic traffic signs significantly affects eye <b>movements</b> <b>and</b> EEG spectral power. The harder to comprehend the sign is, the slower the blink rate, the larger the pupil diameter, and the longer the time to first fixation. Noticeable differences on EEG spectral power between easy-to-comprehend and hard-to-comprehend signs are observed in the prefrontal and visual cortex of the human brain. Conclusions: Sign comprehensibility has significant effects on real-time nonintrusive eye <b>movements</b> <b>and</b> brain oscillations. These findings demonstrate the potential to integrate physiological measures from eye <b>movements</b> <b>and</b> brain oscillations with existing evaluation methods in assessing the comprehensibility of symbolic safety signs...|$|R

Their fast music, the renunciation of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness, and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans. Motörhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour, and they also shared the stage with Lemmy's friends punk band The Damned. Motörhead's musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.|$|E
