5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E

Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks, though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes. The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up the sewage system, sending hundreds of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> sewage into the streets.

5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as Treasury Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. Since the Civil War, whiskey distillers and corrupt treasury agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the treasury of revenue. Discovering that <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> whiskey escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at the Whiskey Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the Treasury. Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri treasury agent John McDonald as part of the Whiskey Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some Ring members after a few months in prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 months in jail.|$|E

Unofficially, rainfall reached 7inches (178mm) in portions of Maryland, though the highest precipitation amount totaled 3.21inches (82mm) at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Swells from the hurricane produced high storm surges along the Western Shore which peaked at 8.2feet (2.5m) in Baltimore. Annapolis also reported {{a surge of}} 7.2feet (2.2m). In many locations, the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane. Throughout central Maryland, 472buildings and homes were destroyed, with 3,260 greatly damaged and another 3,600 affected in general. Strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43,000tons (39,000 t) of salt, millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, and <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> <b>of</b> raw sewage into the Chesapeake Bay. One person {{died as a result}} of a traffic death in the state. Property damage totaled $530.5million (2003USD, ($ USD), with an additional $190,000 (2003USD, ($ USD) in crop damage. The crop damage was primarily limited to minor damage to livestock buildings and sheds, though the winds destroyed a hay barn and a dairy barn at one farm in Frederick County. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 15–30% of the field corn and 10–15% of the soybean crop. Excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants, and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water.|$|E

The used lubricating oil generates waste disposal problem because improperly disposed of used oil may contaminate the environment. On the other hand, each year {{billions of dollars}} are spent on the road maintenance and rehabilitation. Reclaimed asphalt pavement is among the best option for road maintenance in term of construction sustainability. The technique {{requires the use of}} asphalt rejuvenator to revive the aging bitumen. A study is carried out to assess technical viability of using used lubricating oil as rejuvenator. The study aims (i) to identify the properties of typically available used lubricating oil and the requirement for standard bitumen rejuvenating agent; (ii) to determine appropriate methods to improve the characteristics of used oil in fulfilling the rejuvenator standard and (Hi) to assess the laboratory performance of reclaiming asphalt with used lubricating oil as rejuvenator. Only the first two are discussed in this paper. The bitumen used in this study is penetration grade 80 / 100. The bitumen was artificially aged so that the characteristics of bitumen before and after ageing could be identified and compared. A series of chemical, physical and rheological tests related to standard for rejuvenator were carried out to recognize the characteristics of used oil. The result indicates that, technically, used lubricating oil can be used as rejuvenating agent in reclaiming asphalt pavement. However, for a safe handling during asphalt mixing operation, the flash point of the used oil should be increased...|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{grape vines}} planted in Washington State were at Fort Vancouver in 1825 by traders {{working for the}} Hudson's Bay Company {{but it is not}} known for sure whether wine was ever produced from these plantings. The first people who were definitely known to produce wine were German and Italian immigrants who planted their wine grapes in Washington during the 1860s and 1870s. Washington {{was one of the first}} states to usher in the start of Prohibition, going dry in 1917 and shutting down most of the state's wine production. Some scattered grape growers stayed afloat during this period selling grapes to home winemakers but nearly all the state's commercial wines went out of business. Following the end of Prohibition, Washington's fledgling wine industry was based primarily on fortified sweet wine production made from the Vitis Labrusca variety Concord.

40|$|Efforts {{to abate}} Willamette River {{pollution}} between 1926 and 1962 {{centered on a}} struggle between abatement advocates and the two primary polluters in the watershed, the City of Portland and the pulp and paper industry. Throughout the twentieth century, the Willamette {{was by far the}} most heavily populated and industrialized watershed in Oregon. Like many other of the world 2 ̆ 7 s rivers, the Willamette {{was an integral part of}} municipal and industrial waste removal systems. As such, the main stem of the river carried the combined wastes from sewage outfalls serving hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> people and <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> daily <b>of</b> pulp and paper making effluents. Exacerbating the impacts of these pollutants on the Willamette were unavoidable geologic and hydrologic constraints impacting the river 2 ̆ 7 s flow and, therefore, the river 2 ̆ 7 s ability to dilute wastes. As the pollution load in the Willamette River increased throughout the twentieth century, accustomed activities such as recreation, sports fishing, and commercial fishing, were constrained. The polluted water also threatened potential uses of the river, such as tourism and expanded recreation after World War II. To address these concerns, beginning in 1926 clean streams advocates created ad hoc groups of public health experts, sanitary engineers, conservationists, sportsmen, and others to pressure Portland officials and industry representatives to cease polluting the river. In November 1938, continued activism and lobbying from these groups led to the passage of a citizen 2 ̆ 7 s initiative creating the Oregon State Sanitary Authority (OSSA). From 1939 to 1962, the OSSA took the lead in the water pollution abatement issue and realized some limited successes including pushing Portland and other cities to build sewage treatment plants and regulating pulp and paper mill discharges. However, in spite of these accomplishments, the issue of water quality grew more complex and difficult through the 1950 s, as reflected in Tom McCall 2 ̆ 7 s November 1962 television documentary Pollution in Paradise...|$|R
40|$|Electrodeionization (EDI) is {{a widely}} studied process ranging from {{applications}} in wastewater clean-up in the food and beverage industry to purifying organic compounds.

Water consumption within hydraulic fracturing sites can reach in the upwards <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>gallons</b> per site, so {{a need for a}} water recycling process becomes necessary within areas where water requirements are scarce. Implementation of an EDI module that is capable of handling high salt solutions from produced wastewater in subsequent fracturing practices will decrease overall water demands, making this an environmentally sustainable process as well. This study will focus on the selective removal of high concentrations of ions using ion-selective membranes and ion exchange wafers in Wafer-Enhanced Electrodeionization (WE-EDI) of hydraulic fracturing solutions for improved water recovery and reuse within industrial applications. Experiments were performed using a WE-EDI setup with varied wafer composition and thickness in comparison with electrodialysis for selective removal of divalent ions (Ca 2 +) over monovalent ions (Na+) from simulated and fracking solutions. Research sought to show that when increasing the wafer thickness and changing the composition (weak acid compared to strong acid resins) there would be a greater overall current efficiency observed and subsequently lower power consumption. This research concluded that there is some degree of enhanced selectivity with increased wafer size, as well as varied composition compared to a traditional ED system. Continued research is recommended to conclude uncertainties, eliminate areas of system performance error and to further solidify all hypothesises within this research...|$|R
