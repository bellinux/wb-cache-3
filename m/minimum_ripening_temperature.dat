40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{investigate}} the potential of different methods to accelerate Cheddar cheese ripening, individually and in combination. The following approaches to accelerate Cheddar cheese ripening were evaluated; (a) addition of lactic acid bacteria adjuncts attenuated by microfluidization selected on their enzymatic and metabolic potential, (b) addition of entrapped lactococcal cell free extracts in yeast attenuated by microfluidization (c) inclusion of spray dried enzymemodified cheese to the Cheddar making process (d) use of elevated <b>ripening</b> <b>temperatures</b> and (e) combinations of the above approaches. Initially several strains of lactic acid bacteria were screened for key intracellular enzymes and metabolic activities pre- and post-attenuation in broth, and subsequently in a sodium caseinate model system {{for their ability to}} generate volatiles associated with cheese flavour. Based on these results, strains with the greatest potential were attenuated by microfluidization and used as adjuncts in a mini-Gouda type cheese system. These strains were used with a commercial starter consisting of two Lc. lactis and compared with a commercial adjunct consisting of Lactobacillus helveticus. Results indicated that one Lc. lactis strain (Z 8) exhibited similar sensory characteristics to the commercial adjunct, which validated the experimental procedure used to select strains and the method of attenuation. Subsequently a cell free extract of a different lactococcal strain (AM 2) also identified as having flavour potential was entrapped in attenuated freeze-dried yeast (Yarrowia lipolytica). This entrapment approach was successfully used as a vector to augment enzymatic and metabolic activity in Cheddar cheese production, without any adverse effect on cheese quality. In addition a hydrolysed substrate in the form of spray dried enzyme-modified cheese was also successfully incorporated into Cheddar cheese during manufacture to boost substrate availability for key enzymatic and metabolic activities associated with cheese flavour development. The inclusion of the enzyme-modified cheese enhanced flavour development and has potential in the development of fast-ripened ingredient type cheeses.

In Part 1, low-fat (5 %) Cheddar cheese was produced in duplicate, using 6 combinations of DVS 850, LH 32, CR 540, CRL 431, Emfour, and CR 319 bacterial cultures. Due to a previously observed positive effect by sodium gluconate on low-fat cheese flavor, each replicate was split into treatments of 0. 0 % and 0. 8 % sodium gluconate. Each of these treatments was then split into <b>ripening</b> <b>temperature</b> treatments: 6 °C for 21 ± 1 wk; or 6 °C for 3 wk, 10 °C for 8 wk, and 6 °C for 10 wk. Cheese was tasted first by an informal panel. The 4 treatment combinations for the control cheese and the CR 540 (a Lactococcus lactis ssp. and Lactobacillus ssp. blend) cheese, along with all culture combinations containing sodium gluconate and ripened only at 6 °C, were selected for descriptive analysis.

Low-fat (5 %) Cheddar cheese with the CR 540 adjunct with and without sodium gluconate was evaluated in a consumer taste panel with commercial full-fat (33 % fat) and commercial reduced-fat (25 % fat) Cheddar cheese. The low-fat cheeses were not significantly different from the commercial reduced-fat, indicating comparable cheese. Part 2 involved making Cheddar-like cheese with non-Cheddar adjunct cultures, using the same process as Part 1.

40|$|There {{is a poor}} {{understanding}} of the relationship between organoleptic assessment of cheese and quantitative analysis of flavour compounds. Further, the contribution of particular cheese-making parameters such as <b>ripening</b> <b>temperature</b> and starter culture has not been fully elucidated. During the ripening of most cheese varieties complex chemical conversions occur within the cheese matrix. In most cheese varieties breakdown of protein is the most important flavour development pathway. The primary cheese protein, casein, is degraded enzymatically to short peptides and free amino acids. The agents primarily responsible for these conversions are the residual rennet that is retained in the cheese curd {{at the end of the}} manufacturing phase and the proteinases and peptidases that are associated with the starter bacteria. While the rate and degree of proteolysis are of vital significance for desired flavour development, the direct products of proteolysis do not fully define cheese flavour. Much research is now demonstrating that the further biochemical and chemical conversions of the products of proteolysis, in particular the amino acids, are necessary for full flavour development. The products produced by these pathways are volatile at low boiling points and are thus released during mastication of the cheese in the mouth. Many of these volatile compounds contribute to the flavour sensation experienced by the consumer. A very wide spectrum of such compounds have been isolated from cheese, in excess of two hundred in some cheese varieties. It is now generally accepted that there is no individual compound which defines cheese flavour completely and that the flavour sensation is the result of numerous compounds present in the correct proportions. This has become known as the Component Balance Theory. The application of modern analytical techniques as proposed in this project would provide a greater {{understanding of}} the significant flavour compounds in Cheddar cheese and help to identify the impact of specific cheese-making parameters such as starter flora and <b>ripening</b> <b>temperature</b> on the production of volatile flavour compounds.

These results confirm the preferential transformation of Put to Spd and Spm in CO 2 -treated fruits. At chilling temperature, the increase in ACC oxidase activity was inhibited and the Vmax of ADC increased. A combination of chilling temperature storage and high CO 2 level led to suppression of basal ethylene production while ACC oxidase activity remained unchanged. In addition, fruits held at these conditions had higher polyamine titres than the untreated control.

By heating the samples to 60 °C to eliminate their thermal history and cooling them at 2 °C/min, the liquid → solid phase transition of fat was investigated. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to characterize in situ the supramolecular organization of milk fat dispersed in the casein matrix. The destabilization of fat globules by aggregation or coalescence and the formation of free fat during the manufacture altered the thermal properties of milk fat by increasing the initial temperature of crystallization and by the formation of 2 overlapping exotherms. The melting properties of the crystalline structures formed by fat at the <b>temperatures</b> used for <b>ripening</b> (12, 21, and 4 °C) were examined. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine the ratio of solid to liquid fat; that is, the amount of fat that is crystallized, by dividing the partial enthalpy of melting of the fat for <b>ripening</b> <b>temperature</b> by the total enthalpy of melting of the same fat extracted from chees...|$|R

40|$|Phophorous nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (31 P-NMR) spectroscopy was used to study the vacuolar and cytoplasmic pH and the inorganic phosphate (Pi) pool distribution in 'Fino de Jete' cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.) fruit stored at a chilling temperature (6 °C). Fruit stored at the <b>ripening</b> <b>temperature</b> (20 °C) for 3 days were used as a control. 31 P-NMR results confirmed that 6 °C storage caused cytoplasmic acidosis (a decrease of 0. 72 ± 0. 08 pH units) and a notable increase {{in the amount of}} Pi in the cytoplasm. Spectra of perchloric acid extracts also revealed that storage at 6 °C was associated with an increase in the total amount of Pi and phosphorylated metabolites. Moreover, perfusion experiments with a phosphate medium confirmed the preferential accumulation of Pi in the cytoplasm in chilled tissues. Specific activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) (32. 1 ± 1. 7 μmol·min- 1 ·mg- 1) was observed in those fruit. In chilled fruit the amount of ADP was held at steady-state levels and ATP levels increased, contrary to observations for ripe fruit, where the pool of total nucleotides decreased beyond the point of NMR detection. Fruit stored at 6 °C exhibited a low respiration rate, but metabolism was not arrested and an increase in total soluble solid contents was also observed. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:	 Pears are {{exported}} {{in large}} quantities from South Africa resulting in large revenues. Minimisation of quality losses once the fruit has reached the export destination {{is as important as}} following strict export and distribution protocols. Kafirin can form edible films. An edible coating, made from a 2 % (w/w) kafirin coating solution was applied as a post-havest treatment to retard quality deterioration of ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears during storage at the typical <b>ripening</b> <b>temperature</b> (20 ° C). The changes in physic-chemical and sensory quality were studied over a period of 24 days. RESULTS: The kafirin coating was unable to retard the onset of ripening but decreased the respiration rate and retarded the progression of senescence. However, moisture loss was exacerbated in the kafirin-coated fruit during ripening at 20 ° C especially {{towards the end of the}} shelf-life. CONCLUSION: The coating extended the eat-ripe quality of the pears between one and two weeks. However, appearance of the fruit was unacceptable after 14 days of storage in terms of wrinkled skin. Further work is needed to improve the water barrier properties of the kafirin coating by incorporating a wax or triglyceride into the coating formulation or more simply by applying a kafirin coating to waxed fruit.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the genotypic factors and post-climacteric storage conditionsthat affect bruise susceptibility of banana peel. Putative physicochemical indicators of bruise suscepti-bility, including peel electrolyte leakage (PEL), total polyphenolic content, hardness, water content, andpeel thickness, were investigated. Bruise susceptibility is the lowest impact energy needed to producevisible bruising by an object dropped on post-climacteric banana fruit from a pre-determined height, con-verted into impact energy (20 - 200 mJ with a 20 mJ increment). The bananas were stored either at 18 ?Cthroughout ripening or at 13 ?C between the 2 nd and 6 th day after ethylene induction. Five cultivars withcontrasting susceptibility to impact bruises were used. Neither Grande Naine nor hybrid Flhorban 925 bruised at the maximum impact energy (200 mJ) during ripening whatever the storage conditions. A gra-dient in bruise susceptibility was observed among the other cultivars: French Corne > Fougamou > hybridFlhorban 916. Bruise susceptibility increased during ripening and was higher in bananas stored at 18 ?C. The lower <b>ripening</b> <b>temperature</b> resulted in a two-day delay to fruit maturity as well as in bruise suscep-tibility. Bruise susceptibility was positively correlated with PEL (R = 0. 78) and to a lesser extent negativelycorrelated with hardness (R = ? 0. 45), and was not correlated with polyphenolic content. In conclusion,membrane permeability provides the first clue to understanding bruise susceptibility. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
