40|$|An {{extraction}} {{method for}} the distributed, parasitic RC-elements of MOS single- and <b>multi-fingers</b> is introduced by deducing {{a rule of}} thumb for an effective poly resistance Reff. The lumped RC element described by the effective gate resistance in conjunction with the non-linear gate capacitance of the MOS model Cgate approximates sufficiently accurate the distributed RC elements of the gate in the ESD relevant time domain. In addition to the wiring and parasitic capacitance connected to a gate, this RC can cause a significant gate delay (RCnot, vert, similar 1 ns) during ESD events. It is demonstrated for a CMOS output driver circuit that this effect is relevant for ESD switching behavior under human body model (HBM) stress. Here, circuit simulations are compared to the corresponding transmission line pulse (TLP) measurements. Furthermore, a general charge device model (CDM) -level circuit simulation methodology is presented. To our knowledge for the first time, a single-pin CDM event was simulated in a complex I/O circuit applying appropriate ESD models suitable for CDM simulation. Under such stress, the simulation reveals an unexpected large impact of the ‘gate’ RC-delay formed by metal interconnects in a CMOS double input inverter. Voltage overshoots occur at internal gates and lead to oxide breakdown. The failure signature was validated by CDM stress tests and physical failure analysis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an equivalent circuit model for common-emitter current-gain collapse in <b>multi-finger</b> HBTs. The collapse of current-gain is an undesirable phenomenon, which occurs in <b>multi-finger</b> HBTs {{when they are}} operated at high power density. The collapse manifests itself by a distinct abrupt decrease of collector current in the output characteristics of the HBT. Until now, there hasn’t been an equivalent circuit model to simulate the current collapse behavior of <b>multi-finger</b> HBTs. In this paper, for the first time, the large-signal Ebers-Moll model is modified to include the effect of current-gain collapse. Hence, the model presented here is a big step towards predicting the behavior of <b>multi-finger</b> HBTs under high power and high frequency operating con-ditions. Also, the self-heating effect which {{gives rise to the}} negative output resistance is included in the equivalent circuit without the use of an external thermal feedback circuit. Hence, the equivalent circuit is much simpler to implement and easier to analyze. Moreover, it includes the phenomenon of current-gain collapse.

Healthy subjects performed cyclic force changes between pairs of targets “as quickly and accurately as possible”. Tasks with two force amplitudes and six ratios of force amplitude to target size were performed {{by each of}} the four fingers of the right hand and four finger combinations. There was a close to linear relation between movement time and the log-transformed ratio of target amplitude to target size across all finger combinations. There was a close to linear relation between standard deviation of force amplitude and movement time. There were no differences between the performance of either of the two “radial” fingers (index and middle) and the <b>multi-finger</b> tasks. The “ulnar ” fingers (little and ring) showed higher indices of variability and longer movement times as compared to both “radial ” fingers and <b>multi-finger</b> combinations.

Finger {{forces are}} known to change involun-tarily during <b>multi-finger</b> force-production tasks, even when a finger’s {{involvement}} in a task is not consciously changed (the enslaving effect). Furthermore, during maximal force-production (MVC) tests, the force pro-duced by a given finger in a <b>multi-finger</b> task is smaller than the force generated by this finger in its single-finger MVC test (the force-deficit effect). A set of hypothetical control variables – modes – is introduced. Modes can be estimated based on individual finger forces during single-finger MVC tests.

40|$|Abstract We {{studied the}} effects of fatigue, induced by a 60 -s maximal {{isometric}} force production with the index finger, on <b>multi-finger</b> coordination and force production by the other fingers of the hand. Finger forces were mea-sured during single- and <b>multi-finger</b> maximal voluntary force production (MVC) at two sites, {{the middle of the}} distal or the middle of the proximal phalanges. Two fa-tiguing exercises involving force production by the index finger were used, one at the distal phalanx and the other at the proximal phalanx. The MVC of the index finger dropped by about 33 % when it was produced at the site involved in the fatiguing exercise. In addition, large transfer effects of fatigue were observed across sites of force application and across fingers. Force deficit in-creased under fatigue, especially due to a drop in the re-cruitment of the index finger. Under fatigue, the index finger was less enslaved during force production by other fingers. During <b>multi-finger</b> tasks, the percentage of total force produced by the index finger was signifi-cantly reduced after the fatiguing exercise. The principle of minimization of secondary moments was violated un-der fatigue.

By incorporating multiple unit finger HBT models with a multi-port thermal network, a model is developed that enables thermal effects with DC, small-signal and large-signal simulations to be modeled in a circuit simulator. HBTs have earned a reputation in high frequency circuit design for offering outstanding power efficiency and high linearity in applications such as power amplifiers...|$|E
