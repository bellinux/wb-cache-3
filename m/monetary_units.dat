25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo <b>monetary</b> <b>units,</b> so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It is no wonder that the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E
25|$|Spanish {{pieces of}} eight minted in Mexico or Seville were the {{standard}} trade currency in the American colonies. However, every colony still used the <b>monetary</b> <b>units</b> of pounds, shillings, and pence for bookkeeping while Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese money were all standard mediums of exchange as British law prohibited {{the export of}} British silver coinage. Until the exchange rates were standardised in the late 18th century each colony legislated its own different exchange rates. In England, 1 piece of eight was worth 4s 3d while it was worth 8s in New York, 7s 6d in Pennsylvania and 6s 8d in Virginia. One 18th-century English shilling was worth around $58 in modern currency so a piece of eight could be worth anywhere from $246 to $465. As such, the value of pirate plunder could vary considerably depending on who recorded it and where.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Josef Hartl of Vienna had {{devised a}} {{detailed}} plan for fixing {{the value of}} the Stelo. Around 1977 Dr. Hartl had circulated a pamphlet on the Stelo that appears to have influenced Lawrence Mee. Hartl's article suggested the circulation of a currency with a constant value as an answer to inflationary devaluation. His basic idea was that regardless of its level of development each country could calculate in its national currency an average family's monthly expenditure. One could then arbitrarily assign the value of 1,000 <b>monetary</b> <b>units</b> to this average monthly expenditure. Thus by definition, the loss to a family in any country of, say, 10 units would be absolutely equal to 10 [...] "international monetary units." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Roelofs {{especially}} {{wanted to}} give the Stelo a character totally different from Dr. Hartl's idea of international <b>monetary</b> <b>units.</b> He also advocated using the Stelo as propaganda for money reform. Dr. Roelofs believed that the Stelo should {{serve as the basis for}} international financial transactions, but only between countries that refused to deal with commercial banks. How the system would function was never detailed on paper, writes Lawrence Mee, [...] "presumably because the ideas of money reformers were already well known." [...] Although he admitted that the original basis of the purchasing-power provision was somewhat arbitrary, Mee wanted the Stelo to serve in the role originally envisioned by the Universal League.|$|E

5000|$|A fyrk was a <b>monetary</b> <b>unit</b> used in Sweden in the 15th to 17th century, with a {{value of}} between 1/6 and 1/2 öre.

After the <b>monetary</b> <b>unit</b> had been abolished, the word remained in use in the general sense of [...] "small money", [...] "pennies", [...] "an insignificant sum"; and as a slang word for [...] "money" [...] in Finnish Swedish {{as well as in}} Finnish as a dialectal loan word (fyrkka).|$|R

2500|$|National {{banknotes}} {{are generally}} legal tender, meaning that medium of payment is allowed by law or recognized by a legal {{system to be}} valid for meeting a financial obligation. Historically, banks sought {{to ensure that they}} could always pay customers in coins when they presented banknotes for payment. This practice of [...] "backing" [...] notes with something of substance is the basis for the history of central banks backing their currencies in gold or silver. Today, most national currencies have no backing in precious metals or commodities and have value only by fiat. With the exception of non-circulating high-value or precious metal issues, coins are used for lower valued <b>monetary</b> <b>units,</b> while banknotes are used for higher values.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a typical}} case, the [...] {{variables}} might be: a balance (the real or nominal {{value of a}} debt or a financial asset in terms of <b>monetary</b> <b>units),</b> a periodic rate of interest, the number of periods, {{and a series of}} cash flows. (In the case of a debt, cash flows are payments against principal and interest; {{in the case of a}} financial asset, these are contributions to or withdrawals from the balance.) [...] More generally, the cash flows may not be periodic but may be specified individually. [...] Any of the variables may be the independent variable (the sought-for answer) in a given problem. [...] For example, one may know that: the interest is 0.5% per period (per month, say); the number of periods is 60 (months); the initial balance (of the debt, in this case) is 25,000 units; and the final balance is 0 units. [...] The unknown variable may be the monthly payment that the borrower must pay.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the Spanish milled dollar, the U.S. {{dollar is}} based upon a decimal system of values. In {{addition}} to the dollar the coinage act officially established <b>monetary</b> <b>units</b> of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars {{be known as a}} union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; [...] "dime" [...] is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while [...] "eagle" [...] and [...] "mill" [...] are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, more commonly written as $3.59. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, [...] "paper money" [...] was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the [...] "double eagle", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. [...] Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as [...] "fractional currency", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as [...] "shinplasters". [...] In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a [...] "Union", [...] "Half Union", and [...] "Quarter Union", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.|$|E
