5|$|However, Conway relaxed this stance with Anthrocon's move to Pittsburgh in 2006. While no television, {{magazine}} or tabloid representatives were present, several newspapers {{were invited to}} attend, and did, including the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Pittsburgh City Paper, which printed both a preview and an extensive review. When local television station KDKA-TV showed up, Conway gave a short television interview outside the convention hotel. In November 2006 he gave a radio interview to Dublin's 98FM.

5|$|The ACC Championship Game {{traditionally}} {{matches the}} winner of the Coastal and Atlantic Divisions of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Prior to 2005, no championship game existed. The idea for a championship game originated with the league's 2004expansion, which added former Big East members Miami, Virginia Tech, and (in 2005) Boston College. A request to the National Collegiate Athletic Association by conference officials to hold a championship game following the 2004 season was rejected because the ACC lacked the requisite 12teams, and so the league's first championship game had to wait until after Boston College's addition, which had been delayed at the school's request. With the addition of Boston College, the ACC consisted of 12 teams, allowing it to hold a conference championship game under NCAA rules. Before the start of the 2005 season, both Virginia Tech and Florida State were picked as pre-season favorites to play in the championship game in an annual poll conducted by <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> who cover the ACC.|$|E

The award {{was the first major}} award to be introduced by Major League Baseball in more than 25 years. Each team's radio and television play-by-play broadcasters and color analysts vote for three players in each league. Their first place vote receives five points, the second place vote receives three points, and the third place vote receives one point. Beginning in 2003, fans were given the opportunity to vote via Major League Baseball's website.

5|$|Thunder Run {{operated}} {{until the}} end of the 2009 season on November 1. Amid a corporate bankruptcy, on February 4, 2010, Six Flags announced the park would cease operations immediately due to the rejection of an amended lease by the Kentucky State Fair Board. Many attempts were made to reopen the park under new operators. Eventually, on June 27, 2013, a group of investors led by Ed Hart negotiated an agreement to reopen the park. The group would spend $36 million to reopen the park in May 2014. Thunder Run would be part of the opening day lineup of attractions. Rocky Mountain Construction was hired to refurbish the ride, resulting in the existing wooden track to be replaced. On October 10, 2013, Kentucky Kingdom invited <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> and amusement industry to ride the refurbished Thunder Run. The ride reopened to the public on May 24, 2014. After the 2016 season, Kentucky Kingdom announced that Thunder Run would get new trains from the Philadelphia Toboggan Company for the 2017 season.
