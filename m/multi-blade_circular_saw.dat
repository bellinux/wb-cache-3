The results of the measuring the noise level of three structuraly different <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades are presented in this paper.

30|$|When <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade {{is cutting}} the work piece, {{tangential}} and radial tensile stresses are produced {{because of the}} centrifugal force generated by the higher rotational speed of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade. Meanwhile, thermal stress is produced because {{the temperature in the}} edge of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade is higher than other regions. The thermal stress will lead to a large tangential compressive stress in the edge of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade with the increase of temperature difference between the edge and center of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, which could cause the buckling deformation of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, reduction of cutting precision and machining quality of the surface, increase of kerf loss and shortening of saw life. The tensioning processes such as hammering, rolling and heating are proposed and applied {{in order to avoid the}} above-mentioned phenomenon. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced during tensioning process in order to compensate the tangential compressive stress, which will improve the stability and quality of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade [1, 2]. Therefore, the tangential tensioning stress distribution after tensioning is the key factor that determines the quality of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade.|$|R

50|$|A <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> is a {{power-saw}} using a toothed or {{abrasive disc}} or blade to cut different materials using {{a rotary motion}} spinning around an arbor. A hole saw and ring saw also use a rotary motion but are different from a <b>circular</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>Circular</b> <b>saws</b> may also be loosely used for the blade itself. <b>Circular</b> <b>saws</b> were invented in the late 18th century and were in common use in sawmills in the United States {{by the middle of}} the 19th century.|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades {{are very}} {{widespread}} in wood machining. They {{are used in}} different batches and sizes and in large quantities from hand tools to large machining centers. Because of this huge range of applications the <b>circular</b> <b>saws</b> have gained great importance in the industry. The rising request to improve the cutting quality, reduce the noise emission and increase the life time requires improvement of the dynamic behavior of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade. The roll tensioning of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade has been empirically established {{as a solution to}} improve the static and dynamic properties of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade. However, there are several influencing parameters for this process that have not yet been studied scientifically accurate. A scientific and economical solution for the study of various roll tensioning parameters is a simulation model based on finite elements method (FEM) that analyzes the effects on the dynamic behavior of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade. A simulation model for roll tensioning of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades was developed in this study. With this simulation model, the residual stresses induced by the roll tensioning can be calculated. The induced residual stresses are actually responsible for the changing of dynamic properties of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, such as the shifting of eigenvalues and reduction of side run out. Furthermore, this simulation model allows the investigation of various roll tensioning parameters. This investigation helps {{to gain a better understanding}} of the relationship between roll tensioning and improvement of dynamic behavior of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades. Furthermore, it helps to determine the optimization potential of the roll tensioning process, which is one of the important stages of the production line of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  11, the {{tangential}} tensioning stress distribution of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade after unloading and the measured results in specified radial path of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade {{had the same}} trend and the value was similar in most regions, which proved that the tangential tensioning stress of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade calculated by finite element method in this paper was true and reliable. In the edge area of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, the tangential tensioning stress was increased with the ratio of radius, and the feasibility of multi-spot pressure tensioning process was theoretically proved.|$|R
30|$|However, {{thermal stress}} is {{produced}} when <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade is working, because the temperature {{at the edge}} of the blade is higher than that in other regions of the blade. It will cause high tangential compressive stress on the edge of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, causing a buckling deformation that reduces cutting precision, increases kerf loss, and shortens the saw’s life [1, 2]. Thin <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade is more easily affected by thermal stress. For saving materials, the stability of saw blade is very important, especially for thin <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade.|$|R

30|$|Tensioning is {{the most}} {{important}} and advanced technological process for production of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade for avoiding the above-mentioned phenomenon. Among all the tensioning processes, roll tensioning process is most widely applied in the cutting tool industry.

However, <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade can also obtain radial compressive tensioning stress during roll tensioning process which is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape.
