40|$|Induction, neurogenesis, and {{synaptogenesis}} of the {{olfactory bulb}} {{are thought to}} require interactions with the olfactory epithelium. The Dlx family of homeobox genes is expressed in both the olfactory bulb and olfactory epithelium. In particular, Dlx 5 is expressed in the olfactory placode, olfactory epithelium, and <b>local</b> <b>circuit</b> neurons of the olfactory bulb. Here we analyzed mice lacking DLX 5 function. The Dlx 5 �/ � mutation reduces {{the size of the}} olfactory epithelium. Although some olfactory neurons are formed, they fail to generate olfactory axons that innervate the olfactory bulb. Despite the lack of innervation, the olfactory bulb forms, and neurogenesis of projection and <b>local</b> <b>circuit</b> neurons proceeds. However, the mutation has a cell-autonomous effect on the ability of neural progenitors to produce olfactory bulb <b>local</b> <b>circuit</b> neurons, with granule cells more severely affected than periglomerular cells. In addition, the mutation has a noncell-autonomous effect on the morphogenesis of mitral cells.

40|$|Correspondence: Multiple <b>local</b> {{neuronal}} <b>circuits</b> support different, discrete {{frequencies of}} network rhythm in neocortex. Relationships between different frequencies correspond to mechanisms designed to minimise interference, couple activity via stable phase interactions, {{and control the}} amplitude of one frequency relative to the phase of another. These mechanisms are proposed to form a framework for spectral information processing. Individual <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> can also transform their frequency through changes in intrinsic neuronal properties and interactions with other oscillating microcircuits. Here we discuss a frequency transformation in which activity in two co-active <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> may combine sequentially to generate a third frequency whose period is the concatenation sum of the original two. With such an interaction, the intrinsic periodicity in each component <b>local</b> <b>circuit</b> is preserved – alternate, single periods of each original rhythm form one period of a new frequency – suggesting a robust mechanism for combining information processed on multiple concurrent spatiotemporal scales...|$|R
40|$|The thesis work {{intends to}} provide {{architecture}} for <b>mobile</b> <b>local</b> information search service using Wireless LAN and cellular integration. Search {{technology has been}} popular and driving business bodies with increasing e-commerce opportunities. The search technology has been recently brought to portable devices such as mobile phones and PDA devices by extending the research scope. Mobile search revenues are expected to surpass Internet search revenues in near future. <b>Mobile</b> <b>local</b> search {{on the other hand}} is getting much popular with growing number of mobile subscribers. Mobile phones have been chosen to provide <b>mobile</b> <b>local</b> search services because of its high possessivity and portable nature. In this thesis work, {{the author would like to}} propose a generalized architecture for <b>mobile</b> <b>local</b> information search in a new perspective by involving cellular service provider directly with a minimum co-operation from consumers and retailers. When providing <b>mobile</b> <b>local</b> search services, cellular operator has to maintain a replica of databases of all the existing retailers. Updating the replica at cellular operator at regular intervals has been leading to synchronization problems that produce out-dated results to mobile users. The aspects that have driven the author towards proposing the architecture are solving database synchronization problems and thriving for effective search results. The existing architecture of web search, mobile search and <b>mobile</b> <b>local</b> search are analyzed to identify the domain specific challenges and research gaps. Proposed architecture is designed and evaluated by using an approach called Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). The architecture is evaluated against its quality attributes and the results are presented.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that, {{depending}} on its severity and context, stress can affect neural plasticity. Most related studies focused on synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) of principle cells. However, {{evidence suggests that}} following high-frequency stimulation, which induces LTP in principal cells, modifications also {{take place at the}} level of complex interactions with interneurons within the dentate gyrus, that is, at the <b>local</b> <b>circuit</b> level. So far, the possible effects of stress on <b>local</b> <b>circuit</b> activity and plasticity were not studied. Therefore, we set out to examine the possible alterations in <b>local</b> <b>circuit</b> activity and plasticity following exposure to stress. <b>Local</b> <b>circuit</b> activity and plasticity were measured by using frequency dependant inhibition (FDI) and commissural modulation protocols following exposure to a 15 minute-forced swim trial. Exposure to stress did not alter FDI. The application of theta-burst stimulation (TBS) reduced FDI in both control and stressed rats, but this type of plasticity was greater in stressed rats. Commissural-induced inhibition was significantly higher in stressed rats both before and after applying theta-burst stimulation. These findings indicate that the exposure to acute stress affects aspects of <b>local</b> <b>circuit</b> activity and plasticity in the dentate gyrus. It is possible that these alterations underlie some of the behavioral consequences of the stress experience. Copyright © 2008 Orli Yarom et al.

40|$|Hierarchical {{processing}} of sensory information requires interaction at multiple levels along the peripheral to central pathway. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} interaction between driving and modulating components can shape both top down and bottom up {{processing of}} sensory information. Here we show that a component inherited from extrinsic sources combines with local components to code sound intensity. By applying high concentrations of divalent cations to neurons in {{the nucleus of the}} inferior colliculus in the auditory midbrain, we show that as sound intensity increases, the source of synaptic efficacy changes from inherited inputs to <b>local</b> <b>circuits.</b> In neurons with a wide dynamic range response to intensity, inherited inputs increase firing rates at low sound intensities but saturate at mid-to-high intensities. <b>Local</b> <b>circuits</b> activate at high sound intensities and widen dynamic range by continuously increasing their output gain with intensity. Inherited inputs are necessary and sufficient to evoke tuned responses, however <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> change peak output. Push-pull driving inhibition and excitation create net excitatory drive to intensity-variant neurons and tune neurons to intensity. Our results reveal that dynamic range and tuning re-emerge in the auditory midbrain through <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> that are themselves variable or tuned...|$|R

40|$|The {{concepts}} of coexistence of transmitters and of receptor-receptor interactions have increased {{our understanding of}} the integrative processes regulating synaptic homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. Depending upon the ionotropic or metabotropic characteristics of the cotransmitter, it may be mainly involved in synaptic homeostasis or synaptic plasticity, respectively. A chemical trace of the postsynaptic activity can be obtained because of the plasticity of the receptor molecules. Thus, the heuristic hypothesis is introduced that islands of receptors located on postsynaptic membranes of <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> can be formed by means of receptor-receptor interactions favouring ordered electrotonic sequences in the <b>local</b> <b>circuits.</b> This hypothesis has been named the receptor mosaic hypothesis of the engram. The islands or clusters of receptors can then store specific and complex information and when activated by the transmitters they may induce unique changes in ion permeability and cell metabolism which, at the <b>local</b> <b>circuit</b> level, can mimic exactly a previous electrotonic sequence. They can therefore represent {{at least part of the}} engram. This hypothesis is introduced against the background of the possible existence of different types of encodings of memory...|$|R

As availability of internet access on mobile devices develops year after year, users {{have been able}} to make use of mobile internet and search services while on the go. Location information on these devices has enabled mobile users to utilize local search applications for discovering places and activities around them. Although <b>mobile</b> <b>local</b> search is a kind of search activity, it is inherently di erent than general web search. <b>Mobile</b> <b>local</b> search focuses on local businesses and points of interest, instead of web pages as in general web search. Moreover, users' context has a signi cant e ect on their decision process. In previous studies, ranking signals and user context have been investigated on a small set of features. We extend ranking signals and user context in <b>mobile</b> <b>local</b> search with using data of location-based social networks. We developed a <b>mobile</b> <b>local</b> search application, Gezinio, and collected a data set of local search queries. Gezinio helps users to issue local queries and see various kinds of social information about local businesses around them.
