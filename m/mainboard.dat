25|$|It {{was thought}} that Windows 7's support of EFI would result in PC {{motherboards}} replacing BIOS with EFI. MSI announced the Efinity <b>mainboard</b> in early 2008. As of 2011, EFI-based computers have entered the market, however none can natively boot Mac OS X {{due to the lack}} of a HFS+ driver in the EFI implementation.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Sega {{introduced}} a smaller, lighter {{version of the}} console, known as the Mega Drive 2 in Japan, [...] Europe and Australia and simply sold as Genesis (without the Sega prefix) in North America. [...] This version omits the headphone jack in the front, replaces the A/V-Out connector with a smaller version that supports stereo sound, and provides a simpler, less expensive <b>mainboard</b> that requires less power.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1995, reports {{surfaced}} that Sega would collaborate with Lockheed Martin, The 3DO Company, Matsushita, or Alliance Semiconductor {{to create a}} new graphics processing unit, which conflicting accounts said would be used for a 64-bit [...] "Saturn 2" [...] or an add-on peripheral. Development of the Dreamcast was wholly unrelated to this rumored project. In light of the Saturn's poor market performance, Irimajiri decided to start looking outside of the company's internal hardware development division {{to create a new}} console. In 1997, Irimajiri enlisted the services of [...] IBM's Tatsuo Yamamoto to lead an 11-man team to work on a secret hardware project in the United States, which was referred to as [...] "Blackbelt". Accounts vary on how an internal team led by Hideki Sato also began development on Dreamcast hardware; one account specifies that Sega of Japan tasked both teams, while another suggests that Sato was bothered by Irimajiri's choice to begin development externally and chose to have his hardware team begin development. Sato and his group chose the Hitachi SH-4 processor architecture and the VideoLogic PowerVR2 graphics processor, manufactured by NEC, in the production of their <b>mainboard.</b> Initially known as [...] "Whitebelt", this project was later codenamed [...] "Dural", after the metallic female fighter from Sega's Virtua Fighter series.|$|E

2500|$|The Thunderbird was AMD's most {{successful}} product since the Am386DX-40 ten years earlier. <b>Mainboard</b> designs had improved considerably by this time, {{and the initial}} trickle of Athlon <b>mainboard</b> makers had swollen to include every major manufacturer. AMD's new fab in Dresden came online, allowing further production increases, and the process technology was improved by a switch to copper interconnects. In October 2000, the Athlon [...] "C" [...] was introduced, raising the <b>mainboard</b> front-side bus speed from 100MHz to 133MHz (266 MT/s) and providing roughly 10% extra performance per clock over the [...] "B" [...] model Thunderbird.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, if a <b>mainboard</b> has a dual- or quad-channel memory subsystem, all of {{the memory}} {{channels}} must be upgraded simultaneously. 16-bit modules provide one channel of memory, while 32-bit modules provide two channels. Therefore, a dual channel <b>mainboard</b> accepting 16-bit modules must have RIMMs added or removed in pairs. A dual channel <b>mainboard</b> accepting 32-bit modules can have single RIMMs added or removed as well. Note {{that some of the}} later 32 bit modules had 232 pins as compared to the older 184 pin 16 bit modules.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{top-level}} AM3 processors (x945 125W, x955 and x965) {{require a}} special power-supply feature, often called [...] "dual power-plane". It's supported by default in all native AM3 <b>mainboards,</b> however not in most AM2+ <b>mainboards,</b> even those advertised as [...] "AM3 optimized" [...] or [...] "AM3 ready". Processor running below its nominal speed (i.e. at 800 MHz), clock and multiplier locked are symptoms of this incompatibility. This {{is caused by}} the processor itself: when it detects that the motherboard does not supply dual power planes, the chip locks its multiplier to 4x. This issue is not resolvable via a BIOS update; however, users of AM2 and AM2+ motherboards can still use Phenom II processors excluding the 125 watt variants.|$|R
