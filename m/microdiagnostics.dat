40|$|A new {{chlamydia}} transport medium (ChlamydiaPort; Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskeville, R. I.) {{was evaluated}} for its suitability as a transport medium for {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV). Two laboratory HSV strains (McIntyre and 333) and two clinical isolates (AO 218 and AO 301) were suspended in ChlamydiaPort, ViraPort (Scott Laboratories), and cell culture medium and maintained at 2 and 22 degrees C. Samples were tested at various time intervals to determine surviving virus. The range of half-lives of the HSV strains held at 2 degrees C in ChlamydiaPort medium was from 3. 5 to 10 days, while virus stability was greater in ViraPort and less in cell culture medium. These HSV strains held at 22 degrees C in ChlamydiaPort had half-lives from 1. 5 to 6 days, which were significantly greater than the half-lives of the viruses held in either tissue culture medium or ViraPort. Clinical specimens were tested for virus by using the Selecticult-HSV (Scott Laboratories) system to determine {{the performance of the}} transport medium under field conditions. Clinical specimens maintained up to 5 days at ambient temperatures in ChlamydiaPort medium appeared suitable for diagnostic testing without detectable loss of positive specimens. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the average time required for diagnosis when compared with a standard transport system, Virocult (<b>Microdiagnostics,</b> Cleveland, Ohio). These results show that HSV infections can be successfully diagnosed in distant virology laboratories by shipping specimens in ChlamydiaPort transport medium at ambient temperatures...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a processor built {{to meet the}} requirements for a highly reliable and ruggedised digital computer. Innovative techniques were used to achieve high performance without using very high reliability components or redundancy at the circuit level. The processor therefore was designed using moderately reliable components (mil B standard) with microprogrammed control logic and powerful built-in <b>microdiagnostic</b> capabilities. It was successfully used for two major applications: a digital switching system and a data acquisition and processing system for a weather radar...|$|R
40|$|UV−excimer laser photoablation was used, in {{combination}} with surface blocking techniques, to pattern proteins on the surfaces of polyimide and poly(ethylene terephthalate). This technique involves physical adsorption of avidin through laser-defined openings in low-temperature laminates or adsorbed protein blocking layers. Visualization of biomolecular patterns were monitored using avidin and fluorescein-labeled biotin as a model receptor−ligand couple. Adsorbed proteins could be shown to bind to UV-laser-treated polymer surfaces up to three times higher than on commercially available polymers. UV-laser photoablation was also used for the generation of three-dimensional structure, {{which leads to the}} possibility of biomolecule patterning within polymer-based microanalytical systems. The simplicity and easy handling of the described technique facilitate its application in <b>microdiagnostic</b> devices...|$|R

40|$|The article {{present results}} of the study for a {{anatomic}} structure of Campanula rotundifolia grass from Campanulaceae family. Despite its dispersion and application in folk medicine, there are no data about its anatomic structure, therefore to estimate the indices of authenticity and quality of raw materials it is necessary to develop microdiagnostical features in the first place, which could help introducing of this plant in a medical practice. The purpose of this work is to study anatomical structure of Campanula rotundifolia grass to determine its diagnostic features. Methods. The study for anatomic structure was carried out in accordance with the requirements of State Pharmacopoeia, edition XIII. Micromed laboratory microscope with digital adjutage was used to create microphotoes, Photoshop CC was used for their processing. Result. We have established that stalk epidermis is prosenchymal, slightly winding with straight of splayed end cells. After study for the epidermis cells we established that upper epidermis cells had straight walls and are slightly winding. The cells of lower epidermis have more winding walls with prolong wrinkled cuticule. Presence of simple one-cell, thin wall, rough papillose hair on leaf and stalk epidermis. Cells of epidermis in fauces of corolla are prosenchymal, with winding walls, straight or winding walls in a cup. Papillary excrescences can be found along the cup edges. Stomatal apparatus is anomocytic. Conclusion. As the result of the study we have carried out the research for Campanula rotundifolia grass anatomic structure, and determined <b>microdiagnostic</b> features for determination of raw materials authenticity, which included presence of simple, one-cell, thin-walled, rough papillose hair on both epidermises of a leaf, along the veins, leaf edge, and stalk epidermis, as well as the presence of epidermis cells with papillary excrescences along the edges of leaves and cups. Intercellular canals are situated along the veins of flower corolla petals...|$|R
