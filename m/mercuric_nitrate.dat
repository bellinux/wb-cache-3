40|$|A "lactase solution" was {{prepared}} from Escherichia coli. The mechanism of its {{action has been}} studied {{and changes in the}} rate of hydrolysis under various conditions investigated. The hydrolysis of lactose by the enzyme approximates the course of reaction of the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation. One molecule of enzyme combines with one molecule of substrate. E. coli lactase is readily inactivated at pH 5. 0, and its optimal activity at 36 °C. is reached between pH 7. 0 and pH 7. 5. The optimal temperature for its action was found to be 46 °C. when determinations were carried out after an incubation period of 30 minutes. Its inactivation by heat follows the course of a first order reaction, and the critical thermal increment between the temperatures of 45 °C. and 53 °C. was calculated to be 56, 400 calories per mol.

5000|$|The {{experience}} of hatmakers in New Jersey {{is well documented}} and has been reviewed by Richard Wedeen. In 1860, {{at a time when}} the hatmaking industry in towns such as Newark, Orange and Bloomfield was growing rapidly, a physician from Orange called J. Addison Freeman published an article titled [...] "Mercurial Disease Among Hatters" [...] in the Transactions of the Medical Society of New Jersey. This groundbreaking paper provided a clinical account of the effects of chronic mercury poisoning among the workforce, coupled with an occupational description of the use of <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate</b> during carroting and inhalation of mercury vapour later in the process (during finishing, forming and sizing). Freeman concluded that [...] "A proper regard for the health of this class of citizens demands that mercury should not be used so extensively in the manufacture of hats, and that if its use is essential, that the hat finishers' room should be large, with a high ceiling, and well ventilated."

5000|$|Use of {{inorganic}} {{mercury in}} the form of <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate</b> to treat the fur of small animals for the manufacture of felt hats seems to have begun in 17th-century France and from there spread to England {{by the end of the}} century with the Huguenots. By the Victorian era the hatters' condition had become proverbial, as reflected in popular expressions like [...] "mad as a hatter" [...] and [...] "hatters' shakes". Similar phenomena had been described in St Petersburg, Russia, in 1829. In France, the National Academy of Medicine described the health hazards in 1869, and in 1898 a law was passed to protect hatmakers from the risks of mercury exposure. In Britain, mercury poisoning among hatters had become a rarity by the turn of the 20th century. In the United States, where the occupational illness was thoroughly described in New Jersey in 1860, the practice continued until 1941; mercury poisoning in the hatmaking industries of Danbury, Connecticut gave rise to the expression [...] "Danbury shakes".

40|$|Integration of {{physicochemical}} {{procedures for}} studying mercury(II) speciation with microbiological procedures {{for studying the}} effects of mercury on bacterial growth allows evaluation of ionic factors (e. g., pH and ligand species and concentration) which affect biotoxicity. A Pseudomonas fluorescens strain capable of methylating inorganic Hg(II) was isolated from sediment samples collected at Buffalo Pound Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada. The effect of pH and ligand species on the toxic response (i. e., 50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50]) of the P. fluorescens isolated to mercury were determined and related to the aqueous speciation of Hg(II). It was determined that the toxicities of different mercury salts were influenced {{by the nature of}} the co-ion. At a given pH level, mercuric acetate and <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate</b> yielded essentially the same IC 50 s; mercuric chloride, on the other hand, always produced lower IC 50 s. For each Hg salt, toxicity was greatest at pH 6. 0 and decreased significantly (P = 0. 05) at pH 7. 0. Increasing the pH to 8. 0 had no effect on the toxicity of mercuric acetate or <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate</b> but significantly (P = 0. 05) reduced the toxicity of mercuric chloride. The aqueous speciation of Hg(II) in the synthetic growth medium M-IIY (a minimal salts medium amended to contain 0. 1 % yeast extract and 0. 1 % glycerol) was calculated by using the computer program GEOCHEM-PC with a modified data base. Results of the speciation calculations indicated that complexes of Hg(II) with histidine [Hg(H-HIS) HIS+ and Hg(H-HIS) 2 (2 +) ], chloride (HgCl+, HgCl 2 (0), HgClOH 0, and HgCl 3 -), phosphate (HgHPO 4 (0), ammonia (HgNH 3 (2 +), glycine [Hg(GLY) +], alanine [Hg(ALA) +], and hydroxyl ion (HgOH+) were the Hg species primarily responsible for toxicity in the M-IIY medium. The toxicity of <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate</b> at pH 8. 0 was unaffected by the addition of citrate, enhanced by the addition of chloride, and reduced by the addition of cysteine. In the chloride-amended system, HgCl+, HgCl 2 (0), and HgClOH 0 were the species primarily responsible for observed increases in toxicity. In the cysteine-amended system, formation of Hg(CYS) 2 (2 -) was responsible for detoxification effects that were observed.

The Oak Ridge Reservation, established in 1942, was the designated site for the construction of the atomic bomb. During a 20 -year period from 1944 - 1963 radioactive and toxic chemical pollutants, especially mercury compounds were released into the surrounding waterways. A germination study was conducted to investigate the ability of three tree species, American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis),shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) seeds to germinate in <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate</b> (Hg(NO 3 ) 2 and methylmercury chloride (CH 3 HgCl) solutions. A subsequent greenhouse study was conducted to assess the phytotoxic effects of different mercuric solutions on Platanus occidentalis (American Sycamore), inoculated with soils from East Fork Poplar Creek. We also measured vegetation stress by Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. The wavelengths examined were those thatare specific to chlorophyll and several carotenoids, which are involved in photosynthesis: 430 nm (Chl a), 448 nm (Chl b, carotenoids), 471 nm (carotenoids), 642 nm (Chl b), 662 & 680 nm (Chl a). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify patterns in sycamore leaf spectral data.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{products of}} the interaction of fuming nitric acid with acetylene or ethylene are carbon dioxide and trinitromathane. As well, in the interaction with ethylene, and intermediate {{to the formation of}} trinitromethane, is formed the addition compound, nitroethyl alcohol. The course of reaction is fundamentally the same for both compounds, and takes place under varying conditions of temperature, concentration of acid and {{the presence or absence of}} metallic salts, though a marked effect - the simplification of the reaction and the reduction of by-products- is obtained by the addition of <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate.</b> Measurement of the quantities of carbon dioxide and of trinitromethane formed show that at a maximum only fifty per cent of the carbon of the hydrocarbon molecule is nitrated while fifty per cent is oxidised, and this is accompanied to a varying extent by a second reaction involving direct oxidation to carbon dioxide. The tetranitromethane which can be isolated by further nitration always represents considerably more than that which can be estimated as nitroform in the reaction mixture. Hence there are present in the product substances other than trinitronethane, but possibly intermediate to its formation, which are capable on further nitration of yielding tetranitromethane. Evidence is adduced that the reaction is in all cases one of simple addition to the unsaturated bond of the component parts of the nitric acid molecule, analogous to the addition to unsaturated compounds of the component parts of oxides of nitrogen. Hence, the nitric acid, through the medium of addition, is able to exercise its function both as a nitrating and as an oxidising agent, one carbon of the hydrocarbon molecule becoming nitrated, the other becoming oxidised, finally to carbon dioxide. The influence of <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate</b> is largely to increase the rate of absorption and hence of interaction. The mechanism of its effect is complex, but is largely to prevent the alternate reaction of simple oxidation, and hence to increase proportionally the addition reaction producing the nitro alcohol. A similar activating influence of the mercury salt is noticed in the nitration of aromatic compounds, and from this a theory of the mechanism of aromatic nitration is developed. <p...|$|E

40|$|The key {{findings}} from this study can be summarized as follows: (1) palladium appears to be capable of catalyzing the degradation in the absence of mercury; (2) when mercury was added to the palladium system in the form of <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate</b> or phenylmercuric nitrate basic, the rate of TPB degradation was roughly the same as the rate without mercury present; (3) when mercury was added to the system in the form of diphenylmercury, the rate of TPB degradation was greatly accelerated; (4) no TPB degradation was observed for a system which contained phenylmercuric nitrate basic alone with no palladium present; (5) the distribution of lower phenylborates (1 PB, 2 PB, and 3 PB) varied {{as a function of the}} catalyst system; (6) no lower phenylborates were observed during the first 17 hours of reaction indicating that an ''induction period'' may be necessary; and (7) the appearance of precipitates in the reaction mixture varied with the catalyst system, possibly indicating that the active catalyst that is formed may vary with the chemical form of mercury added...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{collection}} of 802 isolates of Gram-negative bacteria causing urinary tract infections {{was made from}} general practice, antenatal clinics, and local hospitals. The organisms were tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, cetrimide, glutaraldehyde, phenyl <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate,</b> a phenolic formulation, and a proprietary antiseptic containing a mixture of picloxydine, octyl phenoxy polyethoxyethanol, and benzalkonium chloride. Escherichia coli, the major species isolated, proved to be uniformly sensitive to these agents. Approximately 10 °,! {{of the total number}} of isolates, however, exhibited a degree of resistance to the cationic agents. These resistant organisms were members of the genera Proteus, Providencia, and Pseudomonas; they were also generally resistant to five, six, or seven antibiotics. It is proposed therefore that an antiseptic policy which involves the intensive use of cationic antiseptics might lead to the selection of a flora of notoriously drug-resistant species. During the course of studies on the development of urinary tract infection in patients undergoing intermittent bladder catheterisation in the early stages of paraplegia, observations were made on th...|$|E
40|$|Giant {{muscle fibers}} 1 to 2 mm in {{diameter}} and 4 to 5 cm in length {{are found in the}} barnacle Balanus nubilus. The preparation offers an excellent opportunity for studying membrane mechanisms of excitation by controlling the internal ionic composition of the fiber. The internal ionic composition was altered by intracellular injection through a glass pipette longitudinally inserted into the fiber. A test solution of a given ionic composition was injected over the whole length of the fiber until the diameter increased by a factor of 1. 5 to 2. 0. This should make the internal ionic composition of the treated fiber close to that of the injected solution. The final concentration of K or Na inside each treated fiber was determined by flame photometry after each experiment. The internal C 1 concentration was also determined by the <b>mercuric</b> <b>nitrate</b> method. To obtain a given concentration of the internal Ca++ or Mg++ concentration the injection was made with a solution containing EDTA or EGTA and Ca or Mg salts in varying proportions. The resting potential of the fiber decreased approximately linearly with th...|$|E
