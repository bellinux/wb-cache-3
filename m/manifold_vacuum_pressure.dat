50|$|Vacuum {{is often}} used to drive {{auxiliary}} systems on the vehicle. Vacuum-assist brake servos, for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> to increase <b>pressure</b> on the brakes. Since braking is nearly always accompanied by the closing of the throttle and associated high <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> this system is simple and almost foolproof. Vacuum tanks were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, it is {{necessary}} to decide whether each line is to be monitored individually and how this is to be done. If there is a single vacuum sensor, whether an electronic transducer connected to the control computer or only a sensitive gauge checked visually, determining which vacuum bag is leaking means shutting each one off in turn and watching for a slight change in <b>vacuum</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure.</b> Given the airflow restrictions in the average lay-up and vacuum lines, even a complete vacuum bag failure may show up {{as little more than a}} small change in vacuum level.|$|R
50|$|Early wipers {{were often}} {{driven by a}} vacuum motor powered by <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum.</b> This had the {{drawback}} that <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> varies depending on throttle position, and is almost non-existent under wide-open throttle, when the wipers would slow down or even stop. This problem was overcome somewhat by using a combined fuel/vacuum booster pump.|$|R
5000|$|At {{wide open}} throttle, <b>{{manifold}}</b> <b>vacuum</b> decreases. The higher manifold pressure in turn allows more air {{to enter the}} combustion cylinders, and thus additional fuel is required to balance the combustion reaction. The additional air and fuel reacting together produce more power. Ideally, to preserve driveability and fuel economy, <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> should not fall any lower than [...]|$|R
5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the crankcase breather, flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|R

50|$|<b>Manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is {{an effect}} of a piston's {{movement}} on the induction stroke and the choked flow through a throttle in the intake manifold of an engine. It {{is a measure of}} the amount of restriction of airflow through the engine, and hence of the unused power capacity in the engine. In some engines, the <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> is also used as an auxiliary power source to drive engine accessories and for the crankcase ventilation system.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards in the USA by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, it was common to use <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> to drive windscreen wipers with a pneumatic motor. This system was cheap & simple but resulted in the comical yet unsafe effect of wipers which operate at full speed while the engine idles, operate around half speed while cruising, and stop altogether when the driver depresses the pedal fully. Vehicle HVAC systems also used <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> to drive actuators controlling airflow and temperature.|$|R
50|$|This low (or negative) {{pressure}} {{can be put}} to uses. A pressure gauge measuring the manifold {{pressure can}} be fitted to give the driver {{an indication of how}} hard the engine is working and {{it can be used to}} achieve maximum momentary fuel efficiency by adjusting driving habits: minimizing <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> increases momentary efficiency. A weak <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> under closed-throttle conditions shows that the butterfly valve or internal components of the engine (valves or piston rings) are worn, preventing good pumping action by the engine and reducing overall efficiency.|$|R

40|$|Two methods, {{namely the}} {{air-tight}} sheet method and the vacuum-drain method (sheetless), are generally used to conduct vacuum consolidation in the field. The {{advantages and disadvantages}} of both methods and the techniques for preventing vacuum leakage through a middle sand layer in a deposit, as well as the method for maintaining <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> when large settlement occurs, have been described. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> is an isotropic consolidation pressure applied to a soil deposit, and the deformation induced is different from that induced by a surcharge (e. g. the weight of an embankment). Two typical case histories in Japan are presented and deformation analyses were conducted. In one case history the vacuum-drain method was used with <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> alone, and in the other a combination of embankment loading and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> was applied employing the air-tight sheet method. It is shown that under <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> loading, the ground deformation (settlement and lateral displacement) can be calculated reliably using a method proposed previously. For the case involving a combination of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> and embankment load, the settlements under the embankment centreline can be estimated reasonably assuming one-dimensional deformation conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the analytical formulation of a modified consolidation theory incorporating <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure,</b> and numerical modeling of soft clay stabilized by prefabricated vertical drains, with a linearly distributed ~trapezoidal! <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> for both axisymmetric and plane strain conditions. The {{effects of the}} magnitude and distribution of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> on soft clay consolidation are examined through average time-dependent excess pore pressure and consolidation settlement analyses. The plane strain analysis was executed by transforming the actual vertical drains into a system of equivalent parallel drain walls by adjusting the coefficient of permeability of the soil and the applied <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure.</b> The converted parameters are incorporated in the finite element code ABAQUS, employing the modified Cam-clay theory. Numerical analysis is conducted to study {{the performance of a}} full-scale test embankment constructed on soft Bangkok clay. The performance of this selected embankment is predicted on the basis of four different <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> distributions. The predictions are compared with the available field data. The assumption of distributing the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> as a constant over the soil surface and varying it linearly along the drains seems justified in relation to the field data...|$|R
40|$|The receiver's {{emittance}} and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> {{are the two}} {{of great}} significance issues on the heat-loss which is the main factor reducing {{the efficiency of the}} parabolic though systems. In this paper, the thermal steady-state equilibrium method was used to test the receivers’ heat-loss. The receivers with increasing emittance were tested to study the variation of heat-loss. Meanwhile, the variable <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> in the annulus that affects the efficiency of the system was investigated. The influence of vacuumizing rate and getters on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> and heat-loss were discussed. The result shows that the emittance and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> affect the receiver's heat-loss dramatically, and the emittance is the major influence factor on the thermal properties. The receiver with 0. 08 emittance and 10 − 3  Pa <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> has a satisfactory heat-loss of 215. 6  W/m at 400  °C. The analysis further reveals that the synergistic effect of both emittance and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> on the heat-loss can be reflected by the packaging temperature of the glass tube, and a fitting formula has been established to estimate the receivers’ heat-loss according to the packaging temperature of the glass tube...|$|R

50|$|Where {{a supply}} of vacuum is available, but not {{pneumatic}} power, rotary actuators have even been made to work from vacuum power. The only common instance of these was for early automatic windscreen wipers on cars up until around 1960. These used the <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> of a petrol engine to work a quarter-turn oscillating vane actuator. Such windscreen wipers worked adequately when the engine was running under light load, but they were notorious that when working hard at top speed or climbing a hill, the <b>manifold</b> <b>vacuum</b> was reduced and the wipers slowed to a crawl.|$|R

Saskatoon berries were dried from an initial moisture content of 75. 5 % to around 25 % (w. b.) using microwave-vacuum drying. In this study, saskatoon berries were dried at different microwave power levels P 10 (745 W), P 7 (514 W) and P 5 (374 W) and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> levels V 20 (67. 0 kPa) and V 10 (33. 5 kPa). The <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> levels did not greatly influence the drying time of the saskatoon berries compared to the microwave power levels. Increasing the microwave power level produced faster drying times for the samples. After 12 min of drying at power level P 10, the moisture contents of the samples at <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressures</b> of 33. 5 and 67. 0 kPa were 29. 74 and 31. 24 %, respectively.
