I conclude that the Doha Declarations may be considered either (1) the political statements or moral commitments of trade ministers or (2) as part of the constitutive process of decision-making by the WTO organization. Under the first view, the WTO Declarations are analogous to G- 7 Declarations or the Malmö Declaration of environmental ministers. Under the second view, the Ministerial Conference can exercise its constitutional authority to set WTO policy, or perhaps to enact secondary law...|$|R

2500|$|Because the ILOs {{enforcement}} and sanction mechanisms are weak, {{there has been}} significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach {{have called for a}} [...] "social clause" [...] to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Declaration</b> 1996 that [...] "the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question." [...] On this view, countries {{ought to be able to}} take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.|$|E

40|$|Scenarios {{and models}} {{of the future of}} HE range from {{institutional}} models and ideals to sectorial scenarios and visions of a global, virtual conglomeration controlled by private sector publishing houses rather than HE as a public good. This paper questions the 12 principles that underpin the Bologna process <b>ministerial</b> <b>declarations</b> in terms of their long term sustainability within the HE sector. Firstly are the issues around the Academe itself: academic freedom, institutional autonomy, academic values and comparability/compatibility. Second are the issues that question the purpose of HE: education as a public good, as a public responsibility, democratic principles, equity and diversity. Finally are the issues surrounding key players with a voice influencing the debate: the participation of stakeholders, issues of accountability, and sustainable development {{for the good of the}} planet. By exploring the issues that will influence these three areas in the next 25 years, this paper questions the sustainability of the Bologna process itself, and whether, despite its good intentions at the outset, it could lead to a longer term future that nobody within the public or HE sector would desire. The paper concludes by identifying the areas that need reconsideration in the next phase of the Bologna Process, as the various stakeholders outline possible, probable and preferred models for the future...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of the Bologna Process was to facilitate the construction of a Europe of Knowledge through educational governance, yet it fails to reach its purpose because of several unexplained assumptions that undermine the conceptual standing of the whole project; it is {{the purpose of this paper}} to bring these assumptions to light. A knowledge economy cannot exist without the knowledge workers which were previously formed in educational institutions, therefore the project for a Europe of Knowledge is usually linked with the educational policies especially those affecting the higher education institutions. One such policy area is the Bologna Process which explicitly traces its purpose to the construction of an educational system that will facilitate the smooth delivery of employable graduates to the European labor market. This presentation has two purposes. First to show through a textual analysis of the Bologna <b>ministerial</b> <b>declarations</b> how the subject of higher education is constructed to single out the European citizen, understood in a narrow sense as the employable, mobile and skilled graduate. Second, to show that the notion of citizenship used in the Bologna declarations is ill-construed. Starting from T. H. Marshall’s classical distinction between the three understandings of citizenship (civic, political, and social), this paper will show that the Bologna discourse on citizenship borrows and mixes illegitimately from the three notions, without making it explicit why such a hybrid notion of citizenship is used in the first place. status: publishe...|$|R
