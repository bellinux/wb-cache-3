2500|$|Motor Trend {{magazine}} {{gave the}} Bel Air top <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> <b>handling.</b> Popular Mechanics reported acceleration for a V8 Bel Air with Powerglide as being 0-60mph in 12.9 seconds, plus a comfortable ride, and good visibility. On the other hand, the horn ring blocked {{some of the}} speedometer, regular gasoline made the engine knock, and the first V8 engines off the line burned too much oil. Front legroom was 43.1". Brakes were 11" [...] drums. A new option for V8-equipped 1955 models was air conditioning, with outlets {{on each side of}} the dashboard; a heavy-duty generator was included on cars equipped with this option; in 1955 and 1956, air conditioning could be installed on cars ordered with the standard three-speed manual transmission, overdrive or Powerglide, but from 1957 onward, an automatic transmission (or minus that, 4-speed manual transmission) was a pre-requisite option.|$|R

Pyaar Hai and was among 22 girls that were screen-tested from 500 girls who came to audition for the film. Patel had gone through a 12-hour audition before she got the part. The film {{went on to become}} the top-grossing film of the year, as well as the biggest hit of the 21st century, earning Rs 973 million in India. Set during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, it featured Patel as Sakeena, a Muslim girl who finds refuge in Deol's house during the riots, and subsequently falls for him. Her performance was praised, and won her the Filmfare Special Performance Award, as well as nominations for Best Actress at various award ceremonies. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM concluded: [...] "Despite being one-film-old, Amisha Patel deserves full <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> <b>handling</b> the complex role with elegance. She looks the character she is portraying and impresses with a natural performance." [...] The film was perceived as being excessively anti-Pakistani.|$|R
40|$|Ball screws are a <b>marking</b> point <b>for</b> <b>handling</b> {{systems in}} which efficiency, {{precision}} and reliability are key elements. In this context, {{it is of}} great interest the use of seals characterized by high performance, capable of exerting a low friction torque, while retaining a high quantity of lubricant and protecting the system from the entrance of contaminants. As part of the thesis project, innovative seals were developed, whose performances have been measured by means of appropriate tests and then compared with the results provided by traditional systems. In {{the second part of}} the thesis work, focus has been given to applications for ultra high speed axes. In this particular case, the analysis mainly focused on the reduction of operating temperatures. Two different types of nuts with liquid cooling have been considered, one of which has been carefully designed and produced. Performances have been compared and measured by means of finite element simulations and experimental analysis...|$|R
50|$|The Sri Lanka Ports Authority {{was created}} in 1980. The harbour {{underwent}} a major transformation to handle containerised cargo in early 1980s, with two being built {{by the end of}} the 1980s and three more in the early 1990s. Due to this, and its strategic location amidst trade routes, the port became more attractive to main line shipping than any other port in the region. After the introduction of private sector operators, it consolidated its position as a major regional hub port for transshipment cargo in late 1990s. The main channel of the port was deepened to 15 meters, while it also reached the one million <b>mark</b> <b>for</b> annual <b>handling</b> of container TEUs in 1996. In 1997 the Oil Berth was opened and container traffic made it to the 1.5 million TEUs mark. 1998 saw the opening of a new container terminal while 1999 saw a new container yard begin operation. The Oluvil Lighthouse was commissioned, and the Oluvil Maritime Training Center opened also in 1999. The South Asia Gateway Terminal began operations, and a new 50 thousand DWT berth was constructed.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} Taiwanese {{female and male}} police officers' perceptions of handling domestic violence. Specifically, it assessed officers' attitudes toward whether female officers, male officers, {{or a combination of}} female and male officers are more suited <b>for</b> <b>handling</b> cases of battered women, offenders, and domestic violence overall. Survey data were collected from 96 female and 156 male officers from two police departments in Taiwan. Frequency distributions showed that a combination of male and female officers were most preferred by officers <b>for</b> <b>handling</b> abused women, offenders, and domestic violence overall. Regression analysis found that female officers were significantly more likely than male officers to favor a combination of male and female officers over female officers alone <b>for</b> <b>handling</b> battered women. Female officers were found to be more likely than male officers to favor male over female officers and a combination of male and female officers <b>for</b> <b>handling</b> offenders. Police supervisors' attitudes toward domestic violence also influenced officers' attitudes toward who is more suited <b>for</b> <b>handling</b> offenders.
