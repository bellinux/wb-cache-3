50|$|<b>Monolinuron</b> is a pesticide, more {{specifically}} a selective systemic herbicide and an algaecide. As an herbicide, {{it is used}} to control broad-leaved weeds and annual grasses in vegetable crops such as leeks, potatoes, and dwarf French beans. <b>Monolinuron</b> affects the photosynthesis in weeds. Following uptake of <b>monolinuron</b> through roots and leaves of weeds, <b>monolinuron</b> causes early symptoms of yellowing and die-back of the leaves, eventually resulting in weed death. In fishkeeping {{it is used to}} control blanketweed and hair algae.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Chloroaniline is an {{important}} building block used in the chemical industry {{for the production of}} pesticides, drugs, and dyestuffs. It is a precursor to the widely used antimicrobial and bacteriocide chlorhexidine and is used in the manufacture of pesticides, including pyraclostrobin, anilofos, <b>monolinuron</b> and chlorphthalim. Some benzodiazepine drugs use 4-chloroaniline in their manufacture.|$|E
40|$|Two {{trials were}} carried out during 1972. and 1974. in which more {{different}} herbicides were applied for the weed control in potatoes. Metribuzin, cyanazine, metoxuron, linuron, metobromuton, cyanazine + linuron and terbutryne + GS- 13259 have been tested in Velika Gorica during 1972 - Metrilbuzin, prometryne chlorbromuron, metoxuron, atrazin + prometryne, alachlor + linuron, linuron + <b>monolinuron</b> and prometryn + simazin were included in trial during 1974. The applications were made 7 (V. Gorica) and 19 (K. Kraljevac) days after planting. Much better weed control has been obtained when herbicides were applied 19 than 7 days after planting. Metribuzin, metobromuron and a mixture cyannazin + linuron gave the best weed control in 1972. Metribuzin again and the mixtures linuron + <b>monolinuron</b> and atrazin + prometryne gave very good results in 1974...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} of the phenylamide herbicides <b>monolinuron,</b> linuron, and solan by cultures of Bacillus sphaericus ATCC 12123 was inhibited by the methylcarbamate insecticides metmercapturon, aldicarb, propoxur, and carbaryl and by the organophosphorus insecticides fenthion and parathion. The extent of inhibition was largest with metmercapturon and smallest with parathion. Inhibition of hydrolysis of the two phenylurea herbicides was greater than of the acylanilide compound. Tests with crude enzyme preparations of aryl acylamidase derived from B. sphaericus showed that the inhibition of the hydrolysis of linuron with methylcarbamates is a competitive one. The insecticides tested did not induce the enzyme, nor could they serve as its substrate...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} rapid {{detection}} of photosynthesis inhibitors in low concentration (0. 25 - 1. 25 ppm) was developed. The experiments {{were performed on}} disks cut from young bean leaves. The disks were infiltrated with solutions of the tested compounds and placed {{at the bottom of}} a crystallizer containing an acidic sodium carbonate solution and then illuminated. The toxicity of the tested substance was measured as the number of disks corning to the surface. It was found that linuron, <b>monolinuron,</b> metoksuron, atrazine and prometrine inhibited floating of the disks, whereas 2, 4, 5 -T, MCPA and chlorpropham gave no effect. This confirms the specificity of the test which is appropriate for determining the phytotoxicity of typical photosynthesis inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|A multiresidue {{approach}} using microwave-assisted extraction {{and liquid}} chromatography with photodiode array detection was investigated for {{the determination of}} butylate, carbaryl, carbofuran, chlorpropham, ethiofencarb, linuron,metobromuron, and <b>monolinuron</b> in soils. The critical parameters of the developed methodology were studied. Method validation was performed by analyzing freshly and aged spiked soil samples. The recoveries and relative standard deviations reached using the optimized conditions were between 77. 0 ± 0. 46 % and 120 ± 2. 9 % except for ethiofencarb (46. 4 ± 4. 4 % to 105 ± 1. 6 %) and butylate (22. 1 ± 7. 6 % to 49. 2 ± 11 %).

The author {{undertook}} {{the preparation}} of cyclodextrin inclusion complexes of four phenylurea herbicides (metobromuron, <b>monolinuron,</b> monuron and fenuron) using the kneading and co-precipitation methods in the solid state while also determining complex formation of the same phenylureas in solution with selected cyclodextrins. The kneading experiments were carried out first {{to determine whether the}} phenylureas would complex in the solid-state. The phenylureas were then subjected to complexation by means of co-precipitation under different conditions of crystallisation such as temperature and solvent medium in order to isolate more than one CD complex containing the same host and guest. The solution-state experiments were performed to see if the phenylurea complexes exist in solution and if so, to determine their nature...|$|E
40|$|The {{residual}} {{effect of a}} few herbicides viz: Atrataf (atrazine), 2, 4 -D and Aresin (<b>monolinuron)</b> sprayed in the previous season on the pigment concentration and primary productivity of the crops (viz: Zea mays and Cajanus cajan) grown in rotation, {{as well as their}} associated weeds has been studied. The results indicate that the residues of all the three herbicides were non toxic to Zea mays and toxic to Cajanus cajan as an increase in chlorophyll content and primary productivity occurred in the former, whereas the contrary is true for the latter. Weeds from residual plots have shown a considerable decrease in the chlorophyll content and primary productivity. The most susceptible weed to all the three herbicides was Acalypha malabarica, while Echinochloa colonum is susceptible to the residues of Atrazine but is tolerant to the residues of the other two herbicides. Recommendations based on the observations are presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Phenylurea {{herbicides}} are {{an important}} group of herbicides utilized in weed control. They have been on sale since the 1950 s and are still in common use throughout the world from pre- and post-emergence control of many annual and perennial broad-leaved weeds. The aim of this work was to evaluate {{the utility of the}} QuEChERS method for the determination of phenylurea pesticides (chlortoluron, isoproturon, linuron, metobromuron, metoxuron, <b>monolinuron)</b> in beetroot by HPLC with UV/Vis detection. Different types of sorbents (PSA, C 18, SAX and NH 2) and solvents (hexane, ethyl acetate) were applied. The obtained results showed that the best recovery ratios were received for the method with PSA and GCB sorbents and using acetonitrile as an extraction solvent with RSD lower than 15 % for most compounds. The linearity of calibration curves was higher than 0. 98 for all target analytes. The results show that the QuEChERS method can be successfully applied for the determination of phenylurea herbicides in beetroot...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} multiresidue {{method for}} the simultaneous determination of seven pesticides in fresh vegetable samples, namely, courgette (Cucurbita pepo), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), lettuce (Lactuca sativa, Romaine and Iceberg varieties) and peppers (Capsicum sp.) is described. The procedure, based on microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and analysis by liquid chromatography– photodiode array (LC–PDA) detection {{was applied to}} four carbamates (carbofuran, carbaryl, chlorpropham and EPTC) and three urea pesticides (<b>monolinuron,</b> metobromuron and linuron). Extraction solvent {{and the addition of}} anhydrous sodium sulphate to fresh vegetable homogenate before MAE were the parameters optimised for each commodity. Recovery studies were performed using spiked samples in the range 250 – 403 µgkg- 1 in each pesticide. The pesticide residues were extracted using 20 mL acetonitrile at 60 ºC, for 10 min. Acceptable recoveries and RSDs were attained (overall average recovery of 77. 2 % and RSDs are lower than 11 %). Detection limits ranged between 5. 8 µgkg- 1 for carbaryl to 12. 3 µgkg- 1 for carbofuran. The analytical protocol was applied for quality control of 41 fresh vegetable samples bought in Oporto Metropolitan Area (North Portugal). None of the samples contained any detectable amounts of the studied compounds...|$|E
40|$|A {{bacterial}} consortium, {{isolated from}} a French agricultural soil, {{was shown to}} rapidly mineralize the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon (3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea). Study of the mineralization kinetics by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) had shown the transitory accumulation and degradation of the three known isoproturon metabolites 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1 -methylurea, 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) -urea, and 4 -isopropylaniline, thus indicating a metabolic pathway initiated by two successive N-demethylations, followed by cleavage of the urea side chain. This bacterial consortium did not degrade other phenylurea herbicides like diuron, linuron, <b>monolinuron</b> and chlorotoluron suggesting the existence of pathway specific for IPU. Six bacterial strains were isolated from the consortium by successive inoculations on mineral salt medium {{but none of them}} was able to degrade isoproturon in isolated form. Based on partial sequencing of the 16 S rDNA sequence, the isolated bacterial strains were found to be belonging to genera Ancylobacter, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Methylobacterium, variovorax and Agrobacterium. A BAC genomic library was established and is currently under functional screeing searching for BAC clone harbouring IPU-degrading capability. positive BAC clone will then be fully sequenced for identifying gene coding for the enzyme responsible for IPU transformation which up to now remains unknown...|$|E
40|$|Several sacoglossan sea slugs (Plakobranchoidea) {{feed upon}} {{plastids}} of large unicellular algae. Four species [...] called long-term retention (LtR) species [...] {{are known to}} sequester ingested plastids within specialized cells of the digestive gland. There, the stolen plastids (kleptoplasts) remain photosynthetically active for several months, during which time LtR species can survive without additional food uptake. Kleptoplast longevity has long been puzzling, because the slugs do not sequester algal nuclei that could support photosystem maintenance. It is widely assumed that the slugs survive starvation by means of kleptoplast photosynthesis, yet direct evidence to support that view is lacking. We show that two LtR plakobranchids, Elysia timida and Plakobranchus ocellatus, incorporate (14) CO 2 into acid-stable products 60 - and 64 -fold more rapidly in the light than in the dark, respectively. Despite this light-dependent CO 2 fixation ability, light is, surprisingly, not essential for the slugs to survive starvation. LtR animals survived several months of starvation (i) in complete darkness and (ii) in {{the light in the}} presence of the photosynthesis inhibitor <b>monolinuron,</b> all while not losing weight faster than the control animals. Contrary to current views, sacoglossan kleptoplasts seem to be slowly digested food reserves, not a source of solar power...|$|E
40|$|The Water Framework Directive 60 / 2000 /EG (WFD) {{requires}} Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for polluting substances. Member States {{have to set}} {{objectives for}} individual surface water bodies (Article 4 WFD). The transitional period for Directive 2006 / 11 /EC ended in 2013. Therefore, revision, adoption {{and implementation of the}} EQS for the substances on the "Indicative list of main pollutants" (see Annex VIII WFD) is needed to assess the status of the surface waters. In this context, the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) initiated a project to update the environmental quality standards (EQS) for 10 pollutants (pollutants specific for river basin according to Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (OGewV)) and to compile suggestions for environmental quality standards for 20 new chemicals. The searched data were documented data sheets according to the "Guidance Document No. 27 : Technical Guidance for Deriving Environmental Quality Standards" (EC, 2011). The derivation of EQS for the matrices to be considered was performed in accordance with the rules as laid down in the "Guidance Document No. 27 ". Within this project EQS proposals were derived for the following 30 substances: 2. 4 -D, arsenic, bezafibrate, carbamazepin, carbendazim, chloroacetic acid, chromium, dibutyltin, dimethoate, dimoxystrobin, epichlorhydrin, erythromycin, flufenacet, flurtamone, imidacloprid, copper, metoprolol, monobutyltin cation, <b>monolinuron,</b> nicosulfuron, omethoate, triphenyl phosphate, phoxim, roxithromycin, sulcotrione, sulfamethoxazole, tetrabutyltin, triclosan, uranium, zinc...|$|E
40|$|A new {{analysis}} method to detect carbamates and phenylurea pesticide residues in fruit juices was developed using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with liquid chromatography–single quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and liquid chromatography–quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry (LC/QIT-MS). The pesticide residues present in watery matrices as fruit juices were extracted using {{three types of}} fibers: 50 -μm Carbowax/templated resin (CW/TPR), 60 -μm poly(dimethylsiloxane) /divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) and 85 -μm polyacrylate. The different extraction conditions were evaluated choosing as the best parameters 90 min (time), 20 °C (temperature) and 1 ml (volume). After extraction, the desorption (in a static mode) was performed in the specific interface chamber SPME/HPLC, previously filled with 70 % methanol and 30 % water. The best recoveries, evaluated at two fortification levels (0. 2 and 0. 5 mg kg− 1) in fruit juices, were obtained using PDMS/DVB and CW/TPR fibers, and ranged from 25 to 82 % (<b>monolinuron,</b> diuron and diethofencarb), with relative standard deviations (RSDs) from 1 to 17 %. All the limits of quantification (LOQs) were {{in the range of}} 0. 005 – 0. 05 μg ml− 1 and, in any case, equal to, or lower than, maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by Italian and Spanish legislations. The mass spectrometry analyses were carried out using an electrospray ionization (ESI) source operating in the positive mode both for single quadrupole and for QIT mass analysers, operating in selected ion monitoring (SIM) and in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes, respectively. The proposed new method {{can be applied to the}} determination of selected pesticides in real samples of fruit juices...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDiuron {{was found}} to be mineralized in buffer strip soil (BS) and in the sediments (SED) of the Morcille river in the Beaujolais {{vineyard}} repeatedly treated with this herbicide. Enrichment cultures from BS and SED samples led to the isolation of three bacterial strains transforming diuron to 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) its aniline derivative. 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed that they belonged to the genus Arthrobacter (99 % of similarity to Arthrobacter globiformis strain K 01 - 01) and were designated as Arthrobacter sp. BS 1, BS 2 and SED 1. Diuron-degrading potential characterized by sequencing of the puhA gene, characterizing the diuron-degradaing potential, revealed 99 % similarity to A. globiformis strain D 47 puhA gene isolated a decade ago in the UK. These isolates were also able to use chlorotoluron for their growth. Although able to degrade linuron and <b>monolinuron</b> to related aniline derivatives they were not growing on them. Enrichment cultures led to the isolation of a strain from the sediments entirely degrading 3, 4 -DCA. 16 S rRNA sequence analysis showed that it was affiliated to the genus Achromobacter (99 % of similarity to Achromobacter sp. CH 1) and was designated as Achromobacter sp. SP 1. The dcaQ gene encoding enzyme responsible for the transformation of 3, 4 -DCA to chlorocatechol was found in SP 1 with 99 % similarity to that of Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7. This isolate also used for its growth a range of anilines (3 -chloro- 4 -methyl-aniline, 4 -isopropylaniline, 4 -chloroaniline, 3 -chloroaniline, 4 -bromoaniline). The mixed culture composed of BS 2 and SP 1 strains entirely mineralizes 14 C-diuron to 14 CO 2. Diuron-mineralization observed in the enrichment culture could result from the metabolic cooperation between these two populations...|$|E
