40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the institutional arrangements of a <b>multilateral</b> <b>payments</b> union for the Commonwealth of Independent States. It starts with {{an analysis of}} the risks of a non-cooperative solution, which would lead to serious liquidity and solvency problems and thus curtail inter-republican trade by a widespread system of bilateralism. A possible solution to these problems is an internal fixed exchange rate system {{along the lines of the}} EMS. The feasibility of this arrangement depends above all on Russia's ability to pursue non-inflationary monetary and fiscal policies. If this approach is not adopted and if most republics peg their currencies to the ECU, the transactions and precautionary demand for reserves can be considerably reduced by a <b>multilateral</b> <b>payments</b> union, which acts as a common clearing house and provides a common credit facility to its members. While Russia, the prospective creditor, would have to be willing to provide a part of its multilateral surplus as a credit to debtor republics, a financial contribution of $ 3 - 4 billion from the West would be required in order to limit the burden to be borne by Russia. As the transition to world market prices for energy would lead to unsustainable current account deficits for several republics at present consumption levels, a payments union can only be introduced after the adoption of comprehensive stabilization programmes in the potential member countries. Otherwise the quotas of the union would be rapidly exhausted, and the system would cease to have a significant economic effect.

40|$|In July 1944 at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, {{delegates from}} 44 nations agreed upon an {{international}} monetary system to be established following World War II. At {{the heart of the}} system was the International Monetary Fund, which was to foster economic prosperity by promoting international monetary cooperation, orderly exchange-rate arrangements, restriction-free <b>multilateral</b> <b>payments,</b> and efficient balance-ofpayments adjustment.; This article surveys the functioning of the IMF, focusing on recent experience. The article discusses the means and methods the IMF has employed to achieve its goals and the degree of success it has attained. One conclusion is that the IMF's goals should be expanded to include the abolition of restrictions on payments for international capital, as well as current transactions.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} a <b>multilateral</b> <b>payments</b> union (PU) between East European countries (EEPU) as an intermediate solution in the process to full convertibility. After a description of the main functions of a PU, which is based on the historical model of the European Payments Union, it identifies the conditions that justify a PU with trade restrictions vis-a-vis outside countries: above all the existence of unsustainable trade deficits under full convertibility. The paper compares the underlying conditions in East European countries with the situation of the EPU member countries and concludes that an EEPU does not have the potential to repeat the successful performance of the EPU. In addition, it shows that prospective fundamental current account deficits of East European countries can only be estimated after a comprehensive concept of the international monetary integration of East European countries has been developed.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} alternative {{options for}} a future monetary order {{in the area of}} the Soviet Union. Its main focus is on two questions: Under what conditions would a common rouble currency area be compatible with fiscal discipline and effective financial control over the large numbers of state-owned enterprises? If a transition to separate republican currencies is unavoidable, how can its effects on trade flows with{{in the area of the}} Soviet Union be kept as small as possible? The paper analyses four options for a monetary union: the relatively unspecified Draft Treaty proposal by Yavlinsky; a monetary union according to the outline of the European System of Central Banks; a monetary union according to the model of a currency board; and a common central bank system managed by representatives from international institutions. If a system of separate currencies is to be introduced, it is essential that all republics peg to the same outside anchor, preferably the ECU. A common fixed rate system between the republics as well as a <b>multilateral</b> <b>payments</b> union could contribute to a reduction of the need for aggregate foreign exchange.

40|$|The goal of {{conditionality}} on IMF {{credit arrangements}} {{is to promote}} a combination of internal and external economic balance in borrowing countries. In its lending practices, the Fund seeks “to help members to attain, over the medium term, a viable payments position {{in a context of}} reasonable price and exchange rate stability, a sustainable level and growth rate of economic activity, and a liberal system of <b>multilateral</b> <b>payments</b> ” (Guitián, 1981, p. 3). This description is essentially similar to the accepted definition of overall macroeconomic equilibrium. John Williamson, for example, has defined an exchange rate as being in “fundamental equilibrium ” when it “is expected to generate a current account surplus or deficit equal to the underlying capital flow over the cycle, given that the country is pursuing ‘internal balance ’ as best it can and not restricting trade for balance of payments reasons ” (Williamson, 1985, p. 14). Of all the complex relationships embodied in these descriptions, the most difficult to model and analyze is also the most important: the linkage between adjustment and economic growth.

On each day participants will very likely {{have more than one}} trade to settle—in practice, major banks will have hundreds or thousands of trades each day. Each day prior to settlement, CLS calculates the funding required of each Settlement Member on a multilateral netted basis. The amount of cash required by CLS to settle all payment instructions is reduced, allowing each Settlement Member to transfer only the net amount of its payment obligations in each currency, rather than the total amount of each trade to be settled. On average, CLS netting efficiency is in the region of 96 percent.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{illustrates the}} evolution of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) as a form of European hybrid governance. The hybridity of SEPA is conceived in terms of interaction between traditional hard law, soft law and privately produced rules. The public and private systems of rules – public in the form of European directives and regulations and private in the form of <b>multilateral</b> agreements among <b>payment</b> service providers – coexist and mutually shape the structure of the European payments system. These two systems of rules have formally been produced in independent rule-making processes and by discrete rule-makers – public and private respectively. However, public actors have exercised a considerable amount of influence over the private rules. They have done so through informal, yet systematized interactions with private actors and through a series of soft laws. And vice versa, private rule-makers and privately-produced rules substantially have affected the content of public rules. The question to be asked is whether this public-private hybrid governance structure is good governance...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{systemic}} risk in <b>multilateral</b> netting <b>payments</b> systems. A four-period model is constructed {{to investigate the}} effects of random liquidity shocks. There are three different types of agents in this model: banks, the payments system operator, and the central bank. Banks pay one another via the payments system. The payments system operator sets the rules for participation. These include total asset requirements, collateral requirements and net debit caps. The central bank serves {{as a source of}} liquidity during a financial crisis. The model is constructed along the lines of Diamond and Dybvig (1983). In period 0, banks optimize their holdings of noninterest-earning central bank reserves to meet their payment obligations and any additional liquidity obligation. Their alternative is to invest in a nonliquid asset that earns a rate of return R. In period 1, a number of banks are unable to make their payments. The number of banks defaulting is random and realized after banks decide their optimal reserve holdings. In period 2, the remaining banks must cover the net payments of defaulting banks minus the defaulting banks' collateral holdings. Each remaining bank has three options to meet its liquidity event: deliver reserves it holds {{at the time of the}} shock, borrow funds in the interbank market from banks in net credit positions, or default since it cannot meet its additional obligations. In period 3, final wealth of each due to bank is calculated. All banks want to maximize final wealth in period 3.; The model provides the following results. The model calculates the threshold point where the payments system collapses. An interbank funds market increases the efficiency of the payments system. Implementation of policy options such as total asset requirements, collateral requirements, and net debit caps decrease {{systemic risk}}. The central bank's role as provider of liquidity to the financial system is investigated in the context of the model. Payment systems; Risk...|$|R

This dissertation examines the origins of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems (NAC) and its role in foreign financial policy making during the early Truman presidency. It chronicles the NAC from its inception in 1945 through 1948, based primarily on NAC records and publications and provides an integrated analysis of early U. S. efforts to implement the Bretton Woods multilateral financial system at a time of increasing Cold War tensions. Congress created the NAC in 1945 to coordinate the policy making of U. S. government agencies involved in foreign lending, foreign exchange or foreign monetary policy. The NAC also reviewed IMF and World Bank policies and operations insuring that they served U. S. economic interests. The NAC consisted of the Secretary of the Treasury, as chairman, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Export-Import Bank Chairman and the Federal Reserve Chairman. The NAC successfully orchestrated {{the first phase of the}} transition from the economic bilateralism of the inter-war years to the multilateralism of the late- 1950 s. It distributed critical postwar assistance in the form of government loans, while securing borrowers' adherence to <b>multilateral</b> trade and <b>payments</b> practices. An analysis of NAC decision making regarding loans to Britain, France, China, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union demonstrates that by 1946 the politics of containing communism increasingly shaped U. S. government foreign lending, causing NAC policy makers to delay their timetable for establishing a multilateral world economy. The NAC shaped the creation and early policy formation of the IMF and World Bank. It insisted that the IMF directors actively monitor members' use of IMF funds, while requiring them to put their fiscal house in order. During these crisis years, the NAC preserved the majority of IMF resources for later use when IMF members were ready to establish multilateral currency convertibility. The NAC worked to stimulate U. S. private foreign investment by channeling dollars through the World Bank and by collaborating with the Aldrich Committee, a group of U. S. international bankers and businessmen. The NAC also pressured the World Bank into reorienting its focus from reconstruction to development lending...|$|R

The balance of payments position unproved faster than expected. The budget deficit target for 2001 – 02 (as set during the first review) was met, despite a shortfall in the Central Board of Revenue (CBR). Broad money increased strongly in 2001 – 02, despite efforts to sterilize foreign exchange inflows. Reforms in the financial sector made significant progress.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a development of financial {{relations of the}} socialist states in the years of 1945 — 1963 and 1964 — 1982. Conditioning of the first period, forming and developing bilateral financial relations, {{is presented in the}} aspect of strong trends of protection of newly constructed industry, limited supply of export goods and inelastic demand on certain products. Circumstances of the second period which gave rise to technical and settling conditions for multilateral settlements are discussed in the latter part, they were not able to relieve a trade system of the socialist countries from the bilateral balancing. Discussing a complex problem of efficiency of multilateral settlements, the author quotes opinions of international finances' specialists and researchers and seeks for new substantial and technical solutions in order to arrive to an agreement between principles of state controlled economy and demands of international trade in the aspect of settlements. In the author's opinion, models of cash settlements between the socialist countries are unsatisfactory at their present stage. The author advocates that requirements of life have to be followed: the conditions of foreign trade are varying, world's economy is not static, supply of goods and services and demand are constantly fluctuating as well as world prices. It is therefore necessary to introduce a reasonable multilaterality of settlements making for stimulation of currency and increase of weight of finances in international settlements and in consequence- for multilateral balancing of trade turnover. In view of the tendencies to isolate socialist countries in the foreign trade, the author emphasises the need to concentrate efforts to create better currency system which would, under the influence of developing CMEA cooperation, improve <b>multilateral</b> settlements. Although <b>payments</b> turnover is functioning efficiently in the CMEA countries by means of the transfer ruble, the article indicates that major problems in the trade between socialist countries are caused by the fact that each socialist state, in order to balance its foreign trade according to plan, establishes quotas, attempts at bilateral balancing of a foreign trade and links directly a volume of exports and imports of deliveries under contract. Bilaterality understood in that way diminishes utility of transfer ruble and its flexibility in settlements and results in ruble's failure to perform its functions in the international trade. In the following remarks the author discusses the role of transfer ruble in settlements in socialist states as a product of the currency system of these states and of the principle of inconvertibility of national currencies, he is also trying to determine whether transfer ruble is a contractual unit of settlement predominated by elements of bilateralism or it is a type of international currency. The author adopts a notion of transfer ruble as an international currency, in its narrow meaning, i. e. which is recognized solely by those states which had created it, as their common unit of account. The article attributes functions of money sui generis to transfer ruble: a scope in which the ruble can perform classical functions of money is described, as a standard of value, as a tender, as a means of accumulation of value. Various views of scientists and financial experts are quoted in this respect. In conclusion, the author admits that transfer ruble is not an international currency in the wide meaning of this word and should be classed among extramonetary units of settlement. Present forms of trade between socialist countries should be, in the authors opinion, altered to overcome a "product for product" barrier, to extend the trade turnover and to create a possibility of converting a value expressed in one currency into another currency. This requires the existence of real exchange rates and a national currency should act as a tender not only in the country but also abroad. Estimating real financial relations of trade and settlements, the author speaks for improving the existing collective currency and elaborating a program in future aiming at introducing convertible currency of the CMEA states or, at least, a currency of partially limited convertibility.
