50|$|A {{non-monotonic logic}} is a formal logic whose {{consequence}} relation is not monotonic. In other words, non-monotonic logics are devised {{to capture and}} represent defeasible inferences (c.f. defeasible reasoning), i.e., a kind of inference in which reasoners draw tentative conclusions, enabling reasoners to retract their conclusion(s) based on further evidence.Most studied formal logics have a monotonic consequence relation, meaning that adding a formula to a theory never produces a reduction of its set of consequences. Intuitively, monotonicity indicates that learning {{a new piece of}} knowledge cannot reduce the set of what is known. A <b>monotonic</b> <b>logic</b> cannot handle various reasoning tasks such as reasoning by default (consequences may be derived only because of lack of evidence of the contrary), abductive reasoning (consequences are only deduced as most likely explanations), some important approaches to reasoning about knowledge (the ignorance of a consequence must be retracted when the consequence becomes known), and similarly, belief revision (new knowledge may contradict old beliefs).|$|E
50|$|Model-theoretic {{formalization}} of a {{non-monotonic logic}} begins with restriction of the semantics of a suitable <b>monotonic</b> <b>logic</b> to some special models, for instance, to minimal models, and then derives {{the set of}} non-monotonic rules of inference, possibly with some restrictions in which contexts these rules may be applied, so that the resulting deductive system is sound and complete {{with respect to the}} restricted semantics. Unlike some proof-theoretic formalizations that suffered from well-known paradoxes and were often hard to evaluate with respect of their consistency with the intuitions they were supposed to capture, model-theoretic formalizations were paradox-free and left little, if any, room for confusion about what non-monotonic patterns of reasoning they covered. Examples of proof-theoretic formalizations of non-monotonic reasoning, which revealed some undesirable or paradoxical properties or did not capture the desired intuitive comprehensions, that have been successfully (consistent with respective intuitive comprehensions and with no paradoxical properties, that is) formalized by model-theoretic means include first-order circumscription, closed-world assumption, and autoepistemic logic.|$|E

In the spirit of our previous work, we generalise our framework of <b>Monotonic</b> <b>Logic</b> Programs to allow for rules with arbitrary antitonic bodies over general complete lattices, of which normal programs are a special case.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we propose a non-monotonic {{extension}} of the Description Logic ALC for reasoning about prototypical properties and inheritance with exceptions. The resulting logic, called ALC+Tmin, is built upon a previously introduced (<b>monotonic)</b> <b>logic</b> ALC+T that is obtained by adding a typicality operator T to ALC. The operator T is intended to select the “most normal” or “most typical” instances of a concept, so that knowledge bases may contain subsumption relations of the form T(C) ⊑D (“T(C) is subsumed by D”), expressing that typical C-members are instances of concept D. From a knowledge representation point of view, the <b>monotonic</b> <b>logic</b> ALC+T is too weak to perform inheritance reasoning. In ALC+Tmin, in order to perform non-monotonic inferences, we define a “minimal model” semantics over ALC+T. The intuition is that preferred or minimal models are those that maximize typical instances of concepts. By means of ALC+Tmin we are able to infer defeasible properties of (explicit or implicit) individuals. We also present a tableau calculus for deciding ALC+Tmin entailment that allows to give a complexity upper bound for the logic, namely that query entailment is in co-NExpNP...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} logic {{language}} for complex events {{based on a}} given set of atomic discrete temporal events and logic constraints built on them. Then we define a structural-probabilistic composition for building the complex events from a set of basic events. We sup-pose that each complex event is probabilistically defined from such atomic-events constraints in a complete way, so that satisfies the Kolmogorov’s probabilistic axioms. The data structure of basic complex events in this logic theory are ground atoms of a Herbrand base over a given domain/universe for events. The compositions of complex events are parameterized by different kinds of conjunctive/disjunctive probability strategies, and inte-grated into this propositional language for events. We propose a probabilistic semantics for such a logic lan-guage where the set of possible worlds is the carte-sian product of complex events and constraints over a input stream of atomic events. Then we define a probabilistic pattern recognition algorithm for complex events, we define a cut-cautious <b>monotonic</b> <b>logic</b> deduc-tion for them, and show {{that in the case}} of this deduc-tion, all deduced complex events have exactly the prob-ability computed by this probabilistic pattern recogni-tion algorithm.

Instant interactive proofs effect a fragile epistemic impact in their intended communities of peer reviewers that consists in the impermanent induction {{of the knowledge}} of their proof goal {{by means of the}} knowledge of the proof with the interpreting reviewer: If my peer reviewer knew my proof then she would at least then (in that instant) know that its proof goal is true. Their impact is fragile and their induction of knowledge impermanent in the sense of being the case possibly only at the instant of learning the proof. This accounts for the important possibility of internalising proofs of statements whose truth value can vary, which, as opposed to invariant statements, cannot have persistent proofs. So instant interactive proofs effect a temporary transfer of certain propositional knowledge (knowable ephemeral facts) via the transmission of certain individual knowledge (knowable non-monotonic proofs) in distributed systems of multiple interacting agents.
