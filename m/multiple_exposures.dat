25|$|Between 1883 and 1886, Muybridge {{made more}} than 100,000 images, {{capturing}} the interest of artists at home and abroad. In 1884, the painter Thomas Eakins briefly worked alongside him, learning about the application of photography {{to the study of}} human and animal motion. Eakins later favoured the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>exposures</b> superimposed on a single photographic negative, while Muybridge used multiple cameras to produce separate images that could be projected by his zoopraxiscope. In 1887, Muybridge's photos were published as a massive portfolio comprising 781 plates and 20,000 photographs in a groundbreaking collection titled Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements.|$|E

25|$|Hertzfeldt's work {{commonly}} features hand-drawn stick figures, {{in stories}} of black humor, surrealism, and tragicomedy. Some films contain existential and philosophical themes {{while others are}} more straightforwardly slapstick and absurdist. His animation is created traditionally with pen and paper, often with minimal digital aid. Hertzfeldt uses antique 16mm or 35mm–film cameras to photograph his drawings and often employs old-fashioned special effect techniques such as <b>multiple</b> <b>exposures,</b> in-camera mattes, and experimental photography. While some of these techniques are as established as an occasional stop-motion animation sequence or a universe of moving stars created by back-lit pin holes, other effects are new innovations on classical methods, as seen with the in-camera compositing of multiple, split-screen windows of action in the Everything Will Be OK films.|$|E
25|$|Between 1883 and 1886, Muybridge {{made more}} than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia {{under the auspices of}} the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter Thomas Eakins briefly worked {{alongside}} him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favoured the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>exposures</b> superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope. The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Towards the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.|$|E
25|$|A draft risk {{assessment}} released by Health Canada in July 2016 {{has found that}} overexposure to boric acid {{has the potential to}} cause developmental and reproductive health effects. Since people are already exposed to boric acid naturally through their diets and water, Health Canada advised that exposure from other sources should be reduced as much as possible, especially for children and pregnant women. The concern is not with any one product, but rather <b>multiple</b> <b>exposures</b> from a variety of sources. With this in mind, the department also announced that registrations for certain pesticides that contain boric acid, which are commonly used in homes, will have their registrations cancelled and be phased out of the marketplace. As well, new, more protective label directions are being introduced for other boric acid pesticides that continue to be registered in Canada (for example, enclosed bait stations and spot treatments using gel formulations).|$|E

2500|$|Marie-Georges-Jean Méliès, {{known as}} Georges Méliès ( [...] ; 8 December 1861 – 21 January 1938), was a French illusionist and film {{director}} who led many technical and narrative {{developments in the}} earliest days of cinema.

His films include A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904), both involving strange, surreal journeys somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films, though their approach is closer to fantasy.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel patch-based match and fusion {{algorithm}} by taking account of moving scene in a <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> image sequence using optimization. A uniform iterative approach is developed to match and find the corresponding patches in different exposure images, which are then fused in each iteration. Our approach {{does not need to}} align the input <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> images before the fusion process. Considering that the pixel values are affected by various exposure time, we design a new patch-based energy function that will be optimized to improve the matching accuracy. An efficient patch-based exposure fusion approach using the random walker algorithm is developed to preserve the moving objects from the input <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> images. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first patch-based exposure fusion work to preserve the moving objects of dynamic scenes that does not need the registration process of different exposure images. Experimental results of moving scenes demonstrate that our algorithm achieves visually pleasing fusion results without ghosting artifacts, while the results produced by the state-of-the-art exposure fusion and tone mapping algorithms exhibit different levels of ghosting artifacts...|$|R

The {{morphological}} and cytological consequences {{resulting from}} single or <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> of gamma irradiation {{to the head}} were qualitatively and quantitatively studied by light and electron microscopy in 30 -day-old rats. At birth (day 0) neonatal albino male and female rats were divided into three experimental groups and subjected to either a single (200 rads) exposure, a consecutive five- day <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> (800 rads) or sham irradiated. Brain and body weights, plus crown to rump length, were lower for both irradiated groups compared to the control. At {{the level of the}} light microscope, total olfactory bulb volume and volume-to- volume ratio for all layers for both irradiated groups were lower than the control. Total mitral and granule cell number for both irradiated groups were also lower. Ultrastructurally, total external plexiform layer synaptic number increased 23 % and 38 % within the single and multiple groups, respectively. Reciprocal synapse number for the single exposure group was comparable to the control group but decreased in the <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> group. Both symmetrical (granule- to-mitral) and asymmetrical (mitral-to-granule) dendrodendritic synaptic density increased significantly in the multiple group, but not in the single group. Reduction in apposition length for the dendrodendritic gemmulofugal (granule-to-mitral) synapses and an increase in apposition length for the dendrodendritic mitrofugal (mitral-to-granule) synapses were noted. The results {{of this study indicate that}} neonatal exposure to a single sublethal dose of gamma irradiation at birth significantly alters the development of the olfactory bulb but does not interfere with normal synaptogenic organization of neuronal assemblies between mitral and granule cells, despite reduction in both cell types. Although no apparent abnormalities in synaptogenesis were noted for the <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> group, gross morphological interference of normal laminar development was noted along with retarded growth of mitral and granule cells, despite no apparent abnormalities in the cells themselves. It is concluded that <b>multiple</b> <b>exposure</b> to gamma radiation during the first postnatal week severely affects not only the postnatal granule and mitral cell populations, but also the morphology and ultrastructure of the olfactory bulb which may have contributed to a compensatory development within the mitral-granule cell synaptic circuitry.
