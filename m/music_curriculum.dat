5|$|Michael Tippett {{was born}} in London in 1905, to well-to-do though {{unconventional}} parents. His father, a lawyer and businessman, was a freethinker, his mother a writer and suffragette. He received piano lessons as a child, but first showed his musical prowess while a pupil at Stamford School in Lincolnshire, between 1920 and 1922. Although the school's formal <b>music</b> <b>curriculum</b> was slight, Tippett received private piano tuition from Frances Tinkler, a noted local teacher whose most distinguished pupil had been Malcolm Sargent, himself a former pupil at Stamford. Tippett's chance purchase in a local bookshop of Stanford's book Musical Composition led to his determination to be a composer, and in April 1923 he was accepted {{as a student at}} the Royal College of Music (RCM). Here he studied composition, first under Charles Wood (who died in 1926) and later, less successfully, with Charles Kitson. He also studied conducting, first under Sargent and later under Adrian Boult. He left the RCM in December 1928, but after two years spent unsuccessfully attempting to launch his career as a composer, he returned to the college in 1930 for a further period of study, principally under the professor of counterpoint, R. O. Morris.|$|E

25|$|At a {{time when}} state-sponsored mass public {{schooling}} was in its infancy, Sharp published song books intended for use by teachers {{and children in the}} then-being-formulated <b>music</b> <b>curriculum.</b> These song books often included arrangements of songs he had collected with piano accompaniment composed by Sharp himself, arrangements intended for choral singing. Although it has been alleged that, had they heard them, traditional singers (who in England virtually always sang unaccompanied) might well have found Sharp's piano parts distracting, the arrangements with piano accompaniment did help Sharp in his goal of disseminating the sound of English folk melodies to children in schools, thus acquainting them with their national musical heritage.|$|E

As a result of a perceived need to improve the music theory curricula for the preparation of church music leaders, this study compared two diverse approaches to the teaching of music theory for church music university students on achievement, attitudes, and self-preparedness. This current study was a quantitative, quasi-experimental research design. Participants (N = 286) were first-year music theory students drawn from the music theory programs at six universities. Both experimental and control groups were exposed to similar music theory content; however, the experimental group was taught music theory emphasizing a combination of Common Practice principles with pop/rock and jazz theory concepts, Nashville Number system, rhythm chart writing and reading, contemporary vocal harmony, and performance of theory concepts through in-class lab settings. In contrast, the control group was taught music theory using a traditional, conservatory-based <b>music</b> theory <b>curriculum</b> consisting of harmony practices presented in traditional four-part writing based exclusively on Common Practice Period principles. When the Liberty contemporary and Liberty traditional groups were compared, significant differences were revealed with the contemporary group scoring higher on posttest measures of music theory achievement (p <. 05), attitude (p <. 05), and self-preparedness (p <. 001). When the Liberty contemporary group was compared with the five other universities, the ANCOVA results for the music theory achievement posttest scores revealed that students instructed in a contemporary <b>music</b> theory <b>curriculum</b> achieved higher test scores on traditional music theory concepts. ANOVA results of the attitude inventory posttest scores indicated that students instructed in a contemporary <b>music</b> theory <b>curriculum</b> possessed higher attitudinal scores (toward a diversity of music styles) as compared to students taught in a traditional <b>music</b> theory <b>curriculum.</b> Significant differences (p <. 001) between groups on posttest self-preparedness scores also indicated that the participants instructed in the contemporary <b>music</b> theory <b>curriculum</b> felt more confident and self-prepared as prospective church music leaders than those participants instructed in a traditional <b>music</b> theory <b>curriculum.</b> This study supports the effectiveness of the use of contemporary church music styles as part of the musical education of future church music leaders...|$|R

500|$|Among {{the music}} {{teachers}} at SPGS, most significantly {{in terms of}} her musical development, Joseph encountered the emergent composer Gustav Holst, then little known, who taught her composition. After leaving the Royal College of Music in 1898 Holst had earned his living as an organist, and as a trombonist in various orchestras, while awaiting critical recognition as a composer. In 1903 he gave up his orchestral appointments to concentrate on composing, but found that he needed a regular income. He became a music teacher, initially at the James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich; in 1905 he was recommended to Frances Gray by Adine O'Neill, a former pupil of Clara Schumann, who taught piano at SPGS. He was first appointed on a part-time basis to teach singing, and later extended his activities to cover the school's wider <b>music</b> <b>curriculum</b> including conducting and composition. According to the composer Alan Gibbs, Joseph quickly came under Holst's spell, and adopted his principles as her own. Holst later described her as the best girl pupil he ever had: [...] "From the first she showed an individual attitude of mind and an eagerness to absorb all that was beautiful".|$|E

40|$|Music {{technology}} is a term commonly {{used to refer to}} electronic form of the musical arts, particularly devices and computer software that enable the facilitation, playback, recording, composition, storage, and performance of various musical compositions. There has been a growing awareness of the importance of aesthetics in early childhood education, especially for the music technology that offers young children benefits from the implementation of an appropriately complete <b>music</b> technology <b>curriculum</b> in the early childhood educational environment and instruments application. The findings in this paper demonstrate such music courses encourage creativity and foster a sense of cultural understanding and appreciation amongst children in an early education program. In short, with the progress of developmentally appropriated program, this study demonstrates that <b>music</b> technology <b>curriculum</b> is not only valuable, but essential to the early education program for young children...|$|R
