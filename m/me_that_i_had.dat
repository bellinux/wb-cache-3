5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{experience}} {{of working on}} Flower Drum Song was rewarding in many ways, {{not the least of}} which was that it convinced <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> overcome all traces of my depression. [...] My only thought was to keep on doing what I was doing, and I saw nothing in the future that could stop me.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{visited her}} {{hometown}} of Detroit during May 2014 and contributed funds to three of the city's organizations, to help eliminate poverty there. The singer released {{a statement saying that}} she was inspired by their work, adding that [...] "it was obvious to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to get involved and {{be part of the solution}} to help Detroit recover". Continuing to extend her business ventures, the singer premiered MDNA Skin in 2014, a range of skin care products in Tokyo, Japan; the products were later launched in the United States in late 2017. In October 2016, Billboard named Madonna its Woman of the Year. Her [...] "blunt and brutally honest" [...] speech at the ceremony received widespread coverage in the media. Her upcoming projects include co-writing and directing a film adaptation of Andrew Sean Greer's novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Tentatively titled Loved, the film would portray the protagonist's relationship with her gay twin brother Felix.|$|E

500|$|LeMond's first {{professional}} victory came three months into his 1981 debut {{when he won}} a stage of the French Tour de l'Oise. He followed with a win in the Coors Classic in the United States, finishing ahead of Sergei Sukhoruchenkov, the 1980 Olympic road champion. The major step forward in 1981 occurred in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race where LeMond placed third. The achievement is the more remarkable because he rode the race in support of team leader Bernard Hinault. LeMond missed standing on the podium with race winner Hinault, as Pascal Simon had finished ahead of him. Two weeks later Simon was assessed a 10-minute penalty when it was discovered he had been doping. LeMond considered the race {{to have been a}} [...] "major steppingstone" [...] in his career. Said LeMond: [...] "It showed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the kind of climbing ability that you need to win the top European stage races." [...] LeMond won a total of five races in his rookie season of 1981.|$|E
500|$|Mullen has {{admitted}} his bass drum technique {{is not one}} of his strengths and has used a floor tom to his left to create the effect he wants (since The Unforgettable Fire era), using it for accents or in songs such as [...] "With or Without You", [...] "In God's Country", [...] "One" [...] and Pride (In the Name of Love)". Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I {{never got a chance to}} practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then he {{came upon}} a copy of Andrea Palladio's Quattro Libri d'archittetura. [...] "You could never believe," [...] {{he wrote to his}} friend and {{long-term}} correspondent Marchesi, [...] "the impression that this book made. Then it struck <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> every reason to consider myself badly guided" [...] before that point (Loukomsky 1928). He turned for new, Neoclassical instruction from Antoine Decrezet, a friend of Winckelmann, and the former's pupil Niccola Giansimoni, measuring and drawing the antiquities of Rome.|$|E

2500|$|When my {{grandmother}} {{found out that}} I was playing jazz {{in one of the}} sporting houses in the District, she told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> disgraced the family and forbade me to live at the house.... She told me that devil music would surely bring about my downfall, but I just couldn't put it behind me. The cornetist Rex Stewart recalled that Morton had chosen [...] "the nom de plume 'Morton' to protect his family from disgrace if he was identified as a whorehouse 'professor'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Borlaug {{said that}} his first few years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained {{scientists}} and equipment. Local farmers were hostile towards the wheat program because of serious crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to stem rust. [...] "It often appeared to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made a dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico," [...] {{he wrote in the}} epilogue to his book, Norman Borlaug on World Hunger. He spent the first ten years breeding wheat cultivars resistant to disease, including rust. In that time, his group made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat.|$|E
2500|$|No cricket {{had come}} from Swabi before and Junaid Khan didn't take {{interest}} in cricket initially, he played with tape-ball & was introduced to hard ball set up by his cousin. At 16 years age Junaid Khan was measured as the fastest bowler in the NWFP Twenty/20 competition. Junaid Khan said, [...] "Some of my team mates suggested that I should go for the Under 17 trials Abbottabad. I was in two minds but afterwards I was relieved that I attended the trials, as Ehteshamuddin spotted me and told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> potential and that I should go to Lahore".|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't let us {{talk about}} it," [...] he interrupted. [...] "I tried {{to pay a}} debt. It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> only {{incurred}} a fresh one." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is why I have such a problem with specific credits." ...|$|E
