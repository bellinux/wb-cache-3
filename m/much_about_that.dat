6000|$|... 'I don't know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Young men don't {{get their}} {{happiness}} {{in that way}} now. They've got other things to think of.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{principal}} friend, of the others, is {{her brother}} Peter. I don't think he troubles himself <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing," [...] said Nick.|$|E
5000|$|The team at NAKG knows so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{varieties}} <b>that</b> {{the members}} of the crop committee are referred to as the 'Walking Reference Collection'.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I'm not--I {{assure you}} I'm not,' said Laura Wing. 'On the contrary, I see so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> me <b>that</b> I don't sympathise with.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe so," [...] responded Sylvia. [...] "If a thing pleases you, don't try to {{find out}} too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>That's</b> the way to disappointment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I hadn't thought <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> yet." [...] He felt guilty, and was profusely cordial to Lee Theresa Zapp, {{the factory}} forewoman, {{who had just}} thumped down-stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> There {{are four}} of us English foremen, and between seven and eight hundred native fitters, smiths, carpenters, painters, and such like." ...|$|E
6000|$|Again her rogue's eyes gleamed. [...] "I don' know so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> Mr. Derek. I'm {{going where}} I won't be chivied about and pointed at, like what I am here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I made a {{night of}} it, as I promised," [...] said he. [...] "This morning I know so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> pearls <b>that</b> I'm tempted {{to go into the}} business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm dashed keen on them, and I've {{studied them}} a bit. As {{a matter of}} fact, though it seems rather like swanking, there isn't <b>much</b> <b>about</b> dogs <b>that</b> I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And a {{great deal}} better, probably. Well, Martin, I'm no lawyer, but I should think there'd not be <b>much</b> {{difficulty}} <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Any attorney could do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you please, brother. We {{are only}} too {{glad to have}} you home again, to care <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> But, now, I have {{something}} of importance to tell you about myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come by all means, and welcome, Mr. Dillon!" [...] cried Roger. [...] "If you {{had that}} mine you speak about you must know as <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{district}} as Abe Blower--maybe more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. When I {{was going}} through it, I prayed; but I don't know whether I really believed. I don't think I mind <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> {{one way or the}} other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There ain't {{any need}} of very <b>much</b> guessin' <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> You're bound {{to get where}} there'll be a chance of hidin', an' {{you want to be}} mighty lively." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know too}} much," [...] he said. [...] "That's what's {{the matter with}} me. That's what's the matter with all of us, and the whole show; we know too <b>much.</b> Too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> one another; too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> ourselves. <b>That's</b> why I'm really interested, just now, <b>about</b> one thing <b>that</b> I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly, mother," [...] replied Catherine Seyton, [...] "I {{have not}} seen so many men of late, that I should {{immediately}} forget your grandson, though I mark not <b>much</b> <b>about</b> him <b>that</b> is deserving of especial remembrance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! the sermon, is it?" [...] {{breaks in}} downright Harry. [...] "I hadn't {{time to read}} a single {{syllable}} of it, aunt--thank you. You see I don't care <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> kind of thing--but thank you all the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oolibuck, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> river which we saw yesterday, off the mouth of this one; and I cannot help fearing that the ship will run into it, instead of into this, for the land is very deceptive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I daresay one profits {{more by the}} {{mistakes}} one makes off one's own bat than by {{doing the right thing}} on somebody's else advice. I've had my fling, and I don't mind settling down now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look! By gum! As I'm a livin' sinner {{there comes}} the whole crowd of hostile redskins. They've got their guns, and--by Gum! they're painted. Looks bad, bad! Not <b>much</b> {{friendliness}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> bunch!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here,' said I, 'I don't mind <b>much</b> <b>about</b> losing <b>that</b> {{life you}} talk so much of; but I mean {{to lose it}} the way I want to, and that is, putting a stop to all this beastliness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{felt that}} you were in earnest, then I had to be in earnest too. And I thought so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it <b>that</b> I lay awake nearly all that night. Shall I tell you what I thought?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> Mr President. I'm {{not sure}} that for myself I want to be cheerful anywhere. If I've only got {{somebody}} just to speak to sometimes, that will be quite enough for me. I suppose old Crasweller will be the first?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I don't {{know that}} I can say <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I don't {{think most of}} them was overfond of the Miss Penfolds, and wouldn't have been sorry if the will had been found {{that would have given}} them another master or mistress." ...|$|E
6000|$|To prepare {{myself for}} this {{expedition}} I {{ran up to}} Ottawa in February to study maps and to talk with Canadian officials concerning the various trails which were being surveyed and blazed. [...] "No one knows <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> country," [...] said Dawson with a smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is very true," [...] said he, [...] "but I {{have thought}} so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> them, and I have studied and {{consulted}} so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> them, <b>that</b> I think I have provided {{against all the}} dangers we have reason to expect. To me the whole business seems like very plain, straightforward sailing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me {{interrupting}} just a minute," [...] interjected {{a member}} of the group who hailed from a distant city, [...] "have you <b>much</b> trouble <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> I mean <b>about</b> knocking the sides out of houses?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{satisfaction}} in her voice, {{but it was}} with a mildly ironical and yet faintly wistful expression she gazed at the shining sea. It somewhat astonished Austin, though there was so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Jacinta <b>that</b> was incomprehensible to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "People don't {{think so}} <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> now-a-days as they used. If he liked it, and she too, {{who had a}} right to say anything? My idea is that a man with any spirit would have turned Lord Alston out of the house. What {{business}} had he to interfere?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} you could judge <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> Albert," [...] his mother said, [...] "seeing that, naturally, the poor girl was grievously shaken {{by the events of}} the evening before, and would, moreover, say but little when her father was conversing with two strangers. What thought you of her, Edgar?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now there'll be {{a row in}} the house;--you see {{if there}} isn't!" [...] said Amelia. But Mrs. Carroll {{expressed}} her opinion that the man must be the most ungrateful of creatures if he kicked up a row on the present occasion. [...] "I don't know so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> mamma," [...] said Amelia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] said I, [...] "I don't mind <b>much</b> <b>about</b> losing <b>that</b> {{life you}} talk so much of; but I mean {{to lose it}} the way I want to, and that is, putting a stop to all this beastliness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{there not}} {{something}} in the great medicine-book that father speaks so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> which teaches <b>that</b> we should love our enemies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But is it so, Luke?" [...] {{asked the}} anxious mother. [...] "I care <b>much</b> more <b>about</b> <b>that</b> than I do {{about all the}} brewery put together. Nothing would make me so wretched as to see you make a {{marriage}} that was beneath you." ...|$|R
