5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E

5000|$|The NBAS {{is based}} on several key assumptions.First, infants, even ones that seem vulnerable, are highly capable when they are born. [...] "A newborn already has nine months of {{experience}} when she is born," [...] Dr. Brazelton notes. [...] "She is capable of controlling her behavior in order to respond to her new environment."Second, babies [...] "communicate" [...] through their behavior, which, although it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> always <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> it, is a rational language. Not only do infants respond to cues around them, like their parents' faces, but they also take steps to control their environment, such as crying to get a response from their caregivers.Third, infants are social organisms, individuals with their own unique qualities, ready to shape as well as be shaped by the care giving environment.|$|R

6000|$|Now {{can there}} be any {{difficulty}} in understanding this? To you Democrats it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> principle; but surely you cannot fail to perceive the position plainly enough. The distinction {{between it and the}} position of your candidate is broad and obvious, and I admit you have a clear right to show it is wrong if you can; but you have no right to pretend you cannot see it at all. We see it, and to us it appears like principle, and the best sort of principle at that--the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with their own business. My friend from Indiana (C. B. Smith) has aptly asked, [...] "Are you willing to trust the people?" [...] Some of you answered substantially, [...] "We are willing to trust the people; but the President is as much the representative of the people as Congress." [...] In a certain sense, and to a certain extent, he is the representative of the people. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is; but can he, in the nature of things know the wants of the people as well as three hundred other men, coming from all the various localities of the nation? If so, where is the propriety of having a Congress? That the Constitution gives the President a negative on legislation, all know; but that this negative should be so combined with platforms and other appliances as to enable him, and in fact almost compel him, to take the whole of legislation into his own hands, is what we object to, is what General Taylor objects to, and is what constitutes the broad distinction between you and us. To thus transfer legislation is clearly to take it from those who understand with minuteness the interests of the people, and give it to one who does not and cannot so well understand it. I understand your idea that if a Presidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question, or rather upon all questions, and the people, with full knowledge of this, elect him, they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions. By means of it, measures are adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of one party, and often nearly half of the other. Three, four, or half a dozen questions are prominent at a given time; the party selects its candidate, and he takes his position on each of these questions. On all but one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections, and his party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large portion of them are against it. But what are they to do? The whole was strung together; and they must take all, or reject all. They cannot take what they like, and leave the rest. What they are already committed to being the majority, they shut their eyes, and gulp the whole. Next election, still another is introduced in the same way. If we run our eyes along the line of the past, we shall see that almost if not quite all the articles of the present Democratic creed have been at first forced upon the party in this very way. And just now, and just so, opposition to internal improvements is to be established if General Cass shall be elected. Almost half the Democrats here are for improvements; but they will vote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their vote will have aided in closing the doors against improvements. Now this is a process which we think is wrong. We prefer a candidate who, like General Taylor, will allow the people to have their own way, regardless of his private opinions; and I should think the internal-improvement Democrats, at least, ought to prefer such a candidate. He would force nothing on them which they don't want, and he would allow them to have improvements which their own candidate, if elected, will not.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} idea behind universal design for learning (UDL) is injecting flexibility into {{the materials and}} methods used in the classroom. Where there is flexibility there is potential to maximize learning opportunities for all the students within today’s diverse classrooms – including students with disabilities. However, materials and methods can be made flexible in a myriad of ways. How does a teacher select among the many options – what is it important to consider? This column addresses this question by elaborating three UDL principles that guide the process of selecting materials and methods according to individual differences in three broad learning networks that underlie three vital elements of learning: (a) recognition, (b) strategy, and (c) affect. Learning and the Brain: the Foundation for the UDL Principles The UDL principles take root in what for some may seem an unlikely place, the brain. Although it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> always <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> it, brain research offers enormous insight into the learning enterprise, increasingly so {{with the advent of}} techniques to image brain activity.
