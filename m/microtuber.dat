At equivalent Ca:total cation, Ca uptake was promoted further when the total macroelement concentration was reduced by half than when the Ca level was doubled (from 3 to 6 mM). This suggested that the increase in the osmotic potential of the medium had a great impact on Ca uptake, probably by affecting the root pressure. B contamination from impurities in the nutrient chemical components always occurred. The addition of the recommended H 3 BO 3 level of 0. 1 mM (1. 08 ppm) or more (0. 3 mM) to the medium decreased Ca content of leaves and shoots in Norland but not Bintje, while addition of only 25 % of this level was sufficient to provide plantlets with adequate B tissue concentration without compromising normal growth. Macroelement dilution along with Ca addition, and lower B levels than commonly used in MS (0. 1 mM) are recommended for optimal Ca uptake in potato and possibly other plant species. <b>Microtuber</b> yield was not improved by a low pH shock. Adjusting microtuberization medium pH to less than 5. 7 (3. 5, 4. 3 or 5. 2), prior to autoclaving, reduced <b>microtuber</b> number and/or weigh...|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} Ca 2 + uptake into greenhouse-grown potato plants and micropropagated potato plantlets were examined, {{including}} {{the movement of}} Ca 2 + into potato plants and tubers, identification of Ca-packing genotypes and assessment {{of the effect of}} improved medium Ca 2 + level on different parameters such as plantlet growth, <b>microtuber</b> induction, yield and tissue Ca concentration. The effect of exogenous vitamin Ds and UV-elicited endogenous vitamin D synthesis on regulation of 45 Ca 2 + uptake into plantlet shoots was also examined. Safranin dye was not as suitable as the tracer 45 Ca 2 + for monitoring translocation of Ca 2 + into tubers. Uptake of Ca 2 + into tubers occurred indirectly through the main basal roots and stolon roots and directly through tuber periderm. Liquid scintillation counting and flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry were used to screen six potato cultivars and two wild species for ability to take up Ca 2 + from treatment solutions containing high or low Ca 2 + levels. In vitro potato micropropagation, microtuberization, and tissue calcium concentration were compared for six cultivars when Murashige-Skoog basal medium Ca 2 + level was increased from 3, to 5 or 15 mM. All aspects of growth including shoot dry weight, early <b>microtuber</b> induction, <b>microtuber</b> yield and tissue Ca concentration were improved when medium Ca 2 + level was 15 mM. Cultivar Bintje was the most efficient genotype at accumulating Ca 2 + from treatment solutions or growth media containing high or low Ca 2 + levels. Vitamin Ds improved 45 Ca 2 + uptake into shoots of micropropagated potato plantlets and D 3 was more efficient in this regard than D 2 or a combination of D 3 and D 2. Plantlets had increased 45 Ca 2 + uptake when exposed to UV irradiation compared with the untreated control plantlets. Plantlets given a 24 hour interval in the dark after UV exposure had even greater 45 Ca 2 + uptake, suggesting that vitamin D, metabolites, specifically calcitriol (1, 25 (OH) 2 -...|$|E

40|$|The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops worldwide. Production of <b>microtubers</b> in temporary immersion systems represents a qualitative advance in obtaining planting material. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of using potato <b>microtubers</b> obtained in SIT to produce minitubers in greenhouse. One hundred <b>microtubers</b> were planted per treatment at a distance of 5. 0 x 10 cm. After 15 days, the number of live plants was quantified, while, at 70 and 120 days of culture 15 plants were selected for treatment and fresh and dry mass of foliage and root was determined. In addition, other morphological variables at 120 days were evaluated. Survival ranged between 84 and 86 %. The results showed that <b>microtubers</b> of cv. `Andinita' obtained in SIT can be used at greenhouse to produce minitubers. The immersion frequency with which they were obtained influenced the number of minitubers per plant as well as its content of dry mass. The best results were achieved with immersion every 4 h.

The main factors were known {{controlling}} <b>microtuber</b> formation including the media type, the concentration of sucrose, the type and concentration of plant growth regulators, temperature, and photoperiodicity. This research aimed to determine the influence of the t of cytokinin and its concentration on the micro-shoot formation of Granola cultivar of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), as well as to determine the best cytokinin type and its concentration on micro-shoot formation of Granola cultivar potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). The research was experimental in a split-plot design. The main plot was the type of cytokinin (BAP and Kinetin), and the subplot was cytokinin concentration at five levels of concentrations, i. e., 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 µM. This study replicated each treatment three times which resulted in obtaining 30 experimental units. The data obtained were then analyzed using an analysis of variance, followed by honest significant difference test at 95 and 99 % levels of confidence. The results showed that the formation of micro-shoot of Granola cultivar of potato was controlled by the type and concentration of cytokinin used.

40|$|A two-year {{field study}} was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} jasmonic acid (JA), light (during in vitro explant production and in vitro tuberization phases), and dormancy-breaking treatment on performance of microtubers in the production of seed tubers (pre-elite) in five potato cultivars. Microtubers were produced under short day (8 -h) conditions and in darkness, from stock plantlets pre-treated with JA and untreated, and on tuberization media with or without JA. <b>Microtuber</b> performance was compared to in vitro plantlets transplanted directly to the field. Yields of tubers from microtubers were 30 % to 40 % of those from plantlets. Microtubers of cultivars Amisk and Russet Burbank produced the highest yields of pre-elite tubers. Atlantic microtubers performed poorly in the field. JA pre-treatment of stock plantlets, prior to in vitro tuberization, enhanced seeds tuber production from microtubers in Russet Burbank and lowered in Shepody. JA presence in media during in vitro tuberization significantly lowered production of tubers while exposure to 8 -h light resulted in microtubers performing significantly better in the field than microtubers produced in the dark. Dormancy release was the key factor influencing <b>microtuber</b> performance. Unlike greenhouse studies, gibberellic acid (GA(3)) was more effective than Rindite.

Four Dioscorea polystachya Turcz., three each of D. bulbifera L. and D. sansibarensis Pax. and two D. japonica Thunb. accessions were used. Five and 10 mg/l of Kn along with IAA and sucrose, and 0. 2 and 0. 5 mg/l of NAA, sucrose and with or without BAP were used in four treatments. The accessions Yam 23 and Yam 25 of D. sansibarensis failed to initiate any leaf under four treatments. The remaining accessions produced 0. 11 to 1. 76 leaves per explant.

40|$|Among {{the food}} crops, yam takes up quantitatively {{the first place}} in the {{gabonese}} diet. Unfortunately, it can stay available only 6 to 7 months in the year because of difficulties of harvest and post- harvest. This problem is little studied in the case of Dioscorea cayenensis-D. rotundata complex. In order to optimize the use of micro tubers for the growing in green house or field, it is important to control the duration of storage before the germination. The present study concerns <b>microtubers</b> obtained by in vitro culture. When <b>microtubers</b> were harvested (after 9 months of culture) and directly transferred on a new medium without hormone, the tubers rapidly sprouted in in vitro conditions. Harvested <b>microtubers</b> were also stored dry in jars in sterile conditions during 2 to 18 weeks before in vitro sprouting. In this case, <b>microtubers</b> stored during 18 weeks sprouted more rapidly than those stored 8 weeks. The size of the tubers used for the storage had great influence on further sprouting. The upper <b>microtubers</b> in 25 mm can be kept to the darkness, under 50 % of relative humidity, in 25 °C during at least 18 weeks. Sprouting is 100 % whatever the substrate of culture. The plant tissue culture technique constitutes a serious alternative for the preservation of plant kinds and for the production of planting material.
