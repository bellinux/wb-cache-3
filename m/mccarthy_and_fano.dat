40|$|The artworks by Los Angeles based {{contemporary}} artists Paul <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Mike Kelley {{can be considered}} a post-pop that turns pop art's appropriation of high and low cultural materials into a fixation on the psychosocial effects of culture on the individual. Creating a frenzied web of associations that develop pop, performance, and postminimal art strategies, the artists elicit audiences in a critical inquiry into our structures of meaning. Appropriating film, television and urban life with performance and installation art practices <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Kelly reveal the social construction behind cultural values, our notions of gender, and architectural spaces. This thesis sets out to address <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Kelley's work through three categories: post-pop, performance and architectural space, arguing that <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Kelley implode high and low cultural materials in order to reveal the repressive social conditioning of American culture at large. Works that will be considered in particular include: <b>McCarthy</b> <b>and</b> Kelley's collaborative project Sod and Sodie Sock Comp O. S. O.
