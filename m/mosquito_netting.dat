5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using <b>mosquito</b> <b>netting</b> while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} a qualitative study designed {{to explore the}} reasons why some Papua New Guineans who own <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> choose not to use them, whether on a regular or episodic basis. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with a sub-sample (n = 44) of participants in a country wide household survey who reported owning or having access to a <b>mosquito</b> <b>net,</b> but not having slept under a <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> the night prior to survey. All IDIs were completed between December 2010 and June 2011. Analysis was informed by a general inductive methodology. Multiple impediments to regular <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> use were identified by study participants, although all were broadly grouped into the inter-related categories of net-, environmental- or human-factors. Indifference emerged as the most influential impediment towards regular net use presenting as a general attitudinal context in which a majority of participant responses were grounded. A lack of knowledge regarding malaria transmission pathways or the utility of <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> {{did not appear to}} underlie this indifference. Rather, the indifference appeared to be rooted in a lack of fear of malaria infection cultivated through lived experience. A wide range of interventions could potentially promote greater <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> use amongst this population. However, the basis of any intervention strategy, given the pervasive indifferent attitude towards regular <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> use, should be to render individual <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> use as easy and as convenient as possible and to promote complementary malaria control strategies where appropriate...|$|R

There was investment in extensive sanitation projects, including city water systems, fumigation of buildings, spraying of insect-breeding areas with oil and larvicide, installation of <b>mosquito</b> <b>netting</b> and window screens, and elimination of stagnant water. Despite opposition from the Commission (one member said his ideas were barmy), Gorgas persisted and when Stevens arrived, he threw his weight behind the project. After two years of extensive work, the mosquito-spread diseases were nearly eliminated. Nevertheless, even with all this effort, about 5,600 workers died of disease and accidents during the U.S. construction phase of the canal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Roll Back Malaria Initiative has {{identified}} the under-fives {{as one of}} the high risk groups for malaria, and one of the strategies to fight malaria in this group is increasing <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> use. This implies that there must be selective targeting at the household level such that the children are protected. However, the Roll Back Malaria preferences must be reconciled with those at the household level to take into account household level preferences. Methods This paper is based on the 2000 – 2001 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey data in which information on <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> ownership and use was collected. The patterns of household <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> ownership and use for children under five years of age were examined using both bi-variate and multivariate analysis. Results The preferences at the household level seem to be different; children use <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> primarily because they happen to share a bed with their parents. A child who shares a bed with the mother is 21 times more likely to use a <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> than his/her counterpart. Conclusion Increasing <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> coverage such that 60 % (the target for the RBM) of households have at least one <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> will not necessarily protect the under-fives. Either the coverage will have to be expanded or appropriate targeting strategies designed. </p...|$|R

The 17 study com-munities were pair-matched and randomly allocated to receive treated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> or no nets and the children (age range 5 3 months– 6 years) in each community were randomly allocated to receive d/p or placebo individually every two weeks. This resulted {{in each of the}} approximately 2, 000 children recruited being in one of four study groups (impregnated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> and d/p prophylaxis, impregnated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets,</b> d/p prophylaxis, and controls). The intervention phase of the study lasted 12 months. A total of 1, 800 children attended more than 25 % of the 48 total weekly morbidity surveillance surveys and were included in the analysis. The effects of the exclusive use of either treated <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> or d/p prophylaxis on protection against clinical malaria due to P. falciparum was significantly similar (49 % and 42 %, respectively), while in combination this protective efficacy was significantly increased to 72 % (95 % confidence interval 5 67 – 76 %).

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{assess the}} {{ownership}} {{and use of}} <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> in 2014, in Mozambique. METHODS This observational and cross-sectional study assessed, in February and March 2015, 69 districts (nine of 11 provinces of Mozambique) that {{have benefited from the}} mass distribution of <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets.</b> The Lot Quality Assurance Sampling methodology was used. Each locality was denominated supervision area. The Lot Quality Assurance Sampling opts for a minimum of 19 households (in this case, we decided for a minimum of 100 households per district) from each supervision area to assess an indicator (in this case, two indicators were assessed: ownership and use of <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets).</b> Two questions guided the research: a) received a mosquito net; b) used a <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> the night before. RESULTS A total of 6, 725 households were assessed. Eighty three percent of them had received <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> in the campaign. Of the 6, 232 respondents, 82. 0 % said they used <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> the night before. The districts of the provinces with low coverage of ownership and use were Tete (69. 5 % and 60. 0 %, respectively), Zambezia (79. 0 % and 60. 0 %, respectively), and Gaza (81. 6 % and 70. 7 %, respectively). The largest coverage of ownership and use were observed in the districts of Nampula (96. 7 % and 93. 8 %, respectively) and Niassa (86. 0 % and 85. 4 % respectively).

Josefin Henrysson, spring 2015 Supervisors: Dr. Rune Andersson, MD, PhD, Gothenburg University, Sweden. Dr. Ivan Nyenje, Kasangati Health Centre, Uganda. Department of Infectious Diseases, Sahlgrenska University Hospital Background: Malaria is {{a leading cause of}} death in Uganda, especially among children < 5 years. One of the most effective ways of protecting against malaria is a consistent use of an insecticide treated <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> (ITN). It has been shown in studies that community-level use of <b>mosquito</b> <b>nets</b> significantly reduces malaria transmission in children < 5 years. Aim: To map the frequency of net {{ownership and}} net usage among children 0 - 12 years and their parents. To see if there are any factors associated with net usage. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with randomly selected respondents who met inclusion criterias. Results: 100 % of the households owned at least one <b>mosquito</b> <b>net.</b> Over 90 % of both the children and the parents had slept under a <b>mosquito</b> <b>net</b> the previous night. Some factors associated with net usage were; age of the child, the highest level of education of the mother and the way of sleeping. The majority of respondents reported there had been a mass campaign in their local area less than six months ago. Discussion and conclusions: <b>Mosquito</b> <b>net</b> usage is very high, both among the children and their parents. Mass campaigns have most likely {{had a significant impact on}} the uptake of net usage in the study population.
