25|$|The {{increase}} in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back {{many of the}} downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector).</b> This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} free {{electrons}} in the ionosphere, {{in conjunction with}} the earth's magnetic field, causes Faraday rotation, a sort of circular birefringence. This is the same mechanism which can rotate the axis of linear polarization by electrons in interstellar space as mentioned below. The magnitude of Faraday rotation caused by such a plasma is greatly exaggerated at lower frequencies, so at the higher microwave frequencies used by satellites the effect is minimal. However medium or short wave transmissions received following refraction by the ionosphere are strongly affected. Since a wave's path through the ionosphere and the earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector</b> along such a path are rather unpredictable, a wave transmitted with vertical (or horizontal) polarization will generally have a resulting polarization in an arbitrary orientation at the receiver.|$|E
25|$|On {{the right}} is an {{illustration}} of the electric field vectors of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. The electric field vectors have a constant magnitude but their direction changes in a rotary manner. Given {{that this is a}} plane wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Specifically, given that this is a circularly polarized plane wave, these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane to plane, has a constant strength while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better appreciate this. This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise circularly polarized if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an electromagnetic wave each electric field vector has a corresponding, but not illustrated, <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector</b> that is at a right angle to the electric field vector and proportional in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.|$|E

2500|$|Applying such a pulse {{to a set}} {{of nuclear}} spins {{simultaneously}} excites all the single-quantum NMR transitions. In terms of the net magnetization vector, this corresponds to tilting the magnetization vector away from its equilibrium position (aligned along the external magnetic field). The out-of-equilibrium magnetization vector precesses about the external <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector</b> at the NMR frequency of the spins. This oscillating magnetization vector induces a current in a nearby pickup coil, creating an electrical signal oscillating at the NMR frequency. This signal is known as the free induction decay (FID), and it contains the vector sum of the NMR responses from all the excited spins. In order to obtain the frequency-domain NMR spectrum (NMR absorption intensity vs. NMR frequency) this time-domain signal (intensity vs. time) must be Fourier transformed. Fortunately the development of Fourier Transform NMR coincided with the development of digital computers and the digital Fast Fourier Transform. Fourier methods can be applied to many types of spectroscopy. (See the full article on Fourier transform spectroscopy.) ...|$|E

Choosing an appropriate coordinate system (say, x,y,z) allows one to [...] "diagonalize" [...] this tensor, thereby reducing the maximal number of its components from 9 to 3: gxx, gyy and gzz.

40|$|The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer-Earth Probe (TOMS-EP) mission relies upon a {{successful}} {{deployment of the}} spacecraft's solar arrays. Several methods of verification are being employed to ascertain the solar array deployment status, with each requiring differing amounts of data. This paper describes a robust attitude-independent verification method that utilizes telemetry from the coarse Sun sensors (CSS's) and the three-axis magnetometers (TAM's) to determine the solar array deployment status - and it can do so with only a few, not necessarily contiguous, points of data. The method developed assumes that the solar arrays are deployed. Telemetry data from the CSS and TAM are converted to the Sun and <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>vectors</b> in spacecraft body coordinates, and the angle between them is calculated. Deployment is indicated if this angle is within a certain error tolerance of the angle between the reference Sun and <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>vectors.</b> Although several other methods can indicate a non-deployed state, with this method there is a 70 % confidence level in confirming deployment {{as well as a}} nearly 100 % certainty in confirming a non-deployed state. In addition, the spacecraft attitude (which is not known during the first orbit after launch) is not needed for this algorithm because the angle between the Sun and <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>vectors</b> is independent of the spacecraft attitude. This technique can be applied to any spacecraft with a TAM and with CSS's mounted on the solar array(s) ...|$|R
