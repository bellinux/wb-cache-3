25|$|In 1945 {{with the}} French ousted by Japan, Prime Minister Trần Trọng Kim {{of the newly}} {{restored}} Empire of Vietnam adopted another variant of the yellow flag. It included three red bands but the <b>middle</b> <b>band</b> was broken to form the Quẻ Ly Flag. Derived from the trigrams, Quẻ Ly is the sixth of the Bát Quái (the Eight Trigrams – (Ba gua) in I Ching): Càn, Khâm, Cấn, Chấn, Tốn, Ly, Khôn, Đoài. It was chosen to symbolize the sun, fire, light, and civilization. And most importantly, it represents the southern lands, that is Vietnam. This flag was used briefly from June to August 1945 when Emperor Bảo Đại abdicated.|$|E
25|$|The uniform {{issued to}} the Indian Legion were the {{standard}} German Army uniform of feldgrau {{in winter and}} khaki in summer. Additionally, the troops wore on their right upper arm a specially designed arm badge {{in the shape of}} a shield with three horizontal stripes of saffron, white, and green and featuring a leaping tiger on the white <b>middle</b> <b>band.</b> The legend Freies Indien was inscribed in black featured on a white background above the tricolor. A saffron, white, and green transfer was also worn on the left side of their steel helmets, similar to the black, white, and red decal German soldiers wore on their helmets. Sikhs in the legion were permitted to wear a turban as dictated by their religion instead of the usual peaked field cap, of a colour appropriate to their uniform.|$|E
500|$|The {{cylindrical}} font, at {{the west}} end of the nave, is from the 12th century. The outside of the font is decorated with carvings in three bands. [...] The bottom band contains round-headed arches, the <b>middle</b> <b>band</b> has a series of chevrons, and the top band has various crosses, chequerwork patterns and other decorations. It has similarities of design and style with the font at St Peulan's Church, Llanbeulan. There is an 18th-century stone tablet recording benefactions to the poor of the parish on the north wall of the chancel. [...] The communion table and rails date from the late 17th century.|$|E
5000|$|Each band is {{classified}} by the grade of music they are playing, which ranges from I (easy) to VI (hard). Most high school bands play music {{that range from}} grade IV to VI; <b>middle</b> school <b>bands</b> tend to play music in the grade II or III category, and some <b>middle</b> school <b>bands</b> {{with a high degree}} of talent play at grade IV.|$|R
40|$|Though many image {{watermarking}} schemes {{have been}} proposed, {{none of them}} can resolve the problem of joint ownership. This paper proposes two novel algorithms that make use of a secret sharing scheme in cryptography to address this problem. The first one applies Shamir's (2, 2) threshold scheme to the watermarking algorithm. A watermark, which is a gaussian distributed random vector determined by two keys, is embedded to selected coefficients in all <b>middle</b> <b>bands</b> in the wavelet domain of an image, so that only when the two keys are put together can the ownership be verified. The second algorithm is a modification of the first one. Three random watermarks are embedded to <b>middle</b> <b>bands</b> in the wavelet domain of an image. For the watermark detection, two thresholds are set, so the watermark detector can verify partial ownership as well as full ownership. Experimental results show that both algorithms have the desired properties such as invisibility, reliable detection and robustness against {{a wide range of}} imaging processing operations...|$|R

2500|$|The {{standard}} of the Indian Legion, presented as the unit's colours in late 1942 or early 1943, featured the same design as the arm badge previously issued {{to the men}} of the Legion. It consisted of saffron, white and green horizontal bands, from top to bottom, the white <b>middle</b> <b>band</b> was approximately three times the width of the coloured bands. The words [...] "Azad" [...] and [...] "Hind" [...] in white were inscribed over the saffron and green bands respectively, and over the white <b>middle</b> <b>band</b> was a leaping tiger. This is essentially the same design that the Azad Hind Government later adopted as their flag (although photographic evidence shows that the Indian National Army, at least during the Burma Campaign, used the Swaraj flag of the INC instead).|$|E
2500|$|Uniforms of chevaulegers were {{modelled}} upon Cavalry National uniforms {{from the}} last decade of the 18th century. Dark blue kurtka had crimson stand-up collar, wristbands and facings. The snug dark blue pantaloons (breeches) were lined with leather, and ornamented with a single crimson stripe. Collar and facings of the Grand Uniform were ornamented also with silver wavy line, and pantaloons with double crimson stripes (officer's Gala Full Dress was white and crimson). High (22cm) czapkas had their forehead metals made of brass (officer's of silver) with a rising sun and the letter [...] "N". For the parade czapka was crowned with 47cm long plume of heron's or ostrich white feathers, and a cockade with a blue center, broad crimson <b>middle</b> <b>band</b> and a narrow white outer edging, with the blue practically hidden under the silver Maltese cross. Officers had blue, while regular soldiers had off-white overcoats, known as manteau-capotes.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the motivational techniques that are most effective in encouraging <b>middle</b> school <b>band</b> students to practice. A questionnaire was sent to <b>middle</b> school <b>band</b> directors in seven regions, as designated by Texas Music Educators Association. Out of 86 respondents, 81 % (n = 68) reported using motivational techniques to encourage practicing, most frequently utilizing assessment, tangible rewards, competition, and encouragement as incentives. Student practicing guidelines were provided by 94 % (n = 82) of the respondents, predominantly suggesting the implementation of a routine, having goals/plan, the use of practice logs, and decreasing tempo. Respondents indicated that parents could encourage their children to practice by providing them direction, listening to them play, and showing interest. Findings from this study provide <b>middle</b> school <b>band</b> directors greater insight into strategies to facilitate student practice. Baker, VickiYoungblood, PamelaStoupy, Etienn...|$|R
