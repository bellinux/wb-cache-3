This paper reports on a system of experiments carried out on STO substrates using a new <b>magnetorheological</b> (MR) <b>finishing</b> process where dynamic magnetic fields are formed by magnetic poles rotate. The results show that a circular ring shaped polishing belt with a stability evaluation zone appears on the surface after being polished by MR finishing with a single-point dynamic magnetic field. The dynamic magnetic fields are stronger when the revolutions of magnetic pole increase and eccentricity of pole enlarge, with the surface finish is smoother and more material is removed. The optimum machining times, machining gap, oscillation distance, eccentricity of pole, revolutions of the workpiece and magnetic pole are 60 min, 0. 8 mm, 0 mm, 7 mm, and 350 r min− 1 and 90 r min− 1, respectively, and the best MR fluid consists of 6 wt% of diamond abrasives in W 1 particle size and 18 wt% of carbonyl iron powder in W 3. 5 particle size. A surface roughness of Ra and a material removal rate of 8 nm and 0. 154 μm min− 1 can be obtained in these optimum process conditions. Finally, the polishing mechanism for dynamic magnetic fields and the mechanism for removing material from STO ceramic substrates are discussed in detail...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Magnetorheological</b> <b>finishing</b> or [...] "MRF" [...] {{uses the}} {{shearing}} of a viscous mixture of micron sized iron particles, abrasives, and oil to impart a machining force or pressure onto the workpiece surface. This magnetic particle mixture is {{commonly referred to}} a ribbon and is extremely viscous {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field, the increased viscosity and different fluid properties are similar to those of a Bingham fluid rather than a Newtonian fluid. In a typical MRF finishing setup the MRF fluid is pumped onto a rotating wheel which is connected to an electromagnet. When the electromagnet is activated the fluid transitions to a more viscous state, the workpiece is then pressed onto the fluid resulting a shearing of the fluid which results in material removal at the interface between the workpiece and the MRF. One of the characteristics of a Bingham fluid is as speed increases the force required to shear proportionally increases therefore an increased wheel rotational rate results in an increased machining force when sheared. This particular setup is ideal for large free form nonmagnetic workpieces such as glass optics. It is also commonly applied to large nonmagnetic workpieces where the thickness of the work results in difficulty in getting the magnetic field to permeate effectively at the desired location hence this setup does not rely on the careful design of the magnetic circuit.|$|E

It has been reported that the shear effect plays an essential role in material removal with the MRF polishing, which ensures no extra damage introduced into the workpiece [28, 36 – 38]. The MRF polishing technology is to create a spot or a wedge on the surface of a part. The spot or the wedge crosses the damage layer to the damage-free matrix. The depth of SSD can be inferred by measuring the width of the spot or the wedge. The depth of SSD is usually tens of microns but the width of the spot is in the order of millimeters. The depth of damage is magnified hundreds of times in this way, which improves the accuracy of the measurement.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} {{in the employment of}} optics-based technologies in modern life has spurred the search for lenses that exhibit exceptionally high optical accuracies, and yet are simple and cheap to manufacture. Currently, most complex lenses are based on multiple lens elements of spherical form, and it is common for a number of these spherical elements to be combined into a single optical objective. However, a characteristic of spherical lenses, spherical aberration, prevents the spherical lens from achieving perfect refraction and leads to distortion of the image at the focus point. It {{is for this reason that}} multiple spherical elements are generally necessary. Aspherical, sometimes referred to as free-form, lenses enable the incorporation of compensation for spherical aberration. Such aspherical lenses may exhibit a perfect focus, will be lighter in weight and will be smaller in size than equivalent multi-spherical objectives. However, the production of asphericallenses is complex, a consequence of their intricate shape. Research was undertaken to analyse the methods for producing lenses. In particular <b>magnetorheological</b> <b>finishing</b> was studied extensively. This process utilises a fluid that is stiffened under the influence of a magnetic fluid as the polishing agent. It is an extremely capable and adaptable process, but yet is subject to many complex factors that influence the manner in which it may be applied to the optical finishing process.
