40|$|Multi-camera {{triangulation}} of feature points {{based on}} a minimisation of the overall l(2) reprojection error can get stuck in suboptimal local <b>minima</b> <b>or</b> <b>require</b> slow global optimisation. For this reason, researchers have proposed optimising the l(infinity) norm of the l(2) single view reprojection errors, which avoids the problem of local minima entirely. In this paper we present a novel method for l(infinity) triangulation that minimizes the l(infinity) norm of the l(infinity) reprojection errors: this apparently small difference leads to a much faster but equally accurate solution which {{is related to the}} MLE under the assumption of uniform noise. The proposed method adopts a new optimisation strategy based on solving simple quadratic equations. This stands in contrast with the fastest existing methods, which solve a sequence of more complex auxiliary Linear Programming or Second Order Cone Problems. The proposed algorithm performs well: for triangulation, it achieves the same accuracy as existing techniques while executing faster and being straightforward to implement...|$|R

40|$|Thermoelectric (TE) power {{generation}} is {{an increasingly important}} {{power generation}} technology. Major advantages include: no moving parts, low-weight, modularity, covertness/silence, high power density, low amortized cost, and long service life with <b>minimum</b> <b>or</b> no <b>required</b> maintenance. Despite low efficiency of power generation, there are many specialized needs for electrical power that TE technologies can uniquely and successfully address. Recent advances in thermoelectric materials technology have rekindled acute interest in thermoelectric power generation. We have developed single crystalline n- and p- type PbTe crystals and are also, developing PbTe bulk nanocomposites using PbTe nano powders and emerging filed assisted sintering technology (FAST). We will discuss the materials requirements for efficient thermoelectric power generation using waste heat at intermediate temperature range (6500 to 8500 K). We will present our recent results on production of n- and p- type PbTe crystals and their thermoelectric characterization. Relative characteristics and performance of PbTe bulk single crystals and nano composites for thermoelectric power generation will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} studies {{the potential of}} using crumb rubber as a partial substitute for course sand {{in the production of}} concrete paving block. Laboratory trials were conducted to compare and investigate the effect of using three particle size of crumb rubber (1 - 3 mm), (3 - 5 mm) and combination of both. A series of tests were carried out to determine the properties of the blocks prepared with and without crumb rubber. The dry density, compressive strength and skid resistance were measured for laboratory prepared samples. It is believed that cement acting as a binder mixed with crumb rubber make concrete blocks more flexible and thus, provides softness to the surface. At the same time it also provides sufficient strength <b>or</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> strength (30 MPa) in accordance to MA 20 for 60 mm thickness rectangular block to be used on pavement for vehicles of less than 3 tonnes gross weight...|$|R

30|$|The Argentinean program {{severely}} punishes short contribution careers {{relative to}} {{other countries in the}} region (Forteza and Ourens 2009). Conversely, the program also widely promotes additional programs to allow access to special pensions for those whose years of contributions are insufficient to be eligible for either the Full (30 years <b>minimum</b> <b>required)</b> <b>or</b> the Advanced age (10 years minimum required) pensions. Additionally, there has also been an increase in the level of the minimum pension in the last few years (Rofman et al. 2010). These changes have led to the idea that the pension system is an essential factor in changes to individual career paths with respect to formal/informal employment), because workers can believe that even if they are informal, the government’s commitment to maintaining some requirement to access a pension will be relaxed (Forteza et al. 2009). Moreover, if the requirements to access a pension are too strict and only a small share of the population can enjoy it, the government will be forced either to change the rules or to create new types of non-contributory pensions.|$|R

40|$|Selling {{integrated}} circuits (IC) in consumer markets places a high emphasis on cost. Average selling prices (ASP) {{tend to be}} low due to customer price pressure and competition. One of the largest costs associated with manufacturing ICs is the subsequent test cost. The test time for complex chips is approaching 50 % of total package-device cost. [1] This is broken down into hardware utilization time and man-hours. The more time that is spent testing one product means less time is available for testing other products. Getting capital expenditures approval to buy more test equipment is generally a hard sell, and even if approved the long lead times prove to be not convenient for alleviating test bottlenecks. One {{of the best ways}} to improve test costs is to reduce the test time per unit. Faster unit testing allows the existing hardware to test more products given the same amount of time. The first place to investigate potential savings is to start at the functional level. Semiconductor companies produce an electrical table highlighting the specifications of the part. The industry standard is to break down these specifications into three categories: minimum, maximum, and typical values. Specifications that fall under the heading of <b>minimum</b> <b>or</b> maximum are <b>required</b> to be guaranteed either by the design of the part or by production testing. This paper will discuss an analysis method designed to improve one of the more time-consuming tests, one-time programmable (OTP) trims...|$|R
40|$|Edge weight-based {{segmentation}} methods, such as normalized cut <b>or</b> <b>minimum</b> cut, <b>require</b> a partition number specification {{for their}} energy formulation. The number of partitions {{plays an important}} role in the segmentation overall quality. However, finding a suitable partition number is a nontrivial problem, and the numbers are ordinarily manually assigned. This is an aspect of the general partition problem, where finding the partition number is an important and difficult issue. In this paper, the edge weights instead of the pixels are partitioned to segment the images. By partitioning the edge weights into two disjoints sets, that is, cut and connect, an image can be partitioned into all possible disjointed segments. The proposed energy function is independent of the number of segments. The energy is minimized by iterating the QPBO-α-expansion algorithm over the pairwise Markov random field and the mean estimation of the cut and connected edges. Experiments using the Berkeley database show that the proposed segmentation method can obtain equivalently accurate segmentation results without designating the segmentation numbers...|$|R
40|$|Visualization of multidimensional dataset is a {{challenging}} task due to non-uniformity of the data. It requires {{new ways to}} display data for better analysis and interpretation. Parallel coordinate {{is one of the}} popular techniques for visualization of multi dimensional dataset. Parallel coordinate technique emphasis various types of patterns present in the dataset. Here, pattern is shown by a polyline. Slope of poly-line indicates the difference between data values. Variation in slope creates the different types of pattern. Based on slope, pattern can be classified and this kind of classification helps to explore distinct pattern available in dataset. Ordering of the axis affects pattern available in any dataset. Specific arrangement of axis may provide maximum patterns and another arrangement may provide minimum patterns. Ordering of axis in different order to find maximum <b>or</b> <b>minimum</b> pattern <b>requires</b> exponential time. Here, we propose a novel clustering technique using heuristic based branch & bound based axis reordering mechanism to solve this problem in polynomial time.

40|$|The use of antenna arrays {{to exploit}} spatial {{information}} in single and multi-user RF communication receivers {{is well established}} for reducing interference and enabling frequency reuse. Antenna arrays have been deployed in single satellite applications but arrays have not been exploited in multi-satellite constellations where increased array size enables high spatial selectivity between ground transmitters. One requirement for these array systems is sufficient fidelity in transporting the received RF signals at each antenna to the array processor. Optical inter-satellite link architectures for signal transport are investigated and parameterized models to compare the performance of each are synthesized. Both analog and digital modulation schemes for the link are considered. A two-channel receiver with both low and high interference is analyzed. It is shown that high resolution satellite array receivers are practical with low required optical power. The optimum selection of transport architecture is shown by selecting for lowest error probability <b>or</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> optical power. A satellite-to-satellite distance threshold is found for selecting the optimum inter-satellite link architecture for a given application. by James Bernard Glettler. Thesis (S. M.)
