I gave him a quick call {{and asked him if}} he could get on the record, and he recorded it and sent it over. As I expected, there was nothing I needed to change. It sounded perfect. He put <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>in</b> there, which is great – so people know to pronounce it now properly, hopefully." [...] The version featuring Ludacris was originally released digitally as the b-side to [...] "No Other One" [...] in November 2009, before in the United States in February 2010.|$|E

LaBelle described the single as an [...] "anthem for women", in which she defined the term [...] "sexify" [...] as a way for women to [...] "make [...] feel comfortable and confident and happy and proud" [...] or help their men feel the same way. The chorus is accompanied by a [...] "summery two-step tune", and includes lyrics such as [...] "I gotta whole bunch of ways" [...] and [...] "He'll come home girl / If you know what I mean."

500|$|Wigner {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 [...] "for his {{contributions}} {{to the theory of}} the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles". The prize was shared that year, with {{the other half of the}} award divided between Maria Goeppert-Mayer and J. Hans D. Jensen. Wigner professed that he had never considered the possibility that this might occur, and added: [...] "I never expected to get <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>in</b> the newspapers without doing something wicked." [...] He also won the Franklin Medal in 1950, the Enrico Fermi award in 1958, the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, the Max Planck Medal in 1961, the National Medal of Science in 1969, the Albert Einstein Award in 1972, and the eponymous Wigner Medal in 1978.

500|$|In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson, who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury {{at the end}} of {{the film}} Iron Man, signed on to reprise the role in Thor as part of an {{unprecedented}} nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios. However, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in Thor. When asked why not Jackson explained, [...] "I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; they said I was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' I called my agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need to pay me if they're gonna put <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>in</b> it. Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for Thor to serve as [...] "connective tissue" [...] for The Avengers. Also in February, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.|$|E
500|$|The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now {{expanded}} to eight {{and referred to}} as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band. [...] Andy Richter was back as an announcer, making Weinberg's role as a foil a little uncertain. [...] Gradually Weinberg and the band's roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves. On June 25, Weinberg departed The Tonight Show temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy bit that had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport. [...] Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain. [...] Of being Tonight Show bandleader, he said, [...] "I {{think one of the}} biggest thrills in my life was seeing <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>in</b> the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for 'Tonight Show' bandleaders. There's never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to think when I was a kid what a great job that must be – you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me." [...] On September 25, Weinberg left The Tonight Show again for two months, to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour. [...] The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was [...] "hit" [...] and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O'Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show). [...] The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on The Tonight Show the next day. [...] With no E Street Band projects in sight {{for at least the next}} year or two, Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role.|$|E

Baldwin, a noninterventionist, admitted others [...] "have urged me to place <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>in</b> nomination." [...] In a convention speech, party founder Howard Phillips endorsed Baldwin and controversially referred to Keyes as a neocon and a too-recent Republican.|$|E

2500|$|Crosby contributed {{the song}} [...] "Long Live the King", a cynical {{commentary}} on the star-making mechanics of the music business, which was ironic, since it was precisely those same materialistic business practices that had enabled The Byrds' reunion to transpire in the first place. [...] Crosby also chose to revisit the song [...] "Laughing", which had already been released on his first solo album, If I Could Only Remember <b>My</b> <b>Name,</b> <b>in</b> 1971. [...] Crosby's rationale for re-recording the song {{was that he had}} originally written [...] "Laughing" [...] in 1967, during his last days as a member of The Byrds and as such, it had initially been intended for inclusion on a Byrds' album. [...] The version of [...] "Laughing" [...] featured on Byrds saw the return of McGuinn's raga rock style of guitar playing, which had last been utilized on the band's Fifth Dimension and Younger Than Yesterday albums. [...] Crosby also sang the lead vocal on the album's Joni Mitchell cover, [...] "For Free".|$|E
