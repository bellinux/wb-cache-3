Instead of Lacy attending the meeting, actor Paul Robeson did. Robeson, though a noted black actor and advocate of civil rights, was a controversial figure {{due to his}} affiliation with the Communist Party. The owners heard Robeson out, but at Landis's suggestion, did not ask him any questions or begin any discussion with him.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and {{immediately}} after World War II, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against New Zealand. However, he was sidelined by injury in 194647 and Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively. Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs {{in the next two}} Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> continued national selection, and he made 99. In the Tests against India during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. In any case, Brown had done enough to tour England with The Invincibles in 1948, his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 2011, the US {{lawsuit against}} Scholastic was dismissed.

In the UK courts, on 21 March 2011, Paul Allen, a trustee of the Jacobs estate, was ordered to pay as security to the court 65% of the costs faced by Bloomsbury and Rowling, amounting to over £1.5million, to avoid the claim being struck out. It was reported in The Bookseller that Paul Allen has appealed against paying this sum. As a condition of the appeal, he paid £50,000 to the court in May 2011. The claim was formally struck out in July 2011 after the deadline for Allen's initial payment was missed.|$|E

25|$|United States Secretary of Transportation Claude Brinegar often criticized Butterfield {{for being}} lax on {{aviation}} safety, allegations Butterfield strongly denied. In early January 1975, President Gerald Ford {{asked for the}} resignation of all executive branch officeholders who had been prominent in the Nixon administration.

25|$|Some {{people also}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> {{different}} narrative forms being classified as storytelling {{in the contemporary}} world. For example, digital storytelling, online and dice-and-paper-based role-playing games. In traditional role-playing games, storytelling {{is done by the}} person who controls the environment and the non playing fictional characters, and moves the story elements along for the players as they interact with the storyteller. The game is advanced by mainly verbal interactions, with dice roll determining random events in the fictional universe, where the players interact with each other and the storyteller. This type of game has many genres, such as sci-fi and fantasy, as well as alternate-reality worlds based on the current reality, but with different setting and beings such as werewolves, aliens, daemons, or hidden societies. These oral-based role-playing games were very popular in the 1990s among circles of youth in many countries before computer and console-based online MMORPG's took their place. Despite the prevalence of computer-based MMORPGs, the dice-and-paper RPG still has a dedicated following.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Sól's attested personifications in Norse mythology, John Lindow {{states that}} [...] "even kennings like 'hall of the sun' for sky may not suggest personification, given {{the rules of}} kenning formation"; that in poetry only stanzas {{associated}} with Sól in the poem Vafþrúðnismál are certain in their personification of the goddess; and [...] "that Sól is female and Máni male probably {{has to do with}} the grammatical gender of the nouns: Sól is feminine and Máni is masculine."

500|$|The philosopher {{of biology}} Michael Ruse wrote that Thompson [...] "had {{little time for}} natural selection." [...] Instead, Thompson {{emphasised}} [...] "the formal aspects of organisms", trying to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> self-organization through normal physical and chemical processes. Ruse notes that, following Aristotle, Thompson used as an example the morphology of jellyfish, which he explained entirely mechanically with the physics of a heavy liquid falling through a lighter liquid, avoiding natural selection as an explanation. Ruse is not sure whether Thompson believed he was actually breaking with [...] "mechanism", in other words adopting a vitalist (ghost in the machine) view of the world. In Ruse's opinion, Thompson {{can be interpreted as}} arguing that [...] "we can have completely mechanical explanations of the living world" [...] – with the important proviso that Thompson apparently felt {{there was no need for}} natural selection. Ruse at once adds that [...] "people like Darwin and Dawkins undoubtedly would disagree"; they would insist that ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1913, Blair left Beebe for Reno {{with the}} {{intention}} of divorcing him, since at this time in history it was easier to obtain a divorce in Reno than in most other areas of the United States. The divorce was granted on August 29, 1913, after Blair had spent the minimum requirement of six months as a resident in Reno. Obtaining a divorce in Reno required a person to demonstrate that their spouse had committed either adultery or extreme cruelty; Blair's complaint accused Beebe of the latter, claiming that during the pheasant expedition he had threatened to commit suicide by [...] "throwing himself in the river, shooting himself through the roof of the mouth with a revolver, and by cutting his throat with a razor." [...] Beebe made very little effort to contest the divorce, and did not appear in court to offer any testimony. Although newspapers at the time reported Blair's accusations uncritically, with headlines such as [...] "Naturalist was cruel", modern biographers consider it more likely that Blair resorted to hyperbole in order to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> divorce. A week after her divorce from Beebe, Blair was remarried to their next-door neighbor Robin Niles, suggesting that the true reason for the divorce may have been cuckoldry. On the other hand, some biographers have suggested that Beebe suffered a nervous breakdown during the expedition, and that he may have contributed his own part to Blair's alienation.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th-century {{revival of}} alchemy, {{the two most}} seminal figures were Mary Anne Atwood and Ethan Allen Hitchcock, who {{independently}} published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy.

[...] Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including Eliphas Levi, Arthur Edward Waite, and Rudolf Steiner. Hitchcock, in his Remarks Upon Alchymists (1855) attempted to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise {{in order to avoid}} accusations of blasphemy from the church and state.

2500|$|The {{establishment}} of devolved government in Wales through the Welsh Assembly, {{set up in}} 1999, {{has led to a}} divergence between England and Wales on some Government policies.
