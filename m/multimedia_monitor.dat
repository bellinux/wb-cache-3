40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} impact of light {{filtering}} on automatic key phrase extraction (AKE) applied to Broadcast News (BN). Key phrases are words and expressions that best characterize the content of a document. Key phrases are often used to index the document or as fea-tures in further processing. This makes improvements in AKE accuracy particularly important. We hypothesized that filtering out marginally relevant sentences from a document would improve AKE accuracy. Our experiments confirmed this hypothesis. Elimination of as little as 10 % of the document sentences lead to a 2 % improvement in AKE precision and recall. AKE is built over MAUI toolkit that follows a supervised learning approach. We trained and tested our AKE method on a gold standard made of 8 BN programs containing 110 manually annotated news sto-ries.

40|$|Current sensor-based {{monitoring}} systems use multiple sensors {{in order to}} identify high-level information based on the events that take place in the monitored environment. This information is obtained through low-level processing of sensory media streams, which are usually noisy and imprecise, leading to many undesired consequences such as false alarms, service interruptions, and often violation of privacy. Therefore, we need a mechanism to compute the quality of sensor-driven information that would help a user or a system in making an informed decision and improve the automated monitoring process. In this article, we propose a model to characterize such quality of information in a multisensor <b>multimedia</b> <b>monitoring</b> system in terms of certainty, accuracy/confidence and timeliness. Our model adopts a multimodal fusion approach to obtain the target information and dynamically compute these attributes based on the observations of the participating sensors. We consider the environment context, the agreement/disagreement among the sensors, and their prior confidence in the fusion process in determining the information of interest. The proposed method is demonstrated by developing and deploying a real-time monitoring system in a simulated smart environment. The effectiveness and suitability of the method has been demonstrated by dynamically assessing the value of the three quality attributes with respect to the detection and identification of human presence in the environment...|$|R

A typical application of such networks is <b>multimedia</b> event <b>monitoring.</b> It is worth noting that the status (including region size and position) of many real-world events often changes over time, such as migration, traffic and crowd movement, and sudden hot spots.

False negative, in contrast, includes, e.g. a compound which is excluded to be a borderline substance although it is one. This means that a possible substance of very high concern due to its LRTP and its short failure of only one of the vPvB and PBT criteria is not identified by the screening procedure.
