5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{published}} {{the final report}} and concluded that pilot error {{was the cause of}} the crash. The investigation determined that there were no issues with the aircraft and all systems were operating normally. The investigation concluded several factors to this accident were the pitch angle versus engine power on the FDR data indicated that the basic principle of jet aircraft flying was not adhered during manual flying, aircraft flight path became unstable below MDA when the rate of descend exceeding 300 <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> in which this situation was not recognised by either pilot, and the Captain's decision to go-around was conducted at an altitude which was insufficient for the go-around to be executed successfully. The flight crew loss of situational awareness in regards of visual references once the aircraft entered a rain cloud during the final approach below minimum descend altitude (MDA), thus, the plane crashed into the water.|$|E

5000|$|Another type of time pencil had a {{percussion}} cap but no detonator attached. Instead {{there was a}} crimping attachment at one end to allow pyrotechnic fuse to be crimped on. When a time pencil of this type fired, it would light the fuse which would burn towards a detonator crimped onto the other end. Because standard safety fuse burns at around half a <b>metre</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> it is not practicable to provide delays {{of more than a}} few minutes in this way. It was also possible to connect a pencil detonator to so-called [...] "instantaneous fuse" [...] (not to be confused with detonating cord) which had an unusually fast burn rate of over 7 <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> second.|$|R

In the 17th century, referring to multi-kilometer races, Cavendish said, [...] "They were so much faster than all other horses known {{at that time that}} none was ever seen to come close to them, even in the many remarkable races that were run."

2500|$|The most {{striking}} {{feature of the}} ship was the lifting platform in the stern, abaft from the propellers and rudders, which was supported by high cantilever structures on both sides. Although the arrangement {{was similar to the}} original Seabee design, the [...] "Syncrolift" [...] cargo elevator was electric instead of hydraulic. Eight winches in four pairs were capable of hoisting 2,600 tons of cargo at a speed of 0.7 <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> ( [...] per minute), giving the ship a calculated loading capacity of about 2,600 tons per hour in optimum conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of HPNS include tremors, myoclonic jerking, somnolence, EEG changes, visual disturbance, nausea, dizziness, and {{decreased}} mental performance. HPNS has two components, one {{resulting from the}} speed of compression and the other from the absolute pressure.

The susceptibility of divers to HPNS varies considerably depending on the individual, but has little variation between different dives by the same diver.|$|E
5000|$|Two loading roads {{led to the}} tracks. In addition, {{there was}} a freight {{handling}} facility with six parallel tracks, {{as well as a}} head and a side ramp each of which had a carrying capacity of 60 tonnes.

50|$|Air rest or dry stand.At {{the end of}} the wet {{stand the}} water is drained out and this is the start of the air rest. During the air rest, fans are run to supply fresh oxygen and to remove excess CO₁ {{produced}} by grain respiration. The temperature of the air supplied is important as it shouldn't impact on the grain temperature during steeping (10 to 15 °C). The aeration requirements (cubic <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> ton <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> are higher {{in the second and third}} air rests as the grain metabolic activity is higher.

50|$|The IMAX cinema process {{increases}} the image resolution by using larger film frame; in relative terms, {{a frame of}} IMAX format film has three times the theoretical horizontal resolution of a frame of 35mm film. To achieve such increased image resolution, which IMAX estimates at approximately 12,000 lines of horizontal resolution (12K), 65mm film stock passes horizontally through the IMAX movie camera, 15 perforations at a time. At 24 frames per second, {{this means that the}} film moves through the camera at 102.7 <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (just over 6 km/h). In a conventional 65mm camera, the film passes vertically through the camera, five perforations at a time, or 34 <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> In comparison, in a conventional 35mm camera, 35mm film passes vertically through the camera, at four (smaller) perforations at a time, which translates to 27.4 <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
50|$|The initial design {{called for}} an {{autonomous}} device equipped with a drill head that would be rotated by expanding gases generated by a propellant burning inside a combustion chamber, {{in a manner similar}} to a Segner wheel. As the hot gases escaped the slits in the drill head at high speeds, they would break down the ground in front of the device. Experiments have shown the device could achieve drilling speed of 5 <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> through solid rock and up to 100 <b>metres</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> in soil.|$|E

5000|$|The volume (expressed in {{cubic feet}} per minute or cubic meters per second) of air {{required}} to ventilate an underground mine is determined by mining engineers based {{on a wide variety}} of parameters.

50|$|The {{technique}} involves simply ascending at {{a controlled}} pace, typically about 18 <b>metres</b> (60 feet) <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> while exhaling slowly. As the diver ascends, {{the air in}} the lungs expands as surrounding water pressure decreases. Exhaling allows excess volume to escape from the lungs, and by exhaling at a suitable rate the diver can continue exhaling throughout the ascent and still have air in his or her lungs at the surface. If the diver fails to exhale during the ascent, lung over expansion injury is likely to occur. If exhalation is limited to relaxing and allowing the expanding gas to escape without effort, there should not be a feeling of running out of breath, as the air inhaled at depth expands during the ascent and the lung volume should remain nearly constant.|$|R
