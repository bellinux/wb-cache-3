40|$|Artificial, {{anisotropic}} fibre phantoms are nowadays {{increasingly used}} {{in the field of}} diffusion-weighted MRI. Such phantoms represent useful tools for, among others, the calibration of pulse sequences and validation of diffusion models since they can mimic well-known structural features of brain tissue on the one hand, but exhibit a reduced complexity, on the other. Among all materials, polyethylene fibres have been widely used due to their excellent properties regarding the restriction of water diffusion and surface relaxation properties. Yet the magnetic susceptibility of polyethylene can be distinctly lower than that of distilled water. This difference produces strong microscopic, background field gradients in the vicinity of fibre bundles which are not parallel to the static magnetic field.
