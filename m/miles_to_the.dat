5|$|The site {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from Luscombe in the parish of Rattery in Devon, about 16 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-west, {{the seat of the}} Luscombe family from before the 16th century to shortly before 1810.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the legendary}} account, the army camped at St Abb's Head {{for several days}} before sailing north, landing at Lunan Bay in Angus. After sacking Montrose, the Army headed inland and razed the town of Brechin to the ground. Camus {{received}} word that King Malcolm II had brought the Scots army to Dundee and ordered the Danish army to march South, reaching the coast near to Panbride. The Scots army set camp at Barry, two <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West.|$|E

25|$|A <b>mile</b> (1.6km) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, in the {{neighbouring}} parish of Heath, is a notable historic chapel. A <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north is Broncroft Castle, a medieval fortified manor house, extensively renovated in the 19th century. A <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, on <b>the</b> lane <b>to</b> Diddlebury, is <b>the</b> hamlet of Peaton, with Peatonstrand roughly half-way.|$|R
50|$|A {{quarter of}} a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south lies Finavon Castle.|$|R
5|$|Although Carmarthenshire is less frequented as {{a tourist}} {{destination}} than some other counties in Wales, it offers {{a wide range of}} outdoor activities. Much of the coast is fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of Burry Port and Pembrey. Further west are the sandy beaches at Llansteffan and Pendine, and Dylan Thomas' boathouse at Laugharne. Further inland {{there are a number of}} medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In November 1849, {{the young}} and {{recently}} ordained priest Albert Lacombe arrived in Pembina and immediately started to learn the Chippewa language. Despite claiming to {{have to resort to}} manual labour to pay for his food, Belcourt supported a household that included a school teacher, a housekeeper, a Chippewa cook and several servants. Thirty <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, he established a mission at Turtle Mountain to serve as a base for expansion toward the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
50|$|Fort Belmont, in {{southern}} Woodson County, Kansas, was built about 1860 {{near the town}} of Belmont. It was <b>to</b> protect <b>the</b> settlers there from attacks by Border Ruffians and Indians. The fort consisted of three or four officer cabins, a redoubt {{about a quarter of a}} <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and a parade ground a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|R
50|$|Bartinney Castle is an Iron Age Enclosure 1 <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|R
50|$|Denby Bottles is half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Denby Village.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the light pollution from Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth did {{not survive}} the English {{invasion}} for long, for he was defeated and mortally wounded or killed by the future Malcolm III ("King Malcolm Ceann-mor", son of Duncan I) {{on the north side}} of the Mounth in 1057, after retreating with his men over the Cairnamounth Pass to take his last stand at the battle at Lumphanan. The Prophecy of Berchán has it that he was wounded and died at Scone, sixty <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, some days later. Macbeth's stepson Lulach was installed as king soon after.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gerhard Schöpfel, leading III./JG 26 and Bf 109s from JG 3, 40 in total, {{were already}} {{crossing}} the Dover straits {{to sweep the}} skies clear of the main raid. Some 25 miles behind him were the 27 Do 17s of I. and III./KG 76 escorted by 20 Bf 110s that were to strike Kenley. Close by the Dorniers were the Ju 88s of III./KG 76 escorted by Bf 109s from JG 51. This formation should have been 15 miles in front. Some 15 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear of the Ju88s, KG 1's He 111s were bound for Biggin Hill, escorted by 40 Bf 109s from JG 54. The formations were moving at around three miles per minute, at 12,000 feet. Around 50 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-west, the nine Do 17s of 9 Staffel were at wave-top height, halfway between Dieppe, Seine-Maritime and Beachy Head, intent on sneaking under British radar beams unobserved. Altogether, the raiding force contained 108 bombers and 150 fighters.|$|E

5|$|On {{the weekend}} of August17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which it took some drivers two hours {{to get to the}} Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the heavy traffic on Route17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's death in Kiryas Joel, a few <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. A traffic light that had been {{malfunctioning}} after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E
5|$|Several long trails {{pass through}} the Morrison Creek area {{on the south side}} of the mountain. The Snipes Mountain Trail #11 follows the eastern edge of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed from the lower end for 6 <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Round the Mountain Trail. The Cold Springs Trail #72 follows the western edge for 4 miles. Other trails in the area include the Gotchen Trail #40, Morrison Creek Trail #39, and Pineway Trail #71.|$|E
5|$|South Stoneham House was acquired, with South Hill (some two <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest), in 1920 {{to house}} male {{students}} at University College Southampton. The salmon pool at South Stoneham was retained by the Montagu family, {{becoming part of}} the Townhill Park estate. Tradition prevailed in the house, with a collegiate atmosphere as gowns were expected to be worn to dinner and lectures and curfews were enforced.|$|E
50|$|A {{little over}} a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{south-east}} are the remains of Danby Castle.|$|R
50|$|Half a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west is the {{overgrown}} motte of Great Ashfield Castle.|$|R
50|$|The Daqin Pagoda {{is located}} {{less than one}} <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Louguantai.|$|R
5|$|The {{mouth of}} the river {{has not always been}} at Littlehampton. Until the later fifteenth century it joined the River Adur at Lancing some ten <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east before {{entering}} the sea. This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward drift of the tides, pushing the Adur towards Shoreham-by-Sea, while the Arun broke out at Worthing, Goring and Ferring at various times, until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530.|$|E
5|$|The {{shortest}} lived {{storm of}} the season, Tropical Storm Nine, formed south of Mexico on September26. The system attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) during its existence. Later that day, {{the center of}} the storm relocated several dozen <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. Shortly thereafter, the storm dissipated on September27 over open waters.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 17. It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the Yucatán Peninsula. The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29.|$|E
50|$|Matthewstown Passage Tomb, {{constructed}} 2500-2000 BC, lies a <b>mile</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{north of}} Fenor.|$|R

5|$|A {{year after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, with the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, on August 30, 1862, rumors of an impending Confederate attack on Cincinnati began to circulate. Richmond was one hundred <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of Cincinnati, and no organized Union troops lay between the two cities. An attack by Confederate Colonel John Hunt Morgan, who had led his cavalry on a raid behind Union lines in Kentucky the previous month, was also feared. On September 2, the men of Cincinnati were organized into work units to build fortifications around the city.|$|E
5|$|A young {{officer in}} the 4th Dragoons, Lieutenant William Light who later served on Graham's staff and was a great admirer of the general, {{subsequently}} became the Surveyor General of South Australia in the 1830s. Light decided to name one of the valleys in the new colony Barossa Valley (now a famous wine making region) {{in memory of the}} victory, albeit misspelled due to a clerical error. It is often incorrectly stated that Light fought at the Battle of Barrosa but he was actually hundreds of <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, his diary of 6 March 1811 recording he was with Wellington's cavalry travelling through Santarem to Pernes.|$|E
5|$|At 2045 hrs, {{another person}} on {{duty in the}} control tower {{received}} a call to track the mysterious craft on radar. For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons storage area, when it suddenly vanished, {{as though it had}} landed or dropped below the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. Messages were sent to the National Military Command Center, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued to remain on a high state of alert until the following morning, as efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.|$|E
