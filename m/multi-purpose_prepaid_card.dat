40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that the use of <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> is growing in the United States. The study of how <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> fit into the existing payments market requires accurate data about the adoption of <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> among consumers. This paper describes several experiments conducted by the Consumer Payments Research Center that compare the efficacy of various question forms regarding reported adoption rates. A primary focus is on the effect of "disaggregation" or asking about adoption of a number of <b>prepaid</b> <b>card</b> categories sequentially rather than asking about adoption of <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> as a whole. We find strong evidence that increases in the number of categories yield higher adoption rates.

50|$|In July 2013, the Association of Government Accountants {{released}} a report on government use of <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards,</b> concluding that such programs offer a number of advantages to governments and those who receive payments on a <b>prepaid</b> <b>card</b> rather than by check. The <b>prepaid</b> <b>card</b> programs benefit payments largely for cost savings they offer and provide easier access to cash for recipients, as well as increased security. The report also advises that governments should consider replacing any remaining cheque-based payments with <b>prepaid</b> <b>card</b> programs in order to realize substantial savings for taxpayers, as well as benefits for payees.|$|R

These <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> were replaced by the Ayuca smart cards, which first went on sale on December 1, 2006. Like the <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards,</b> these smart cards replaced cash and gave bonuses to riders when they recharged their cards. Both systems were used simultaneously for four months until the <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> were stopped.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the fastest}} growing sectors of the {{consumer}} payments marketplace is the general-purpose reloadable <b>prepaid</b> <b>card</b> sector. Their importance accelerated as a consequence of new regulations enacted {{in the wake of the}} 2008 financial crisis. This increased use of <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> also increased angst among regulators, especially regarding the number and size of fees on <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards.</b> State and federal regulators as well as Congress are interested in imposing new regulations on <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards.</b> These calls for regulation, however, proceed in a largely fact-free environment. This Article describes the current economic and regulatory landscape for <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards.</b> The market appears robustly competitiveâ€”in recent years, costs declined, functionality increased, and major players such as American Express and several large banks entered the market. In addition, traditional consumer protection concerns appear to be largely absent, as there is no evidence that consumers systematically err in the cards that they choose. Absent a demonstrable competitive market failure or systematic consumer abuse, prescriptive regulation of the terms and substance of <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> would likely have unintended consequences that would exceed benefits to consumers. On the other hand, there are some regulations that, if enacted, could promote competition and consumer welfare in this rapidly evolving market...|$|R

The benefits that open-system <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> offer for consumers, providers, and issuing banks contribute to the increased adoption of these payment applications. Using these cards, consumers can pay bills, make purchases, and get cash from ATM networks. At the same time, consumers who hold <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards</b> need not secure a traditional banking relationship nor gain approval for a deposit account or revolving credit. By offering <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards,</b> issuing banks may meet the financial needs of consumers who may not otherwise qualify for more traditional banking products and these banks may do so with a card-based electronic payment application that essentially eliminates credit risk for the bank.

40|$|<b>Prepaid</b> <b>cards,</b> also {{commonly}} referred to as stored-value cards, are typically credit card-sized pieces of plastic that contain or represent an amount of pre-loaded value. They include a wide range of payment products, such as gift cards, payroll cards, teen cards, and travel cards. Despite significant product innovations, it is unclear whether and how existing federal and state laws that apply to other financial products (e. g., checks, credit cards, deposit accounts) apply to the different varieties of <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards.</b> Overall, the law in this area is very much unsettled.
