5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow {{is treated}} as a species of least concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , estimated population of 2.4million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed {{and those that do}} produce fewer offspring. Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number. The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct, and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s. Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region. Additionally, the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide warfarin, though <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine the effects of pesticides on the rufous-crowned sparrow.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> evaluate {{the long-term effects of}} treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.|$|E
25|$|If the {{phytoplankton}} {{is consumed}} by other {{components of the}} pelagic ecosystem, most of the carbon remains in the upper strata. There is speculation that this process {{is one of the}} largest biofeedback mechanisms of the planet, maybe the most sizable of all, driven by a gigantic biomass. Still <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> quantify the Southern Ocean ecosystem.|$|E

25|$|Carbetocin {{compared}} with oxytocin produced {{a reduction in}} women who needed uterine massage and further uterotonic drugs for women having caesarean sections. There {{was no difference in}} rates of PPH in women having caesarean sections or women having vaginal deliveries when given carbetocin. Carbetocin appears to cause less adverse effects. <b>More</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> find the cost effectiveness of using carbetocin.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{variation}} among speakers concerning how tone {{is realized}} phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken {{in the major}} geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, {{there seems to be}} variation among individuals. <b>More</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.|$|E
25|$|Nipple {{stimulation}} and breastfeeding {{triggers the}} release of natural oxytocin in the body, therefore {{it is thought that}} encouraging the baby to suckle soon after birth may reduce the risk of PPH for the mother. A review looking into this did not find enough good research to say whether or not nipple stimulation did reduce PPH. <b>More</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> answer this question.|$|E

25|$|Benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, are {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} treatment of mania or acute psychosis-induced aggression. In this context, benzodiazepines are given either alone, or in combination with other first-line drugs such as lithium, haloperidol or risperidone. The effectiveness of taking benzodiazepines along with antipsychotic drugs is unknown, and <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine if benzodiazepines are more effective than antipsychotic drugs when urgent sedation is required.|$|E
25|$|Nanotechnology {{may also}} help in the {{transfer}} of drugs across the BBB. Recently, researchers {{have been trying to}} build liposomes loaded with nanoparticles to gain access through the BBB. <b>More</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine which strategies will be most effective and how they can be improved for patients with brain tumors. The potential for using BBB opening to target specific agents to brain tumors has just begun to be explored.|$|E
25|$|The same {{impairment}} in prospective memory is also seen {{in patients with}} lesions to the hippocampus. Damage to the left hippocampus has shown to have a worse effect on prospective memory than damage to the right hippocampus. While the hippocampus as a whole {{may be involved in}} prospective memory, the left side plays more of a dominant role. This shows the complexity of the brain and <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> further understand the role of each section.|$|E

25|$|Infection or {{inflammation}} of the prostate (prostatitis) may increase the chance for prostate cancer while another study shows infection may help prevent prostate cancer by increasing blood to the area. In particular, infection with the sexually transmitted infections chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis seems to increase risk. Finally, obesity and elevated blood levels of testosterone may increase the risk for prostate cancer. There is an association between vasectomy and prostate cancer; however, <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine {{if this is a}} causative relationship.|$|E
25|$|This path {{results in}} the {{accumulation}} of sulfatide in renal cancer cell lines. Additionally, sulfatide can accumulate {{on the surface of}} cancer cells. This indicates that sulfatide may serve as a specific ligand for P-selectin. This would contribute to increased metastasis of the cancer. However, <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> elucidate the relationship between the elevated levels of sulfatide expression and the initiation and metastasis mechanisms of cancer, but sulfatide may be a useful serum biomarker for early tumor detection.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{article in}} the American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care criticised the Liverpool Pathway for its {{traditional}} approach and not taking an explicit position on the artificial hydration for critically ill patients. A 2009 editorial in the Journal of Clinical Nursing welcomed the impetus towards providing improved care {{at the end of}} life and the more widespread use of integrated care pathways, but warned that much <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> assess which of the several approaches that are in use is most effective.|$|E

25|$|Giving {{oxytocin}} in {{a solution}} of saline into the umbilical vein is a method of administering the drugs directly to the placental bed and uterus. However quality of evidence around this technique is poor {{and it is not}} recommended for routine use in the management of the third stage. <b>More</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> ascertain whether this is an effective way of administering uterotonic drugs. As a way of treating a retained placenta, this method is not harmful but has not been shown to be effective.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects are {{flushing}} (e.g., warmth, redness, itching or tingling), headache, pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, pruritus and rash. These can be minimized by initiating therapy at low dosages, increasing dosage gradually, and avoiding administration {{on an empty}} stomach. High doses of niacin often temporarily reduce blood pressure {{as a result of}} acute vasodilation. In the longer term, high-dose niacin use may persistently lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, but <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine the extent of this effect.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{long-term}} copper treatment (oral {{intake of}} 8mg copper (Cu-(II)-orotate-dihydrate)) was excluded as {{a risk factor}} for Alzheimer's disease in a noted clinical trial on humans and a potentially beneficial role of copper in Alzheimer's disease has been demonstrated on cerebral spinal fluid levels of AÎ²42, a toxic peptide and biomarker of the disease. <b>More</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> understand metal homeostasis disturbances in Alzheimer's disease patients and how to address these disturbances therapeutically. Since this experiment used Cu-(II)-orotate-dihydrate, it does not relate to the effects of cupric oxide in supplements.|$|E

25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that children and adolescents are sometimes given antipsychotic drugs as a first-line treatment for mental health problems or behavioral issues other than a psychotic disorder, {{which is not the}} ideal treatment approach for these drugs. In the United States, the usage of these drugs in young people has greatly increased since 2000, especially among children from low-income families. <b>More</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> specifically assess the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic medications in pediatric populations. Because of the risk of weight gain, metabolic side effects, and cardiovascular changes with antipsychotic use, the use of the drugs in pediatric populations is highly scrutinized.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{speculate that}} abnormalities or {{deficiencies in the}} receptors for certain neurotransmitters may contribute to some forms of myoclonus. Receptors {{that appear to be}} related to myoclonus include those for two important inhibitory neurotransmitters: serotonin, which constricts blood vessels and brings on sleep, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps the brain maintain muscle control. Other receptors with links to myoclonus include those for benzodiazepines, drugs that induce sleep, and for glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is important for the control of motor and sensory functions in the spinal cord. <b>More</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine how these receptor abnormalities cause or contribute to myoclonus.|$|E
25|$|<b>More</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> fully {{elucidate}} the lifecycle, but both larvae and adults {{appear to be}} infective. One recent case reported finding adult worms in the duodenum, {{which is the first}} presentation of adult worms not in the upper respiratory region. The adult worms might have been coughed up and reswallowed before settling in the duodenum. The development from larvae to adults is about three weeks, but the existence of a larval pulmonary cycle is uncertain. Intermediate hosts, although not fully known, may be earthworms (an intermediate host for the genus Syngamus), snails, or arthropods. Other than intermediate hosts, no mention of other biological or mechanical vectors has been made.|$|E
