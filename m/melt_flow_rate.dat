The MVR of the polypropylene composites filled with diatomite particles was measured {{by means of a}} MVR instrument to investigate the effects of the filler content, particle size and extrusion conditions (temperature 210 – 2308 C, load 5. 0 – 12. 5 kg) on the <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> properties of the composite systems. The results showed that the MVR of the composites increased as a quadratic function with the increase of load, while decreased nonlinearly with the increase of filler particle diameter. The MVR was a linear function of temperature. The MVR decreased quickly when the filler volume fraction (f) was 55 %, and then reduced slightly with an increase of f. In addition, the <b>melt</b> shear <b>flow</b> obeyed roughly power law under the experimental conditions, and the influence of particle size on the temperature sensitivity of the melt shear viscosity is insignificant at low filler concentration.

50|$|During {{spraying}} it {{is essential}} to maintain a constant top surface temperature and hence maintain steady-state conditions if a billet with consistent microstructure is to be produced. At the billet surface, during spraying an enthalpy balance must be maintained where the rate of enthalpy lost (Hout) from the billet by conduction to the atomising gas and through the substrate, convection and radiation must be balanced with the rate of enthalpy input (Hin) from the droplets in the spray. There are a variety of factors that can be adjusted in order to maintain these conditions: spray height, atomiser gas pressure, <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> melt superheat and atomiser configuration, being those parameters most readily adjusted. Typically equipment such as closed circuit cameras and optical pyrometry can be used to monitor billet size/position and top surface temperature. If Hout is much greater Hin then a steady temperature is maintained at the billet top surface. The top surface should be in a mushy condition in order to promote sticking of incoming droplets and partial re-melting of solid particles. The necessary partial re-melting of solid droplets explains the absence of dendritic remnants from pre-solidified droplets in the final microstructure. If Hin is insufficient to cause significant re-melting, a ‘splat’ microstructure of layered droplets will form, typical of thermal spray processes such as vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), arc spraying and high velocity oxy-fuel. Processing maps have been produced for plasma spraying and spray forming using a steady-state heat balance in terms of the interlayer time (time between deposition events) against average deposition rate per unit area. These maps show the boundaries between banded un-fused microstructure and an equiaxed homogeneous structure.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: The investigated samples were obtained during the industrial injection moulding. There were determined the sample mechanical properties (by a tensile test), <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> temperatures of phase transitions (by differential scanning calorimetry, DSC), temperatures of thermal degradation (by thermogravimetric analysis, TGA), as well as storage modulus and damping coefficient (both by dynamic mechanical analysis, DMA).

The <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> increased along with the number of injection mouldings. The glass transition temperatures (from DSC) of butadiene and acrylonitrile styrene fractions don’t vary with the number of injection mouldings and are ca. 61 and + 104 ºC, respectively.
