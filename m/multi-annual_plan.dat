40|$|The {{advent of}} public management, {{a focus on}} {{outcomes}} and results, {{has led to the}} adoption of strategic management practices in public organizations and academic interest therein (Ferlie and Ongaro 2015, Poister, Pitts, and Edwards 2010). Strategic management in public organizations encompasses strategy formulation (i. e. the process of strategy making), strategy content (i. e. the stance and actions resulting from strategy making) and strategy implementation (i. e. the follow-up and evaluation of selected strategies and actions) (Bryson, Berry, and Yang 2010, Boyne and Walker 2004). In order to connect strategy formulation and implementation, public organizations can use strategic management tools such as strategic planning to define strategic goals (SG) and action plans (AP), and performance measurement (PM) to define performance indicators (PI) linked to these SG and AP, and set targets for these indicators (Poister 2010). 	Underlying strategic management’s popularity among public administration scholars is the assumption that strategic management is linked to public service performance (PSP) (Boyne and Walker 2010). Legislative initiatives in some jurisdictions have imposed strategic management tools upon governments –e. g. Government Performance and Results Act in the United States, Best Value in England and Wales, and the Policy and Management Cycle in Flanders, Belgium. The implementation of these practices suggests that policymakers believe these tools will “work” in a public-sector setting. There are, however, critical voices about the use of strategic management tools in public sector settings. For example, Bovaird (2008) strongly challenges the effectiveness of planning-based tools in public organizations arguing that more emergent types of strategy making are necessary for the complex, adaptive nature of the public sector. 	Empirical evidence from large-n quantitative studies examining the strategic management-PSP relationship is limited. Given the concerns about the value of strategic management tools in public organizations, and in particular concerns associated with strategic planning and performance measurement, richer empirical evidence is essential to more clearly understand the relationship between these tools and PSP (George and Desmidt, 2014). Such evidence can help to address the contradiction where, on the one hand, strategic management tools are being adopted by public organizations worldwide and, on the other hand, we do not fully know whether these tools actually deliver on their promises, and rebuff critiques. 	This study addresses this contradiction by positing that while SG and AP (i. e. core elements of strategic planning) and PI and targets (i. e. core elements of performance measurement) are associated with PSP the relationship is not linear. Building from propositions developed by Boyne (2010) for PI and targets we hypothesize that this association is concave and curvilinear –indicating that, initially, a positive association exists but this association becomes negative when too many SG, AP, PI and targets are put in place. This hypothesis is tested by drawing on data from 308 Flemish municipalities. In Flanders (i. e. the northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), municipalities have been obliged by the Flemish Government to formulate a <b>multi-annual</b> <b>plan</b> including SG and AP for the 5 -year policy cycle 2014 - 2019 with PI and targets tied to these SG and AP. One of the key rationales underlying this obligation, is the Flemish Government’s expectation that this system will improve the financial performance of municipalities and, specifically, their “Self-Financing Margin”, a measure that evaluates the long term financial stability of a municipality. To address this, data for the independent variables are gathered by analyzing the <b>multi-annual</b> <b>plan</b> of each Flemish municipality and data for the dependent variable are gathered by identifying the Self-Financing Margin in the annual account of each municipality. Due to our hypotheses and data both a linear and nonlinear model are tested using OLS regression analysis. 	Preliminary multivariate statistical results show that strategic goals and performance indicators –two central elements of strategic planning and performance measurement– have a concave curvilinear relationship with PSP, implying an initial positive association which becomes negative when too many strategic goals and performance indicators are formulated. This finding ties in with the essence of effective strategic management tools, namely to provide focus and make fundamental choices on the organization’s course. The contributions of this study to public administration theory and practice are threefold. First, we address the calls for more large-n quantitative evidence by investigating the relation between strategic planning, performance measurement and PSP in all 308 Flemish municipalities. Second, by hypothesizing and testing for nonlinear relations between strategic planning, performance measurement and PSP, we theoretically and empirically extend previous research by incorporating a core assumption underlying strategic management theory into public management theory; namely that successful strategic management tools should offer focus and prioritization in order to avoid “muddling through” –an abundance of tools could thus be counterproductive (Porter 1996). Third, our paper is relevant to policymakers because it tests a core assumption underlying many NPM reforms, that strategic management tools enhance the PSP of public organizations (George and Desmidt 2014, Jimenez 2013) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} that endogenously determines catchability {{functions that}} link fishing mortality with contemporaneous stock abundance is presented. We consider a stochastic age-structured {{model for a}} fishery composed {{by a number of}} fishing units (fleets, vessels or métiers) that optimally select the level of fishing effort to be applied considering total mortalities as given. The introduction of a balance constrain which guarantees that total mortality is equal to the sum of individual fishing mortalities optimally selected, enables total fishing mortality to be determined as a combination of contemporaneous abundance and stochastic processes affecting the fishery. In this way, future abundance can be projected as a dynamic system that depends on contemporaneous abundance. The model is generic and can be applied to several issues of fisheries management. In particular, we illustrate how to apply the methodology to assess the floating band target management regime for controlling fishing mortalities which is inspired in the new <b>multi-annual</b> <b>plans.</b> Our results support this management regime for the Mediterranean demersal fishery in Northern Spain.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the value {{attributed}} to given working competences, by Portuguese handball coaches according to their coaching background, certification level, coaching experience, and level of education. A sample of 207 handball coaches responded to a questionnaire which included demographic characteristics and a scale focused on perceptions of the level of importance attributed to working competences. Data analysis included an exploratory factorial analysis applying Maximum Likelihood Factoring (MLF) and Oblimin rotation. These factors were submitted to a One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons to analyse coaches' perceptions according to their coaching background. A six factor solution was found where three major domains of competences were highlighted; the first one related to training and competition (e. g. planning and conducting the training, team administration in competition, annual and <b>multi-annual</b> <b>planning,</b> and coaching methodology); the second one related to social and cultural issues and management (e. g. implementation of youth sport development projects, team leadership and coach education) and the third one related to the cognitive background (meta-cognitive competences). The importance ascribed to some working competences was influenced by their coaching experience and certification level. Highly experienced and qualified coaches perceived competences of everyday practice, social, cultural and management issues related to training and competition as more important than the other coaches. This study suggests the need to consider some working competences, until now not explicitly present in the Portuguese coaching education curriculum which could enable coaches to choose the best way to practice/work in a manner that will foster and support their professional development...|$|R

We develop an approach that rely on exact mathematical optimization tools in the aim of gradually lifting those limitations. Our model makes use of column and row generation techniques. It considers a wider search space and allows to satisfy the demand at an infra-daily time step. The use of Benders decomposition (via a row generation algorithm) enables us to test robustness over several demand scenarios. Our model can be extended to account for "smooth" fluctuations in nuclear power plant availability...|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction] The first EU {{budget was}} drafted in 1988 under the {{so-called}} “Delors Package I. ” Its budgetary headings and monetary distribution have remained unchanged until 14 th July 2004, when the Commission adjusted its traditional model {{to a new}} system of headings to adapt the budget to an evolutionary economical environment. The budget of the European Union distinguishes itself from other international bodies by its exclusive system of the so-called “own resources. ” This system is composed of the revenues obtained by (1) the Common Customs duties collected under the external tariff; (2) the levies in imported agricultural products; (3) the Value Added Tax revenue; and (4) the Gross National Income based resources. The EU budget sets out and authorizes the total amount of revenues and expenditures annually deemed necessary by the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. However, the EU budget is a seven-year <b>multi-annual</b> spending <b>plan</b> articulated around a ¨financial framework¨ that ensures the control of the evolution of the budget expenditure. The budget is drafted and implemented under the ¨Financial Programming and Budget¨ Directorate General and is supervised by the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors. The EU budget not only rests on the three basic accounting principles: unity, annuality and balance, which guarantee its economic efficiency, but also on the composition of its revenues, the so-called “own resources. ...|$|R
40|$|The Eastern Baltic cod {{stock was}} until {{recently}} below {{safe biological limits}} and suffered from high fishing pressure. In most recent years, fishing mortality substantially declined and spawner biomass more than tripled. Similar developments have not been observed for any other depleted cod stock in the North Atlantic {{during the last few}} decades. This paper investigates relative impacts of changes in different ecological and management-related drivers, which could have contributed to the rapid recovery of the Eastern Baltic cod. The results show that the success to reduce fishing mortality below management target in 2008 was due to a combination of increased recruitment and improved compliance with TAC. The reversal of the negative trend in biomass and rebuilding of the stock to the present level were largely driven by increased recruitment. Harvest control rules of the <b>multi-annual</b> management <b>plan</b> for setting TACs currently maintain the fishing mortality at a low level, which allows the stock to accumulate biomass and further accelerate its recovery. Relatively strong incoming year-classes and recently better control over removals distinguish the Eastern Baltic cod from other depleted European cod stocks, which have not shown similar positive trends in recent years. Sound management measures and compliance to those as well as favourable biological conditions are required for a successful stock recovery.
