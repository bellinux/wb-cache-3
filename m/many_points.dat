50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Point</b> Scout Reservation {{was founded}} in 1946 by Wint Hartman, the first camping {{director}} for the reservation, and Boots Hanson, the first camp ranger. Wint's initial idea for the camp was that Scouts would come with their troops and be guided by principles such as leave no trace. This was a new idea for the BSA, as up until this time Scouts went to camp by themselves, and camps were much more para-military. <b>Many</b> <b>Point</b> Scout Camp was the first BSA camp to accommodate troops instead of just individual Scouts.|$|R

5|$|Subdivision {{surfaces}} in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although <b>many</b> <b>points</b> get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E

5|$|The Reformation {{spread to}} other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several cantons resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an {{alliance}} of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on <b>many</b> <b>points</b> of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry with}} Liverpool {{is rooted in}} {{competition}} between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port.

5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were <b>many</b> <b>points</b> on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E

50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1946-1947, Boots Hanson lived alone on land {{purchased}} from the <b>Many</b> <b>Point</b> Gun and Rod club, what is today the Buckskin sub-camp. He spent the winter readying the land for Scouts. In the spring, when Wint Hartman drove up from the cities wondering if camp would be ready, he saw a red lantern hanging in Hanson's window, a sign that camp was ready. To this day, a red lantern {{is one of the}} symbols for <b>Many</b> <b>Point.</b> During the summer, lit red lanterns are hung outside of each sub-camp's lodge, as a sign that the camp is there for the Scouts. In the winter, red lanterns are placed in the windows of the rangers' homes.|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} involving Wooten, Barbey, Edmund Herring (Wooten's superior as commander of I Corps), Colonel Merian C. Cooper from the Fifth Air Force, and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt from the RAAF, reached agreement, or at least compromise, on <b>many</b> <b>points.</b> Wooten wanted at least 10 days' reserve rations. This meant that some stores {{would have to be}} transported in bulk, and not pre-loaded on trucks as Barbey initially wanted. Loading the stores onto trucks was an inefficient use of shipping space, but permitted quick unloading of the LSTs, as the trucks could simply be driven off. The 9th Division did not have sufficient trucks for this, but 200 trucks earmarked for the US Advanced Base at Lae were borrowed from USASOS. Barbey would not allow loaded vehicles on the tank decks of the LSTs, as this was a fire hazard, so bulk stores were carried there instead.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the army}} {{boundary}} on the right, the ROK 1st Division continued its attack northwest and {{advanced to the}} edge of Ka-san. The ROK 11th Regiment seized Hill 755 about dark on September 14, and small elements of the ROK 15th Regiment reached the stone ramparts of the Ka-san area at the same time. The ROK and North Korean troops fought during the night and on into the 15th at <b>many</b> <b>points</b> along the high mountain backbone that extends southeast from Ka-san to Hills 755 and 783 and on to P'algong-san. Prisoners taken by the ROK's estimated that there were about 800 North Koreans on this high ridge. The ROK 1st Division later estimated that approximately 3,000 North Koreans were inside Ka-san's walled perimeter and about 1,500 or 2,000 outside it near the crest. At this time the bulk of the NK 1st Division was gradually withdrawing into Ka-san and its vicinity. Indications were that the NK 13th Division also was withdrawing northward. Aerial observers on the afternoon of September 14 reported that an estimated 500 North Korean troops were moving north from Tabu-dong. While these signs were hopeful, Walker continued to prepare for a final close-in defense of Taegu. As part of this, fourteen battalions of South Korean police dug in around the city.|$|E
