40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the serum zinc levels in {{patients}} with common oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases</b> by comparing these to healthy controls. Material and Methods: A total of 368 patients, which consisted of 156 recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) patients, 57 oral lichen planus (OLP) patients, 55 burning mouth syndrome (BMS) patients, 54 atrophic glossitis (AG) patients, 46 xerostomia patients, and 115 sex-and age-matched healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. Serum zinc levels were measured in all participants. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA, t-test, and Chi-square test. Results: The mean serum zinc level in the healthy control group was significantly higher than the levels of all other groups (p < 0. 001). No individual in the healthy control group had a serum zinc level less than the minimum normal value. However, up to 24. 7 % (13 / 54) of patients with AG presented with zinc deficiency, while 21. 2 % (33 / 156) of patients with RAS, 16. 4 % (9 / 55) of patients with BMS, 15. 2 % (7 / 46) of patients with xerostomia, and 14. 0 % (8 / 57) of patients with OLP were zinc deficient. Altogether, the zinc deficiency rate was 19. 02 % (70 / 368) in the oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases</b> (OMD) group (all patients with OMD). The difference between the OMD and healthy control group was significant (p < 0. 001). Gender differences in serum zinc levels were also present, although not statistically significant. Conclusions: Zinc deficiency may be involved in the pathogenesis of common oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases.</b> Zinc supplementation may be a useful treatment for oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases,</b> but this requires further investigation; the optimal serum level of zinc, for the prevention and treatment of oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases,</b> remains to be determined...|$|R

50|$|Leukoplakia {{could be}} {{classified}} as <b>mucosal</b> <b>disease,</b> and also as a premalignant condition. Although the white color in leukoplakia is a result of hyperkeratosis (or acanthosis), similarly appearing white lesions that are caused by reactive keratosis (smoker's keratosis or frictional keratoses e.g. morsicatio buccarum) are not considered to be leukoplakias. Leukoplakia could also be considered according to the affected site, e.g. oral leukoplakia, leukoplakia of the urinary tract, including bladder leukoplakia or leukoplakia of the penis, vulvae, cervix or vagina. Leukoplakia may also occur in the larynx, possibly in association with gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Oropharyngeal leukoplakia is linked to the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and sometimes this is associated with tylosis, which is thickening of the skin on the palms and soles of the feet (see: Leukoplakia with tylosis and esophageal carcinoma). Dyskeratosis congenita may be associated with leukoplakia of the oral mucosa and of the anal mucosa.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the frequency and demographic characteristics of the patients presenting at the department of pediatric dermatology with complaints of mouth and lip lesions and to compare their epidemiological data with the literature in this study. Material and Methods: Of the 3000 children aged between 0 and 16 who presented at the pediatric dermatology outpatients between 2011 January and 2011 December, the children who had been brought with complaints of mouth and lip sores were retrospectively assessed in terms of age, gender, socio-economic level (SEL), medicine use, disease history, systemic disease and presence of genetic disease. Results: Of the pediatric patients brought with mouth complaints, 64 (58 %) were girls and 46 (42 %) were boys. Fifteen different oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases</b> were detected in 110 patients (3. 6 %). The most frequent oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases</b> were RAS (recurrent aphthous stomatitis) (16. 3 %, n= 18), perioral dermatitis (14. 5 %, n= 16), and hand foot mouth disease (13. 6 %, n = 15).

40|$|Aged {{subjects}} display increased {{susceptibility to}} <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases.</b> Retinoic Acid (RA) {{plays a major}} role in inducing tolerance in the mucosa. RA acts on Dendritic cells (DCs) to induce mucosal tolerance. Here we compared the response of DCs from aged and young individuals to RA with a view to understand the role of DCs in age-associated increased susceptibility to <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases.</b> Our investigations revealed that compared to young DCs, RA stimulated DCs from aged subjects are defective in inducing IL- 10 and T regulatory cells. Examinations of the underlying mechanisms indicated that RA exposure led to the upregulation of CD 141 and GARP on DCs which rendered the DCs tolerogenic. CD 141 (hi), GARP(+) DCs displayed enhanced capacity to induce T regulatory cells compared to CD 141 (lo) and GARP(-) DCs. Unlike RA stimulated DCs from young, DCs from aged subjects exhibited diminished upregulation of both CD 141 and GARP. The percentage of DCs expressing CD 141 and GARP on RA treatment was significantly reduced in DCs from aged individuals. Furthermore, the remaining CD 141 (hi), GARP(+) DCs from aged individuals were also deficient in inducing T regs. In summary, reduced response of aged DCs to RA enhances mucosal inflammation in the elderly, increasing their susceptibility to <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim: Dental {{implants}} are {{a reliable}} treatment choice for rehabilitation of healthy patients {{as well as}} subjects with several systemic conditions. Patients with oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases</b> often exhibit oral mucosal fragility and dryness, erosions, blisters, ulcers or microstomia that complicate the use of removable dentures and emphasize the need for dental implants. The aim {{of the current study}} is to review the pertinent literature regarding the dental implantation prospects for patients with oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases.</b> Material and Method: The English literature was searched through PubMed and Google Scholar electronic databases with key words: dental implants, oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases,</b> oral lichen planus (OLP), epidermolysis bullosa (EB), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), cicatricial pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, scleroderma/systemic sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, leukoplakia, oral potentially malignant disorders, oral premalignant lesions, oral cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Results: Literature review revealed dental implantation in patients with OLP (14 articles), EB (11 articles), pemphigus vulgaris (1 article), SS (14 articles), systemic sclerosis (11 articles), systemic lupus erythematosus (3 articles) and oral SCC development associated with leukoplakia (5 articles). No articles regarding dental implants in patients with pemphigoid or leukoplakia without SCC development were identified. Most articles were case-reports, while only a few retrospective, prospective or observational studies were identified. Conclusions: Dental implants represent an acceptable treatment option with a high success rate in patients with chronic mucocutaneous and autoimmune diseases with oral manifestations, such as OLP, SS, EB and systemic sclerosis. Patients with oral possibly malignant disorders should be closely monitored to rule out the development of periimplant malignancy. Further studies with long follow-up, clinical and radiographic dental data are required to predict with accuracy the outcome of dental implants in patients with oral <b>mucosal</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

Following an outbreak of fetal infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus during 1989 - 1990, at least 28 (22 %) of the 128 calves born from this herd of cows in the spring of 1990 were persistently infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus. However, only one calf born from this herd in 1991, and five calves born from all herds in 1992 were persistently infected. Of the five persistently infected calves born in 1992, three were born to persistently infected replacement heifers born in 1990. These heifers calved without assistance in 1992, but only one of their calves survived past three days of age, and it was persistently infected.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding is the severe complication of stress-related <b>mucosal</b> <b>disease</b> in hospitalized patients. In intensive care units (ICU), risk factors are well defined and only mechanical ventilation and coagulopathy {{proved to be}} relevant for significant bleeding. On the contrary, in non-ICU settings {{there is no consensus}} about this issue. Nevertheless, omeprazole is still widely used in prophylaxis of bleeding. The objective of our study was to evaluate the relevance of stress-related <b>mucosal</b> <b>disease</b> bleeding in patients admitted to an internal medicine ward, and the role of omeprazole in its prophylaxis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in which we analysed consecutive patients who were admitted to our ward over a year. We recorded demographic characteristics of the patients, potential risk factors for stress-related <b>mucosal</b> <b>disease</b> (clinical data, laboratory, and medication), administration of prophylactic omeprazole, and total cost of this prophylaxis. Patients with active {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} on the admission were excluded. We recorded every upper gastrointestinal bleeding event with clinical relevance. RESULTS: Five hundred and thirty-five patients, mean age 70 years, mean length of stay 9. 6 +/- 7. 7 days; 140 (26. 2 %) patients were treated with 40 mg of omeprazole intravenously, 193 (36. 1 %) with 20 mg of omeprazole orally, and 202 (37. 8 %) patients had no prophylaxis. There was only one episode (0. 2 %) of clinically relevant bleeding.
