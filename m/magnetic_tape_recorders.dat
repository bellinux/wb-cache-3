Takemitsu had ideas {{similar to that of}} musique concrète, which he was initially unaware of, while Shibata foresaw the development of synthesizers and predicted a drastic change in music. Sony began producing popular <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> for government and public use.|$|E
25|$|Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises {{had seen}} a {{demonstration}} of the German Magnetophon in June 1947—the same device that Jack Mullin had brought back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape, {{at the end of the}} war. It was one of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. Alexander M. Poniatoff ordered his Ampex company, which he'd founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{recording}} {{was demonstrated}} in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a recording head. Engineers at AEG, working with the chemical giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical magnetic tape sound recorder, the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. By 1943 AEG had developed stereo tape recorders. Development of <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the Brush Development Company and its licensee, Ampex; the equally important development of magnetic tape media itself was led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing corporation (now known as 3M).|$|E
50|$|Six of {{the seven}} active {{experiments}} that needed to record data used one or two Experiment Power and Data System (EPDS) modules.

25|$|In {{analogue}} {{audio recording}} a tachometer is {{a device that}} measures the speed of audiotape as it passes across the head. The reel-to-reel format {{was used in the}} very earliest magnetic tape sound recorders, including the pioneering German Magnetophon machines of the 1930s. Originally, this format had no name, since all forms of <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> used it. The name arose only with the need to distinguish it from the several kinds of tape cartridges or cassettes such as the endless loop cartridge, Fidelipac, developed for radio station commercials and spot announcements in 1954, the full size cassette, developed by RCA in 1958 for home use, as well as the compact cassette developed by Philips in 1962, originally for dictation. Reel-to-reel tape was also used in early tape drives for data storage on mainframe computers, video tape recorder (VTR) machines, and high quality analog audio recorders, which have been in use from the early 1940s, up until the present.|$|E
