25|$|Absolute {{accuracy}} is {{the error of}} the measurement compared to a perfect measurement. Relative {{accuracy is}} the error of the measurement compared to the device used to calibrate the <b>multimeter.</b> Most <b>multimeter</b> datasheets provide relative accuracy. To compute the absolute accuracy from the relative accuracy of a <b>multimeter</b> add the absolute accuracy of the device used to calibrate the <b>multimeter</b> to the relative accuracy of the <b>multimeter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The meter {{movement}} in a moving pointer analog <b>multimeter</b> is practically always a moving-coil galvanometer of the d'Arsonval type, using either jeweled pivots or taut bands {{to support the}} moving coil. In a basic analog <b>multimeter</b> the current to deflect the coil and pointer is drawn from the circuit being measured; it is usually an advantage to minimize the current drawn from the circuit, which implies delicate mechanisms. The sensitivity of an analog <b>multimeter</b> is given in units of ohms per volt. For example, a very low cost <b>multimeter</b> with a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt would draw 1milliampere from a circuit at full scale deflection. More expensive, (and mechanically more delicate) multimeters typically have sensitivities of 20,000 ohms per volt and sometimes higher, with 50,000 ohms per volt (drawing 20microamperes at full scale) being about the upper limit for a portable, general purpose, non-amplified analog <b>multimeter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first digital <b>multimeter</b> was {{manufactured}} in 1955 by Non Linear Systems. It is {{claimed that the}} first handheld digital <b>multimeter</b> was developed by Frank Bishop of Intron Electronics in 1977, {{which at the time}} presented a major breakthrough for servicing and fault finding in the field.|$|E
25|$|Digital <b>multimeters</b> {{generally}} {{take measurements}} with accuracy superior to their analog counterparts. Standard analog <b>multimeters</b> measure with typically ±3% accuracy, though instruments of higher accuracy are made. Standard portable digital <b>multimeters</b> are specified {{to have an}} accuracy of typically ±0.5% on the DC voltage ranges. Mainstream bench-top <b>multimeters</b> are available with specified accuracy of better than ±0.01%. Laboratory grade instruments can have accuracies of a few parts per million.|$|R
25|$|<b>Multimeters</b> are {{available}} {{in a wide range}} of features and prices. Cheap <b>multimeters</b> can cost less than US$10, while laboratory-grade models with certified calibration can cost more than US$5,000.|$|R
25|$|Additional scales such as decibels, and {{measurement}} {{functions such as}} capacitance, transistor gain, frequency, duty cycle, display hold, and buzzers which sound when the measured resistance is small have been included on many <b>multimeters.</b> While <b>multimeters</b> may be supplemented by more specialized equipment in a technician's toolkit, some <b>multimeters</b> include additional functions for specialized applications (temperature with a thermocouple probe, inductance, connectivity to a computer, speaking measured value, etc.).|$|R
25|$|Modern {{multimeters}} {{are often}} digital {{due to their}} accuracy, durability and extra features. In a digital <b>multimeter</b> the signal under test is converted to a voltage and an amplifier with electronically controlled gain preconditions the signal. A digital <b>multimeter</b> displays the quantity measured as a number, which eliminates parallax errors.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} of a <b>multimeter</b> {{is the smallest}} part of the scale which can be shown, which is scale dependent. On some digital multimeters it can be configured, with higher resolution measurements taking longer to complete. For example, a <b>multimeter</b> that has a 1mV resolution on a 10V scale can show changes in measurements in 1mV increments.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} of a <b>multimeter</b> is often {{specified in the}} number of decimal digits resolved and displayed. If the most significant digit cannot take all values from 0 to 9 it is generally, and confusingly, termed a fractional digit. For example, a <b>multimeter</b> which can read up to 19999 (plus an embedded decimal point) is said to read 4½ digits.|$|E
50|$|On March 7, 2014, U.S. Customs and Border Protection {{informed}} SparkFun that {{a shipment}} of <b>multimeters</b> meant for sale on SparkFun's website had been seized. The Port of Denver deemed that the yellow protective jackets on the imported <b>multimeters</b> too closely resembled the trade dress of Fluke Corporation's competing <b>multimeters.</b> Rather than pay the cost of shipping the imported <b>multimeters</b> back, SparkFun chose to have them destroyed. In a letter to SparkFun, Fluke announced {{that they would be}} supplying the company with {{a shipment of}} genuine Fluke products and equipment as a gesture of goodwill and support for the maker movement, which SparkFun accepted.|$|R
40|$|The {{programmable}} quantum {{devices are}} described which determines von Neumann measurements on single qubit. The quantum state of program register selects the desired measurement. The phase-covarinat <b>multimeters</b> for large class {{of programs and}} universal <b>multimeters</b> for special choice of program are analyzed. The error-prone devices are used which never make mistake but provide an inconclusive result from time to time. The <b>multimeters</b> are optimized with respect to minimum probability of an inconclusive result for given type of program. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the design and {{subsequent}} development of user applications for communication, control and manipulate with Metrahit <b>multimeters.</b> To realize the application was chosen C # programming language and development environment Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. With the developed software {{will be able to}} connect <b>multimeters</b> to a PC on selected COM port, the connected devices can be set, monitored the measured value and processing these values. In this work, we will find a description of the created application, analysis of individual instances and features of the program. And instructions, how to use individual elements of the application. There is also a short description of the interface which is used for connection between <b>multimeters</b> and PC, and description of <b>multimeters</b> themselves, their properties and uses...|$|R
25|$|An average {{responding}} <b>multimeter</b> will only meet its specified accuracy on AC volts and amps for purely sinusoidal waveforms.|$|E
25|$|Digital instruments, which {{necessarily}} incorporate amplifiers, use {{the same}} principles as analog instruments for resistance readings. For resistance measurements, usually a small constant current is passed through the device under test and the digital <b>multimeter</b> reads the resultant voltage drop; this eliminates the scale compression found in analog meters, but requires a source of precise current. An autoranging digital <b>multimeter</b> can automatically adjust the scaling network so the measurement circuits use the full precision of the A/D converter.|$|E
25|$|A typical <b>multimeter</b> {{will give}} {{incorrect}} results {{when attempting to}} measure the AC current in a non-sinusoidal waveform; the instruments sense the average value of the rectified waveform. The average response is then calibrated to the effective RMS value. An RMS sensing <b>multimeter</b> must be {{used to measure the}} actual RMS currents and voltages (and therefore apparent power). To measure the real power or reactive power, a wattmeter designed to work properly with non-sinusoidal currents must be used.|$|E

40|$|We propose quantum {{devices that}} can realize {{probabilistically}} different projective measurements on a qubit. The desired measurement basis is {{selected by the}} quantum state of a program register. First we analyze the phase-covariant <b>multimeters</b> for a large class of program states, then the universal <b>multimeters</b> for a special choice of program. In both cases we start with deterministic but erroneous devices and then proceed to devices that never make a mistake but {{from time to time}} they give an inconclusive result. These <b>multimeters</b> are optimized (for a given type of a program) with respect to the minimum probability of inconclusive result. This concept is further generalized to the <b>multimeters</b> that minimize the error rate for a given probability of an inconclusive result (or vice versa). Finally, we propose a generalization for qudits. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
2500|$|Meters with {{electronic}} amplifiers (all digital <b>multimeters</b> and some analog meters) have a fixed input impedance that is high {{enough not to}} disturb most circuits. This is often either one or ten megohms; the standardization of the input resistance allows the use of external high-resistance probes which form a voltage divider with the input resistance to extend voltage range up {{to tens of thousands}} of volts. [...] High-end <b>multimeters</b> generally provide an input impedance >10Gigaohms for ranges less than or equal to 10V. [...] Some high-end <b>multimeters</b> provide >10Gigaohms of impedance to ranges greater than 10V.|$|R
25|$|The {{upper end}} of <b>multimeter</b> {{measurement}} ranges varies considerably; measurements over perhaps 600volts, 10amperes, or 100megohms may require a specialized test instrument.|$|E
25|$|A <b>multimeter</b> or a multitester, {{also known}} as a VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter), is an {{electronic}} measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit. A typical <b>multimeter</b> can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Analog multimeters use a microammeter with a moving pointer to display readings. Digital multimeters (DMM, DVOM) have a numeric display, and may also show a graphical bar representing the measured value. Digital multimeters are now far more common due to their cost and precision, but analog multimeters are still preferable in some cases, for example when monitoring a rapidly varying value.|$|E
25|$|As an example, a meter {{movement}} that required 1milliampere for full scale deflection, with an internal resistance of 500ohms, would, on a 10-volt {{range of the}} <b>multimeter,</b> have 9,500ohms of series resistance.|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary <b>multimeters</b> {{can measure}} many quantities. The most common ones are: ...|$|R

25|$|When {{used for}} {{measuring}} voltage, the input impedance of the <b>multimeter</b> {{must be very}} high compared to the impedance of the circuit being measured; otherwise circuit operation may be changed, and the reading will also be inaccurate.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the absence}} of amplification, {{ordinary}} analog <b>multimeter</b> are typically less susceptible to radio frequency interference, and so continue to have a prominent place in some fields even in a world of more accurate and flexible electronic multimeters.|$|E
25|$|Most {{multimeters}} {{include a}} fuse, or two fuses, which will sometimes prevent {{damage to the}} <b>multimeter</b> from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added safety, test leads with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a <b>multimeter</b> is to set the meter to measure resistance or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance voltage source. Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if operator error exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation {{has led to the}} creation of the IEC61010 categories to rate the safety and robustness of meters.|$|E
2500|$|For {{general-purpose}} digital <b>multimeters,</b> {{the lowest}} voltage range is typically several hundred millivolts AC or DC, but the lowest current range may be several hundred microamperes, although instruments with greater current sensitivity are available. <b>Multimeters</b> designed for (mains) [...] "electrical" [...] use instead of general electronics engineering use will typically forego the microamps current ranges.|$|R
2500|$|Various {{sensors can be}} {{attached}} to (or included in) <b>multimeters</b> to take measurements such as: ...|$|R
2500|$|Modern digital <b>multimeters</b> {{may have}} an {{embedded}} computer, which provides a wealth of convenience features. Measurement enhancements available include: ...|$|R
25|$|A <b>multimeter</b> {{can be a}} {{hand-held}} device useful for basic fault finding and field service work, or a bench instrument which can measure to a very high degree of accuracy. They {{can be used to}} troubleshoot electrical problems in a wide array of industrial and household devices such as electronic equipment, motor controls, domestic appliances, power supplies, and wiring systems.|$|E
25|$|A <b>multimeter</b> may be {{implemented}} with a galvanometer meter movement, or less {{often with a}} bargraph or simulated pointer such as an LCD or vacuum fluorescent display. Analog multimeters are common; a quality analog instrument will cost {{about the same as}} a DMM. Analog multimeters have the precision and reading accuracy limitations described above, and so are not built to provide the same accuracy as digital instruments.|$|E
25|$|Auto-ranging, which selects {{the correct}} range for the {{quantity}} under test {{so that the}} most significant digits are shown. For example, a four-digit <b>multimeter</b> would automatically select an appropriate range to display 1.234 instead of 0.012, or overloading. Auto-ranging meters usually include a facility to hold the meter to a particular range, because a measurement that causes frequent range changes can be distracting to the user.|$|E
25|$|High quality analog (analogue) <b>multimeters</b> {{continue}} {{to be made by}} several manufacturers, including Chauvin Arnaux (France), Gossen Metrawatt (Germany), and Simpson and Triplett (USA).|$|R
25|$|To {{avoid the}} loading of the {{measured}} circuit {{by the current}} drawn by the meter movement, some analog <b>multimeters</b> use an amplifier inserted between the measured circuit and the meter movement. While this increases the expense {{and complexity of the}} meter, by use of vacuum tubes or field effect transistors the input resistance can be made very high and independent of the current required to operate the meter movement coil. Such amplified <b>multimeters</b> are called VTVMs (vacuum tube voltmeters), TVMs (transistor volt meters), FET-VOMs, and similar names.|$|R
