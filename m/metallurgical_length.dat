40|$|International audienceThe paper {{focuses on}} two points related to water spray cooling during {{secondary}} cooling. The {{first one is}} the impact in terms of local stress generated along the surface and subsurface of the cast product when passing by each water spray sprinkler. The second point deals with an automatic determination of the water flow rate to be imposed to each sprinkler in view of an increase of the casting speed under the constraint that the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>length</b> should be maintained constant. The 3 D finite element software THERCAST ® is used to address those two questions...|$|E

40|$|The strain-dependence of {{electron}} {{transport in bulk}} Si and deep-submicron MOSFETs is {{investigated by}} full-band Monte Carlo simulation. On the bulk level, the drift velocity at medium field strengths is still enhanced above Ge-contents of 20 % in the substrate, where the low-field mobility is already saturated, while the saturation velocity remains unchanged under strain. In an n-MOSFET with a <b>metallurgical</b> channel <b>length</b> of 50 nm, the saturation drain current is enhanced by up to 11 %, but this maximum improvement is essentially already achieved at a Ge-content of 20 % emphasizing {{the role of the}} low-field mobility as a key indicator of device performance in the deep-submicron regime...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Ultra short channel MOS {{transistors}} {{with high}} permittivity gate dielectrics suffer from carrier quantum confinement in the channel and from electric field fkinging in the dielectric layer. This paper {{deals with the}} 2 D numerical simulation of the coupling between these two physical mechanisms. We shall demonstrate how they impact the threshold parameters in MOS transistors for <b>metallurgical</b> channel <b>lengths</b> ranging from 5 to 50 nanometers. A special {{attention has been paid}} to the control on numerical errors. With the ultimate thinning of gate silicon dioxide layers, tunneling currents are becoming so large that going further in scaling-down requires new dielectric materials. HfOz for instance, increases the dielectric constant by one decade, and solutions are under investigation to get one decade more. These solutions will operat...|$|R
40|$|This work proposes an {{interaction}} between a numerical heat transfer model and an artificial intelligence (AI) heuristic search method which is linked to a Knowledge Base for the continuous casting of quality billets (SAE 1010 steel). A two-dimensional heat transfer model was developed using a finite difference method and was applied to real dimensions of a steel billet continuous easter. The Knowledge Base consists of technological and metallurgical constraints. The heuristic search method, aided by the Knowledge Base, explores the space parameter settings {{in order to find}} optimized cooling conditions which results in defect free biller production with minimum <b>metallurgical</b> <b>length.</b> The use of the developed search method for determining optimum setting of cooling conditions demonstrated that very good results can be attained in assuring billet quality and in the improvement of easter performance.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of the basic indicators of heat transfer in the continuous casting of steel, which can be described as an unsteady process with complicated boundary conditions for the solution. An analytical solution of this problem is practically impossible and, therefore, mathematical modelling is applied with a certain simplification of the real conditions and with a description of those criteria that influence the most the process of solidification and cooling. Using a simulation program and the knowledge of input parameters, it was possible to predict the distribution of the thermal field of a continuously cast blank in the course of its casting. Simulations also allowed us to deal with the issues of the inner structure, surface quality, mechanical properties of a continuously cast blank, <b>metallurgical</b> <b>length,</b> change in the thickness of a strand shell and overheating of steel. Some results obtained with numerical simulations are documented for concrete examples. Web of Science 47681881...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of steels has {{significant influence on}} the actual concasting process, and on the accuracy of its numerical simulation and optimization. The {{chemical composition}} of steel affects the thermophysical properties (heat conductivity, specific heat capacity and density in the solid and liquid states) often requires more time than the actual numerical calculation of the temperature fields of a continuously cast steel billet. Therefore, an analysis study of these thermophysical properties was conducted. The order of importance within the actual process and the accuracy of simulation were also determined. The order of significance of the chemical composition on thermophysical properties was determined {{with respect to the}} <b>metallurgical</b> <b>length.</b> The analysis was performed by means of a so-called calculation experiment, i. e. by means of the original numerical concasting model developed by the authors of this paper.

40|$|The two-step recess gate {{technology}} has been developed for sub- 100 -nm gate InP-based InAlAs/InGaAs high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). This gate structure {{is found to be}} advantageous for the preciseness of the <b>metallurgical</b> gate <b>length</b> as well as a comparable stability to the conventional gate structure with an InP etch stop layer. The two-step recess gate is optimized focusing on the lateral width of the gate recess. Due to the stability of the gate recess with InP surface, a laterally wide gate recess gives the maximum cutoff frequency, lower gate leakage current, smaller output conductance and higher maximum frequency of oscillation. Finally, the uniformity of the device characteristics evaluated for sub- 100 -nm HEMTs with the optimized recess width. The result reveals the significant role of the short channel effects on the device uniformity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review some {{advances}} in High-κ characterization {{by means of}} capacitance measurement in the radio-frequency regime (widely known as RFCV). Firstly, we present a robust methodology for the gate impedance parameter extraction in short channel leaky devices, based on measurements from DC to the GHz range and fitting with a robust weighted algorithm. Secondly, we will present a novel RFCV technique which pushes the conventional split-CV measurement to the MHz range. This RF-split-CV is based on measuring with a 2 -port network analyzer, {{as opposed to the}} conventional technique which uses a 1 -port LCR meter. This improved technique is the basis for accurate mobility extraction as studied in the final part of the paper. This methodology takes parasitics fully into account: the RF-split-CV curves obtained are used for the accurate <b>metallurgical</b> channel <b>length</b> extraction. Combination of these Lmet results with conventional Ids- Vgs curves measured in the linear regime leads to the source and drain resistance calculation. After all these corrections have been performed, the mobility is finally calculated...|$|R
40|$|The short-channel {{performance}} of compressively strained Si 0. 77 Ge 0. 23 pMOSFETs with HfSiOx/TiSiN gate stacks {{has been characterized}} alongside that of unstrained-Si pMOSFETs. Strained-SiGe devices exhibit 80 % mobility enhancement compared with Si control devices at an effective vertical field of 1 MV middotcm- 1. For the first time, the on-state drain-current enhancement of intrinsic strained-SiGe devices is shown to be approximately constant with scaling. Intrinsic strained-SiGe devices with 100 -nm gate lengths exhibit 75 % enhancement in maximum transconductance compared with Si control devices, using only ~ 20 % Ge (~ 0. 8 % strain). The origin of the loss in performance enhancement commonly observed in strained-SiGe devices at short gate lengths is examined and found {{to be dominated by}} reduced boron diffusivity and increased parasitic series resistance in compressively strained SiGe devices compared with silicon control devices. The effective channel length was extracted from I- V measurements and was found to be 40 % smaller in 100 -nm silicon control devices than in SiGe devices having the same lithographic gate lengths, which is in good agreement with the <b>metallurgical</b> channel <b>length</b> predicted by TCAD process simulations. Self-heating due to the low thermal conductivity of SiGe is shown to have a negligible effect on the scaled-device performance. These findings demonstrate that the significant on-state performance gains of strained-SiGe pMOSFETs compared with bulk Si devices observed at long channel lengths are also obtainable in scaled devices if dopant diffusion, silicidation, and contact modules can be optimized for SiGe...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the verification of solidification of continuously cast round steel billets using numerical modelling based on the finite element method. The aim of numerical modelling is to optimize the production of continuously cast steel billets of round format. The paper describes the pre-processing, processing and post-processing phases of numerical modelling. Also, the problems with determination of the thermodynamic properties of materials and the heat transfer between the individual parts of the casting system, including the definition of the heat losses along the casting strand in the primary and secondary cooling, were discussed. The first results of numerical simulation show the so-called thermal steady state of continuous casting. The temperature field, the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>length</b> and the thickness of the shell {{at the end of the}} mould were predicted. The further research will be concentrated on the prediction the risk of the cracks and the porosity based on the different boundary conditions. Web of Science 62122622...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} quality in {{continuous}} casting products cannot be achieved without a knowledge base which incorporates parameters and variables of influence such as: equipment characteristics, steel, each {{component of the}} system and operational conditions. This work presents the development of a computational algorithm (software) applied to maximize the quality of steel billets produced by continuous casting. A mathematical model of solidification works integrated with a genetic search algorithm and a knowledge base of operational parameters. The optimization strategy selects a set of cooling conditions (mold and secondary cooling) and metallurgical criteria in order to attain highest product quality, which is related to a homogeneous thermal behavior during solidification. The results of simulations performed using the mathematical model are validated against both experimental and literature results and a good agreement is observed. Using the numerical model linked to a search method and the knowledge base, results can be produced for determining optimum settings of casting conditions, which are conducive to the best strand surface temperature profile and <b>metallurgical</b> <b>length.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The thermophysical {{properties}} of steels have {{significant influence on}} the actual concasting process, and on the accuracy of its numerical simulation and optimization. The determination of these properties (heat conductivity, specific heat capacity and density in the solid and liquid states) often requires more time than the actual numerical calculation of the temperature fields of a continuously cast steel billet, cylinder or slab (generally a concasting). The influence of individual properties should be neither under- nor over-estimated. Therefore, an analysis/parametric study of these thermophysical properties was conducted. The order of importance within the actual process and the accuracy of simulation and optimization were also determined. Individual properties, which, in some cases, were obtained from tables, and in others experimentally, were substituted by an approximation using orthogonal polynomials. The accuracy of each polynomial {{is dependent on the}} precision of individual values. The order of significance of individual thermophysical properties was determined with respect to the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>length.</b> The analysis was performed by means of a so-called calculation experiment, i. e. by means of the original and universal numerical concasting model developed by the authors of this paper.
