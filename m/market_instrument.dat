50|$|As of September 2001, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 280 active ABCP programs, {{with more than}} $650 billion in outstanding. During the mid-2000s, ABCP saw a steady rise in popularity because of their high ratings {{from the perspective of}} investors and the low borrowing rates from companies who need money. Gradually, even more conservative investors, such as money market mutual funds and retirement funds began purchasing ABCP. This optimism pushed the outstanding of ABCP to $1.3 trillion by the time of July 2007. At that time, ABCP was the largest money <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> in the United States, following by Treasury Bills with about $940 billion outstanding. However, this trend came to an abrupt end in August 2007.|$|E
50|$|Many tonewoods {{come from}} {{sustainable}} sources through specialist dealers. Spruce, for example, is very common, but large pieces with even grain represent {{a small proportion}} of total supply and can be expensive. Some tonewoods are particularly hard to find on the open market, and small-scale instrument makers often turn to reclamation, for instance from disused salmon traps in Alaska, various old construction in the U.S Pacific Northwest, from trees that have blown down, or from specially permitted removals in conservation areas where logging is not generally permitted. Mass <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> manufacturers have started using Asian and African woods, such as Bubinga (Guibourtia species) and Wenge (Millettia laurentii), as inexpensive alternatives to traditional tonewoods.|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of the {{economic}} literature on pollution control strategies concentrates on the efficiency of environmental policy instruments. Most analytical studies in this field show that <b>market</b> <b>instruments</b> are more efficient with respect to the cost of pollution abatement of a given number of polluters than non-market instruments. According to several analytical studies, <b>market</b> <b>instruments</b> should also be more efficient with respect to innovation in pollution abatement equipment than non-market instruments. In the empirical literature a great number of case studies exist with estimations of the savings of abatement costs of <b>market</b> <b>instruments</b> in a situation without technological progress. Empirical studies about the impact of environmental policy <b>market</b> <b>instruments</b> on the abatement costs in situations with technological progress are lacking. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to fill this gap. The paper deals with an empirical estimation of abatement costs for the emission of SO 2 of coal-fired electricity units in the Netherlands from 1985 to 2000. First, the working of <b>market</b> <b>instruments</b> and non-market instruments (the existing environmental policy of the Dutch government) is simulated in a static situation. Second, we analyse the learning effects of flue gas desulphurization. The efficiency advantage of <b>market</b> <b>instruments</b> turns out to be larger in a situation of technological progress than in a static situation.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the article}} is to verify the {{logistics}} and <b>marketing</b> <b>instruments</b> used in transport enterprises in Lubuskie voivodeship. The article {{presents the results of}} surveys of transport companies. Based on these studies in transport enterprises in Lubuskie, the current level of the use of logistics and <b>marketing</b> <b>instruments</b> was determined. Logistics and <b>marketing</b> <b>instruments</b> were separated to study the needs of transport companies in Lubuskie voivodeship. The choice of these instruments gave rise to a study f the possibility of using them in the implementation of business operations. From the findings it can be inferred that they are useful for the voivodeship, and that such a system can be implemented in the whole country. 	Methods: The study was conducted {{in the second half of}} 2014 and 140 transport enterprises in Lubuskie. Based on the research results, classifications of instruments were developed using logistics and marketing division at their levels. 	Results: On the basis of these findings and observations, the authors have analysed the levels of identification <b>instruments,</b> logistics and <b>marketing.</b> On this basis, it was possible to identify the instruments used by logistics and marketing in these companies. 	Conclusions: Based on the study of transport companies in Lubuskie voivodeship, a selection of logistics and <b>marketing</b> <b>instruments</b> were identified, along with a classification of the logistics and <b>marketing</b> <b>instruments</b> used. With the implementation of the above steps to classify the usage level of logistics and <b>marketing</b> <b>instruments,</b> the ability to match these levels to data transport companies was established...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{penetration}} by {{the market}} into the governing of agri-environments, {{and the use of}} market-oriented approaches in an attempt to produce more sustainable outcomes, is a characteristic feature of what scholars have called the 'neoliberalisation of nature'. While accepting that neoliberal forms of governing tend to extend market relations into new domains, a number of scholars have argued that they may at the same time create spaces of resistance, open up progressive political possibilities, or incorporate alternative rationalities of governing. This literature has so far focused primarily on the policy and/or programme level with limited connection made to the growing body of research that explores landholder responses to specific market instruments. We address this gap by focusing on a <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> – Wimmera Habitat Tender – in the State of Victoria, Australia, which aims to provide incentives for farmers in managing native vegetation. This case study explores how a specific tender-based <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> seeks to construct natural resource managers as neoliberal subjects, as well as the complex ways in which farmers contest or resist the neoliberal governing of their agri-environmental practices. Through our analysis we contend that closer scrutiny of how the techniques underpinning market-based environmental instruments are taken up or resisted contributes to a more robust understanding of the environmental possibilities created by market instruments, as well as the challenges involved in attempts to neoliberalise nature...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{water scarcity}} and pollution {{problems that are}} affecting {{large areas of the}} globe are provoking a heated debate both among scholars and in the public opinion on two main issues: first, on the very nature of water as a common resource and the related management problems that this generates and, second, on the most appropriate <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> to apply the polluters' (user's) pays principle and thus price water pollution (consumption). This chapter analyzes these two intertwined issues and critically examines the experiences of various countries that have applied a specific kind of market-based instrument, tradable water permits programmes. For this purpose, the author first investigates the recent debate on water as a common resource and its practical implications in terms of water pricing, emphasizing the rationale and limitations underlying the use of market instruments for water. The chapter then focuses on tradable permits as this might become the main <b>market</b> <b>instrument</b> for water management and conservation to be adopted in many countries in the years to come. In this regard, the work critically evaluates the most significant applications of water tradable permit systems all over the world, focusing attention on the crucial role that the government can play for their successful implementation, in order to provide a few suggestions which can be drawn from these programs for their application in other countries in the future...|$|E

Using a hazard model for a panel of 35 states from 1991 to 2003, we find that the adoption and the timing of market instruments are positively associated with the relative price of electricity even after controlling for a slate of variables, including the political context, the severity of air pollution, and neighbor-hood effects...|$|E
