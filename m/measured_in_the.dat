5|$|All {{daughter}} isotopes (decay products) of element 117 {{were previously}} unknown; therefore, their properties {{could not be}} used to confirm the claim of discovery. In 2011, when one of the decay products (289115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element 117. The discoverers did not submit a claim for their findings in 2007–2011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.|$|E

5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E
5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones can be <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.|$|E

However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.|$|E

According to a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted January 11–15, 2009, Bush's final approval rating in office was 22percent, the lowest in American history.|$|E
5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

5|$|Japan has 108 active volcanoes. During {{the twentieth}} century several new volcanoes emerged, {{including}} Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami. Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2013 World Risk Index.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the {{algorithm is}} formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths a and b corresponds to the greatest length g that measures a and b evenly; in other words, the lengths a and b are both integer multiples of the length g.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{contains a}} range of interesting compounds in small quantities, including some based on hydrogen, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). There is carbon monoxide, water vapour and atomic oxygen as well. Hydrogen is in relatively short supply in the Venusian atmosphere. A large amount of the planet's hydrogen is theorised to have been lost to space, with the remainder being mostly bound up in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The loss of significant amounts of hydrogen is proven by a very high D–H ratio <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Venusian atmosphere. The ratio is about 0.015–0.025, which is 100–150 {{times higher than the}} terrestrial value of 1.6. According to some measurements, in the upper atmosphere of Venus D/H ratio is 1.5 higher than in the bulk atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals {{are much more}} likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E
