5000|$|Both [...] "pipe" [...] and [...] "tube" [...] imply a {{level of}} {{rigidity}} and permanence, whereas a hose (or hosepipe) is usually portable and flexible. Pipe assemblies are almost always constructed {{with the use of}} fittings such as elbows, tees, and so on, while tube may be formed or bent into custom configurations. For materials that are inflexible, cannot be formed, or where construction is governed by codes or standards, tube assemblies are also constructed with the use of <b>tube</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Automated reconstructions {{of neurons}} {{can be done}} using model (e.g. spheres or <b>tubes)</b> <b>fitting</b> and marching, pruning of over-reconstruction, minimal cost {{connection}} of key points, ray-bursting and many others. Skeletonization is a critical step in automated neuron reconstruction, {{but in the case}} of all-path-pruning and its variants it is combined with estimation of model parameters (e.g. tube diameters). The major limitation of automated tracing is the lack of precision especially when the neuron morphology is complicated or the image has substantial amount of noise.|$|R

40|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{pressure}} vessel industry. Current research on <b>tube</b> <b>fittings</b> serves to determine means of decreasing the cost and increasing the efficiency of their manufacture. With this motivation, several new tube forming processes have been proposed in recent years. The current study focuses on the finite element simulation of two new manufacturing processes for tube fittings; i. e. hydroforming and tube push-bending. For tube hydroforming, used to produce T and Y joints, there is a working range defined by the combination of internal pressure and axial load. To ensure that a satisfactory product is obtained, {{it is essential that}} the loading path be inside the working range. The working range for several tube hydroforming models are predicted, and the results are validated with existing theoretical and experimental values. The new tube push bending process has the advantage that tube bends with a small bending radius can be produced. In this study, finite element simulations are carried out to demonstrate this advantage. The spring-back and material waste factors are determined through simulation, as well as the maximum axial load. The results obtained are validated against existing theoretical and experimental values. The study ends with some conclusions about the suitability of finite element simulations in tube forming processes, and with some suggestions for further research...|$|R
