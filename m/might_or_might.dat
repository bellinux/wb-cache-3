25|$|Human {{prehistory}} in Southeastern Europe is conventionally {{divided into}} smaller periods, such as Upper Paleolithic, Holocene Mesolithic/Epipaleolithic, Neolithic Revolution, expansion of Proto-Indo-Europeans, and Protohistory. The changes between these are gradual. For example, depending on interpretation, protohistory <b>might</b> <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not include Bronze Age Greece (2800–1200 BC), Minoan, Mycenaean, Thracian and Venetic cultures. By one {{interpretation of the}} historiography criterion, Southeastern Europe enters protohistory only with Homer (See also Historicity of the Iliad, and Geography of the Odyssey). At any rate, the period ends before Herodotus in the 5th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Gap {{insurance}} {{covers the}} excess amount on your auto loan in an instance where {{your insurance company}} does not cover the entire loan. Depending on the company's specific policies it <b>might</b> <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not cover the deductible as well. This coverage is marketed for those who put low down payments, have high interest rates on their loans, and those with 60-month or longer terms. Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.|$|E

You catch me {{at the end of}} my evidence, dad, when you come to Miss Gwilt's proceedings in the spring and summer of the present year. She <b>might,</b> <b>or</b> she <b>might</b> not, have been desperate enough to attempt suicide; and she <b>might,</b> <b>or</b> she <b>might</b> not, have been at the bottom of those inquiries that I made for Mrs. Oldershaw.

25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying <b>might</b> <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal testimony under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E
25|$|Urs, Tenor, {{most likely}} a Heldentenor. As its name implies, the heldentenor vocal fach {{features}} in the German romantic operatic repertoire. The heldentenor is the German equivalent of the tenore drammatico, however with a more baritonal quality. Therefore, the heldentenor voice <b>might</b> <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not have facility up to high B or C. The repertoire, however, rarely calls for such high notes. This seems to be evident in Il Divo's repertoire: {{the extent of his}} range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G2 up to C5. However, Buhler himself once revealed from a video chat with fans that he could sing from C2 up to G5.|$|E
25|$|Both Suther and Régine Tessier, {{the latter}} in a sketch of Sage in Notable American Women: The Modern Period, note key {{features}} of Sage’s mature work. Most of Sage’s paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and latticework, which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Some contain figures that <b>might</b> <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not be human, hidden by flowing drapery. (Le Passage, one of Sage’s last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even Small Portrait, thought {{by many to be}} a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as a face.) Like Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as “reminiscent of the sulphurous light before a thunderstorm”. Critics frequently called Sage’s work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} {{advice from}} Archie, Emma decides to confront Hyde about the vision while she pays him a visit at the psychiatric ward {{at the hospital}} where he being held. Hyde is aware of Emma's life behind bars and tests her {{to see if she}} is in fear even if she is in denial and makes his point when her hand started shaking. Hyde gives Emma the answer and he tells her to follow a red bird. Later that night, Emma takes the advice after she sees one during the search for survivors, and it leads Emma to The Oracle, a young girl who gives Emma a vision of her future as The Savior, which reveals a confrontation with an unknown attacker who plans to kill Emma as she was defending her family; The Oracle also hints of many paths Emma could take but the outcome <b>might</b> <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not change. When Emma returns to confront Hyde about this, he explain that the person she'll face in the future will be her ending but given his previous encounters with those that came before her, he tells Emma that the enemy is among the residents, so Emma decides for her family's sake to keep this to herself.|$|E
500|$|Abortion {{rights advocates}} {{have called the}} film the “gold standard” for {{cinematic}} portrayals of abortion, which author Yannis Tzioumakis described as offering a [...] "compassionate depiction of abortion in which the woman seeking an abortion was not demonized with the primary concerns being her health and preserving her capacity to bear children at a future time rather than the ethical dilemma that <b>might</b> <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not inform her decision, a portrayal {{that is not necessarily}} available in current films." ...|$|E

50|$|In Spycatcher, Wright {{states that}} he was {{assigned}} to unmask a Soviet mole in MI5, and claims that the mole was Roger Hollis — a former MI5 Director General; it also describes people who <b>might</b> have <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not have been the mole; and narrates a history of MI5 by chronicling its principal officers, from the 1930s to his time in service.|$|R
500|$|However, modern {{translations}} make {{it clear}} that Laing was using the nursery rhyme as a model for his very free translation, and the reference to London Bridge does not appear {{at the start of the}} verse and it is unlikely that this is an earlier version of the nursery rhyme. Some historians have raised the possibility that the attack never took place. However, the original document detailing the attack was written only about 100 years after what would be a famous event in a highly populated area, leading the majority of historians to conclude that the account is at least relatively accurate. While it <b>might</b> <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not be the origin of the rhyme, this would make King Olaf's victory the only historically recorded incidence of london bridge [...] "falling down." ...|$|E

2500|$|A birth {{certificate}} {{is a vital}} record that documents {{the birth of a}} child.

60|$|It may be well to {{remember}} that the highest level of moral aspiration recorded in history was reached by a few ancient Jews--Micah, Isaiah, and the rest--who took no count whatever of what <b>might</b> <b>or</b> what <b>might</b> not happen to them after death. It is not obvious to me why the same point should not by and by be reached by the Gentiles.|$|R

2500|$|In actuality, {{young men}} and women who were {{attracted}} to each other would often meet privately, in the bush or on the beach. Sometimes the young women became pregnant as a result of these meetings. Marriage <b>might</b> <b>or</b> <b>might</b> not result.
