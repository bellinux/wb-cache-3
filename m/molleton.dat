2500|$|Many {{innovations}} {{and technical}} refinements {{have been made}} in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of presses with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that can print multi-color images in one pass {{on both sides of the}} sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (webs) of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren instead of the old method which is still used on older presses (conventional dampening), which are rollers covered with <b>molleton</b> (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a [...] "delta effect or vario," [...] which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as [...] "hickies".|$|E

It was {{nevertheless}} besieged and taken by the Geuzen, locally known as the Hurlus in 1579, before being taken back three months later. In 1627, Philip IV of Spain promoted the seigneury to the rank of county. The Franco-Dutch War under Louis XIV devastated for this mostly agricultural region. Mouscron and the surrounding area became French after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). Part of it rejoined the Southern Netherlands after the Treaty of Nijmegen (1678), which drew the frontier right through its territory. It was finally completely ceded to the Southern Netherlands under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The textile industry started in Mouscron in the 1760s thanks to the imposition by Lille of a ban on the fabrication of <b>molletons,</b> a mixture of flax and wool, in Roubaix and Tourcoing. The Battle of Fleurus (1794) gave Mouscron back to France.|$|R
