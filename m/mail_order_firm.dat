In the late 1980s, the larger scales were marketed in the U.S. in a new relationship with Tonka. Apparently, Tonka had purchased Polistil. Vehicle boxes remained red at this time, but were now labeled Polistil/Tonka. This included larger 1:14 scale cars. Unfortunately, competition with newer and upcoming Bburago, Maisto and <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>firms</b> like Franklin Mint Precision Models provided a surge in competition in the larger scales and contributed to Polistil's demise. By 1993, just as the demand for 1:18 scale models was starting to peak, Tonka dropped the name, dropped Italian production, and venerable Polistil was gone.|$|R
40|$|Coopey, Richard, et al., Order Retailing in Britain: A Business and Social History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. x+ 248 RAE 2008 Since its {{inception}} in the late 19 th century, Britain's <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> industry both exploited and generated social networks in building its businesses. The common foundation of the sector was the agency system; Sales were made through catalogues held by agents, ordinary people in families, neighbourhoods, pubs, clubs and workplaces. Through this agency system <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>firms</b> in Britain were able to tap social networks both to build a customer base, but also to obtain vital information on creditworthiness. In this, the first comprehensive history of the British <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> industry, the authors combine business and social history to fully explain the features and workings of this industry. They show how British general <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> industry <b>firms</b> such as Kay and Co., Empire Stores, Littlewoods, and Grattan grew {{from a range of}} businesses as diverse as watch sales or football pools. A range of business innovations and strategies were developed throughout the twentieth century, including technological development and labour process rationalisation. Indeed, the sector was in the vanguard of many aspects of change from supply chain logistics to computerization. The social and gender profile of the home shopper also changed markedly as the industry developed. These changes are charted, from the male-dominated origins of the industry to the growing influence of women both within the firm and, more importantly, as the centre of the <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> market. The book also draws parallels and contrasts with the much more widely studied <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> industry of the United States. The final section of the book examines the rise of internet shopping and the new challenges and opportunities it provided for the <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> industry. Here the story is one of continuity and fracture as the established <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> companies struggle to adjust to a business environment which they had partly created, but which also rested on a new range of core competencies and technological and demographic change...|$|R

While he expressed his views in terms of his small Kansas city, he tailored his rhetoric to the needs and values of all of urban America.

Sauser had been an area farmer and owned a Cascade lumber business when he built this house in 1908. It is the only known example of the Grand Rapids, Michigan <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> architectural <b>firm</b> of Jacob H. Daverman and Son in Iowa. [...] Sauser lived here until his death, and it was bought by John Thomas Lane in 1926. As of 1983 it was still owned by his descendants. The 2½-story frame house {{is a combination of}} Neoclassical and a restrained version of the Queen Anne style known as Edwardian. The Edwardian influence is found in its asymmetrical massing, roof lines, bay windows, wraparound porch, gable ornamentation, roof cresting, and the leaded glass in the upper sash of the front windows. The Neoclassical influence is found in the window trim, cornice returns, and the Doric porch columns. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|R

The practical and modern style led to orders from her friends and became known as the Poor Boy Sweater. Rykiel started selling the sweaters from her husband's store and the Poor Boy Sweater made the cover of French Elle magazine, bringing Rykiel fame. Actress Audrey Hepburn bought 14 sweaters in every colour. Rykiel's husband helped her to create the Sonia Rykiel Company in 1965. In 1968, Rykiel opened her first boutique store on the Left Bank.Rykiel invented various fashion techniques. She was the first designer to put seams on the outside of a garment, leave hems unfinished and use slogans on her sweaters. She has also been credited with popularisation of wearing black. In 1972, Rykiel was dubbed [...] "Queen of Knits" [...] by Women's Wear Daily. She was also known as [...] "Coco Rykiel", a comparison to Coco Chanel.

As evidenced in some of his letters and memos, Roddenberry was fond of circle-and-triangle designs and had wanted to use them for purposes of theatrical unity as early as the first season's [...] "The Return of the Archons".

40|$|Abstract Background Outpatient {{drugs are}} {{dispensed}} through both community and <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacies. There is no empirical evidence that substitution of community pharmacy with <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> reduces overall drug expenditures. The need {{for evaluating the}} potential effects on utilization and costs of the possible extension of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> services in Medicaid provides the rationale for conducting this study. This study compares drug utilization and drug product cost in community vs. <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy dispensing services in a Medicaid population. Methods This study is a retrospective cohort study comparing utilization and cost patterns in community vs. <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy. A simulation model was employed to assess drug utilization and cost in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy using community pharmacy claim data. The model assumed that courses of drug therapy (CDT) in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy would have utilization patterns {{similar to those found}} in community pharmacy. A 95 % confidence interval surrounding changes in average utilization and average cost were estimated using bootstrap analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed by varying drug selection criteria and supply, fill point, and medication possession ratio (MPR). Sub-analyses were performed to address differences between <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> and community pharmacy related to therapeutic class and dual-eligible patients. Data for the study derived from pharmacy claims database of Ohio Medicaid State program for the period January 2000 -September 2004. Drug claims were aggregated to obtain a set of CDTs representing unique patient IDs and unique drug products. Drug product cost estimates excluded dispensing fees and were used to estimate the cost reduction required in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> to become cost neutral in comparison with community pharmacy. Results The baseline model revealed that the use of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> vs. community pharmacy would result in a 5. 5 % increase in drug utilization and a 5. 4 % cost reduction required in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> to become cost neutral. Results from Ohio Medicaid drugs for chronic use revealed a 5. 1 % increase in utilization and a 4. 9 % cost reduction required to become cost neutral in comparison with community pharmacy. Conclusion The results of the simulation model indicate that <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy increases drug utilization and can also increase drug product cost if the cost per unit is not reduced accordingly. Prior consideration should be given to the patient population, day-supply, disease, therapy, and insurance characteristics to ensure the appropriate use of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy services. </p...|$|R
