This project was to develop a <b>multi-range</b> sensor that offers improved sensitivity over currently available sensors using materials that undergo phase transformations. A shape memory alloy, whose mechanical properties change with temperature, was used for this <b>multi-range</b> sensor development. Shape memory alloys are materials that exhibit a phase transformation when the temperature of the material changes. The material possesses a low temperature low strength martensitic phase and a high temperature high strength austenitic phase.

The ability of the material to exhibit large changes in the yield stress and the modulus of elasticity, as well as its ability to recover from certain plastic deformations are important to the proposed sensor design. The ability of the material to exhibit linear elastic deformation in both phases will result in enhanced sensing capability.

40|$|Railways {{have been}} used {{as one of the most}} crucial means of {{transportation}} in public mobility and economic development. For safe railway operation, the electrification system in the railway infrastructure, which supplies electric power to trains, is an essential facility for stable train operation. Due to its important role, the electrification system needs to be rigorously and regularly inspected and managed. This paper presents a supervised learning method to classify Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) data into ten target classes representing overhead wires, movable brackets and poles, which are key objects in the electrification system. In general, the layout of the railway electrification system shows strong spatial regularity relations among object classes. The proposed classifier is developed based on Conditional Random Field (CRF), which characterizes not only labeling homogeneity at short range, but also the layout compatibility between different object classes at long range in the probabilistic graphical model. This <b>multi-range</b> CRF model consists of a unary term and three pairwise contextual terms. In order to gain computational efficiency, MLS point clouds are converted into a set of line segments to which the labeling process is applied. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a local classifier considering only node features for producing the unary potentials of the CRF model. As the short-range pairwise contextual term, the Potts model is applied to enforce a local smoothness in the short-range graph; while long-range pairwise potentials are designed to enhance the spatial regularities of both horizontal and vertical layouts among railway objects. We formulate two long-range pairwise potentials as the log posterior probability obtained by the naive Bayes classifier. The directional layout compatibilities are characterized in probability look-up tables, which represent the co-occurrence rate of spatial relations in the horizontal and vertical directions. The likelihood function is formulated by multivariate Gaussian distributions. In the proposed <b>multi-range</b> CRF model, the weight parameters to balance four sub-terms are estimated by applying the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The results show that the proposed <b>multi-range</b> CRF can effectively classify individual railway elements, representing an average recall of 97. 66 % and an average precision of 97. 07 % for all classes...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we aim {{to address}} an {{important}} issue about the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann (LB) model, which has attracted much attention as a mesoscopic model for simulating interfacial dynamics of complex fluids, but suffers from the problem that the surface tension cannot be tuned independently of the density ratio. In the literature, a <b>multi-range</b> potential was devised to adjust the surface tension [Sbragaglia et al., Phys. Rev. E 75, 026702 (2007) ]. However, it was recently found that the density ratio of the system will be changed when the <b>multi-range</b> potential is employed to adjust the surface tension. A new approach is therefore proposed in the present work. The basic strategy is to add a source term to the LB equation so as to tune the surface tension of the pseudopotential LB model. The proposed approach can guarantee that the adjustment of the surface tension {{does not affect the}} mechanical stability condition of the pseudopotential LB model, and thus provides a separate control of the surface tension and the density ratio. Meanwhile, it still retains the mesoscopic feature and the computational simplicity of the pseudopotential LB model. Numerical simulations are carried out for stationary droplets, capillary waves, and droplet splashing on a thin liquid film. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of achieving a tunable surface tension over a very wide range and can keep the density ratio unchanged when adjusting the surface tension.

40|$|Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) is a ground-based, active {{imaging method}} that rapidly acquires accurate, highly dense {{three-dimensional}} point cloud of object surfaces by laser range finding. For fully utilizing its benefits, developing a robust method to classify many objects of interests from {{huge amounts of}} laser point clouds is urgently required. However, classifying massive TLS data faces many challenges, such as complex urban scene, partial data acquisition from occlusion. To make an automatic, accurate and robust TLS data classification, we present a line-based <b>multi-range</b> asymmetric Conditional Random Field algorithm. The first contribution is to propose a line-base TLS data classification method. In this thesis, {{we are interested in}} seven classes: building, roof, pedestrian road (PR), tree, low man-made object (LMO), vehicle road (VR), and low vegetation (LV). The line-based classification is implemented in each scan profile, which follows the line profiling nature of laser scanning mechanism. Ten conventional local classifiers are tested, including popular generative and discriminative classifiers, and experimental results validate that the line-based method can achieve satisfying classification performance. However, local classifiers implement labeling task on individual line independently of its neighborhood, the inference of which often suffers from similar local appearance across different object classes. The second contribution is to propose a <b>multi-range</b> asymmetric Conditional Random Field (maCRF) model, which uses object context as post-classification to improve the performance of a local generative classifier. The maCRF incorporates appearance, local smoothness constraint, and global scene layout regularity together into a probabilistic graphical model. The local smoothness enforces that lines in a local area to have the same class label, while scene layout favours an asymmetric regularity of spatial arrangement between different object classes within long-range, which is considered both in vertical (above-bellow relation) and horizontal (front-behind) directions. The asymmetric regularity allows capturing directional spatial arrangement between pairwise objects (e. g. it allows ground is lower than building, not vice-versa). The third contribution is to extend the maCRF model by adding across scan profile context, which is called Across scan profile <b>Multi-range</b> Asymmetric Conditional Random Field (amaCRF) model. Due to the sweeping nature of laser scanning, the sequentially acquired TLS data has strong spatial dependency, and the across scan profile context can provide more contextual information. The final contribution is to propose a sequential classification strategy. Along the sweeping direction of laser scanning, amaCRF models were sequentially constructed. By dynamically updating posterior probability of common scan profiles, contextual information propagates through adjacent scan profiles...|$|E

For fully utilizing its benefits, developing a robust method to classify many objects of interests from huge amounts of laser point clouds is urgently required. Conditional Random Field (CRF) is a well-known discriminative classifier, which integrates local appearance of the observation (laser point) with spatial interactions among its neighbouring points in classification process. Typical CRFs employ generic label consistency using short-range dependency only, which often causes locality problem. In this paper, we present a <b>multi-range</b> and asymmetric Conditional Random Field (CRF) (maCRF), which adopts a priori information of scene-layout compatibility addressing long-range dependency. The proposed CRF constructs two graphical models, one for enhancing a local labelling smoothness within short-range (srCRF) {{and the other for}} favouring a global and asymmetric regularity of spatial arrangement between different object classes within long-range (lrCRF).

40|$|For the {{homologation}} of railway vehicles, standards ([1, 2]) {{require the}} measurement of wheel-rail contact forces {{as well as the}} accelerometric monitoring of all bogies along the train. Moreover, also carbody accelerations are usually measured for assessing passenger comfort. Obviously, measuring ranges of accelerometer mounted on axle boxes, bogies and carbodies are significantly different and require different types of accelerometer. Besides the measuring range, also other requirements are important for this type of application: accelerometers have to be rugged, easy-to-configure, low-noise and sealed and, due to the possibility of having long cables (long distances between the measuring point and the acquisition system), measured signals have to be pre-amplified at the measuring point.

Large mm-wave telescopes are now routinely detecting and mapping the SZ effect in a number of clusters, measure their comptonisation parameter and use them as probes of the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe. Aims. We show that estimates of the physical parameters of clusters (optical depth, plasma temperature, peculiar velocity, non-thermal components etc.) obtained from ground-based multi-band SZ photometry can be significantly biased, owing to the reduced frequency coverage, to the degeneracy between the parameters and to the presence of a number of independent components larger than the number of frequencies measured. We demonstrate that low-resolution spectroscopic measurements of the SZ effect that also cover frequencies > 270 GHz are effective in removing the degeneracy. Methods. We used accurate simulations of observations with lines-of-sight through clusters of galaxies with different experimental configurations (4 -band photometers, 6 -band photometer, <b>multi-range</b> differential spectrometer, full coverage spectrometers) and different intracluster plasma stratifications. Results. We find that measurements carried out with ground-based few-band photometers are biased towards high electron temperatures and low optical depths, and require coverage of high frequency and/or independent complementary observations to produce unbiased information; a differential spectrometer that covers 4 bands with a resolution of ~ 6 GHz eliminates most if not all bias; full-range differential spectrometers are the ultimate resource that allows a full recovery of all parameters...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{systems with}} high ground state degeneracy, such as {{electrons}} in large magnetic fields [1, 2] and geometrically frustrated spins [3], provide a rich playground for exploring emergent many-body phenomena. Quantum simulations with cold atoms offer new prospects for exploring complex phases arising from frustration and interactions [4 - 7] through the direct engineering of these {{ingredients in a}} well-controlled environment [8, 9]. Advances in band structure engineering, {{through the use of}} sophisticated lattice potentials made from interfering lasers, have allowed for explorations of kagome [10] and Lieb [11] lattice structures that support high-degeneracy excited energy bands. The use of internal states as synthetic dimensions [12] offers even greater flexibility in creating nontrivial band structures [13 - 17]. Here, using synthetic lattices based on laser-coupled atomic momentum states, we perform the first exploration of high-degeneracy ground bands in a cold atom system. By combining nearest- and next-nearest-neighbour tunnellings, we form an effective zigzag lattice that naturally supports kinetic frustration and nearly-flat quartic energy bands. In a quartic band structure with time-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken by a synthetic magnetic flux, the quench dynamics of our atoms reveal hallmark signatures of spin-momentum locking. Under preserved TRS, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of a nearly-flat ground band to added disorder. Furthermore, we show that the ground state localisation properties are strongly modified by an added flux, relating to a flux-dependent mobility edge due to <b>multi-range</b> tunnelling. Our work constitutes the first quantum simulation study on the interplay of topology and disorder [18], and opens the door to studying emergent phenomena driven by frustrated kinetics and atomic interactionsComment: 6 pages, 3 figures; 4 pages of supplementary material...|$|E
