5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments.

Wear produces loss of sucrose extraction and loss of grip of the roll on the bagasse.  This paper presents the evaluation of wear and loss of grip of hypoeutectic and hypereutectic high chromium welding deposits applied on ASTM A- 36 steel and gray cast iron. A modified ASTM G- 65 standard test was used.  Wear was produced by the abrasive action of wet bagasse with three levels of <b>mineral</b> extraneous <b>matter.</b> Silica grains with sizes {{in the range of}} 0. 212 - 0. 300 mm (AFS 50 / 70) were used as <b>mineral</b> extraneous <b>matter.</b> Grip was evaluated by measuring the torque on the power transmission shaft that moves the specimens.

The acid dissolves the <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> from the coal ball, leaving a projecting layer of plant cells. After applying acetone, a piece of cellulose acetate is placed on the coal ball. This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball into the cellulose acetate. Upon drying, the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball with a razor and the obtained peel can be stained with a low-acidity stain and observed under a microscope. Up to 50peels can be extracted from [...] of coal ball with this method.|$|E

30|$|The ILs can be {{used for}} the {{beneficiation}} of high sulfur coals through removal all forms of sulfur including <b>mineral</b> <b>matters.</b> In the present process, ILs are able to reduce the pyritic, sulfate and organic sulfur by maximum of 62.50  %, 83.33  % and 31.63  % from Meghalya (India) coals. The FT-IR, XRF and SEM analyses support the beneficiation process through removal of sulfur components and <b>mineral</b> <b>matters</b> from the coal samples. The GCVs of the beneficiated coals are enhanced after oxidation in ILs. The process removed some of inorganic species such as Ca, Mn and Ni. The combustion performance indexes (S) and activation energies (Ea) indicate the suitability of the beneficiated coals for thermal applications. Moreover, the chemical process finds merits for industrial application as it could be carried out in mild conditions. In summary, the present green process of chemical desulfurization of coals with ILs is observed to substitute the use lethal chemicals in coal beneficiation.|$|R

I am not raising a merely fanciful and unreal objection. Very learned men, in former days, have even entertained the notion that all the formed things found in rocks are of this nature; and if no such conception is at present held to be admissible, it is because long and varied experience has now shown that <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> never does assume the form and structure we find in fossils. If any one were to try to persuade you that an oyster-shell (which is also chiefly composed of carbonate of lime) had crystallized out of sea-water, I suppose you would laugh at the absurdity.

60|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Cap Rouge river there is a high point, now called Redclyffe. On this Cartier {{constructed}} a second fort, which commanded the fortification and the ships below. A little spring supplied fresh water, and the natural situation afforded a protection against attack by water or by land. While the French laboured in building the stockades and in hauling provisions and equipments from the ships to the forts, they made other discoveries that impressed them more than the forest wealth of this new land. Close beside the upper fort they found in the soil a good store of stones which they 'esteemed to be diamonds.' At the foot of the slope along the St Lawrence lay iron deposits, and the sand of the shore needed only, Cartier said, to be put into the furnace to get the iron from it. At the water's edge they found 'certain leaves of fine gold as thick as a man's nail,' and in the slabs of black slate-stone which ribbed the open glades of the wood there were veins of <b>mineral</b> <b>matter</b> which shone like gold and silver. Cartier's mineral discoveries have unfortunately not resulted in anything. We know now that his diamonds, still to be seen about Cap Rouge, are rock crystals. The gold which he later on showed to Roberval, and which was tested, proved genuine enough, but the quantity of such deposits in the region has proved insignificant. It is very likely that Cartier would make the most of his mineral discoveries as the readiest means of exciting his master's interest.|$|E

The alluvium {{on the banks of}} the Ganges is obviously an aqueous deposit subsequent to the elevation of these hills, and is perfectly plane up to their bases. The river has its course through the alluvium, like the Soane. The depth of the former is in many places upwards of 100 feet, and the kunker pebbles it contains are often disposed in parallel undulating bands. It nowhere contains sand pebbles or fossils; concretions of lime (kunker) alone interrupting its uniform consistence. It attains its greatest thickness in the valleys of the Ganges and the Soane, gradually sloping up to the Himalaya and Curruckpore hills on either flank. It is, however, well developed on the Kymore and Paras-nath hills, 1200 to 1500 feet above the Ganges valley, and I have no doubt was deposited in very deep water, when the relative positions of these mountains to the Ganges and Soane valleys were the same that they are now. Like every other part of the surface of India, it has suffered much from denudation, especially on the above-named mountains, and around their bases, where various rocks protrude through it. Along the Ganges again, its surface is an unbroken level between Chunar and the rocks of Monghyr.
