25|$|In 2003, {{the first}} volume of his five-volume work Garry Kasparov on <b>My</b> <b>Great</b> Predecessors was published. This volume, which deals with the world chess champions Wilhelm Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, and some of their strong contemporaries, has {{received}} lavish praise from some reviewers (including Nigel Short), while attracting criticism from others for historical inaccuracies and analysis of games directly copied from unattributed sources. Through suggestions on the book's website, most of these shortcomings were corrected in following editions and translations. Despite this, {{the first volume}} won the British Chess Federation's Book of the Year award in 2003. Volume two, covering Max Euwe, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov and Mikhail Tal appeared later in 2003. Volume three, covering Tigran Petrosian and Boris Spassky appeared in early 2004. In December 2004, Kasparov released volume four, which covers Samuel Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf, and Bent Larsen (none of these three were World Champions), but focuses primarily on Bobby Fischer. The fifth volume, devoted to the chess careers of World Champion Anatoly Karpov and challenger Viktor Korchnoi, was published in March 2006.|$|E

25|$|Iolanthe premiered {{only three}} days after Patience closed at the Savoy. The Savoy Theatre, opened only a year earlier, was a {{state-of-the-art}} facility, the first theatre {{in the world to}} be lit entirely by electricity. Patience had transferred to the Savoy from the Opera Comique, upon the theatre's opening, but Iolanthe was the first show to premiere at the theatre. New lighting technologies made such special effects as sparkling fairy wands possible for the first time. The principal fairies' heads were also lit by wreaths of small illuminated stars attached to a battery. The audience that attended the opening night in London included Captain (later Captain Sir) Eyre Massey Shaw, head of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, whom the Fairy Queen apostrophises in the second act ("Oh, Captain Shaw / Type of true love kept under / Could thy brigade with cold cascade / Quench <b>my</b> <b>great</b> love, I wonder?"). On the first night Alice Barnett, as the Queen of the Fairies, sang the verses directly to Captain Shaw, who was sitting in the centre of the stalls.|$|E

500|$|On 6 December 1829, the House of Representatives of Buenos Aires elected Rosas {{governor}} and granted him facultades extraordinarias (extraordinary powers). This {{marked the beginning}} of his regime, described by historians as a dictatorship. He saw himself as a benevolent dictator, saying: [...] "For me the ideal of good government would be paternal autocracy, intelligent, disinterested and indefatigable... I have always admired the autocratic dictators who have been the first servants of their people. That is <b>my</b> <b>great</b> title: I have always sought to serve the country."

[...] In a TV Guide interview after Skelton's death, Marceau said, [...] "Red, you are eternal for me and {{the millions of people}} you made laugh and cry. [...] May God bless you forever, <b>my</b> <b>great</b> and precious companion. [...] I will never forget that silent world we created together." [...] CBS issued the following statement upon his death: [...] "Red's audience had no age limits.

500|$|In 1808, Champollion {{received}} a scare when French Archeologist Alexandre Lenoir published {{the first of}} his four volumes on Nouvelles Explications des Hieroglyphes. making the young scholar fear that his budding work had already been surpassed. But he was relieved to find that Lenoir still operated under the assumption that the hieroglyphs were mystic symbols and not a literary system expressing language. This experience made him even more determined {{to be the first to}} decipher the language and he began dedicating himself even more to the study of Coptic, writing in 1809 to his brother: [...] "I give myself up entirely to Coptic... I wish to know Egyptian like my French, because on that language will be based <b>my</b> <b>great</b> work on the Egyptian papyri." [...] That same year, he was appointed to his first academic post, in history and politics at the University of Grenoble.|$|E

Her purpose was {{to help them understand}} King's death as it related to racism, something they little understood as they lived in a predominantly white community. King has become a national icon in the history of American liberalism and American progressivism. King also influenced Irish politician and activist John Hume.

500|$|According to Markham, [...] "the {{appearance}} of the globes naturally created a great sensation, and much interest was taken in appliances which were equally useful to the student and to the practical navigator." [...] The largest and most prestigious globes were priced at up to £20 each: these were purchased by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions. Among the purchasers were Thomas Bodley and the Warden of All Souls College, for their libraries in Oxford. William Sanderson presented the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge with a pair each. The public preacher Thomas Laughton made an inaugural gift of a Molyneux globe to the Shrewsbury School library. Smaller globes were also made, though no examples have survived. Sanderson {{is known to have}} presented one of these to Robert Cecil in 1595, together with Hues' [...] "Latin booke that teacheth the use of <b>my</b> <b>great</b> globes". Intended as practical navigation aids, they cost as little as £2.|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to <b>my</b> <b>great</b> surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} English language uses of [...] "conscious" [...] and [...] "consciousness" [...] date back, however, to the 1500s. [...] The English word [...] "conscious" [...] originally {{derived from}} the Latin conscius (con- [...] "together" [...] and [...] "to know"), but the Latin word {{did not have the}} same meaning as our word—it meant [...] "knowing with", in other words [...] "having joint or common knowledge with another". [...] There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi, which translates literally as [...] "knowing with oneself", or in other words [...] "sharing knowledge with oneself about something". [...] This phrase had the figurative meaning of [...] "knowing that one knows", as the modern English word [...] "conscious" [...] does. [...] In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word [...] "conscious" [...] retained the meaning of the Latin conscius. [...] For example, Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan wrote: [...] "Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another." [...] The Latin phrase conscius sibi, whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as [...] "conscious to oneself" [...] or [...] "conscious unto oneself". [...] For example, Archbishop Ussher wrote in 1613 of [...] "being so conscious unto myself of <b>my</b> <b>great</b> weakness". [...] Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.|$|E
500|$|During the voyage, Hues made astronomical {{observations}} of the Southern Cross and other stars of the Southern Hemisphere while in the South Atlantic, and also observed the variation of the compass there and at the Equator. He returned to England with Davis in 1593, and published his discoveries in the work Tractatus de globis et eorum usu (Treatise on Globes and Their Use, 1594), which he dedicated to Raleigh. The book was written to explain {{the use of the}} terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by Emery Molyneux in late 1592 or early 1593. Apparently, the book was also intended to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation, although Lesley Cormack has observed that the fact it was written in Latin suggests that it was aimed at scholarly readers on the Continent. In 1595, William Sanderson, a London merchant who had largely financed the globes' construction, presented a small globe together with Hues' [...] "Latin booke that teacheth the use of <b>my</b> <b>great</b> globes" [...] to Robert Cecil, a statesman who was spymaster and minister to ElizabethI and JamesI. Hues' work subsequently went into at least 12 other printings in Dutch (1597, 1613 and 1622), English (1638 and 1659), French (1618) and Latin (1611, 1613, 1617, 1627, 1659 and 1663). In his book An Accidence or The Path-way to Experience: Necessary for all Young Sea-men (1626),|contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/1049?rskey=yLIzcm=2=false#eid|title=OED Online|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|accessdate=23 July 2016}} John Smith, who founded the first permanent English settlement in North America at Jamestown, Virginia, listed Hues' book among the works that a young seaman should study.|$|E

500|$|In {{a letter}} {{dedicating}} the new opera to Queen Anne, Hill wrote of {{his choice of}} story: [...] "I could not chuse a finer Subject than the celebrated story of Rinaldo and Armida". He had, however, exercised [...] "a Poet's Privilege", to render Tasso's work suitable for the stage. This [...] "privilege" [...] moved the opera's story {{a long way from}} Tasso's original. Hill invented a new heroine, Almirena, to provide the main love interest with the hero Rinaldo, and the relationship between Rinaldo and Armida scarcely figures in the opera. Likewise, the affair between Argante and Armida is Hill's creation, as are the conversions to Christianity, the latter possibly a [...] to English susceptibilities. Rossi was required to turn the elaborate scenario into verses, a relatively light task which, he said, was [...] "the delivery of a few evenings". Nevertheless, Rossi complained that Handel hardly gave him time to write: [...] "To <b>my</b> <b>great</b> wonder I saw an entire Opera set to music by that surprising genius, with the greatest degree of perfection, in two weeks". Price argues that Rossi's role was beyond that of a mere versifier, quoting Hill's words of praise for Rossi in the preface to the libretto, which suggest that Rossi was the senior partner in the birth of the libretto. Price also points to the likely influences on the structure of Rinaldo from two British semi-operas—George Granville's The British Enchanters, and Purcell's King Arthur. The transformations of characters to others' shapes, Price contends, is likely derived from John Dryden's play Amphitryon.|$|E
