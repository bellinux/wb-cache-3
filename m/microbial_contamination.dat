25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for <b>microbial</b> <b>contamination</b> which is very stringent to ensure freedom from <b>microbial</b> <b>contamination</b> in pharmaceutical products.|$|E
25|$|As a {{very general}} {{guideline}} {{it is recommended}} that the bottom of the pit should be at least 2 m abovegroundwaterlevel, and a minimum horizontal distance of 30 m between a pit and a water source is normally recommended to limit exposure to <b>microbial</b> <b>contamination.</b> However, no general statement should be made regarding the minimum lateral separation distances required to prevent contamination of a well from a pit latrine. For example, even 50 m lateral separation distance might not be sufficient in a strongly karstified system with a downgradient supply well or spring, while 10 m lateral separation distance is completely sufficient if there is a well developed clay cover layer and the annular space of the groundwater well is well sealed.|$|E

He collaborated with Frank Macfarlane Burnet to study viral antibodies. With the launching of Sputnik in 1957, Lederberg became concerned about the biological impact of space exploration. In a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, he outlined his concerns that extraterrestrial microbes might gain entry to Earth onboard spacecraft, causing catastrophic diseases. He also argued that, conversely, <b>microbial</b> <b>contamination</b> of manmade satellites and probes may obscure the search for extraterrestrial life. He advised quarantine for returning astronauts and equipment and sterilization of equipment prior to launch. Teaming up with Carl Sagan, his public advocacy for what he termed exobiology helped expand the role of biology in NASA.|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{standard}} {{index of}} <b>microbial</b> air <b>contamination</b> (IMA) for {{the measurement of}} <b>microbial</b> air <b>contamination</b> in environments at risk is described. The method quantifies the microbial flow {{directly related to the}} contamination of surfaces coming from microbes that reach critical points by falling on to them. The index of <b>microbial</b> air <b>contamination</b> is based on the count of the microbial fallout on to Petri dishes left open to the air according to the 1 / 1 / 1 scheme (for 1 h, 1 m from the floor, at least 1 m away from walls or any obstacle). Classes of contamination and maximum acceptable levels have been established. The index of <b>microbial</b> air <b>contamination</b> has been tested in many different places: in hospitals, in food indus-tries, in art galleries, aboard the MIR space station and also in the open air. It {{has proved to be a}} reliable and useful tool for monitoring the <b>microbial</b> surface <b>contamination</b> settling from the air in any environment...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to define the risk of contamination of human corneas preserved by the organ-culture method. 	 Methods: We examined the <b>microbial</b> <b>contaminations</b> in 3, 100 corneoscleral rims cultivated in our eye bank. Microbiologic tests were performed in the preservation medium 5 days after the beginning of cornea cultures and in the last day of culture (21. 5 ± 8. 1 days), when the corneas were transferred to the deswelling medium. In 1, 029 corneas a microbiologic test also was performed 1 day after the beginning of deswelling procedure. 	 Results: We found 206 <b>microbial</b> <b>contaminations</b> (6. 65 % of total) after 5 days and 17 (0. 55 %) {{at the end of the}} preservation period. The total number of contaminated samples during the cornea culture was 223 corresponding to 7. 2 % of the samples (95 % confidence interval, 6. 3 - 8. 1). The 1, 029 tests performed during the deswelling step disclosed 26 contaminated cornea cultures despite apparent sterility of the medium (2. 5 %; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 - 3. 5). 	 Conclusions: The observation of <b>microbial</b> <b>contaminations</b> in a time close to the transplant (i. e., at the end of the preservation period and in the deswelling step) showed that a fast microbial tests during the deswelling procedure may prevent the grafting of a contaminated cornea. The appearance of bacteria in the deswelling medium despite a negative culture medium suggests that bacteria penetrate the corneal tissues during the culture to be subsequently extruded when the internal fluids move outward...|$|R
25|$|Nepenthes {{digestive}} fluids are sterile before pitchers {{open and}} contain secondary metabolites and proteins {{that act as}} bactericides and fungicides after the pitcher opens. While the digestive fluid is being produced, the pitcher is not yet open, {{so there is no}} chance of <b>microbial</b> <b>contamination.</b> During pitcher development, at least 29 digestive proteins including proteases, chitinases, pathogenesis-related proteins and thaumatin-like proteins are produced in the pitcher fluid. In addition to breaking down prey, these can act as antimicrobial agents. When the pitchers open, the fluid is exposed to bacteria, fungal spores, insects and rain. Often pitchers have a lid that covers the trap, excepting a few (e.g. N. lowii, N. attenboroughii and N. jamban), preventing rain water from entering. The lid inhibits rainwater from diluting the digestive fluid. Once the bacteria and fungi enter the fluid, secondary metabolites are produced in addition to antimicrobial proteins. Naphthoquinones, a class of secondary metabolite, are commonly produced, and these either kill or inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria and fungi. This adaptation could have evolved since Nepenthes plants that could produce secondary metabolites and antimicrobial proteins to kill bacteria and fungi were most likely more fit. Plants that produced antimicrobial compounds could prevent loss of valuable nutrients gained from insects within the pitcher. Since Nepenthes cannot digest certain bacteria and fungi, the bactericides and fungicides allow plants to maximize nutrient uptake.|$|E
500|$|Also defined herewith: eggshell, yolk, albumen; chalaza. The organic vessel {{containing}} the zygote, in which birds develop until hatching. Eggs are usually oval in shape, {{and have a}} base white colour from the predominant calcium carbonate makeup of the outer shell, called the eggshell, though [...] birds especially may have eggs of other colours, such as through deposition of biliverdin and its zinc chelate, which give a green or blue ground colour, and protoporphyrin which produces reds and browns. A viable bird egg (as opposed to a non-viable egg: see [...] ) consists {{of a number of}} structures. The eggshell is 95–97% calcium carbonate crystals, at least in chickens, stabilized by a protein matrix, without which the crystalline structure would be too brittle to keep its form; the organic matrix is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and <b>microbial</b> <b>contamination,</b> prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and water exchange for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Inside the eggshell are two shell membranes (inner and outer), and at the center is a yolk—a spherical structure, usually some shade of yellow, to which the fertilized gamete attaches and which the embryonic bird uses as sustenance as it grows. The yolk is suspended in the albumen (also called egg white or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. The albumen protects the yolk and provides additional nutrition for the embryo's growth, though it is made up of approximately 90% water in most birds. Prior to fertilization, the yolk is a single cell ovum or egg cell; one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{important}} {{area of contact}} lens research deals with patient compliance. Compliance is a major issue pertaining {{to the use of}} contact lenses because patient noncompliance often leads to contamination of the lens, storage case, or both. However, careful users can extend the wear of lenses through proper handling: there is, unfortunately, no disinterested research on the issue of [...] "compliance" [...] or the length of time a user can safely wear a lens beyond its stated use. The introduction of multipurpose solutions and daily disposable lenses have helped to alleviate some of the problems observed from inadequate cleaning but new methods of combating <b>microbial</b> <b>contamination</b> are currently being developed. A silver-impregnated lens case has been developed which helps to eradicate any potentially contaminating microbes that come in contact with the lens case. Additionally, a number of antimicrobial agents are being developed that have been embedded into contact lenses themselves. Lenses with covalently attached selenium molecules have been shown to reduce bacterial colonization without adversely affecting the cornea of a rabbit eye and octylglucoside used as a lens surfactant significantly decreases bacterial adhesion. These compounds are of particular interest to contact lens manufacturers and prescribing optometrists because they do not require any patient compliance to effectively attenuate the effects of bacterial colonization.|$|E

The test detects endotoxins and non-endotoxins, such as fungal spores, Gram-positive bacteria and their lipoteichoic acid moiety and pyrogenic dust particles with high sensitivity, thus reflecting the total inflammatory capacity of a sample.

40|$|Sensing of {{pathogens}} by innate {{immune cells}} {{is essential for}} the initiation of appropriate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are highly sensitive for various structurally and evolutionary conserved molecules derived from microbes have a prominent role in this process. TLR engagement results in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which induces the expression of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. The exquisite sensitivity of TLR signalling can be exploited for the detection of bacteria and microbial contaminants in tissue cultures and in protein preparations. Here we describe a cellular reporter system for the detection of TLR ligands in biological samples. The well-characterized human monocytic THP- 1 cell line was chosen as host for an NF-ᴋB-inducible enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene. We studied the sensitivity of the resultant reporter cells for a variety of microbial components and observed a strong reactivity towards TLR 1 / 2 and TLR 2 / 6 ligands. Mycoplasma lipoproteins are potent TLR 2 / 6 agonists and we demonstrate that our reporter cells can be used as reliable and robust detection system for mycoplasma contaminations in cell cultures. In addition, a TLR 4 -sensitive subline of our reporters was engineered, and probed with recombinant proteins expressed in different host systems. Bacterially expressed but not mammalian expressed proteins induced strong reporter activity. We also tested proteins expressed in an E. coli strain engineered to lack TLR 4 agonists. Such preparations also induced reporter activation in THP- 1 cells highlighting the importance of testing recombinant protein preparations for <b>microbial</b> <b>contaminations</b> beyond endotoxins.
