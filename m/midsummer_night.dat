5|$|Although List {{wanted to}} become an artist and scholar, he reluctantly agreed to his father's insistence that he enter the family's leather goods business. During his leisure time he devoted himself to writing and {{sketching}} as well as rambling, riding, or rowing in the countryside, becoming both {{a member of the}} Viennese rowing club Donauhort and the secretary of the Austrian Alpine Association (Österreichischer Alpenverein). He was involved in both solitary and group expeditions into the Austrian Alps, and it was on one of the latter journeys that he left his mountaineering group to spend <b>Midsummer</b> <b>night</b> alone atop the Geiselberg hillfort. On 24 June 1875 he and four friends rowed down the Danube before camping for the night {{at the site of the}} ancient Roman fortification of Carnuntum to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the Battle of Carnuntum, in which Germanic tribes defeated the Roman Army. List later claimed that while his friends caroused, he celebrated the event with a fire and by burying eight bottles of wine in the shape of a swastika beneath the arch of the monument's Pagan Gate.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} aspect of modern May Day {{celebrations}} is {{the preparation of}} a flower wreath from wild flowers, although {{as a result of}} urbanisation there is an increasing trend to buy wreaths from flower shops. The flowers are placed on the wreath against a background of green leaves and the wreath is hung either on the entrance to the family house/apartment or on a balcony. It remains there until <b>midsummer</b> <b>night.</b> On that night, the flower wreaths are set alight in bonfires known as St John’s fires. Youths leap over the flames consuming the flower wreaths. This custom has also practically disappeared, like the theatrical revival of Adonis/Dionysus/Maios, as a result of rising urban traffic and with no alternative public grounds in most Greek city neighbourhoods, not to mention potential conflicts with demonstrating workers.|$|E
500|$|Shearer and Leslie Howard, with a {{combined}} age over 75, played the teenage lovers in George Cukor's MGM 1936 film version. Neither critics nor the public responded enthusiastically. Cinemagoers considered the film too [...] "arty", staying away as they had from Warner's A <b>Midsummer</b> <b>Night</b> Dream a year before: leading to Hollywood abandoning the Bard for over a decade. [...] Renato Castellani won the Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival for his 1954 film of Romeo and Juliet. His Romeo, Laurence Harvey, was already an experienced screen actor. By contrast, Susan Shentall, as Juliet, was a secretarial student who was discovered by the director in a London pub and was cast for her [...] "pale sweet skin and honey-blonde hair".|$|E

This may have been partly from unfavorable comparison of her works to her husband's, but likely also due to family responsibilities.|$|E

2500|$|In 1602 Beeston was {{involved}} in a serious scandal involving a charge of rape. The evidence is recorded in the Minute Books of Bridewell prison. A woman named Margaret White, the widow of a cloth worker, accused him of raping her on <b>Midsummer</b> <b>night</b> and leaving her pregnant. Beeston denied the charge, in a riotous hearing attended by his fellow actors who [...] "much abused the place". The hearing recommended that Beeston be prosecuted, but no records of a trial survive; it appears that the case did not follow through, perhaps for lack of evidence.|$|E

2500|$|The short {{was written}} by Borst and {{produced}} by DiRaffaele in Adobe Flash {{over the course of}} two months. Daymond, who provides the voice of SwaySway, was found on a casting call website and invited into the apartment of DiRaffaele to audition. Originally a one-off, Breadwinners premiered at the <b>Midsummer</b> <b>Night</b> Toons short film festival in New York City, where they wanted to entertain their colleagues. The short was uploaded to YouTube to positive reception, and after obtaining 10,000 to 15,000 views on its first week, Borst explained, [...] "it just took {{on a life of its}} own." [...] The creators linked it to Nickelodeon after users expressed wanting more. Upon receiving an inquiry from a Nickelodeon executive, DiRaffaele was doubtful of the offer, joking that he [...] "thought it was spam".

2500|$|Neither critics nor {{the public}} responded enthusiastically, {{although}} Robert Osborne {{has stated that}} the film was a success when he hosted a telecast of it on Turner Classic Movies. Graham Greene wrote that he was [...] "less than ever convinced {{that there is an}} aesthetic justification for filming Shakespeare at all... the effect of even the best scenes is to distract." [...] Cinemagoers considered the film too [...] "arty", staying away as they had from Warner's A <b>Midsummer</b> <b>Night</b> Dream a year before: leading to Hollywood abandoning the Bard for over a decade. The film nevertheless received four Oscar nominations. Subsequent film versions would make use of less experienced, but more photogenic, actors in the central roles. Cukor, interviewed in 1970, said of his film: [...] "It's one picture that if I had to do over again, I'd know how. I'd get the garlic and the Mediterranean into it." ...|$|E
