25|$|A smart TV {{device is}} either a {{television}} set with integrated Internet capabilities or a set-top box for television that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary basic television set. Smart TVs may {{be thought of as}} an information appliance or the computer system from a handheld computer integrated within a television set unit, as such a smart TV often allows the user to install and run more advanced applications or plugins/addons based on a specific platform. Smart TVs run a complete operating system or <b>mobile</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> software providing a platform for application developers.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the growing}} number of {{products}} and the need for interconnection between them, compatibility standardization in ICT has gained considerable importance during the last decade, creating network externalities for the users and increasing returns for the producers. Standards can be created by market or committee-based mechanisms but also by a combination of both types. One goal of a standard in high-technology markets can be to decrease the uncertainty faced by users and producers. For example, in <b>mobile</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems,</b> Symbian is an alliance of firms, which have common interest in the success of this <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> This research aims to shed light on the processes involved in the creation and diffusion of a standard in <b>mobile</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> in the telecommunication sector. In other words, what are the mechanisms to create and diffuse a standard in the case of <b>mobile</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems?</b> Why are these mechanisms used and with what implications? The study will survey several actors involved in <b>mobile</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> standardisation with both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. The theories of the product lifecycle (dominant product design) and technological paradigm are to be used...|$|R

Within a single year Android had passed the installed base of the BlackBerry in the United States. By February 2016, only 1.59 million (0.8%) of the 198.9 million smartphone users in the United States were running BlackBerry compared to 104.82 million (52.7%) running Android.|$|E

With Microsoft's <b>mobile</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> Windows Phone, full Xbox Live functionality is integrated into new Windows Phones that launched since late 2010. The service shut down for the original Xbox on April 15, 2010, and original Xbox Games are now only playable online through local area network (LAN) tunneling applications such as XLink Kai.|$|E
25|$|Android is a <b>mobile</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> {{developed}} by Google, {{based on the}} Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, digital cameras, PCs and other electronics.|$|E
