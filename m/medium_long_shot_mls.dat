50|$|All {{sorts of}} camera shots {{are used in}} the film. Some of which include extreme <b>long</b> <b>shots,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>long</b> <b>shots,</b> {{full-body}} shots, close-ups, medium close-up, and so on. An example of a close-up shot used in the film could be the main character’s spontaneous yells while driving. By this, would emphasize pure happiness and freedom that he had not felt in a long time.|$|R

50|$|Then, {{there is}} the <b>medium</b> <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> which makes the subject and the setting have equal {{importance}} and has the two about 50/50 in the frame. Then is the medium shot which emphasizes the character and is about a knees to waist up type shot. Then the medium close up is a shot that has the waist to the chest and up. The next closest shot is the close up which has the shoulders and up or maybe a little tighter on the head.|$|R
2500|$|Proxemics is an {{essential}} component of cinematic mise-en-scène, the placement of characters, props and scenery within a frame, creating visual weight and movement. [...] There are two aspects to the consideration of proxemics in this context, the first being character proxemics, which addresses such questions as: [...] How much space is there between the characters? [...] What is suggested by characters who are close to (or, conversely, far away from) each other? [...] Do distances change as the film progresses? [...] and, Do distances depend on the film's other content? [...] The other consideration is camera proxemics, which answers the single question: How far away is the camera from the characters/action? [...] Analysis of camera proxemics typically relates Hall's system of proxemic patterns to the camera angle used to create a specific <b>shot,</b> with the <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> or extreme <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> becoming the public proxemic, a full shot (sometimes called a figure shot, complete view, or <b>medium</b> <b>long</b> <b>shot)</b> becoming the social proxemic, the medium shot becoming the personal proxemic, and the close up or extreme close up becoming the intimate proxemic.|$|R
30|$|The {{standard}} {{measure of the}} size of the character in the movie frame has shown a change across time. Salt (2006, 2009), Cutting and Armstrong (2018), and Cutting et al. (2012) have shown that the size of the character’s head in movie frames has increased in movies from the 1910 s to 2010. In silent film and early sound film, the average shot scale across a whole movie was a <b>medium</b> <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> (showing the character from knees up) whereas, as cameras got smaller and more mobile, by 2015 it was closer to a medium closeup (showing the character from the chest up). This change makes the character’s facial expressions and emotions easier to discern. In contrast, Study 6 showed that the fluctuation patterns in shot scale across movies has essentially remained unchanged between 1940 and 2010.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel semantic-oriented video analysis {{system for the}} basketball game videos. Based on Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), it may bridge this gap between the low-level features describing image/video structure and the high-level knowledge. We apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify and track the ball, the shooter, and the basket as the lowlevel features. Based on these features, our BBN framework can identify four categories of shot event such as short <b>shot,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>shot,</b> <b>long</b> <b>shot,</b> free throw, and the scoring event. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our system may interpret the video shots in terms of four different shot events and one scoring event effectively. 1...|$|R
25|$|He was {{relatively}} sparing in {{his use of}} camera movements and close-ups, preferring static <b>medium</b> or <b>long</b> <b>shots,</b> with his players framed against dramatic vistas or interiors lit in an Expressionistic style, although he often used panning shots and sometimes used a dramatic dolly in (e.g. John Wayne's first appearance in Stagecoach). Ford is famous for his exciting tracking shots, such as the Apache chase sequence in Stagecoach or {{the attack on the}} Comanche camp in The Searchers.|$|R
50|$|The {{landscape}} {{itself is}} realistic, and Visconti takes great care to situate his {{characters in a}} rural Italy that remains {{for the most part}} unromanticized. Nearly the entire story is told using <b>medium</b> and <b>long</b> <b>shots,</b> with Visconti choosing to employ close-ups only at moments of intense emotion. Characters are depicted interacting with and moving around within their environment; to this effect, Visconti favors <b>long</b> and ponderous <b>shots</b> while making use of depth of focus to highlight the variety of action occurring throughout the space of the frame.|$|R
500|$|Like all Hawks' comedies, {{the film}} {{is known for its}} fast pace (despite being filmed {{primarily}} in <b>long</b> <b>medium</b> <b>shots,</b> with little cross-cutting). Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich, [...] "You get more pace if you pace the actors quickly within the frame rather than cross cutting fast".|$|R

[...] Or, as actor/director Charlie Chaplin put it: [...] "Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long shot." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{close-up}} or closeup in filmmaking, television production, still {{photography and}} {{the comic strip}} medium {{is a type of}} shot, which tightly frames a person or an object. Close-ups are one of the standard shots used regularly with <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> and <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> (cinematic techniques). Close-ups display the most detail, but they do not include the broader scene. Moving in to a close-up or away from a close-up is a common type of zooming.|$|R
30|$|Once {{the video}} {{sequence}} has been divided into shots and the keyframes have been selected, low-level descriptors are extracted {{to describe the}} audio-visual soccer content. Audio descriptors (Kim et al. 2005) {{play a crucial role}} in the summarization process of soccer sequences because the most important events tend to happen where the audio presents concrete features. For example in a goal occasion the audio power suddenly increases and in a referee’s whistle instance specific harmonics are spotted at concrete frequency ranges. Motion descriptors (Sikora 2001) describe the level of action in the scene (e.g. the peace in a panoramic view or the high intensity movement in a goal occasion) and at the same time they can provide information about camera operations such as pannings, tiltings, zooms-in, etc. These descriptors are efficiently computed exploiting the motion compensation information provided in the MPEG streams. Color descriptors (Sikora 2001) in soccer events help in recognizing the type of view of the field (close-up <b>shot,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>shot,</b> <b>long</b> <b>shot,</b> the stands, etc.). The color descriptors have been calculated using the MPEG- 7 Low Level Feature Extraction Library (Bastan et al. 2010).|$|R
50|$|Carr scored 9,176 {{points in}} his NBA career. Carr {{had a strong}} ability to manage the ball down low, even as a small center. He {{is known for his}} power and dunking, and his ability to hit <b>medium</b> to <b>long</b> jump <b>shots</b> under pressure. He made 50% of his {{attempts}} from the floor and shot 78% from the free throw line. After receiving an eye injury, Carr wore orange-tinted Oakley sunglasses {{for the rest of his}} NBA career.|$|R
50|$|Paul O’Brien {{relates the}} episode to ‘Beatlemania {{was in its}} hysterical early days, and Duke's {{appearances}} brilliantly mimic Elvis Presley’s effect on late 50s audiences’. He notes that {{at this stage in}} the series ‘the characters were well established with the viewers’ and ‘Dennis was able to have some fun sending them up.’ He compares Commander Shore and King Titan as ‘representing the older generation’s incomprehension’. He goes on to praise production and use of models, ‘Several other episodes are let down by close-ups of smaller versions which should only have been used for <b>medium</b> or <b>long</b> <b>shots,</b> so it’s nice to see the big version in all its glory.’ He does however describe the scene evolving Troy running as ‘a total failure and looks like the puppet is being stretched on a rack'. Vincent Law states that 'Titan Goes Pop' ‘sends up teen culture' and describes the episode as a classic.|$|R
5000|$|The first motion-picture {{adaptation}} {{of an actual}} burlesque show was Hollywood Revels (1946). Much of the action was filmed in <b>medium</b> or <b>long</b> <b>shots,</b> because the production was staged in a theater and the camera photographed the stage from a distance. In 1947, film producer W. Merle Connell reinvented the filmed burlesque show by restaging the action especially for films, in a studio, where he could control the camerawork, lighting and sound, providing close-ups and other studio photographic and editorial techniques. His 1951 production French Follies recreates a classic American burlesque presentation, with stage curtains, singing emcee, dances by showgirls and strippers, comic sketches and a finale featuring the star performer. The highlight is the famous burlesque routine [...] "Crazy House", popularized earlier by Abbott and Costello. Another familiar sketch, [...] "Slowly I Turned" [...] (later famous as a Three Stooges routine), was filmed for Connell's 1953 feature A Night in Hollywood.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a written}} {{description}} of a given sequence in a film in order of the shots. According to Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, when doing shot-by-shot analysis, we start with describing the techniques used in the shots or images we are analyzing. After that, {{we also need to}} elaborate what effects these techniques can produce when viewing the movie; for example, camera leads what we see in the film so the changes in camera angles have impact on audience's interpretations of the meanings the movie tries to convey. Some of the techniques used in film producing could be composition (foreground/background, frame/raming, etc.), cinematography (close-up, <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> and <b>long</b> <b>shot,</b> pan shot, tilt shot, etc.), editing (montage, eyeline match, etc.), and so on.|$|R
500|$|Three {{models of}} the Nostromo were made: a [...] version for <b>medium</b> and <b>long</b> <b>shots,</b> a [...] version for rear shots, and a , [...] rig for the {{undocking}} and planetoid surface sequences. Scott insisted on numerous changes to the models even as filming was taking place, leading to conflicts with the modeling and filming teams. The Nostromo was originally yellow, and the team filmed shots of the models for six weeks before Johnson left to work on The Empire Strikes Back. Scott then ordered it changed to gray, and the team had to begin shooting again from scratch. He asked {{that more and more}} pieces be added to the model such that the final version (with the refinery) required a metal framework so that it could be hoisted by a forklift. He also took a hammer and chisel to sections of the refinery, knocking off many of the spires that Bower had spent weeks creating. Scott also had disagreements with miniature-effects cinematographer Dennis Ayling over how to light the models.|$|R

30|$|Many systems combine local {{features}} {{derived from}} a segmented image with global features of the frame. In Kijak et al. [7], shot features are computed for each shot and one keyframe is extracted {{from the beginning of}} the shot. The features were shot length, camera motion amount, colour descriptor, and relative player position. The baseball highlight system of Chang and Gong [9] uses a field descriptor, an edge descriptor, grass amount, sand amount, camera motion, and player height. A probabilistic measure is used for the segmentation. The four types of highlights then comprise of defined sequences of scene shots. Each HMM has between three and five states with the transitions controlled by what order of scene shots constitute a particular highlight. Assfalg's soccer highlight system [10] used a discrete 3 -state left-to-right HMM model for each highlight type, noting that the three states correspond well to the evolution of the highlights in terms of characteristic content. The features used were a framing term (whether very <b>long</b> <b>shot,</b> <b>long</b> <b>shot,</b> or <b>medium</b> <b>long</b> shot); pan and tilt quantised in 5 and 2 levels. Three extra features to reflect player position were also investigated. In Rea's snooker system [11], the relative position and temporal behaviour of the white ball was considered on the snooker table over the duration of a clip. A colour-based particle filter was employed to robustly track the snooker balls.|$|R

50|$|Extreme <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> {{are usually}} {{done in a}} high angle so the viewer can look down upon a setting or scene. Extreme <b>longs</b> <b>shots</b> are used mainly to open the scene or {{narrative}} and show the viewer the setting. The rest of the shots are most typically done in an eye level or point of view shot although {{it is possible to}} do any shot with any angle. There is the <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> which shows the subject even though the setting still dominates the picture frame.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{wants to}} explore <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> {{alongside}} with stylization in cinema. 	Through three directors are explored possibility and problematic of cinematographic expression through <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> and stylization. Stylisation is connected mainly with mis-en-scène and particular {{aspects of it}} – acting, film decoration/props, film space, film sound, [...] . 	The terms stylisation and <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> (plan-séquence) are analysed and explored on its own and in the films of the chosen directors. 	The main analysed directors are Andrei Tarkovsky, Carl Th. Dreyer and Béla Tarr and their three films (in the same order) - Sacrifice, Gertrud and Satantango. 	The chosen directors are {{from my point of}} view the best example of the use of stylisation and <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> due to their artistic clarity and coherence. 	I try to base this work mostly on my own analysis and thoughts about <b>long</b> <b>shots</b> and stylisation based on the literature, films and my own film works, although I also use quotations from directors/authors and quotations from theoretical works. 	The thesis in its form is closest to the analytic and essay study...|$|R
