5|$|A {{connection}} to the defunct LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch, {{not part of the}} main project, was proposed in 1963 and again in 1967, as were branches along other LIRR lines to outer Queens areas without rapid transit service. An alternate to the Southeast Queens line was also proposed in 1963 and again in 1967 {{as an extension of the}} IND Fulton Street Line, east from Euclid Avenue under Pitkin Avenue and Linden Boulevard, or east from Lefferts Boulevard under Liberty Avenue. Both options would continue east to Jamaica, then turn south under Merrick Boulevard to Springfield Boulevard. The Rockaway extension and both Fulton Line extensions were previously proposed as part of the 1929 and 1939 IND Second System plans, and were ultimately not incorporated into the <b>main</b> <b>Program</b> For Action plan.|$|E

The 2000–01 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the <b>main</b> <b>program.</b> Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted {{to know what was going}} on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army {{announced}} that {{they had decided to}} terminate all work on the Comanche program. At the time, it was stated that the Army had determined that a number of upgrades would be necessary in order for the RAH-66 to be capable of surviving on the battlefield in the face of current anti-aircraft threats; however, the Army had instead decided to re-direct the bulk of its funding for rotary development toward the renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack, utility, and reconnaissance aircraft. Specifically, the Army also had plans to reuse the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9billion. The contract termination fees involved were estimated to total US$450–680million for the <b>main</b> <b>program</b> partners Sikorsky and Boeing.|$|E

5|$|The {{encryption}} {{resembles the}} RSA algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-byte blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position permutation, then the bits are {{split into two}} 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 bits of the second byte and the 8 bits of the first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 bits of the third byte and the 4 high bits of the second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually encrypted by taking them to the 3491st power, mod 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes. The encrypted text is then stored in a string variable {{as part of the}} program. To shroud the would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with the simple Lzw before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler compresses the <b>main</b> <b>program</b> code into the executable, this was not that necessary.|$|E

The half-hour program was fed twice to allow affiliates to carry one or both broadcasts. NBC canceled the program after a year, {{and replaced it with}} NBC News at Sunrise, originally anchored by Connie Chung.|$|E
25|$|The camp's {{operations}} {{are divided into}} two seasons, Summertime and Christmastime. The <b>main</b> <b>program</b> is presented during the summer, in which ten weeks are divided for Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venture Scouts. The Christmas season runs for a single week and summarizes the summer's offerings open for both Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. A short three-to-four-day camp has also been offered during Spring Break with a similar program to the one offered during the Christmas camp. The camp also operates off-season for special troop activities or external groups that wish to experience the outdoor spirit of the reservation.|$|E
25|$|A simple example {{would be}} a GPU program that {{collects}} data about average lighting values as it renders some view from either a camera or a computer graphics program back to the <b>main</b> <b>program</b> on the CPU, so that the CPU can then make adjustments to the overall screen view. A more advanced example might use edge detection to return both numerical information and a processed image representing outlines to a computer vision program controlling, say, a mobile robot. Because the GPU has fast and local hardware access to every pixel or other picture element in an image, it can analyze and average it (for the first example) or apply a Sobel edge filter or other convolution filter (for the second) with much greater speed than a CPU, which typically must access slower random-access memory copies of the graphic in question.|$|E

On that date, a half-hour extension of Breakfast Television began airing exclusively on CityNews Channel weekdays from 9-9:30a.m. (the program continues {{to run from}} 5:30-9 a.m. on Citytv Toronto). The 9 a.m. extension on CityNews Channel includes fewer references to {{being part of the}} main BT program itself and is formatted similarly to the previously-added 5:30a.m. half-hour; though, [...] "Live Eye" [...] reports are included as with the 6-9 a.m. portion of the <b>main</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E

The College Bowl quiz show was also sponsored by GE. The original does not include Santa traveling to the Island of Misfit Toys, but does include a scene {{near the end of the}} special in which Yukon Cornelius discovers a peppermint mine near Santa's workshop. He can be seen throughout the special tossing his pickax into the air, sniffing, then licking the end that contacts the snow or ice. Discarded in 1965 to make room for Santa traveling to the Island of Misfit toys, the audience was left to assume that Cornelius was attempting to find either silver or gold by taste alone.|$|E
