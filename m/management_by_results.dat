It is an institutional financing mechanism for allocating resources of advanced conceptual design and high strategic impact, which provides funding on the basis of results and allows institutions to generate transformative initiatives, capable of facing structural problems of different nature that can significantly improve their academic quality. For a system of higher education that has to face important challenges, the PBA offer relevant opportunities in the strengthening of organizational efforts and resources towards the achievement of outstanding outcomes, generation of competitive advantages and strategic positioning in functional or knowledge areas that can be improved and replicated in other institutions. Performance agreements consider an institutional plan of improvement, agreed between both parties, that is implemented with <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> and a monitoring and evaluation process based on indicators and performance.|$|E

5000|$|Management by {{objectives}} (MBO), {{also known}} as <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> (MBR), was first popularized by Peter Drucker in his 1954 book The Practice of Management. Management by objectives {{is the process of}} defining specific objectives within an organization that [...] management can convey to organization members, then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence. This process allows managers to take work {{that needs to be done}} one step at a time to allow for a calm, yet productive work environment. This process also helps organization members to see their accomplishments as they achieve each objective, which reinforces a positive work environment and a sense of achievement. An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an employee's actual performance with the standards set. Ideally, when employees themselves have been involved with the goal-setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them, they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities.According to George S. Odiorne, the system of management by objectives can be described as a process whereby the superior and subordinate jointly identify common goals, define each individual's major areas of responsibility in terms of the results expected of him or her, and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members.|$|E

He understood that Brazil's civil service reform had already been made since the 1930s and initiated the managerial reform of the state. He elaborated a white paper, the [...] "Plano Diretor da Reforma do Aparelho do Estado", and developed a theoretical framework for this reform, which, on the managerial perspective, was based on <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results,</b> on competition for excellence between the state organizations, and on a formal system of social accountability and, on the structural perspective, {{on the creation of}} the [...] "social organizations" [...] - non-profit private organizations to which the state should transfer its large social and scientific services that don’t involve the use of state power. He also proposed an amendment to the chapter on the public administration of the 1988 Constitution. This managerial reform of the state is happening in Brazil, mainly at state and municipal levels, but also at the federal level, while a large number of social organizations continue to be created. The Brazilian 1999 managerial reform turned into an international reference. The books and papers that Bresser-Pereira wrote on the subject turned the main element in the courses on public administration offered by the Brazilian universities. Several Master and PhD dissertations have been written on the reform. While in MARE, Bresser-Pereira was also president of :es:Centro Latinoamericano de Administración para el Desarrollo - CLAD between 1995 and 1997. In his term, he gave to the managerial reform a Latin American dimension, and with the same objective, he organized the first yearly congress of CLAD, which is today CLAD's key activity.|$|E

In the present study, the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> process at the University of Jyväskylä is examined from a critical point of view using two sociological analytical devices, fashion and social interaction, as developed by Georg Simmel (1908, 1917, 1986). Within social interaction, different perspectives are used: rites, power and politics, and culture. The study represents an ethnographic way of writing and studying in that it is a record of the ethnic heterogeneity of a number of people at a certain place and time. The social interaction obtaining the steering process between the Management/Central Administration of the University and the Ministry of Education appears to be satisfactory. However, according to the interviewees, the process does not fully {{meet the needs of the}} Faculties and Departments. In conclusion, it is suggested that the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> system represents the modern era of universities. In this modern era, the universities are - even more than during the era before the performance-oriented management - treated similarly to any public sector organisations accountable to the government. At the same time, the power of discipline-rooted authority has declined in relation to institutional authority. Besides their traditional tasks and duties in the area of research and education, the universities have started to co-operate with local business and industries and by facilitating transfer of expertise to working life. This development also puts the stress on the need to develop the present <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> steering system. The universities are responsible for their results not only to the Ministry of Education but also to the broader community, that is, citizens and business.

The Fiscal Survey of the States in the late nineties called performance budgeting for government agencies “the most significant trend in state budgeting. ” 1 In public higher education, this practice emerged as the budgeting phenomenon of the decade. A survey by the Rockefeller Institute of Government in June of 2000 showed that nearly three-quarters of the states considered performance in budgeting for public colleges and universities. 2 This phenomenon emerged from the movements to reengineer business and reinvent government in the early 1990 s. 3 Those movements preached a novel gospel for American business and a new heresy for state government and higher education.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis {{article will}} focus on the central role played by {{imperfect}} or incomplete markets in the spread and perpetuation of recessionary situations. It is a known fact that demand volatility perpetuates such situations, and this can only be mitigated by sustainable economic stimulus policies. Macrofiscal rules, which are important for enhancing the tarnished credibility of State action, need to combine two basic principles: responsibility and stability. This means preserving regulation mechanisms so that excessive macroeconomic fluctuations can be stabilized. The best thing the authorities can do is to use flexible intervention policies to prevent such fluctuations. The new paradigm of public <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> thus entails setting clear fiscal rules with medium-term targets and short-term stabilization capabilities, but it must also involve allocating a larger and larger proportion of public expenditure on a multi-year basis. In seeking to combine stable economic growth with proper implementation of the plans and programmes voted for by citizens, public management faces three essential challenges: adhering to a macrofiscal rule over the cycle, identifying structural deficits as they arise, and correcting the traditional bias against investment. This article will look at some recent efforts to deal explicitly with these serious obstacles by applying legal provisions designed to cope with the uncertainties that surround both the cyclical behaviour of the economy and calculations of its long-term growth potential...|$|E

40|$|Arviointitutkimus koskee Suomen talouden ytimen, valtiokonsernin talousohjauksen tilaa vuosien 1987 - 2008 uudistuskauden jälkeen. Mihin oli tultu vuonna 2008 ja miten talousohjausjärjestelmä toimii? Arvioinnin kohteena on myös se, miten ohjausjärjestelmän tila vastaa 2010 -luvun haasteita. Arviointiaineiston muodostavat uudistuskauden dokumentit sekä ohjausjärjestelmän kaikkien tasojen eduskunnan, hallituksen, valtiovarainministeriön, ministeriöiden, virastojen ja laitosten sekä tarkastusviranomaisten haastattelut. Vastaavaa lähestymistapaa ei suomalaisessa hallinnontutkimuksessa ole aikaisemmin sovellettu. Arviointi tukeutuu kompleksisuusteoreettiseen viitekehykseen. Kompleksisuusteoriaa ei ole myöskään vastaavalla tavalla hyödynnetty. Tutkimus on siten sekä lähestymistapansa että teoriaulottuvuutensa osalta pioneerityötä, jota ei ole voitu perustaa aiempaan tutkimukseen. Sellaisena se avaa, vaatii ja osoittaa useita jatkotutkimustarpeita. Tutkimuksen päätuloksia ovat ensinnäkin se, että talousohjauksen ytimen, finanssipolitiikan ohjausrakenne on tasapainossa uudistustavoitteiden kanssa ja sellaisena se tukee talouden kokonaishallintaa. Toiseksi tutkimustulokset osoittavat, että tulosohjaustavoitteet, tuottavuus, taloudellisuus ja vaikuttavuus eivät ole toteutuneet talousarviolain edellyttämällä tavalla. Laki ja käytännön toiminta ovat kaukana tasapainosta. Lain vaatimukset ovat taakkana toimijoille. Taakka ei kuitenkaan näy suoraan menoina momenteilla ja siksi se ei ole saanut osakseen ansaitsemaansa huomiota. Kolmantena uudistustavoitteena ollut demokraattisen ohjauksen vahvistaminen näyttää valtiokonsernin osalta rakenteellisesti toteutuneen. Toimivuuden kannalta rakenne on kuitenkin vielä niin uusi, että erityisesti eduskunnan näkökulmasta sen toimivuutta on vaikea arvioida. 2010 -luvun haasteiden kannalta tutkimuksessa tulee esiin joukko riskitekijöitä. Yksi niistä on talousohjauksen päätoimijan, valtiovarainministeriön ohjausrakenne. Se näyttää olevan epätasapainossa ministeriön kasvaneiden vastuiden kanssa. Taloudellisesti vaikeina aikoina valtiovarainministeriön rooli lisäksi korostuu järjestelmälogiikan mukasesti talouden tasapainottajana. Ministeriön ohjausrakenteella on yleistä merkitystä, koska se heijastuu koko hallinnon talousohjaukseen. Se voi olla sille joko tukena tai taakkana. In the {{administrative}} reforms of 1987 - 2008 in Finland {{the state as}} a whole was divided into three parts the core state, autonomous parts and actors operating in market conditions. The structural division was taken further when in 2010 the universities were split off from the financial governance of the core state to join the autonomous actors. Each part of the state body has its own financial governance. The study is confined to reforms in the system of financial governance of a state concern (core state) and the functionality of the system of governance after the reforms. This is an evaluative study assessing first the reforms in the structure and governance tools and thereafter their functionality. The structural research is based chiefly on documentary material from the era of reform. The functionality of the structures is evaluated from the perspectives of Parliament, the Government, the Ministry of Finance, the ministries, agencies and institutions and also the inspectorate. The functionality evaluation is based on 96 personal interviews with actors in charge of governance, the elite in financial governance. The object of the evaluation was the main finances under overall control and the objectives set for <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> of improving productivity, economy of operations and effectiveness. As the reforms progressed, it became a political objective to strengthen democracy or political governance in financial governance. This, too, was made a target of evaluation. The evaluation relies on the concepts of complexity theory. It was the working hypothesis of the study that through the concepts of the theory {{it would be possible to}} explain and comprehend reform processes, the functionality of the reforms and the problems experienced in them. In the study of the structure the main criterion was the complexity theory concept far from a state of equilibrium and in the study of functionality the concept of significance. No such complexity theory based study in the field of administrative science has so far been presented in Finland. Thus on the basis of the study the applicability of complexity theory to the research of reform processes and the functionality of reforms was evaluated. In the study of structure the research question was how after the reforms of 1987 - 2008 the governance structure of a state financial governance system is in a state of equilibrium with the goals of the reforms. The question in the study of functionality was how the financial governance system of a state concern functioned after the reforms from the perspectives of various actors. Likewise thereafter an answer was sought in the nature of triangulation to how the situation of the financial governance system structure and functionality appear to be in equilibrium with the challenges to financial governance apparent in the 2010 s. Is the financial governance system a support, burden or risk to the challenges of the 2010 s? In summary the answers to the research questions in light of the evaluation of the structure and functionality data are as follows: 1. The core of financial governance, the governance structure of financial policy and its functionality would appear to be almost in equilibrium with the goals of financial overall administration. In this respect the structure also supports overall financial governance. 2. The objectives of productivity, economical and efficacy in <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> would appear to be very far from being in equilibrium with respect to the requirements of the budgetary legislation (Talousarviolaki). Due to shortcomings in accounting and evaluation systems the objectives has not been achieved. Thus the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> structure would appear to be a burden on financial governance and administration of the state economy as a whole. The structure of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> would appear to be in a state of disintegration 3. The aim of strengthening democracy through the structural reforms of the 2000 s appears to have been achieved. However, the structure is still mostly so new that its functionality, especially as regards Parliament, is difficult to evaluate. The structure appears mostly to support overall financial management, but this may entail risks from the perspective of overall financial management. 4. The situation of financial governance, from the perspective of the challenges of the 2010 s would appear, as far as financial policy is concerned to be almost in equilibrium with the policy challenges, but from the perspective of overall financial management this would not appear to be the case in all respects; the situation in governance is likely to require reforms and attention to the obvious risk factors latent therein. The study permits the evaluation that complexity theory, a derivative of systems theory, would appear to be applicable to the research of reforms of complex systems and their functionality and to offer opportunities to explain and comprehend the successes and failures of reforms...|$|E

The main aim is to investigate whether research assessment is implemented and to see to what extent its results are used to revise policy strategies, identify new research priorities, allocate financial resources or enhance public understanding of R&D. The paper addresses a set of cases studies, four within Europe (UK, Finland, Italy, and Spain) and two outside (US and Japan). Each case study {{provides an}} outline of the strategies devised to improve the domestic science system; offers a map of the main actors of science policy and introduces the main performers of research assessment. A short overview of how evaluation is approached at European level is also given. The study shows that approaches vary significantly from case to case and that it is not always possible to identify a clear research evaluation framework. In some cases, new strategies have been devised to improve the research system and the process of renovation has affected the structure and the role of research assessment. Overall, official documents across countries emphasise that research evaluation is not a means in itself, and call on its use as a policy design tool. However, very few cases of “management by results” can be identified. The success of research evaluation practice is always tied to strong cultural support and it is where research assessment meets with reluctance and mistrust that it yields no fruit. The absence of an “evaluative culture” is the main obstacle to an efficient research evaluation system.

Four female and four male lecturers, four deans, four chairmen/heads of departments and four heads of ICT departments participated in the study. Questionnaires were used to collect data. A Documentary and Content Analysis was done and a Field Study carried out in March 2009 on management of higher education institutions. This paper explains the legal framework within which universities operate and it assesses how universities in Kenya are managed and the extent to which IT is used as a tool for effective management of complex operations as necessitated by increasing populations. The study was guided by the following research questions: 1. How are universities in Kenya managed? 2. What are the challenges that universities face? 3. How can university management be bettered to suit economic and social changes? The paper {{attempts to}} shed light on how higher education institutions can apply corporate knowledge management practices and carry out <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> to support every part of their mission. The paper argues that there is need for higher education institution to focus on consistent and coherent practices in the systems and procedures that are followed, which means that quality assurance should be undertaken in the context of the institutional strategic plan, these will assist in dealing with challenges and constraints facing higher education institutions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{communication}} {{intends to}} analyze the conceptions of governance and management that have characterized {{the development of the}} Priority Intervention Educational Territories Program (TEIP) in Portugal, describing its main features and examining the changes in organizational models, leadership patterns and community involvement throughout the process. Special attention will be given to the context in which priority education first emerged and took hold in Portugal, marking the emergence of new paradigms of educational management, public service and learning. Our reflection will be based upon the following: (i) analysis of the TEIP Program's legislative directives (1996 - 2008); (ii) interviews with educational administration offices’ program coordinators; and (iii) interviews and questionnaires with local actors (school directors, consultants, parents and teachers). Results suggest a growing influence on conceptions, instruments and practices which are characteristic of a new public management model (contract, evaluation, <b>management</b> <b>by</b> objectives, <b>results)</b> but which are still not wholly accepted in schools since they are viewed as a somewhat instrumental conception of education and learning. This should be taken into account in the program's development, as well as the discrepancy between goals and results...|$|R
40|$|On {{the shift}} of {{responsibility}} for compulsory schooling. The path to <b>management</b> <b>by</b> objectives and <b>results</b> {{and some of its}} consequences). The aim with this thesis is to contribute to the discussion about the responsibility for compulsory schooling in the 1990 s. The decade began with a shift of responsibility for the compulsory school, a process generally referred to as 'municipalization', which on an everyday basis makes it perfectly clear where the responsibility lies. This thesis probes a little further into the problems of the distribution of responsibility, through investigating how the issue of responsibility for the nine-year comprehensive compulsory school has been discussed and motivated over time, in order to analyse more precisely the conditions at hand as the municipalities were to take over responsibility for the different schools in the 1990 s. As a sequel to the fundamental direction of this study it enters into a discussion about the consequences following the distribution of responsibility: the effects of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> objectives and <b>results</b> on the school's cognitive approach and problematizing the issue of power and influence under the new model of responsibility. The thesis contains an analysis of how the issue of responsibility for compulsory schooling has been discussed in official commission reports over time, with the purpose of gaining {{a better understanding of the}} compulsory school in the 1990 s, and its conditions. The historical study thus focuses on the school reform conducted in the early 90 s and the three concepts seen as central to the discussion about responsibility for the compulsory school towards the end of the twentieth century: municipalization, decentralization and turning the school into a goals and achievement-related organisation. The analysis is founded upon an outlook based on discourse, aiming to distinguish any changes in the meaning of those three key expressions as well as to define shifts and discursive breaks in textual references to the responsibility for comprehensive school...|$|R

The study on information management of Pacto pela Vida (Pact for Life) of Pernambuco state shows {{the relationship among}} information, politics and power. Monitoring systematics, originated from the management model by results, Todos por Pernambuco (All for Pernambuco), requires the intensive use of accurate and relevant information. For this purpose, the government created structural, instrumental and political conditions so that information becomes one {{of the elements of}} support for the evaluation of public policies and decision-making. These assumptions lead to the thesis that the policy and <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> interfere in the information flow that subsidizes the public administration, changing the exercise of power of the tactical level actors who develop informational practices, invisible or nonexistent, in the predominantly bureaucratic administration. Theoretically, the study relies on the theoretical pluralism of information described by Braman (1989; 2009), in which several understandings of information can be associated with different stages of political decision-making. Likewise, the study uses four power exercise demonstrations: instrumental, structural, symbolic and informational, studied by the mentioned author. The objective focuses on analyzing how the political strategy and the public administration change of Pernambuco state government alter the power of the actors involved in Pacto pela Vida (Pact for Life) through the intensive use of information. The methodological procedures are composed of content analysis of interviews with governmental actors of the strategic, tactical and operational levels and the Pacto pela Vida (Pact for Life) legislation; for this purpose, NVivo software was used. The documentation and interviews were examined through the content analysis and guided by the theoretical assumption referring to information, power and politics, which constituted categories and subcategories established a priori and regrouped in compliance with Bardin (2009) who establishes the categorization as the classification of constituent elements of a set by differentiation and then by regrouping, according to gender with predefined criteria. Visits were also carried out in the Management Center by Results, Statistical and Criminal Analysis Management and in judicial district stations and neighborhood police stations to make direct observation of informational practices undertaken in these places. It can be concluded that information is in the genesis of the monitoring and evaluation process {{as well as in the}} basis of instrumental, structural, symbolic and informational powers. Information is used to exercise control over individuals, institutions, processes, results, shaping behaviors, creating and spreading ideas and images; in short, creating in the governmental and non-governmental actors? minds confidence of the benefits regarding the new model for conducting the State. The policy and <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> interfere in the information flow that subsidizes the public administration and alter the exercise of power of the tactical level actors who develop informational practices, invisible or nonexistent, in the bureaucratic administration. Thus, the thesis was confirmed. Moreover, it is recognized that the problem of information in Brazil is eminently political, once it depends on the Brazilian government's decision to make the information a resource for management and a basic tool of accountability and social control...|$|E

A pesquisa perpassa o histórico de constituição e atuação do Instituto Unibanco como instituição voltada para a assistência social e o processo que conduziu sua atuação para a educação básica. Compreende também o desenvolvimento da tecnologia Jovem de Futuro bem como a constituição da parceria com o Ministério da Educação para a transferência da mesma em conjunto com o Programa Ensino Médio Inovador. O estudo parte da abordagem qualitativa e utiliza como método para o levantamento de dados a análise documental, tanto de fontes primárias como secundárias publicadas entre os anos de 2003 e 2014. Para abordar o tema faz-se um breve estudo de referenciais teóricos que indicam a nova gestão pública, fruto do processo de reforma do Estado implementada no governo do ex-presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso, como parte do processo de inserção do setor privado na educação, tendo em vista a implantação de novos marcos regulatórios na execução das políticas públicas sociais. O levantamento indica que apesar de haver alternância de poder com a eleição do ex-presidente Lula para o governo federal, o processo de incursão do setor privado não foi interrompido, ao contrário continuou sob bases semelhantes às observadas na plataforma política anterior. Com relação ao Instituto Unibanco, a pesquisa demonstrou que o mesmo traçou como objetivo atuar na educação básica pública, bem como almejou uma posição {{relevante}} na área. Para tanto, passou de uma atuação fragmentada na assistência social, para uma atuação incisiva na escola pública, por intermédio da parceria constituída com o Ministério da Educação para execução do Programa Ensino nédio Inovador/Jovem de Futuro. A parceria consistiu na transferência da tecnologia Jovem de Futuro, nos Estados de Ceará, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Pará e Piauí, que visa transformar a escola a partir da intervenção junto à gestão escolar, para uma Gestão por Resultados. Em decorrência da assunção da tecnologia, o Instituto Unibanco se insere nas escolas por intermédio dos ordenamentos previstos pelo Jovem de Futuro, tais como o curso de formação para gestores. The research Unibanco Institute and the Project Youngsters of Future: {{a way of}} inserting entrepreneurs in the Educational Public Policies for High School aims at analysing {{the insertion}} {{of the private sector}} in the public basic education by means of the study of the incursion of the Unibanco Institute in the public High School with the proposal named Youngsters of Future. The research comprehends the constitution and acting history of the Unibanco Institute as an institution directed to the social assistance and the process which conducted such acting to the basic education. Also, it comprehends the development of the Youngsters of Future technology, as well as the constitution of the partnership with the Ministry of Education to its tranfer along with the Innovative High School Program. This is a qualitative study, and the method adopted for the data collection is the documentary analysis, both primary and secondary sources published between the years 2003 and 2014. In order to approach the subject, initially, a brief study of theoretical frameworks which indicate the new public administration is carried out, result of the reform of the State established in the former president Fernando Henrique Cardosos administration, as {{part of the process of}} insertion of the private sector in education, considering the establishment of new regulatory marks in the execution of the public social policies. The survey indicates that, in spite of the existence of power switching with the election of the former president Lula for the federal government, the incursion process of the private sector was not interrupted; on the contrary, it remained under bases which are similar to the ones found in the previous political platform. With regard to the Unibanco Institute, the research showed that its objective was acting in the public basic education, and it aimed at a significant position in such area. In order to do so, the acting, which was fragmented, focused on the social assistance, became an acting which is incisive inside the public school, by means of the partnership established with the Ministry of Education for the carrying out of the Innovative High School Program/Youngsters of Future.

40|$|L'auteur explore la possibilité d'effectuer le passage de la théorie micro-économique à la {{pratique}} des affaires. Après une brève critique de la théorie traditionnelle, il définit l’économie d'entreprise et propose un modèle économique opératoire de l’entreprise, soit le modèle des décisions améliorées. INTRODUCTIONThis {{paper has}} been especially written {{for those interested in}} the economic studies of the firm and who are more or less embarassed in using their knowledge in micro-economics: How could one conciliate profit maximization with all other objectives apparently prevailing in practice ? How could one obtain the nice theoretical demand curves ? How could one know the different cost elements for each of the many products of a firm ? Actually, those specialists are quite discouraged by the difficulties met in the passage from theory to practice. This uneasiness also exists for the theoricians. To prove it, let us recall the famous controversy on marginalism which, {{for more than twenty years}} now, questioned the validity of the traditional economic theory. There has been much literature on this subject for the last few years both in books and magazine articles. Some of them criticize the orthodox theory by doubting of its validity as a firm theory while others propose changes or new theories. It is known that the founders of this theory, to mention only Cournot (1838), Marshall (1890) and Chamberlin-Robinson (in the thirties), assigned to the entrepreneur a rather passive role and considered almost almighty the market forces for the factors and the products. On the contrary, since the beginning of the thirties, an increasing number of economists admit that the entrepreneur has great freedom of action i. e. he can more and more influence the external world. Cleland 1 even writes that « the manager would be substituted for the market as the key element ». But one can note by simple observation that this is passing from one extreme to the other since market forces still remain generally very powerful. Whatever is the exact relative power of each of those two elements, there is no doubt that the manager possesses a relatively large freedom of decision (especially because of his lack of information) and consequently he needs a new kind of operational framework to prepare his decisions. Unfortunately nothing satisfying seems to be yet found. Nordquist 2 notes that « among the critic  there are wide differences as to what is wrong with the theory and little agreement on what should be done ». Managers nevertheless need a better approach than the one they presently have. Does this imply that traditional micro-economics should be discarded? If so, what should replace it? If not, how could it be made more useful for scientific management? The first step to make seems quite indicated: to discuss the validity of the orthodox marginalism. THE VALIDITY OF THE TRADITIONAL THEORYCyert and March 3 state seven propositions which explain the essential content of the traditional theory on which they think that there is a general consensus. Let us mention here the three following:«  1. — At equilibrium, the marginal rate of substitution between two products, or between two factors, is equal to the ratio of their prices. 2. — The marginal physical productivity of a factor with respect to a product is equal to their price ratio. 3. — The quantity of a good produced is selected so that its marginal cost is equal to its price ». In the context of managerial economics, it is advisable to retain only the qualitative aspect of the preceding propositions, for one must admit that it is impossible in most of our existing firms to quantify the variables involved so to entirely apply those basic principles. On the other hand each proposition describes an ideal to reach and characterizes the way and direction of the action to undertake. To put it another way, theory does not aim at the business administration as such but must inspire it largely. To bring the subject in proper focus, before submitting it to discussion, it is convenient to recall some of the main implicit assumptions of the theory. Cleland 4 has presented and explained five of them :«  1. —The stationary assumption — it assumes that wants, resources and the body of knowledge are given and unchanging. 2. —The independence assumption — it assumes that wants, resources and the body of knowledge are independent of one another and of the actions of the firm. 3. —The moticational assumption — the purposes or goals of the firm are assumed to be maximizing of net benefits (or profits). 4. —The informational assumption — it assumes that there is a well-organized system for the acquisition and dissemination of relevant information to the firm and within the firm, whether this be concerning technical processes, human relations, the markets for products and raw material or facilities for production. 5. —The organizational assumption — it assumes a process for decision and actions of various individuals are related to one another in terms of maximizing purpose of the firm ». One must recall those assumptions, since most of critics invalidate orthodox marginalism pleading the non-conformity of these hypotheses with reality. Two assumptions: Stationary and IndependenceIt is quite evident that wants, resources and the body of knowledge are not given once and for all for the firm but they change with time. It is also known that market forces do not entirely dominate the firm but that they influence one another. MotivationIt is unuseful here to dissert for a long time on the purpose of profit. The manager remains an individual even if he roughly accepts the value system prevailing in the firm. It is thus possible to see his own motivation more or less in opposition to the one of the organization. In fact, the individual first reaches for economical security, without neglecting psychological quietude, interest for work, chances for promotion prestige, power, etc. This becomes more and more obvious with the increasing separation of ownership from control. In addition to this, given the growing number of constraints to reckon with such as human relations, innovation, financing needs, etc., it seems impossible to maximize profit in the sense of the theory. We must however admit with Goetz 5 that profit maximization constitutes a common denominator serving the many goals of the firm. InformationThe decision criterion, in the case of orthodox marginalism, consists of maximizing profit by equating the marginal cost to the marginal revenue. This implies that the manager knows all the alternatives opened to him : each point on a demand or cost curve, for instance, represents a subset of such alternatives. Their number being infinite, it is then impossible to know all of them perfectly. Therefore the manager will not be able to rely on conventional marginalism in its full sense. However he will have to collect and use all the economic information possible to gather. OrganizationWe have mentioned that the founders of conventional marginalism gave the firm a very passive role. They did not consider it either as an organization, in its modem sense, which supposes that the interrelationships between individuals and groups are established by a communication channel through which flows all the information used in the decision making process. In this organization many conflicts may arise between the different parties thus hampering the collaboration necessary for an adequate and efficient action. That is why an effort must be made to use theory in the best possible manner in the decision making process. General Criticism of the TheoryThe traditional theory is more or less invalidated on the basis of an inconsistency between the assumptions and the reality. One cannot even say that this theory is strictly speaking a theory of the firm since it explains in the first place the allocation of resources on the market. But managers must make their decisions in the firm: they cannot only consider market forces and consequently they need a supplementary framework to the one laid down in the traditional theory. It is thus urgent to give a better account of the actual reality and to offer better guidance to the managers. However it seems utopic to search for a substitute theory for the traditional one since, because of its high degree of abstraction, it has shed some light on the extremely complex decision process of the firm. It can be noted with Nordquist 6 that « two identifiable streams of activity seem to be emerging: the first, at least in precedence, involves an elaboration of the traditional theory into a general framework of optimal choice wherein the assumption of profit maximization is replaced by constrained preference maximization. The second approach seeks to develop process-oriented models of the firm, based upon close observation of actual decision behavior in real business setting ». It would be too long to enumerate here all the proposed reforms and theories. It is sufficient to say that none of them has yet received general approbation and that, on the contrary the attempts are multiplied and perhaps more diversified. Anyhow, the real economic problem consists of allocating scarce resources in order to satisfy unlimited needs. The traditional theory will hit that target the more it will be completed by an operational economic model. The economic system considers the individuals as consumers and workers, firms as producers of goods and services, and finally the government as the regulator of the activity of the economic agents, individuals and firms. The economic welfare depends largely upon the good functionning of the different parts of the economy. One must admit at the beginning the unlimited complexity of reality and consequently the necessity for the managers to follow the fundamental principles of conventional marginalism. The desire of rebuilding the foundations of the traditional firm theory and, like physical sciences, to want to go from the particular to the general seems unfruitful. The dimensions of a decision in the firm being quite difficult to apprehend, it is necessary, in a first step, to go far above reality because decisions must help the firm to come nearer and nearer to the theoritical ideal. In a second step, the managers must turn to a model which considers at the same time theory and practice. NECESSITY FOR AN OPERATIONAL MODELThe more abstract is a theory, the better it explains the essential of a phenomena and on the other hand the less it explains the detail of it. That is at the same time its force and weakness. The traditional theory gives the managers the main guide lines but is not sufficient for their concrete decisions. It is often said that conventional marginalism, concerning the allocation of resources on a market, does not help much the managers in their decisions. Coase 7 states however that « the firm is the supersession of the price mechanism » and that « the main reason why it is profitable to establish a firm would seem to be that there is a cost of using the price mechanism ». On the other hand, Peter Drucker 8 defines the main challenge of the entrepreneur as being the discovery of new possibilities. We could also state many other opinions all more or less different as the other. Admitting that the manager partially substituted the market as the key element, following the idea of Cleland, it is not allowed to go from one extreme to the other and deny that the market forces influence sometimes very much the decisions of the firms which, after all, buy the factors of production and also sell their products on the market. But fundamentally such a discussion on the exact relative importance of the market and of the manager leads nowhere since everybody recognizes decision making as the main function of the manager, and decision implies freedom of action i. e. the choice of an alternative among many. It is sure that this liberty is active within the limits determinated by the market. For example, the price of a certain hour of work goes from $ 2. 00 to $ 3. 00. That is why the manager must know the price mechanism. He must thus know that an increase in the price of a product leads to a fall in its demand. Therefore the manager needs to know how the allocation of resources on the market is done. He also needs an operational model which can be drawn from theoritical teachings but which sticks to the managerial reality and more particularly to the decision making process. ESSAY OF DEFINITIONIt is now possible to formulate a tentative definition of managerial economies: a model of optimal choice among the alternatives considered by the managers and evaluated in terms of the objective that they themselves define. The attempt may seem ventured at a time when nobody has yet defined managerial economies. This is unfortunate and perhaps explains greatly the confusion which presently exists in this field. In fact it is almost impossible to find two books dealing with the subject and using the same terms of reference. On the one hand, one will find works presenting popularization of the traditional theory, while on the other hand some authors explain techniques and methods in one or more specific areas of management. The model is an attempt to represent the links between the activities and the objective of a firm. It simplifies complex operations thus facilating its management by establishing the main significant relations. Everybody considers the decision process as being the main function of an executive. Moreover, managers must optimize their choice i. e. choose the best alternatives conducive to the achievement of the objective previously defined. Considering the fact that managers do not have perfect knowledge, it is impossible for them to inventory all the alternatives. They will rather study a few of them which seem to be the most promising. They must also evaluate the effects of the alternatives kept for study in order to facilitate the choice of the best one. It is in their interest to quantify each outcome the best they can. For planning and control to be efficient, they must compare the forecasted outcomes of a decision with its actual results: this method is called <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>results.</b> For sure the evaluation of the latter may present as many difficulties as the former. But at least the effort of evaluation leads the managers to a better preparation of their decisions, thus contributing to their improvement. Finally, the proposed definition implies that it is the responsability of the manager to finally define the objective. However, if one assumes a rational behavior on the part of the manager, he is led to accept long-run maximization as the objective of the firm. MODEL FOR IMPROVING DECISIONSSo far, it has been argued that the traditional theory offered the manager a weak help but a necessary one for their decisions, thus showing its limited validity in managerial economies. The necessity of an operational model that can be useful to the managers was also pointed out. The model for improving decisions must now be explained. Fortunately, what has been said earlier probably foresees the essential. In fact, faced with the great complexity of management, one must give up the direct application of the theory as such; but one notes at the same time the necessity of following its main guide-lines. One must therefore pass suitably from theory to practice. Nemmers 9 writes « that the typical college graduate with major in economics is, unfortunately, ill-equipped to go into business after graduation ». He proposes precisely the teaching of managerial economies which would serve as a bridge between theory and practice. Unfortunately this bridge does not exist. That is what Scitovsky 10 deplored when he spoke of the « unbridged gulf » twenty five years ago. One could probably explain its absence by the difficulty to use theory which finally leads to a set of qualitative propositions not quantifiable. The qualitative aspect of theory was mentioned in the preceding pages. What shall be done then? The manager cannot act only by intuition or with confidence to the traditional analysis. The only way to get out of the deadlock is to settle the question a little to the manner of the Gordian knot. We thus find afterwards on one side the qualitative propositions of the theory and on the other side the complex decision making process involved in the task of managing. An adequate model must fulfill in the best manner possible two fundamental requirements: to conform to theory and stick to reality. Everyone recognizes the complex, aleatory and generally uncertain character of firm management. One will never be able to apprehend all the dimensions of a decision neither will be able to predict the future so to speak. Therefore we must turn to a model which offers some chances of improving decisions. We could explain it by refering on the one hand to the definition of the firm or managers' objective and on the other hand to the evaluation of alternatives to choose in the search for the objective defined by the managers. Definition of the ObjectiveThe traditional theory only sets forth the purpose of profit maximization, obtained by equating marginal cost and marginal revenue, supposing the perfect rationality of the entrepreneur-owner. The profit could thus be maximized in a theoretical sense only if the entrepreneur fully desires it and if he possesses a complete information of all the alternatives in terms of the profit objective. Hence everybody denies the possibility of profit maximization. Many authors proposed other particular purposes aimed at by the firm such as the maximization of the sales volume or the share of the market, the satisfying profit; the firms give an increasing importance to human relations and assign large sums of money to valorize their image in the public; above all, they want to survive and maximize utility. In such a case, it is necessary to suppose, on one hand, a certain willingness on the part of the managers to act rationnally thus striving for profit maximization in the theoritical sense and, on another hand, to accept that the practice of management inevitably keeps managers away from the theoritical ideal. This process allows one to suppose that managers search for maximum profit on the long period taking into account a long series of constraints such as the survival of the firm, the share of the market, the sales volume, the variety of products, research and development, human and public relations, etc [...] However, it seems quite difficult to define profit in a way that it could be properly measured. The accounting concept is one of the best known and the most used especially because of its possibility to measure profit objectively against rules which are conveniently applied to the exploitation of a firm. The economic concept has a much more superior significance but its use is difficult and very precarious when interfirm comparisons are made because of the strongly subjective content of its measure. It seems however necessary to keep the economic concept in mind in managerial economies. First, let us say that a workable definition is in order: the increase (or loss) of the present value of future receipts during a given period represents the economic profit (or decrease) of a firm. We meet here just about the same problem as the one found when figuring out the profitability of investments. We finally get to the same idea of Peter Drucker 11 i. e. that the major challenge for the entrepreneur consists in finding and using new possibilities. In fact it is a matter of deciding to invest once and for all. But the profitability of a firm can change with time. The calculation of this profitability gives at the same time the measure of the economic profit and of the success of managers to innovate. Concerning the length of the period, it depends mainly upon the capacity of forecasting. Certain firms can trust certain predictions of five years, others of seven years and others of ten years. For example, we agree on the fact that managers plan more precisely, with greater confidence and on a longer period the needs of floor area then the sales of a particular product. On the same manner it is surely easier to estimate the demand for newspaper than for women's hat. In fact it does not seem rational for the manager to pursue another profit objective than a maximum one over a long period. Any other concept does not tend toward the optimization of decisions for there exists then an area of indetermination in the choices. So, to fix as objective a satisfying profit has two meanings: either one acts irrationnally in rejecting the best alternative in terms of profit, ceteris paribus; or one makes the optimal choice in terms of the most satisfying profit, given the limited information available. In this latter sense, the satisfying profit is the same thing as the maximum profit hereby proposed. In other words, the satisfiers' school speaks of satisfying profit when considering the impossibility of maximizing profit in the theoretical sense i. e. the impossibility to be aware of all the alternatives and to evaluate them in terms of the final objective. In addition to this, it is often said that optimal decisions are made in terms of two objectives, the short and the long period for example. However, when one wants to classify a group of objects, he would use only one criterion; also he should do the same thing when measuring an alternative against an objective. In the logics of managing which implies foreseeing in the long run, it seems to be impossible to speak of short-run objective which in this case, appears more like a budgetary forecast. To say that a sales volume is determined for the following year in a given amount can not be construe...|$|E
40|$|Construction plays a {{major role}} in the economies of {{developed}} and developing countries. Sadly, it is also a major contributor to the occupational accident and ill-health statistics. This paper explores the environments within which SMEs manage health and safety in developing countries, in this case, Ghana. The majority of construction businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises and their capacity to manage health and safety depends on an enabling policy and cultural environments. Typically, workers are not trained in health and safety and there is little investment in health and safety <b>management</b> <b>by</b> owner/managers. The <b>results</b> suggest the extended family system and collectivist value systems have tremendous impact on the management of health and safety. The institutional structure has made little impact on health and safety attitudes and behaviours of owner/managers. Recommendations for improving health and safety on construction sites in Ghana are suggested which draw upon values which could promote enabling environment for the adoption good practice by SMEs...|$|R

Based on empirical material frominterviews of 119 teachers in three studies conducted between 2002 and 2014, the findings indicate thatteacher autonomy has been reduced by school reforms and restructurings since the late 1980 s. Regardless oftheir individual aims, these reforms have collectively created a power structure that distributes power to thestate, municipalities, principals and the school market, including ‘customers’, that is, students, at the expenseof teacher autonomy. Teacher agency follows certain policies at the discourse level, such as decentralisationand <b>management</b> <b>by</b> objectives and <b>results,</b> but in practice seems to be based on individuals’ and groups’capacities to exploit opportunities for agency in combination with more or less facilitative management andorganisation cultures. This development is multifaceted and varies locally, but the overall trend can bedescribed as a shift from occupational to organisational professionalism and from ‘licensed’ to ‘regulated’autonomy but emphasising the influence of market logics...|$|R

Our methods draw upon the field of Agent-Based computational social science where Artificial Life and simulated societies have been used to study complex systems including economies and financial markets. Modeling the researchers as individual agents, we simulate our new management structure against a more traditional organization where the researchers are broken into departments based on their skills and assigned projects <b>by</b> <b>management.</b> Our <b>results,</b> measuring the amount of time it takes a research organization to serve a given number of contracts, show promise in the less hierarchical approach...|$|R
