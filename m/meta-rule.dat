5000|$|A {{central part}} of H.L.A. Hart's theory on legal positivism, in any legal system, the rule of {{recognition}} is a master <b>meta-rule</b> underlying any legal system that defines the common identifying test for legal validity (or [...] "what counts as law") within that system. He thus articulates its application:sd ...to say that a given rule is valid is to recognize it as passing all the tests provided by the rule of recognition and so {{as a rule of}} the system. We can indeed simply say that the statement that a particular rule is valid means that it satisfies all the criteria provided by the rule of recognition. H. L. A. Hart In Hart's view, the rule of recognition arises out of a convention among officials whereby they accept the rule's criteria as standards that empower and govern their actions as officials. The rule is cognizable from the social practices of officials acknowledging the rule as a legitimate standard of behavior, exerting social pressure on one another to conform to it, and generally satisfying the rule's requirements. To this end, as explained by Hart, the rule has three functions: ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL) is an ILP {{technique}} {{which uses}} higher-order <b>meta-rules</b> to support predicate invention and learning of recursive definitions. In MIL {{the selection of}} <b>meta-rules</b> {{is analogous to the}} choice of refinement operators in a refinement graph search. The <b>meta-rules</b> determine the structure of permissible rules which in turn defines the hypothesis space. On the other hand, the hypothesis space can be shown to increase rapidly in the number of <b>meta-rules.</b> However, methods for reducing the set of <b>meta-rules</b> have so far not been explored within MIL. In this paper we demonstrate that irreducible, or minimal sets of <b>meta-rules</b> can be found automatically by applying Plotkin’s clausal theory reduction algorithm. When this approach is applied to a set of <b>meta-rules</b> consisting of an enumeration of all <b>meta-rules</b> in a given finite hypothesis language we show that in some cases as few as two <b>meta-rules</b> are complete and sufficient for generating all hypotheses. In our experiments we compare the effect of using a minimal set of <b>meta-rules</b> to randomly chosen subsets of the maximal set of <b>meta-rules.</b> In general the minimal set of <b>meta-rules</b> leads to lower runtimes and higher predictive accuracies than larger randomly selected sets of <b>meta-rules.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{transformational}} methodology {{described in}} this paper induces new knowledge, which may be open under any deductive process. The method of transposition is used to maintain a maximum size for the application as well as <b>meta-rule</b> bases. The “move to head ” method is used by both the application and metarule bases for hypotheses formation. Whenever an application rule is fired, it is transposed on the transposition list and also moved to the head on the other list. If any <b>meta-rule</b> on a solution path individually leads to a contradiction on the application rule base, then the offending <b>meta-rule</b> is expunged. Then, when the system is idle enter dream mode, whereby rule i ⇒ rule j is generated by the 3 - 2 - 1 skewed twister as a candidate most-specific <b>meta-rule.</b> Candidate most-specific meta-rules are “cored ” to create one generalization per candidate. These candidate meta-rules are tested for application to each rule in the application domain rule base. In order to be saved in the meta base, they may not map any existing rule in the application domain rule base to one having the same antecedent as another in this base, but a different consequent (as found by hashing). In addition, all candidate meta-rules must map at least one rule in the application base to another distinct one there, or be symmetrically induced from meta-rules that so map...|$|E
40|$|A meta-rule-guided {{data mining}} {{approach}} is proposed and studied which apphes meta-rules as a guidance at finding multiple-level association rules in large relational databases. A <b>meta-rule</b> is a rule template {{in the form}} of "P A [...] . A P, [...] * Q A [...] . A Q,,", in which some of the predicates (and/or their variables) in the antecedent and/or consequent of the <b>meta-rule</b> could be instantJared. The rule template is used to describe what forms of rules are expected to be found from the database, and such a rule template is used as a guidance or constraint in the data mining process. Note that the predicate variables in a <b>meta-rule</b> can be instantJared against a database schema, whereas the variables or some high-level constants inside a predicate can be bound to multiple (but more specific) levels of concepts in the corresponding con- ceptual hierarchies. The concrete rules at different concept levels are discovered by a progressive deepening data mining technique similar to that developed in our study of mining multiple-level association rules. Two algorithms are developed along this hne and a performance study is conducted to compare their relative efficiencies. Our experimental and performance studies demonstrate that the method is powerful and efficient in data mining from large databases...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to automated tactical theorem proving and proof planning: By using metarules to control the search for a proof, heuristic knowledge is declaratively collected. This eases the user's understanding of the system's search for a proof thus making user-interactions easier. The system's heuristics can be modified by simply using different sets of meta-rules. Via meta-rules contextual preconditions for tactics can be formulated in a transparent way.

40|$|Albert Breton and Pierre Salmon {{argue that}} the effects of {{constitutional}} rules depend on the nature of political competition and on some <b>meta-rules</b> that contain procedures regulating the application and the modification of constitutional rules. They outline two models of competition - electoral competition and compound government competition - and describe the nature of the transactions between the parties involved in the two corresponding settings. In both, the transactions are over constitutional rules and ordinary goods and services, all of which are arguments in the utility functions of citizens. To make the discussion more concrete, the paper focuses on the demand for political autonomy, a variable which, at the limit, becomes a demand for secession and independence. This allows the specification of some <b>meta-rules</b> applicable to secessionism.

40|$|We examine {{adaptable}} dialogue interface {{agents using}} <b>meta-rules</b> {{to engage in}} to converse with information seeking callers. For an adaptable dialogue interface agent to exhibit the intelligence required in a dialogue with a user it needs the ability to handle unanticipated user input gracefully in a proper context, that is, it can support ad hoc requests from a user, maintain the topic of discourse, and keep a user from digressing away from the subject.

40|$|Rule {{selection}} in forward chaining {{is a critical}} factor in the performance of expert systems. Uninformed selection causes many rules to be fired, that are not useful in the attainment of the reasoning goal. As a result, users have to answer more questions than needed and the system's performance is degraded. Domain-specific <b>meta-rules</b> have been used to improve rule selection. However, in most instances, such <b>meta-rules</b> are elicited from experts and thus costly to obtain and difficult to validate. This paper describes a method for improving rule selection automatically and adaptively. The idea rests on the use of a neural network to (meta-) learn dynamically (i. e., whilst the expert system is run) in which situations which rules are worth applying. Prior <b>meta-rules,</b> if they exist, may also be improved by the neural network. Empirical results demonstrate that the (meta-) knowledge encoded in the neural network produces a reduction of the number of rules selected during forward chaining. 1...|$|R

40|$|Rule-based {{systems have}} been used {{extensively}} by the AI community in implementing knowledgebased expert systems. A currentrend in the Database community is to use rules {{for the purpose of}} providing inferential capabilities for large database applications. However, in the database context, performance of rule-program processing {{has proved to be a}} major stumbling block, particularly in data-intensive and real-time applications. Similar work in the AI community has demonstrated the same problems mainly due to the predominantly sequential semantics of the underlying rule languages and the lack of facilities to optimize run-timexecution performance. In this brief paper, we describe the PARULEL rule language and its <b>meta-rule</b> formalism for declaratively specifying control of rule execution. We argue that the <b>meta-rule</b> facility provides a means for programmable operational semantics that separates control from the base logic of a rule program. This allows the potential realization of a wide range of operational semantics including those of Datalog ~ * and OPS 5. In previous work, we presented an incremental update algorithm for Datalog ~ * and extended it for PARULEL. Run-time performance optimization is also studied by way of the technique Of copy-and-constrain. We briefly describextensions of this work to include run-time reorganization as a principle to enhancexecution performance after an initial compile-time analysis. These features, incremental update, copy-and-constrain, and run-time reorganization, are being developed within a parallel and distributed environment for execution of PARULEL programs targeted to commercial multiprocessors and distributed computing facilities. 207...|$|E
