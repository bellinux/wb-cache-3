50|$|The PS {{program can}} be used for studies with dichotomous, continuous, or {{survival}} response measures. The user specifies the alternative hypothesis in terms of differing response rates, means, survival times, relative risks, or odds ratios. Matched or independent study designs may be used. Power, sample size, and the detectable alternative hypothesis are interrelated. The user specifies any two of these three quantities and the program derives the third. A description of each calculation, written in English, is generated and may be copied into the user's documents. Interactive help is available. The program provides methods that are appropriate for matched and independent t-tests, survival analysis, matched and unmatched studies of dichotomous events, the <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>test,</b> and linear regression.The program can generate graphs of the relationships between power, sample size and the detectable alternative hypothesis. It can plot graphs of any two of these variables while holding the third constant. Linear or logarithmic axes may be used and multiple curves can be plotted on each graph. Graphs may be copied and pasted into other documents or programs for further editing.|$|E

This study was aimed {{to determine the}} prevalence of T. gondii infection in sheep, cattle and horses in Urmia, north-west of Iran, using MAT. Methods: Blood samples of 276 livestock and 26 horses were collected from July 2009 till April 2010. The data were analyzed by the Chi-square, Fisher's Exact and Cochran’s and <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>Tests.</b> The level of significance was set at P < 0. 05.

METHODS: A literature search was performed of electronic databases, Abstract Books and single paper references. Data were also obtained from the authors.

40|$|Aim: To analyze genetic {{alterations}} of p 53 gene in Slovenian {{gastric cancer}} patients and to compare these alterations with clinicopathological parameters {{in order to}} assess the value of p 53 as a prognostic factor. Methods: We analyzed the samples from 230 Slovenian patients with gastric cancer, collected between 1983 and 2001. p 53 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically with DO- 7 monoclonal antibody. In addition, loss of heterozigosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI) of p 53 gene were evaluated, as well as its mutational status in the selected population of patients. Results: p 53 expression was associated with poorer survival and it was an independent predictor in multivariate analysis, along with TNM (T – size of tumor, N – nodal involvement, M – distant metastasis) stage status. Loss of heterozigosity and microsatellite instability status did not influence survival, however we found association of loss of heterozigosity with Lauren’s (<b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>test,</b> P[*]=[*]. 004) and Ming’s (<b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>test,</b> P<. 001) classification, whereas microsatellite instability was associated with gender (<b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>test,</b> P[*]=[*]. 017), TNM stage (χ 2 test, P[*]=[*]. 006) of gastric cancer, and lymph node involvement (pN) (χ 2 test, P[*]=[*]. 004). Conclusions: The data on p 53 abnormalities, when considered separately, could be of relative value for predicting the behavior of gastric tumors. However, our analyses showed that studying p 53 overexpression, loss of heterozigosity, microsatellite instability, and mutational analysis could provide data that, particularly in combination with some clinicopathological features, might be of clinical value for predicting the tumor behavior and patient response to therapy...|$|E

A national survey identified all jumping hotspots that have been secured in Switzerland; of the 15 that could be included in this study, 11 were secured by vertical barriers and 4 were secured by low-hanging horizontal safety nets. The study made an overall and individual pre-post analysis by using <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>Tests,</b> regression methods and calculating rate ratios. Barriers and safety nets were both effective, with mean suicide reduction of 68. 7 % (barriers) and 77. 1 % (safety nets), respectively. Measures that do not secure the whole hotspot and still allow jumps of 15 meters or more were less effective. Further, the analyses revealed that barriers of at least 2. 3 m in height and safety-nets fixed significantly below pedestrian level deterred suicidal jumps. Secured bridgeheads and inbound angle barriers seemed to enhance the effectiveness of the measure.

40|$|Background: High {{rates of}} {{mutation}} in HIV infected individual allow {{the virus to}} adapt rapidly in vivo to selective forces such as anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and host immune pressure. This provides an opportunity to determine the relative contribution of different components of the immune response to HIV- 1 infection in driving viral diversity, which may also facilitate assessment of their role in controlling viral replication. It is accepted that HIV- 1 -specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) may drive the selection of viral variants that can escape T-cell recognition but the extent of this selective pressure has been controversial. Methods: Two digit HLA typing; ELISPOT assay; HIV- 1 sequence analysis; HIV sequence clustering and phylogenetic analysis of HLA associations using the neighbour-joining method, S-Plus 8. 0, “Partitioning around medoids” (PAM) method and Stratification analysis by <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>tests</b> Results: Here we describe the consequences of HLA-associated selection on viral diversity in the main targets of T-cell recognition following an outbreak of HIV- 1 in a cohort of 258 former plasma donors in rural China.

40|$|Statistical {{considerations}} are discussed for a randomized parallel groups study to compare treatments for {{the healing of}} ulcers during a specified time period of dosing andfor the avoidance of subsequent ulcer recurrence (in patients with healing) during a follow-up period with no medication. For this study, randomization enables valid comparisons of treatments for the rates of healing during the dosing period and for the cumulative rates of being ulcer-free (ie, healing and no recurrence subsequent to healing) during the combined dosing and follow-up periods. Appropriate methods of analysis include <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>tests</b> and logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes and their life table counterparts for time to event outcomes. For recurrence rates among patients with healing, the basis for comparisons among treatments is unclear because of potential lack of similarity of treatment groups for risk factors for recurrence {{at the beginning of}} the follow-up period. This difficulty can be ad dressed by interpreting recurrence rates within treatment groups as descriptive for corresponding populations with healing. Moreover, such descriptions can involve statistical models which account for the effects of risk factors.

Four methods for estimating the variance of a function estimated using complex survey data are reviewed. These four methods are then applied to estimates of the conditional probabilities of an event and the associated survivorship probabilities, and suggestions are made as to the Ibest l variance estimation method to use. A test statistic analogous to the <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>test</b> is developed for comparing survivorship probabilities between two or more domains of interest for complex survey data. Use of the test statistic is illustrated for two data sets.
