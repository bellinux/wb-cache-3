40|$|Abstract In this article, {{the problem}} of {{downlink}} subcarrier allocation in a cooperative wireless multiuser OFDM system is investigated. We consider a single-cell where all the users are paired in cooperative groups. The mobile users in each group amplify and forward their partner’s data stream using a time division protocol. Based on the capacity contribution from the relaying terminal, a new parameter called cooperation coefficient is introduced {{as a function of}} the relaying subchannel. This parameter is used to modify the objective parameter of the subcarrier allocation procedure. Fairness-oriented and throughput-oriented algorithms are selected from the literature to test the proposed technique. Both algorithms are modified to employ the <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> coefficient in the objective parameter of the subcarrier allocation procedure and shown to have a better total throughput without any sacrifice. Using the <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> coefficient eliminates the need for the feedback of the relaying channel to the base station. It is shown that by using the <b>mean</b> value <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation</b> coefficient, instead <b>of</b> its instantaneous value, throughput of the system would still improve compared to the non-cooperative case. Using the <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> coefficient leads to an implementable cooperative subcarrier allocation algorithm...|$|R

An agreement was reached with Chrysler in 1963 to build the Dodge Dart, allowing the company to enter the car market.

During that time, the Spanish automobile market was strongly protected, making entering it effectively only possible by domestic manufacturing. As the 1960s progressed, the range was extended with some smaller models from Chrysler's French subsidiary, Simca. The Barreiros-made Simca 1000 was launched in 1966, and later the Simca 1200 joined the range (in fact the French Simca 1100, but with a bigger standard engine for the Spanish market).|$|E
50|$|Bob Black {{argued that}} it was not {{feelings}} or intentions or urges but the actual model of collaboration that distincted the group-entity. The sexual individual animal can conceive (pun intended) of seduction, dance, flirtation, and other <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> that do not involve one entity consuming and destroying the identity of the other. Group-entities have no such skills nor capacities - they interact with each other in a way reminiscent of predator-prey relations, where the predator will consume and destroy the identity of the prey, which no longer reproduces but contributes to the predator's energy. Corporate mergers, for instance, are often presented as relationships of equals cooperating, but in fact usually one executive group or the other will be drastically reduced, the organizational structure and ethics of one of the two being obliterated. Corporations do not get each other pregnant, nor do they nurture child corporations - joint ventures being a notable exception.|$|E
