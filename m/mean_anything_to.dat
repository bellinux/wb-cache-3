[...] "All my serious dramatic performances suddenly weren't getting me the jobs or opportunities that I really wanted," [...] {{she said in a}} 2005 interview. [...] "I have stacks and stacks of letters from great directors saying I can't cast you because you don't <b>mean</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> the studios.

500|$|The {{design for}} the $50 {{received}} contemporary criticism; some suggested {{that the presence of}} the dolphins on the octagonal coin implied that the canal had been constructed for cetacean convenience. A 1916 column in the American Journal of Numismatics contained the conclusion that [...] "the criticism often heard that 'there is nothing American about the coin except the inscription' is fully warranted." [...] Swiatek and Breen dismissed criticisms as [...] "numerous and mostly irrelevant, based on total misreading of the iconography. [...] with stupid claims that Pallas Athena meant nothing on a U.S. coin unless she could be identified with Liberty, and that Athena's owl would never <b>mean</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> all of us". Vermeule deemed the $50 coins [...] "a tour de force, dated to be sure, but unusual enough in all respects to be worthy of what American numismatic art could achieve". Later Chief Engraver Elizabeth Jones felt that the $50 pieces were [...] "stylistically in step with the period [...] considerable artistic merits". Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, in their book on U.S. gold coins, deemed the Panama–Pacific $50 pieces [...] "one of the most stunning issues ever produced by the U.S. government".|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{called it}} [...] "flat-out the best comedy {{series of the}} new season". Varietys Tony Scott had optimistic hopes for the series; he enjoyed the premise but was {{concerned}} that dialogue from the writers of Dream On should be [...] "snappier". Scott was also concerned that the Monica storyline set a bad example to younger viewers; [...] "Friends touts promiscuity and offers liberal samples of an openness that borders on empty-headedness". He singled out Cox and Schwimmer as the best actors of the ensemble. Robert Bianco was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him [...] "terrific". He also praised the female leads, but wrote that Perry's role as Chandler was [...] "undefined" [...] and that LeBlanc was [...] "relying {{too much on the}} same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it". Entertainment Weekly rates the episode B+ and states that [...] "After 22 minutes, these six people are believably set up as lifelong buddies". Ross's line, [...] "Do the words 'Billy, Don't Be a Hero' <b>mean</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> you?" [...] is singled out as the best line of the episode. The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends call it a [...] "good, solid start to the series" [...] but [...] "the regular cast (particularly Perry and Schwimmer) might be trying just a little too hard". Schwimmer recalls enjoying the physical humor involving Ross, particularly the scene where Ross greets Rachel and opens an umbrella on her.|$|E

500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "She's a Sensation", which was said by author Dave Thompson to have a 60's melody which [...] "melts through the hard rock." [...] The next song, [...] "7-11", deals with dating {{at a young age}} where the couple goes on dates to places like {{convenience}} stores and record swaps. The lyrics follow a boy who meets a girl by a Space Invaders machine, and eventually has to let her go after she dies in a car crash. True relates: [...] "You can lose your heart within the singer's torched '7-11'. Joey details in time-honoured girl group fashion the beauty of young love that takes place among the most mundane, humdrum of surroundings." [...] "You Didn't <b>Mean</b> <b>Anything</b> <b>to</b> Me", written by Dee Dee, reflects the desolation and vacillation which the bassist was feeling in his personal life as well as while he was with the band. This is evident through lines like [...] "Every dinner was crummy/Even the ones for free." [...] The pop-oriented song [...] "Come On Now" [...] was described by True as a [...] "sparkling rush of blood to the head from the [...] "comic book boy", and said that it ranged alongside songs from The Dave Clark Five and 1910 Fruitgum Company. The eleventh track on the album is titled [...] "This Business Is Killing Me", and was written by Joey to detail how everyone expects him to please others, but he simply cannot please everyone all the time. Pleasant Dreams concludes with [...] "Sitting in My Room", which contained lyrics quoted by David Fricke in the conclusion of his review on the album, saying: [...] "'It's us against them,' sneers Joey in [...] "Sitting in My Room.' 'They just wanna worry ... /They just wanna be so lame/Maybe they should try and sniff some glue.' Or put Pleasant Dreams on the box and crank it up to ten." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yamaguchi wrote new {{lyrics to}} the song, {{and felt like}} the song mixed his past self with his present self. He {{inserted}} many lyrical gimmicks into the song's lyrics, such as hiding the album's title Kikuuiki in the lyric [...] This gimmick was the reason that Yamaguchi decided to capitalize the two central letters of the album title (kikUUiki). Yamaguchi felt that the lyrics he wrote were like a first-person novel, using lyrical techniques {{that he had not}} personally experimented with before. He wrote the lyrics abstractly, using words that meant a lot to Yamaguchi personally that would not <b>mean</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> outside listeners. He hoped that this technique would move listeners, however without fully understanding why they felt moved.|$|E

Karnataka and Kerala governments spoke about [...] "tier II cities" [...] and the [...] "Smart City" [...] concept, but investment was not forthcoming". In another interview, Ramanna Rai said that [...] "the work on the Mangalore–Bangalore railway line was completed after 35 years of its launch."

2500|$|Mentalist Mark Edward relates from {{personal}} experience as a [...] "psychic performer" [...] how powerful a hit can be when someone in a large audience [...] "claims" [...] a phrase such as a [...] "clown in a graveyard" [...] statement. Edward describes a mental image of a clown placing flowers on graves and adds, [...] "Does that <b>mean</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> someone... whereupon a woman stands up and claims that he is speaking directly to her. She remembers it as Edward specifically stating that she knew a man who dressed as a clown and placed flowers on graves in her hometown. Edward reports that it took some convincing {{to get her to}} understand that he was not directly talking to her, but had thrown the statement out to the entire audience of 300 people. She made the connection, and because it seemed so personal and the situation so odd she felt that he was talking to her directly.|$|E

2500|$|Flight logs {{released}} in September 2004 {{in response to}} a lawsuit (see below) showed that Bush, who had been flying in the F-102A Delta Dagger, a single-seater interceptor, for most of his career, flew nine times in T-33 trainers in February and March 1972 – nearly twice as many times as he had flown in T-33s in the prior 18 months. The logs also show that on March 12 and April 10 of 1972, Bush took two passes to land his F-102 fighter. [...] Although White House officials could not explain the changes in the flight logs in these final flights, Air Force experts said there could be any of a number of reasons for the change in Bush's flight pattern. Retired Major General Paul A. Weaver, a former head of the Air National Guard, said Bush could have just been practicing landing skills.

2500|$|Described by Gomez as [...] "a {{beautiful}} {{start to}} the album", [...] "Good for You" [...] was the third song she received since signing with her new label Interscope Records, as well the second track to be recorded for the album. It was uninterruptedly recorded in 45 minutes at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California; during the process, Gomez's vocals featured cracks as the song [...] "took on this emotion [...] didn't realize [...] could tap into", and {{at the beginning of}} the session she was exhausted from pressurizing herself for a sound and concept for the album. According to her, this recording had no beat and was [...] "just a skeleton of a song". There was also no specific sound planned for the song at the time although it was suggested that its soft melodies be made more pop-indebted which Gomez disagreed with, believing it would take away from her vocal. She was entirely involved in the song's creative direction, providing additional songwriting, and helped to develop it to represent her process of self-realization, her confidence as a young woman, and feelings of vulnerability. The song also formed part of a process in which she wanted to portray her story as an artist and as part of a transitional album over which she would take full control. In an interview for MTV, she said this was her time [...] "to embrace who I am, and I'm not going to sit down in a chair and talk about something that doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> me anymore" [...] and spoke about her involvement in the track: [...] "This is the most I've been creatively involved from the writing process ... every single thing I'm even remotely singing about is something I've related to and something I'm hitting the nail on, and I had to pick what was going to represent the album and who I am as a whole".|$|E

2500|$|Alex. Ştefănescu {{agrees with}} Negoiţescu's own {{belief in the}} book's {{narrative}} qualities, arguing that Straja dragonilor is, after Poezia lui Eminescu, [...] "the best of all that this feverish and uneven author has ever written". The same commentator commends the volume it for displaying a form of sincerity that was ultimately [...] "conquered through culture {{and the experience of}} writing", resulting in [...] "another level" [...] of a memoir. He writes: [...] "All is beautiful in Ion Negoiţescu's autobiography, even that which is ugly. [...] A reader who is purely spurred on by a prosaic curiosity will find himself disappointed and will abandon it (like the sexually obsessed will abandon a book by Freud)." [...] In Pârvulescu's view: [...] "Although they break all sorts of taboos, [...] Negoiţescu's memoirs are so well written that they never veer into vulgarity or obscenity." [...] Likewise, Adriana Stan esteemed the book [...] "singular in our literature" [...] and its author's [...] "capital work". Also according to Ştefănescu, readers who follow the account of young Negoiţescu's spontaneous sexual act at the cinema will sympathize with the protagonist, and even [...] "breathe a sigh of relief" [...] to note that his advances were not rejected. The same reviewer finds another outstanding quality of the book in [...] "the vast depiction of emotional states", which he believes comparable to sections of Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. In one such fragment, he argues, Negoiţescu presents him child self as [...] "a strange Pygmalion", helping his own mother get dressed for a ball and obsessing over every detail in her appearance. The [...] "Proustian" [...] nature is also highlighted by Stan, who argues: [...] "the recollection performed by the grownup ego has therefore too little in common with a regular, constructed and directed writer's diary." [...] Additionally, Pârvulescu sees an essential quality of the book in its depiction of Transylvania as both a prolongation of Austria-Hungary's [...] "decadent greatness" [...] and an area of Balkan and Levantine echoes, [...] "the Ischler cookies on the same table as the qatayef." [...] A section of Straja dragonilor is based strictly on an inventory of Negoiţescu's genealogy, with insight into his family history. The segment is however deemed [...] "boring" [...] by Ştefănescu, who notes that the names mentioned [...] "do not <b>mean</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> us", but nevertheless acknowledges the [...] "chill" [...] they evoke: [...] "the writer, alerted by the premonition of death, wishes to save [...] all things that he can remember about his forefathers." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine if the {{proportion}} of a project <b>means</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> the way project management is being conducted. The method used to examine this, is through an analysis of three different projects, with projects exemplified as the festivals Musik I Lejet, Smukfest and Langelandsfestivalen. The festivals vary from being small to relatively large, measured on the amount of guests participating each of the events. The analyses cover the way organization, management, risk assessment and handling of stakeholders is conducted. It is shown that the size of a project is not a decisive influence on the way project management is acted out. Instead, the cultural dimensions within the organization shows up as a far more likely key factor, for causing how project management operates...|$|R
