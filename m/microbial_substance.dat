40|$|Asthma is a {{worldwide}} disease affecting an estimated 300 million individuals [1, 2]. Some authors {{refer to the}} increased prevalence of asthma reported during the past decades, {{in many parts of}} the world, as a wave of ‘‘asthma epidemic’’ [3]. Given the recent increase in asthma-related healthcare costs [4], it has become important, in a time of economical restriction, to critically review the dimensions of this phenomenon and to investigate the underlying causes. First of all, is there a real epidemic threat? Indeed, besides several proposed explanations for increasing asthma preva- lence (e. g. exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollution and specific allergens, change in diet intake, obesity, exposure to infections and <b>microbial</b> <b>substance</b> in the environment) [3], there has also been an improved awareness of the disease over the past few years. Substantial effort has been made in the past decade for the development and the dissemination of international asthma guidelines. Such widespread publicity has certainly contributed to improve asthma management worldwide and to identify and treat new asthmatic patients. However, it might also have caused overdiagnosis of asthma and, more specifi- cally, it may have contributed to the increased proportion of incorrectly diagnosed asthma cases. Inevitably, any misdiag- nosed cases lead to over treatment or inappropriate treatments [5], and increased risk of side-effects in the absence of any pharmacological benefit...|$|E
40|$|The non-reducing {{disaccharide}} trehalose (a-D-glucopyranosyl- 1, 1 -a-D-glucopyranoside) {{is widespread}} in nature, but is normally {{not present in}} higher plants. With respect to plant-microbe interactions, {{it is interesting that}} trehalose is regularly found in plant roots interacting with antagonistic fungi, mycorrhizal fungi, and in nitrogen-fixing root nodules, probably as a <b>microbial</b> <b>substance.</b> The impact of trehalose on plant metabolism and its role in nitrogen fixing symbiosis is unclear. This work focuses on the nodule symbiosis. It represents a genetic approach to study the role of trehalose synthesis by the microsymbiont. One pathway for trehalose synthesis is the OtsA/B pathway. Trehalose is synthesized from UDP-glucose and glucose- 6 -phosphate in a two-step process by the action of trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase (OtsA) and trehalose- 6 -phosphate phosphatase (OtsB). Homologues of the genes coding for these two enzymes in Escherichia coli, otsA and otsB, have been localized on the symbiotic plasmid of Rhizobium sp. NGR 234 (pNGR 234 a). To study the significance of rhizobial trehalose synthesis in free living and symbiotic rhizobia, an Ω-cassette was inserted into the otsA homologue. Phenotypically, the deletion of the rhizobial otsA-homologue strongly reduced trehalose synthesis under microaerobic growth conditions. Thus, there are strong indications that the rhizobial trehalose synthesis induced under hypoxic conditions is directed by the symbiotic plasmid encoded otsA-homologue in conjunction with otsB. The functionality of otsA has therefore indirectly been demonstrated in Rhizobium sp. NGR 234, which {{is the first time in}} aproteobacteria in general. In addition, the induction of otsA and its homologues by low oxygen conditions has not been previously reported. The natural environment inside nodules is characterized by low oxygen. In contrast, trehalose synthesis under salt stress was not influenced by the mutation of otsA. This indicates that Rhizobium sp. NGR 234 exhibits a second trehalose pathway. Activities of maltooligosyltrehalose synthase and maltooligosyl trehalohydrolase (MOS – pathway) had been demonstrated in Rhizobium sp. NGR 234 in previous work. To study the role of rhizobial otsA in symbiosis, various host plants were infected with Rhizobium sp. NGRWotsA. In a number of hosts, average nodule size was reduced, nodule number was increased (up to 30 %) and nitrogen fixation was reduced compared to control plants infected with the wildtype strain NGR 234. Analysis of the carbohydrate content of these nodules revealed significant increases in the levels of sucrose, hexoses and starch. Thus the deletion of the potential rhizobial otsA-homologue has a severe impact on rhizobium-legume symbiosis, and a signal function of trehalose in carbohydrate partitioning and root nodule development is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The hyporheic {{interstitial}} {{was recognized}} as an integral zone within the aquatic ecosystem bearing important functions for both adjacent compartments, surface and ground water, about 50 years ago. Since then, rather disciplinary works gained knowledge on the organismic community of this ecotone, its spatial extent, the role of distinct parameters such as hydrology and morphology, temporal characteristics, process dynamics, the role for stream or groundwater quality and restoration measures. However, a systematic study on the risks to the hyporheic functions was missing to date. This thesis combined existing methods in order to gather an integrated set of information allowing {{for the assessment of}} the ecotonal status. This approach was applied to investigate the functional behavior towards stressors like increasing nutrient and fine sediment input into a rather pristine environment. An interdisciplinary risk assessment and the establishment of adapted measures was called for as land-use scenarios for the studied catchment area indicated progressive onland erosion. Therefore firstly, an integrated monitoring scheme was drawn up and conducted at three sites along a river that underlay a stressor gradient such as mentioned before. Secondly, the data sets were analysed in order to evaluate the status of the hyporheic funtions at the riffles. Thirdly, a coupled surface-subsurface modelling approach was set up to further study the impact of the stressors on the ecotonal integrity. And fourthly, an interdisciplinary consideration combined with studies on the catchments sediment budget and the rivers ecological status was applied to identify measures for the restoration and protection of the aquatic ecosystem. The analysis of the data gathered {{with the help of the}} established monitoring scheme revealed that elevated nutrient or fine sediment input lead to biological or physical clogging, respectively, with consequences for the hyporheic zone functions. The surface - ground water connectivity was either lowered in summer months, when biofilm growth was highest, or permanently, as fine sediment particles infiltrated into the interstices of the riverbed sediment. Scouring did not seem to take place as high amounts of fine particles were found in the matrix after discharge events of snowmelt and summer precipitation. With respect to the biogeochemical regulation function, biofilm material appeared to provide an autochthonous carbon source boosting <b>microbial</b> <b>substance</b> turnover. The sediment underneath the physical clogged layer was cut off from carbon and oxygen rich surface water and thus was not reactive. However, the enhanced surface area provided by the fine sediment within the topmost sediment layer seemed to support microbial processing. The inclusion of the results of a study concerning the ecological status at the investigated reaches lead to the deduction that biological clogging at the present degree was not affecting habitat quality. Whereas the physical clogging had tremendeous and lasting effects on the macroinvertebrate community which carries to the conclusion that sediment management within the studied catchment is of uttermost importance. A scenario analysis reflecting distinct clogging degrees and types with a calibrated model of a studied riffle within a pristine reach proved the observed loss of hydrologic connectivity due to physical and biological clogging. Further, a treshold of oxygen consumption rates above which the reproduction of salmonid fish would be unsuccessful was identified for the settings of the middle reaches. In summer month with low discharge it seemed to be likely that this treshold might be reached. Following, a dynamic discharge may be decisive to protect the ecotonal integrity. The integration with the outcome of an investigation regarding the sediment sources within the catchment allowed for two suggestions. On the one hand, river bank restoration and protection within the middle reaches need to be prioritised, and on the other hand, the conservation of the natural vegetation at the steep slopes within the mountaineous areas need to be undertaken in order to secure the pristine aquatic environment of this area. Hyporheic zone research of the last decade was driven by testing hypotheses on the functional significance of distinct spatial and temporal configurations in the field and by new modelling approaches. However, data on the quantification of the ecological impact of clogging processes were lacking. The thesis contributed to the systemic understanding of the hyporheic zone being affected by physical and biological clogging and new field data within a degrading pristine environment were generated, accessible for further hyporheic research. The interdisciplinarity enabled comprehensive statements for the usage of an Integrated Water Resources Management plan...|$|E

In the present study we investigated the mechanisms underlying the B cell stimulatory capacity of PWM.

However, how these abiotic and biotic entities interact in a microhabitat is not fully understood. Visualization of the clay-bacterial micro-aggregate under scanning electron microscope (SEM) and profiling the associated elemental signature through energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) can potentially unravel the mechanisms of a complex clay-bacterial interaction. Osmium (Os) was used previously to enhance the visualization of <b>microbial</b> <b>substances,</b> but the delineation of bacterial cells from clay particles in a micro-aggregate was not tried before.

They can be present in many forms, including cell-bound capsular polysaccharides, unbound "slime", and as O-antigen component of lipopolysaccharide, with an equally wide range of biological functions. These include resistance to desiccation, protection against nonspecific and specific host immunity, and adherence.

We have used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MS to resolve lipopolysaccharide-induced changes in the protein profile of a Drosophila hemocytic cell line. We identified 24 intra-cellular proteins that were up- or down-regulated, or modified, in response to immune challenge. Several pro-teins with predicted immune functions, including lysoso-mal proteases, actin-binding/remodeling proteins, as well as proteins involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress, were affected by the immune assault. Intriguingly, a number of the proteins identified in this study have recently been implicated in phagocytosis in higher ver-tebrates. We suggest that phagocytosis is activated in Drosophila hemocytes by the presence of microbial sub-stances, and that this activation constitutes an evolution-arily conserved arm of innate immunity. In addition, a number of proteins involved in calcium-regulated signal-ing, mRNA processing, and nuclear transport were af-fected, consistent with a possible role in reprogramming of gene expression.

40|$|Macrophages play {{a pivotal}} role in the immune system through {{recognition}} and elimination of microbial pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages interact with <b>microbial</b> <b>substances</b> and initiate signal transduction through intracellular adapters. TLR 4, which recognizes the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, triggers downstream signaling mediators and eventually activates IκB kinase (IKK) complex and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as p 38. Previous reports revealed that, in addition to NF-κB, a core transcription factor of the innate immune response, the induction of some LPS-induced genes in macrophages required another transcription factor whose activity depends on p 38. However, these additional transcription factors remain to be identified. In order to identify p 38 -activated transcription factors that cooperate with NF-κB in response to LPS stimulation, microarrays were used to identify genes regulated by both NF-κB and p 38 using wild-type, IKK-depleted, and p 38 inhibitor-treated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). In silico analysis of transcription factor binding sites was used to predict the potential synergistic transcription factors from the co-expressed genes. Among these genes, NF-κB and C/EBPβ, a p 38 downstream transcription factor, were predicted to co-regulate genes in LPS-stimulated BMDMs. Based on the subsequent results of a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and TNFAIP 3 expression in C/EBPβ-ablated macrophages, we demonstrated that Tnfaip 3 is regulated by both NF-κB and p 38 -dependent C/EBPβ. These results identify a novel regulatory mechanism in TLR 4 -mediated innate immunity...|$|R
5|$|Various {{antibodies}} {{directed at}} nerve cells {{have been reported}} in Guillain–Barré syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these antibodies have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A ganglioside is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of N-acetylneuraminic acid groups. The key four gangliosides against which antibodies have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside antibodies being associated with particular features; for instance, GQ1b antibodies have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis. The production of these antibodies after an infection is probably the result of molecular mimicry, where the immune system is reacting to <b>microbial</b> <b>substances</b> but the resultant antibodies also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. After a Campylobacter infection, the body produces antibodies of the IgA class; only a small proportion of people also produce IgG antibodies against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e.g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of antibodies against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside antibodies cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some antibodies bind to more than one type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Furthermore, the development of pathogenic antibodies may depend on the presence of other strains of bacteria in the bowel.|$|R

40|$|About 15 {{years have}} gone by since Strachan first {{proposed}} the idea that infections and unhygienic contact may confer protection from the development of allergic illnesses. The so-called ‘hygiene hypothesis’ has since undergone numerous modifications {{in the field of}} epidemiology, clinical science and immunology. Three main areas of research have been brought forward: to explore the role of overt viral and bacterial infections for the inception of allergic diseases; to investigate the significance of environmental exposure to microbial compounds on the development of allergies; and to study the effect of both exposures on underlying innate and adaptive immune responses. A concept unifying these various aspects has not been found, but various pieces of a complex interplay between immune responses of the host, characteristics of the invading microorganism, the level and variety of the environmental exposure and the interactions between an exposed subject's genetic background and the environmental exposures becomes apparent. A natural experiment relating to the hygiene hypothesis is the recurrent observation of a protective effect of growing up on a farm for asthma and allergies. This has been shown in a large number of epidemiological studies across the world among children and adults. The timing and duration of exposure are likely to play a critical role. The largest reduction in risk has been demonstrated for those exposed prenatally and continuously thereafter until adulthood. The protective factors in these farming environments have not been unravelled completely. Findings from various studies suggest that the contact with farm animals, at least in childhood, confers protection. Also the consumption of unprocessed cow's milk directly from the farm has been shown to protect from childhood asthma and allergies. Increased levels of <b>microbial</b> <b>substances</b> may, at least in part, contribute to the ‘farm effect’. However, only few studies have measured microbial exposures in these environments and the results obtained so far suggest that the underlying protective microbial exposure(s) have not been identified, but a number of studies using metagenomic approaches are currently under way. The mechanisms by which such environmental exposures confer protection from respiratory allergies are also not well understood. There is good evidence for the involvement of innate immune responses, but translation into protective mechanisms for asthma and allergies is lacking.

The early phase of the immune response against MCMV is characterized by the production of chemokines which subsequently recruit and activate effector cells. One of the main sources of chemokines are myeloid cells and natural killer cells. In the current work it was shown for the first time at the single cell level that MCMV infects macrophages and thereby impairs the production of chemokines, cytokines and other essential immunological functions. MCMV blocked the activation of resting macrophages by <b>microbial</b> <b>substances</b> and the subsequent production of chemokines (MIP- 1 α, MIP- 1 β, RANTES and MCP- 1), cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 12, IL- 15, IL- 18 and TNF-α) and nitric oxid. The blockade by MCMV was achieved by downregulating of the surface receptors TLR 2 (toll like receptor 2) and TLR 4 leading to a stop of chemokine gene transcription. Hence MCMV infected macrophages were not able to produce chemokines and cytokines necessary for an effective TH 1 -immune response. In activated macrophages MCMV downregulated the ongoing production of the above mentioned soluble mediators. Additionally, MCMV interfered with other essential macrophage functions: the phagocytosis of dextran and the expression of immunological important surface receptors (CD 29, CD 80, CD 86 and CD 115). MCMV infected macrophages are therefore paralysed with respect to the recognition and elimination of microbial pathogens. Thus the MCMV induced paralysis of macrophages affects three main functions of phagocytes: the intercellular communication (and costimulation), the detection of pathogens and antimicrobial activities. Using these strategies MCMV is able to evade the primary immune response despite a short-time and local immune activation and uses the mobility of monocytes and macrophages to disseminate and reach immunological privileged sites in the host. As a result, an acute infection could lead to a local and transient immune suppression that might be an important strategy of viral dissemination. The results of this work describe a possible mechanism which may explain the transient immune suppression observed in acute MCMV infected mice...|$|R
40|$|Biogenic {{particles}} discharged by {{wastewater treatment}} plants play important roles in receiving water {{because of the large}} specific surface area and good mobility of the particles. In this study, the changes induced in biogenic particles by natural sunlight were investigated to understand the phototransformation of the particles in the receiving waters. The results showed that photoexposure resulted in significant decreases in the sizes of the biogenic particles but that photoexposure did not impact the zeta potentials. In addition, the photodissolution of biogenic particulate organic matter (POM) led to the generation of biogenic dissolved organic matter (DOM). Characterization using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy showed that photoexposure changed both the shapes and the intensities of the EEM spectra of the biogenic POM; the regions of the T 1 and T 2 peaks were susceptible to photoexposure. Modeling by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) decomposed the EEMs of the biogenic POM into four valid components, i. e., terrestrial or <b>microbial</b> humic-like <b>substances,</b> tryptophan-like proteins, tyrosine-like proteins and hydrophobic proteins. The humic-like substances in the biogenic POM from the effluents were subject to lower decreases (17. 0 % and 11. 6 %). Throughout the entire incubation time, the PARAFAC components in the biogenic DOM were dominated by elimination mechanisms rather than by production through photodissolution of the biogenic POM...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} which microorganisms {{might be}} responsible for microbial reduction of humic substances in sedimentary environments, humic-reducing bacteria were isolated {{from a variety of}} sediment types. These included lake sediments, pristine and contaminated wetland sediments, and marine sediments. In each of the sediment types, all of the humic reducers recovered with acetate as the electron donor and the humic substance analog, 2, 6 -anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS), as the electron acceptor were members of the family Geobacteraceae. This was true whether the AQDS-reducing bacteria were enriched prior to isolation on solid media or were recovered from the highest positive dilutions of sediments in liquid media. All of the isolates tested not only conserved energy to support growth from acetate oxidation coupled to AQDS reduction but also could oxidize acetate with highly purified soil humic acids as the sole electron acceptor. All of the isolates tested were also able to grow with Fe(III) serving as the sole electron acceptor. This is consistent with previous studies that have suggested that the capacity for Fe(III) reduction is a common feature of all members of the Geobacteraceae. These studies demonstrate that the potential for <b>microbial</b> humic <b>substance</b> reduction {{can be found in a}} wide variety of sediment types and suggest that Geobacteraceae species might be important humic-reducing organisms in sediments...|$|R
40|$|<b>Microbial</b> humic <b>substance</b> (HS) {{reduction}} and subsequent abiotic electron transfer from reduced HS to poorly soluble Fe(III) (oxyhydr) oxides, a process named electron shuttling, significantly increases microbial Fe(III) mineral reduction rates. However, {{the importance of}} electron shuttling in nature and notably the electron transfer from HS to biogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr) oxides have thus far not been determined. In this study, we have quantified the rate and extent of electron transfer from reduced and non-reduced Pahokee Peat humic acids (PPHA) and fresh soil organic matter (SOM) extracts to both synthetic and environmentally relevant biogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr) oxides. We found that biogenic Fe(III) minerals were reduced faster and to an equal or higher degree than their abiogenic counterparts. Differences were attributed to differences in crystallinity and the association of bacterial biomass with biogenic minerals. Compared to purified PPHA, SOM extract transferred fewer electrons per mg carbon and electron transfer was observed only to poorly crystalline ferrihydrite but not to more crystalline goethite. This indicates a difference in redox potential distribution of the redox-active functional groups in extracted SOM relative to the purified PPHA. Our results suggest that HS electron shuttling can also contribute to iron redox processes in environments where biogenic Fe(III) minerals are present...|$|R

Often, health complaints occur even after the moisture damage has dried, sometimes even only then. In these cases, moisture measurements are not suitable to localize the microorganisms. Besides spores and other particles, microorganisms emit gaseous <b>substances</b> (<b>microbial</b> volatile organic compounds = MVOC). The MVOCs are still emitted from the contaminated material long after the microorganism has died. Dogs can be trained to search for microbial odor and to detect the source.
