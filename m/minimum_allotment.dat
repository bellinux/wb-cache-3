5|$|In 1961 a {{residents}} progress {{association was}} formed. A prime goal was {{the building of}} a reservoir—supplied from the river—on Armidale hill overlooking the town. To defray costs and gain council acceptance, {{a large part of the}} work was performed by volunteers. This scheme began supplying the town on 17 February 1961. Up to the 1970s, Carrick's growth was limited by the lack of town sewerage—which restricted the <b>minimum</b> <b>allotment</b> size—and reluctance of landowner's to subdivide property. A 1977 planning study found that the land structure allowed most of the town to be served by a gravity fed system and recommended construction. As of 2008 the majority of the town was connected to reticulated water and sewerage.|$|E
50|$|During the 1880s Brisbane {{had grown}} spectacularly. The {{population}} {{more than doubled}} to over 90,000 in 1891, primarily due to immigration. This stimulated building activity, municipal organisation, provision of amenities and services, and cultural and leisure outlets. The number of inhabited dwellings almost doubled between 1881 and 1891, from 5,814 to 10,321. Aided by the requirement of the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885, which enforced a <b>minimum</b> <b>allotment</b> size, this population increase caused Brisbane to overshoot its boundaries, growing {{along the lines of}} transport (railway, road, tram and omnibus routes which were dictated by the hilly topography of the area) until the town coalesced with its fringe settlements transforming them into suburbs.|$|E

40|$|In {{a shared}} server infrastructure, a {{scheduler}} controls how quantities of resources are shared {{over time in}} a fair manner across multiple, competing consumers. It should support wide (parallel) requests for variable-sized pool of resources, provide assurance of <b>minimum</b> resource <b>allotment</b> on demand, and give predictable assignments to plan their resource usage (e. g., advance reservations). Our approach integrates a fair queuing algorithm with a calendar scheduler. We present Winks, a proportional share allocation policy that addresses the needs of shared server environments. It extends start-time fair queuing to supports wide requests with backfill, advance reservations, dynamic cluster sizing, dynamic request sizing, and intraflow request prioritization. We show that it preserves fairness properties across queue transformations and calendar operations needed to implement these extensions. The analysis and experimental results show that Winks enforces shares effectively, even when wide requests would otherwise prevent a flow from making progress. While the algorithm {{is presented in the}} context of a virtual computing system, it is also applicable as a full-featured job scheduler. 1...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, the parcels {{which we}} {{examined}} {{owing to the}} construction of pipelines lie outside the residential areas and/or within agricultural land. In both of these rural areas, the <b>minimum</b> <b>allotment</b> condition is 5000  m 2. The easement rights are recorded in deed and pipeline transit fees are paid in Turkey by establishing permanent easement rights.|$|E
