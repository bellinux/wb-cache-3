5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as <b>My</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Foot</b> and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's <b>My</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Foot,</b> which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E

500|$|Houllier was {{disappointed}} with Liverpool's start and noticed his players {{struggled with the}} humidity.

[...] Houllier revealed he gave a frank assessment of the task facing his players before the match; although in his words Arsenal were [...] "...probably a bit better than us, probably more mature, more experienced, more ability in some areas," [...] dealing with setbacks would make the difference on the day. He dismissed accusations that Liverpool were boring, rather describing his team as difficult to beat. Owen, the match winner, felt he answered his critics by scoring left-footed: [...] "It's nice to prove people wrong when they say you haven't got a left foot. I {{was supposed to be the}} worst header and the worst player with <b>my</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> in the league, and how could an England player play when they haven't got a left foot....

When I was onstage, I would pretend as though <b>my</b> <b>left</b> side was the same as my right. 　　In doing so, I denied the truth of my body. Mask work freed me of my ego and enabled me to look at my body free of judgment. When I put on the mask my attention shifted from mental to physical. When I saw from within, I noticed <b>my</b> <b>left</b> side had another octave to be played. I found a freedom and versatility, I could now play my entire being as an instrument. I started using my disability as an asset, rather than an obstacle. I found that <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hand wasn't a burden, but a unique tool in telling the stories of my characters. 　　Doing mask work in The Venetian Twins allowed me to construct characters who are incredibly physically specific using my instrument. I didn't shy away from using <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hand and <b>foot.</b> I embraced them as part of my body, built them into the composition of my characters. My three years at UC San Diego have shifted my relationship with my own body. Now I don't go on stage to deny myself, rather I inhabit myself. I allow myself to be seen...|$|R

5000|$|Filming {{proved to}} be {{dangerous}} at times. Margaret Hamilton was severely burned in the Munchkinland scene. A concealed elevator {{was supposed to take}} her down while a bit of fire and smoke erupted to dramatize and conceal her exit. The first take ran like clockwork; however, in the DVD commentary, Hamilton states, [...] "I had to stand on this dual elevator, that went down slowly or went down fast, and in this case it dropped out from under me, it <b>left</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> and I followed it." [...] The fire and smoke then erupted. However, for the second take, the timing was off, and Hamilton was exposed to the flames. The grease in her copper-based makeup caught fire and had to be completely and quickly removed before the ensuing second-degree burns on her hands and face could be treated. After spending six weeks in the hospital convalescing, she returned to filming.|$|R
500|$|From 2006 to 2007, Sheen starred as the {{television}} broadcaster David Frost in Frost/Nixon {{at both the}} Donmar Warehouse and Gielgud Theatre in London and at the Jacobs Theatre on Broadway. The play, written by Peter Morgan, directed by Michael Grandage and co-starring Frank Langella, was a critical and commercial success but Sheen initially accepted the role as a favour to his friends and [...] "never {{thought it was going}} anywhere". The Guardian said the actor [...] "exactly captures Frost's verbal tics and mannerisms while suggesting a nervousness behind the self-assurance". [...] "He's got the voice, the mannerisms, the blaze," [...] said the Financial Times, [...] "but, more than that, Sheen—as viscerally exciting an actor as any in Britain today—shows us the hunger of Frost's ambition [...]. and fox-like instinct for the hunt and the kill." [...] Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. Sheen next appeared in the 2007 film Music Within as a political activist with cerebral palsy. He spoke of having a [...] "responsibility" [...] to accurately portray the condition. Variety said his performance was [...] "remarkable.. utterly convincing", USA Today found him [...] "outstanding" [...] while the Los Angeles Times felt he was [...] "reminiscent of Daniel Day-Lewis in <b>My</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Foot,</b> bringing a vibrancy and wit to the role". Also that year, Sheen starred in the short film Airlock, or How To Say Goodbye in Space with Derek Jacobi and was invited to join the actors' branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.|$|E
