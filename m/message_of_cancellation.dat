Despite careful liaison with general practitioners, and a booked admission policy, over 6 % of patients were cancelled as unsuitable. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the number <b>of</b> <b>cancellations</b> on medical grounds would be reduced by closer liaison with general practitioners, and the establishment of preadmission clinics. Ensuring that only consultants book patients for surgery would also reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>cancellations</b> due to incorrect indications for surgery...|$|R

2500|$|J. Stephen Kennedy {{wrote that}} the {{majority}} of the Supreme Court was sufficiently concerned with the constitutional challenges to the line item veto presented to declare the act wholly unconstitutional, instead of relying on other traditional and less sweeping ways of correcting acts of Congress. In his view, “the Court’s decision sent a clear <b>message</b> <b>of</b> finality for any future use of the line item veto.” Kennedy also noted that while the majority relied on a strict interpretation or literal textual reading of the Presentment Clause contained in Article I of the United States Constitution, Justice Scalia, in his dissent, “stray somewhat from his usual strict constructionist approach ... by stressing that the President’s act <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> would only occur after satisfaction of the Presentment Clause.” ...|$|R

The analysis <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> is presented in parametric terms, both in time and in frequency, leading to a three-dimensional description <b>of</b> a <b>cancellation</b> that is suitable for determining the geometrical arrangement for a given degree <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> and consequently can be used for the design of ANC systems. Such parameters can also be used to determine the performance of the resulting ANC system...|$|R

40|$|Multivariate Hensel {{construction}} with floating-point numbers often cause large cancellation errors {{which are}} errors {{due to a}} <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> almost the same numbers. Sasaki andYamaguchi [SY 98] showedthat multivariate Hensel construction causes large cancellation errors if the expansion point is chosen near a singular point, andSasaki [Sas 00] studied four mechanisms <b>of</b> term <b>cancellations</b> near a singular point. However, an analysis <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> errors, if the expansion point is chosen randomly, has never been studied. Moreover, in practical computations, {{we do not know}} in advance where the nearest singular point is. In this paper, we investigate a distance to the nearest singular point from the expansion point andestimate a magnitude <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> errors. ...|$|R
40|$|If a {{taxpayer}} borrows money, the borrowed funds {{are not included}} in the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s gross income. That treatment is proper even though the taxpayer has increased his assets by the amount he borrowed because he also has created a corresponding liability to pay back the loan. The taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s net: wealth has not increased. 2 ̆ 7 The more difficult and interesting questions arise when the taxpayer fails to repay the loan. At first blush, it would appear that upon <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> a loan, the taxpayer should have income for the amount that was cancelled. However, the current tax treatment is not that simple. A number of exceptions exist to the straightforward treatment under which the cancellation requires the taxpayer to recognize income. Some of those exceptions reflect an application of normal tax principles while others exist for programmatic purposes. Those exceptions make the tax treatment <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> debt particularly complex. The goal of this Article is to set out the tax treatment <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> debt, including the many exceptions that apply, it first reviews the history <b>of</b> the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> debt rules, which helps explain how we arrived at the current treatment. It then covers the current statutory treatment <b>of</b> <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> debt as well as the many common law rules (such as the transactional approach and the tax benefit rule) that apply...|$|R
