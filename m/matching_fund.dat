5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up to half of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood <b>Matching</b> <b>Fund,</b> a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed on the bridge to discourage further damage.|$|E
25|$|After {{less than}} four months, on July 7, 2010, it emerged from {{bankruptcy}} after a multi-million dollar anonymous <b>matching</b> <b>fund</b> contribution toward operating costs and judicially approved debt cancellation. The Pasadena Playhouse also reduced paid staff to essential upper level administration, keeping the Artistic Director Sheldon Epps as coordinator {{for the rest of}} the planned consolidation. Director Epps announced through an interview with the LA Times that the shake-up was intended to put the theatre back on solid financial footing and ensure the Playhouse's survival into the future. The Playhouse released a tentative Fall/Winter season schedule including one new production of Dangerous Beauty slated for January 2011. Plans for a new extension and 400 seat venue designed pro bono by Frank Gehry that was announced in 2007 were not confirmed to be moving forward despite its possibility as a revenue stream and the strong donation campaign already in place for its construction.|$|E
25|$|Northern philanthropists {{continued}} to support black {{education in the}} 20th century, even as tensions rose within the black community, exemplified by Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois, as to the proper emphasis between industrial and classical academic education at the college level. An example of a major donor to Hampton Institute and Tuskegee was George Eastman, who also helped fund health programs at colleges and in communities. Collaborating with Washington {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century, philanthropist Julius Rosenwald provided matching funds for community efforts to build rural schools for black children. He insisted on white and black cooperation in the effort, wanting to ensure that white-controlled school boards made a commitment to maintain the schools. By the 1930s local parents had helped raise funds (sometimes donating labor and land) to create over 5,000 rural schools in the South. Other philanthropists, such as Henry H. Rogers and Andrew Carnegie, each of whom had arisen from modest roots to become wealthy, used <b>matching</b> <b>fund</b> grants to stimulate local development of libraries and schools.|$|E

2500|$|While {{his presidential}} bid {{ultimately}} ended in failure, Dean's campaign served {{to frame the}} White House race by tapping into voters' concerns {{about the war in}} Iraq, energizing Democrats, and sharpening criticism of incumbent George W. Bush. Dean's lone Pennsylvania delegate, State Rep. Mark B. Cohen of Philadelphia, said Dean's decision, ultimately emulated by Kerry, to forgo primary federal matching funds and exceed the <b>matching</b> <b>fund</b> spending limits [...] "marked the day the Democratic Party became a serious contender for national power in 2004." ...|$|E
2500|$|Improvements {{were also}} made in income and work {{conditions}} for home workers, accident insurance {{was extended to}} non-working adults, and the Border Zone Assistance Act (1971) increased levels of assistance to the declining zonal peripheral area. The Occupational Safety Act (1973) required employers to provide company doctors and safety experts. A directive on protection against noise at the place of work was adopted in November 1970. If measurements showed or there was reason to assume that a noise level guide value of 90dB( [...] A) may be exceeded at the place of work, then the authority had to instruct the employer to arrange check-ups of the employees concerned and these employees had to use personal noise protection devices. A <b>matching</b> <b>fund</b> program for 15 million employees was also introduced, which stimulated them to accumulate capital.|$|E

50|$|Rare {{instruments}} of party subsidies are <b>matching</b> <b>funds</b> and tax credits. <b>Matching</b> <b>funds</b> are granted {{to a political}} competitor who has proven to a government authority {{that he or she}} solicited small individual donations.

Because <b>matching</b> <b>funds</b> and tax credits depend on financial contributions by individual citizens such support is more compatible with a participatory concept of democracy than flat grants, which do not require specific efforts by the fundraising parties (or candidates).|$|R
