40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is a frequent}} and distressing mental disorder, about which {{much remains to be}} learned. It is a heterogeneous disorder; the hyperarousal sub-type (about 70 % of occurrences and simply termed PTSD in this paper) is the topic of this article, but the dissociative subtype (about 30 % of occurrences and likely involving quite different <b>brain</b> <b>mechanisms)</b> is outside its scope. A theoretical model is presented that integrates neuroscience data on diverse brain regions known to be involved in PTSD, and extensive psychiatric findings on the disorder. Specifically, the amygdala is a <b>multifunctional</b> <b>brain</b> region that is crucial to PTSD, and processes peritraumatic hyperarousal on grounded cognition principles to produce hyperarousal symptoms. Amygdala activity also modulates hippocampal function, which is supported by a large body of evidence, and likewise amyg-dala activity modulates several brainstem regions, visual cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), to produce diverse startle, visual, memory, numbing, anger, and recklessness symptoms. Additional brain regions process other aspects of peritraumatic responses to produce further symptoms. These contentions are supported by neuroimaging, neuropsychological, neuroanatomical, physiological, cog...|$|R

40|$|The {{symbiotic}} {{relationships between}} art and the brain begin with the obvious fact that <b>brain</b> <b>mechanisms</b> underlie the creation and appreciation of art. Conversely, many spectacular images of neural structures have remarkable aesthetic appeal. But beyond its fascinating forms, the many functions performed by <b>brain</b> <b>mechanisms</b> provide a profound subject for aesthetic exploration. Complex interactions in the tangled neural networks in our brain miraculously generate coherent behavior and cognition. Neuroscientists tackle these phenomena with specialized methodologies that limit the scope of exposition and are comprehensible to an initiated minority.

30|$|Notable {{progress}} has been made in understanding brain bases of hedonic processing, producing insights into that brain systems that cause and/or code sensory pleasures. Progress has been facilitated by the recognition that hedonic <b>brain</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are largely shared between humans and other mammals, allowing application of conclusions from animal studies to a better understanding of human pleasures. In the past few years, evidence has also grown to indicate that for humans, <b>brain</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of higher abstract pleasures strongly overlap with more basic sensory pleasures. This overlap may provide a window into underlying brain circuitry that generates all pleasures, including even the hedonic quality of pervasive well-being that detaches from any particular sensation to apply to daily life in a more sustained or frequent fashion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an {{unsupervised}} {{neural network}} introduced by Kohonen and is a model simpli-fying self-organization process of the brain. However, SOM is still {{far away from the}} realization of the <b>brain</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In order to realize more powerful and more flexible mechanism, it is important to propose new models of the <b>brain</b> <b>mechanism</b> and to investigate their behaviors. In this study, as the first step to realize a new nonlinear spring model of SOM, we propose a simple one dimensional 2 -neuron model connected by a nonlinear spring. We investigate its behavior under a simple assumption where input vectors are given to the model periodically. Computer simulated results show that the neurons oscillate chaotically. I...|$|R
