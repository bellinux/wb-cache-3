5|$|The film {{serves as}} a satire of the social conditions, {{dominant}} practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, {{as well as the}} film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Filmmaking was becoming more expensive and requiring larger technical resources, particularly with the rise of sound production, making it increasingly difficult for amateur filmmakers to enter the profession. This deepened a divide between amateurs and Hollywood professionals, and as a result, a growing number of amateurs started lampooning Hollywood in their films, including A Hollywood Extra. The subject of the film is an extra who starts his Hollywood career with hopes and dreams, but ultimately finds himself used and discarded by the industry, and his artistic ambitions destroyed. At the start of the film, the protagonist has a name (<b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones)</b> and a letter of recommendation outlining his talents, but his abilities are ignored and he is reduced to a number, symbolizing his dehumanization.|$|E

When they reach <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones’s</b> door, Billy rings the bell {{with the intention of}} letting the house owner know that someone is at the door, and of making her open the door ... in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones's</b> story as told above ... Mrs. Jones opens the door. Billy and Julia shout ‘trick or treats!’ Mrs. Jones gives them candies.|$|R

25|$|The hens – The hens are promised at {{the start}} of the {{revolution}} that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under <b>Mr</b> <b>Jones.</b> However their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm.

25|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Jones</b> – A heavy drinker {{who is the}} {{original}} owner of Manor Farm, a farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job. He is an allegory of Russian Tsar Nicholas II, who abdicated following the February Revolution of 1917 and was murdered, {{along with the rest}} of his family, by the Bolsheviks on 17 July 1918.

25|$|Olaudah Equiano (Gustavus Vassa) {{published}} his memoir, {{one of the}} genre of {{what became known as}} slave narratives - accounts by slaves who achieved freedom. As an African with direct experience of the slave trade and slavery, Equiano was pleased that his book became highly influential in the anti-slavery movement. Clarkson wrote to the Rev. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones</b> at Trinity College, to introduce Equiano to him and the community. He asked for aid from the Rev. Jones in selling copies of the memoir and arranging for Equiano to visit Cambridge to lecture.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Jones {{defended his}} super middleweight title {{successfully}} multiple times. He began {{the year by}} knocking out IBF #1 Antoine Byrd in round one. This {{was the first time}} a championship fight took place at Pensacola. In a fight billed as The Devil & <b>Mr</b> <b>Jones,</b> he faced former IBF Lightweight Champion Vinny Pazienza and defeated him in round six, after knocking down Pazienza three times. In the fourth round, Jones became the first fighter in CombuBox history to go an entire round without being hit by his opponent. Pazienza was credited with throwing five punches and landing zero. Pazienza was guaranteed $1.35 million, while Jones, who worked off percentages of the gate and the pay-per-view revenue, was guaranteed at least $2 million. Jones then beat Tony Thornton in round two by KO three months later.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court remanded {{the case}} to the {{district}} court. During the investigation, the government obtained cell site location data with a 2703(d) order under the Stored Communications Act. In light of the Supreme Court's decision, the government sought to use this data instead of the GPS data it had collected. Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ruled in December 2012 that the government could use the cell site data against Jones. A new trial began in January 2013 after <b>Mr</b> <b>Jones</b> rejected 2 plea offers of 15 to 22 years with credit for time served. In March 2013, a mistrial was declared with the jury evenly split. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones</b> had represented himself at trial. [...] The Government planned for a fourth trial but in May 2013 Jones accepted a plea bargain of 15 years with credit for time served.|$|E
500|$|The {{play was}} {{described}} by The Times as a [...] "strange free-wheeling piece {{about a man who}} has said goodbye to the world and simply shut himself up in his room." [...] The reviewer added [...] "It is a strange unpredictable world <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones</b> conjures up and Mr. Saville, with the aid of an excellent cast (Miss Maureen Pryor and Miss Ursula Howells were particularly good) and some haunting songs by Mr. Bob Dylan, brought it powerfully to life." [...] The Observer, in 2005, reports that the play [...] "got stinking reviews" [...] according to folk singer Martin Carthy, adding that the Western Daily Mail reviewer was [...] "baffled" [...] and The Listener had [...] "noted that Dylan had 'sat around playing and singing attractively, if a little incomprehensibly'".|$|E
500|$|The house proper was {{completed}} in 1798, with a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones</b> of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter. Built in an 18th-century Georgian style, the [...] "balance and symmetry" [...] of the architecture signaled [...] "subdued elegance". The house was accented with Federalist highlights, such as [...] "the fanlights over the doors and the balustrades on the rooftop belvedere and main staircase", marking it as distinctly American. Douglas R. McMinn, in the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Northumberland Historic District, calls it a [...] "mansion" [...] that is [...] "probably the finest example of the Federal style in the region". As William N. Richardson, the site administrator for the Joseph Priestley House in the 1990s, notes, Priestley's American home did not resemble his [...] "high-style Georgian town house" [...] that was destroyed in Birmingham; rather, it was [...] "plain" [...] and built in the [...] "American vernacular".|$|E
6000|$|Schomberg, {{raising his}} eyes, at last met the gleams in two dark caverns under <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones's</b> devilish eyebrows, {{directed}} upon him impenetrably. He shuddered as if horrors worse than murder had been lurking there, and said, nodding towards Ricardo: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did {{you think}} a fellow is, sir--a baby?" [...] he said, in answer to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones's</b> objections. [...] "I am {{trying to find out}} what I would do myself. He wouldn't be likely to be cleverer than I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ricardo tossed up {{his chin}} to {{indicate}} the room above; from which Schomberg, his wits painfully aroused by this reminder of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones's</b> existence, concluded that the latter had withdrawn into his bedroom. Ricardo, observing him from under lowered eyelids, went on: ...|$|R
500|$|... "Ballad of a Thin Man" [...] {{is driven}} by Dylan's piano, which {{contrasts}} with [...] "the spooky organ riffs" [...] played by Al Kooper. Marqusee describes the song as one of [...] "the purest songs of protest ever sung", as it looks at the media and its inability to understand both the singer and his work. He writes that the song became the anthem of an in-group, [...] "disgusted by the old, excited by the new... elated by their discovery of others who shared their feelings", with its refrain [...] "Something is happening here/ But you don't know what it is/ Do you, Mr Jones?" [...] epitomizing the [...] "hip exclusivity" [...] of the burgeoning counterculture. Robert Shelton describes the song's central character, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jones,</b> as [...] "one of Dylan's greatest archetypes", characterizing him as [...] "a Philistine... superficially educated and well bred but not very smart {{about the things that}} count".|$|E
500|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones</b> (Jules Raucourt), {{an artist}} and {{aspiring}} movie star, arrives in Hollywood and is immediately star-struck by the glitz and glamour of the film industry. He speaks with a film studio representative, presenting a letter of recommendation and attempting to speak on his own behalf, but the representative cuts him off and writes the number [...] "9413" [...] on his forehead. From this point on, 9413 speaks only in unintelligible gibberish and moves in a mechanical fashion, mindlessly following the instructions of film directors and studio representatives. He goes {{on a series of}} casting calls, but is unable to find any success, constantly being confronted with signs that read, [...] "No Casting Today". A series of images are interspersed throughout these scenes, including shots of Hollywood, cameras filming, the word [...] "DREAMS" [...] written in the stars, and an endlessly repeating loop of a man walking up a stairway toward the word [...] "SUCCESS", without ever reaching the top.|$|E
500|$|Morrison's {{influence}} {{can readily}} {{be heard in}} the music of a diverse array of major artists and according to The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll (Simon & Schuster, 2001), [...] "his influence among rock singers/song writers is unrivaled by any living artist outside of that other prickly legend, Bob Dylan. Echoes of Morrison's rugged literateness and his gruff, feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Elvis Costello". His influence includes U2 (Bono was quoted saying [...] "I am in awe of a musician like Van Morrison. I had to stop listening to Van Morrison records about six months before we made The Unforgettable Fire because I didn't want his very original soul voice to overpower my own."); John Mellencamp ("Wild Night"); Jim Morrison; Joan Armatrading (the only musical influence she will acknowledge); Nick Cave; Rod Stewart; Tom Petty; Rickie Lee Jones (recognises both Laura Nyro and Van Morrison as the main influences on her career); Elton John; Graham Parker; Sinéad O'Connor; Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy; Bob Seger ("I know Bruce Springsteen was very much affected by Van Morrison, and so was I." [...] from Creem interview) ("I've Been Working"); Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners ("Jackie Wilson Said"); Jimi Hendrix ("Gloria"); Jeff Buckley ("The Way Young Lovers Do", [...] "Sweet Thing"); Nick Drake; and numerous others, including the Counting Crows (their [...] "sha-la-la" [...] sequence in <b>Mr</b> <b>Jones,</b> is a tribute to Morrison). Morrison's influence reaches into the country music genre, with Hal Ketchum acknowledging, [...] "He (Van Morrison) was a major influence in my life." ...|$|E
60|$|The gale was a {{short-lived}} one. On {{the following morning}} the wind had decreased to a moderate breeze, and before night the sea had gone down sufficiently to allow the boat of <b>Mr</b> <b>Jones's</b> sloop to come alongside of the floating light.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Jones's</b> {{teeth were}} {{suddenly}} started chattering by another faint puff of wind, a mere sigh from the west, where Venus cast her rays {{on the dark}} edge of the horizon, like a bright lamp hung above the grave of the sun.|$|R
60|$|The vengeful {{spirit in}} me exulted. I said to myself, I wish you joy of your job, Mr. Bixby; you'll {{have a good}} time finding <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jones's</b> {{plantation}} such a night as this; and I hope you never WILL find it as long as you live.|$|R
