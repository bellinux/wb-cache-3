5|$|A related {{argument}} against evolution {{is that most}} mutations are harmful. However, {{the vast majority of}} mutations are neutral, and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in another.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{criteria}} {{exist for}} each of the main subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but these may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction failure) and therefore changes to these criteria have been proposed. Sometimes, repeated testing <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prolotherapy – the {{practice}} of injecting solutions into joints (or other areas) to cause inflammation and thereby stimulate the body's healing response – has not {{been found to be}} effective by itself, although it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> when added to another therapy.|$|E

5|$|With {{other causes}} ruled out, people with {{non-specific}} {{low back pain}} are typically treated symptomatically, without exact determination of the cause. Efforts to uncover factors that might complicate the diagnosis, such as depression, substance abuse, or an agenda concerning insurance payments <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful,</b> and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, {{evidence}} of the earliest known life on land on Earth may {{have been found in}} 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. These findings <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.|$|E

50|$|Patients with hyperuricosuria can {{be treated}} with {{allopurinol}} which will reduce urate formation. Urine alkalinization <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in this setting.|$|R
5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots {{is for them to}} block the ball with either their hands or arms. Longer arms can help the goalkeeper to reach the ball, thus being an advantage. Sports {{involving}} quick reactions <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful,</b> as these help the goalkeeper's reflexes which is a crucial skill.|$|E
5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> {{for treating}} vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, {{with a single}} dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems. A liver transplant <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.|$|E

5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|N-Acetylcysteine {{has shown}} promise in {{combination}} with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{treatment}} {{might include}} inpatient treatment, partial hospitalization, and drug therapy. Various types of therapy (including cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and family therapy) <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>helpful.</b> Meeting with a nutritionist <b>may</b> <b>be</b> recommended.|$|R

5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E

25|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{is similar to}} atrophic rhinitis, namely keeping the nasal mucosa moist with saline or oil-based lubricants and treating pain and infection as they arise; adding menthol to lubricants <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> in ENS, as may be use of a cool mist humidifer at home.

50|$|The CAPS1 was {{intended}} to monitor changes over a one-month period, whereas the CAPS-2 was developed to monitor changes over a week period. The CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 were later changed to the CAPS-DX and CAPS-SX respectively to avoid confusion over future versions. The CAPS-5 has two versions - one that can assess for one-week changes and one that can assess for one-month changes. The one-week changes <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>helpful</b> for treatment providers to see change in symptom scores over time, whereas the one-month changes <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>helpful</b> to assess for baseline PTSD.|$|R
