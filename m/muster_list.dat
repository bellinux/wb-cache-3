500|$|When the Alamo Cenotaph {{was created}} by Pompeo Coppini in 1939, the 187 defender names on the {{monument}} came from the research of Amelia Williams, considered the leading Alamo authority of her day. [...] Her work is still used {{by some as a}} benchmark, although skepticism has been voiced. Lindley's 2003 Alamo Traces: New Evidence and New Conclusions is the result of his 15-year study of the battle, and upended much of what was previously accepted as fact. He devoted a chapter to deconstructing Williams' research as [...] "misrepresentation, alteration, and fabrication of data", criticizing her sole reliance on the military land grants without checking through the muster lists to identify the combatants. In lieu of service pay, the cash-poor Republic of Texas adopted the system of military land grants. Issuance was dependent upon the military muster lists and either the veterans or their heirs filing a claim, a process that required an upfront fee to complete. Lacking a completed claim, proof of service would appear only on a <b>muster</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E

50|$|The first {{main unit}} was a {{regiment}} raised in England by Peterborough, probably from amongst former Parliamentarian troops which were being disbanded. This, the Tangier Regiment (later, the 2nd Regiment of Foot and, later still, the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)) was mustered on Putney Heath on 14 October 1661. As was usual, the regiment was officially {{referred to by}} its colonel's name; thus the Tangier Regiment will be found, variously, as Peterborough's, Rutherford's (or Teviot's), Fitzgerald's, Bellasis', Norwood's, Middleton's, Inchiquin's, Fairborne's, and Kirke's. After leaving Tangier, the Regiment became quite popularly (or unpopularly) known as Kirke's Lambs. The regiment, with augmentations and changes, served throughout the English occupation of Tangier, and certainly a few soldiers individually served almost the whole, if not the whole, of that time. Notable in the initial <b>muster</b> <b>list,</b> as a captain, is Palmes Fairborne, who himself became governor in 1680, after above 18 years of service there. He {{was killed by a}} shot from the Moors, dying in Tangier on 27 October 1680.|$|E
5000|$|Damacio Jiménez was Tejano {{soldier who}} served under Juan Seguín during the Battle of the Alamo, {{but was not}} {{recognized}} as such until 150 years afterwards. Records placing him among those who perished in the battle were found in 1986 among court files by Laredo, Texas attorney Raul Casso IV. In support of an 1861 military land grant claim by the heirs of Jiménez, Seguin provided sworn testimony verifying the soldier's place in his company, as did Cornelio Delgado who stated he had seen Jiménez's corpse after the battle. The cash-poor Republic of Texas adopted a system of military land grants in lieu of service pay. Issuance of the grants were dependent upon the military <b>muster</b> <b>lists</b> and either the veterans or their heirs filing a claim, a process that required an upfront fee to complete. For service at the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre, the heirs were eligible to file for the land grants. Researchers on the defenders of the Alamo sometimes relied on the military land grants, but did not always check through the <b>muster</b> <b>lists.</b> Although the claim was filed in 1861, it was never registered {{due to a lack}} of filing fee. Casso referred to Jiménez as [...] "the 189th Alamo defender". He was officially added to the list of Alamo defenders in 1987.|$|R

5000|$|Astley Castle was a Parliamentary stronghold {{during the}} English Civil War, {{one of a}} network of small, {{troublesome}} garrisons (to the Royalists) that infested this part of the English Midlands, drawing upon surrounding villages for their support.

5000|$|It was {{therefore}} essential that Stanley should trace {{the course of}} the Lualaba downstream (northward) from Nyangwe, the point where Livingstone had left it in July 1871. [...] Between November 1876 and August 1877, Stanley and his men navigated the Lualaba up to and beyond the point where it turned sharply westward, away from the Nile, identifying itself as the Congo River. [...] Having succeeded with this second objective, they then traced the river to the sea. During this expedition, Stanley used sectional boats and dug-out canoes to pass the large cataracts that separated the Congo into distinct tracts. These boats were transported around the rapids before being rebuilt to travel on the next section of river. In passing the rapids many of his men were drowned, including his last white colleague, Frank Pocock. [...] Stanley and his men reached the Portuguese outpost of Boma, around 100 km {{from the mouth of the}} Congo River on the Atlantic Ocean, after 999 days on 9 August 1877. <b>Muster</b> <b>lists</b> and Stanley's diary (12 November 1874) show that he started with 228 people and reached Boma with 114 survivors, with he being the only European left alive out of four.

40|$|At {{this point}} seamen {{have a lot}} of tasks of {{administrative}} character, beyond the traditional tasks aboard a ship. Due to the new conventions that are formed by IMO, more requirements are added which often lead to time consuming administrative tasks and documentation that should be spent on activities which are contributing to the ships safety. The issue has been observed by IMO that has through BIMCO done a study with the aim to identify and reduce administrative burdens at sea. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} find out if safety officers aboard Swedish ferries consider that SOLAS Chapter III, 8. 3 och 19. 5 regulations are administrative burdens, restricted to <b>muster</b> <b>lists</b> and documentation of training aboard the ship. The secondary questions to the study are if it is possible to remove, combine or change the documents and how much time can be saved by doing this. The question about timesaving could not be answered, because the values were scattered and could not be used for further investigation. The observed values were accumulated by a survey and the result indicated that safety officers did not experience the two regulations as administrative burdens. Due to this, the majority of the respondents did not have requests about changing or removing the requirements since all safety officers considered them to be important. Other duties that were experienced as administrative burdens were customs lists, handling of certificates and reporting to various authorities...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Obedience Robins emigrated to Virginia in the 1620 s in search of the land and status his elder brother gained by inheritance. This thesis establishes motivations for immigration and methods by which one English emigre achieved success in Virginia. The 1582 will of Richard Robins established a pattern of primogeniture for successive generations of his Northamptonshire family. <b>Muster</b> <b>lists,</b> wills, parish registers and a 1591 manor survey record increasing prosperity and associated expectations. Robinses were among those "better sorts" who paid taxes, provided armour, held local office, educated their children, and protested against perceived government injustice. In Virginia, Richard Robins's great grandson parlayed his assets into land, office and status. The extent of his education and financial resources was probably limited, but good health, tinidng, ability and hard work brought him respect, a seat on the governors council, and his children's marriages within a coalescing Eastern Shore gentry. Robins's career in America paralleled that of his brother in England. Both abandoned their father's yeoman designation to become gentlemen in their own and their peers' estimations. Obedience Robins combined public office with private enterprise and agriculture with trade for social and economic security. The commonwealth period did not disrupt Virginia's colonial hierarchy. Robins and his fellow justices, n-militia officers and burgesses retained their positions within a framework of transported English institutions...|$|R
