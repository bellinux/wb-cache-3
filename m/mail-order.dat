5000|$|The UPS Man:House infers {{frequently}} {{that his}} wife is {{having an affair with}} the UPS driver that services his house. He often cites made up [...] "evidence" [...] to this. The gag stemmed from a commentary on the amount of <b>mail-ordering</b> {{that his wife}} does.|$|R
40|$|While {{the advent}} and {{structure}} of electronic mail has been discussed in web caucuses, newspapers, hypertext theory, and communication theory, {{it has not yet}} been considered in conjunction with epistolary scenarios in film, art, and literature. To address this gap, <b>Mail-Orders</b> explores the status of the epistolary form {{at the end of the}} twentieth century and its connections to feminist criticism, literary theory, and post-modernism. One of the first works to consider electronic mail in relation to the history of epistolary fiction, <b>Mail-Orders</b> concerns itself with individual letters, as well as fiction written in letter form, and widens the debate on the often postulated death of letters 2 ̆ 2 by considering the epistolary connections between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries 2 ̆ 7 systems of communication and representation. 2 ̆ 2 [...] BOOK JACKE...|$|R
50|$|While in Mexico, Ray, {{using the}} alias Eric Starvo Galt, {{attempted}} to establish {{himself as a}} pornography director.

5|$|The ZX81's {{distribution}} {{arrangements were}} {{an essential part}} of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a <b>mail-order</b> retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through <b>mail-order</b> – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to do just that was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.|$|E
5|$|The race {{moved to}} the current stadium in 1943, and there it has stayed with the {{exceptions}} of 1986, 1987 and 1988 when the finish was in the avenue des Nations-Unies, outside the offices of La Redoute, the <b>mail-order</b> company which sponsored the race.|$|E

Sales of the CD continued at the Persona Music FES Concert at the Nippon Budokan on August 13, 2013. However limited quantities quickly sold out {{due to its}} popularity at both events. Due to high demand, the disc was later made available for <b>mail-order</b> purchase on Aniplex's Plus webstore.|$|E
50|$|Vendors sell cooked balut from {{buckets of}} sand (used to retain warmth) {{accompanied}} by small packets of salt. Uncooked balut are rarely sold in Southeast Asia. In the United States, Asian markets occasionally carry uncooked balut eggs. Alternatively, {{they can be}} <b>mail-ordered.</b> The cooking process is identical to that of hard-boiled chicken eggs, and baluts are eaten while still warm.|$|R
50|$|While the Gun Control Act {{prohibits the}} direct <b>mail-ordering</b> of firearms, {{a person may}} ship a gun via {{contract}} carrier (such as United Parcel Service-UPS, United States Postal Service or FedEx) to a gunsmith (who has an FFL) or the gunmaker's factory for repairs or modification. After the repair work is done, the gunsmith or the factory can ship the gun directly back to the customer.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} open the mall more rapidly, half of the mall was delayed in opening until the next year as a [...] "Phase II". Many new stores, {{including}} Sears, opened that year. It included a <b>mail-ordering</b> delivery destination for many of Myrtle Beach's residents when they ordered from the Sears catalog. Myrtle Beach's first attempt at an enclosed mall had been a success.|$|R

5|$|Robyn Miller {{composed}} Rivens music, {{which was}} later packaged and released by Virgin Records as Riven: The Soundtrack. Miller designed the liner notes and packaging, which included English translations {{of the language}} found in the game. Whereas the music to Myst was, at first, only available by <b>mail-order</b> from Cyan, Virgin Records had bought the rights to release it initially, prompting Miller {{to make sure that}} it could stand alone in CD form. The compact disc was released on February 24, 1998, with 54minutes of music.|$|E
5000|$|Destroy Terrastock - Live [...] (1998) is {{the only}} live album {{released}} on CD by Tadpoles.

5000|$|The Sears retail chain marketed {{vehicles}} {{made by the}} Lincoln Motor Car Works {{under the}} name [...] "Sears Motor Buggy" [...] between 1908 and 1912. These horseless carriages were of the [...] "high-wheeler" [...] variety with large wagon-type wheels. Their high ground clearance was well-suited to muddy, wagon-rutted country roads. Customers were accustomed to <b>mail-ordering</b> through the Sears catalog, and the Sears Motor Buggy could be delivered to the nearest railroad siding.|$|R
40|$|In {{an age of}} free {{international}} {{shipments of}} <b>mail-ordered</b> seeds and plants, more policing will not stop the global migration of hitchhiking pests. The solution is in a preemptive response based on an internationally coordinated genomic deployment of global biodiversity in the largest breeding project since the "Garden of Eden. " This plan will enrich the narrow genetic basis of annual and perennial plants with adaptations to changing environments and resistances to the pests of the future...|$|R
5|$|While {{living in}} Boston and {{pursuing}} his chosen major, English literature, Marcus began a lifelong hobby of collecting rare and antique books. To finance his pursuits, he began The Book Collector's Service Bureau, a <b>mail-order</b> book service, {{beginning with a}} letter of introduction sent to 100 homes. The venture proved so successful that for a time Marcus considered entering that line of work full time, concerned that entering the retail business might curtail his freedom of expression in politics and other areas of interest; his father persuaded {{him that he would}} always be granted the liberty of his own views, and pointed out that retailing was more profitable and thus would allow him to amass a large book collection that much sooner.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Eckard Wimmer's {{group at}} SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing {{poliovirus}} from its chemical code, producing the world's first synthetic virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as DNA {{was easier to}} synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence were obtained by <b>mail-order,</b> and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. This whole painstaking process took two years. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, {{so that it could}} be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. The newly minted synthetic virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th as lethal as the original virus.|$|E
25|$|A <b>mail-order</b> catalog is a {{publication}} containing {{a list of}} general merchandise from a company. Those who publish and operate <b>mail-order</b> catalogs {{are referred to as}} catalogers within the industry, who also buy or manufacture goods and then market those goods to prospective customers. Mail ordering uses the postal system for soliciting and delivering goods. According to The National Mail Order Association, Benjamin Franklin invented and conceptualized mail order cataloging in 1744.|$|E
5000|$|Smoke Ghost (1998) is {{the third}} {{full-length}} studio album released on CD by Tadpoles and is the first album with Tadpoles' new drummer, Adam Boyette. Upon original release, Bakery Records included a copy of Tadpoles Destroy Terrastock - Live with all <b>mail-orders.</b> The song [...] "Breaking" [...] is a re-recording of the original version which appeared on the group's 1992 cassette-only album, Superwhip. [...] "Know Your Ghosts" [...] {{is identical to the}} version which was released on the 1997 Know Your Ghosts E.P.|$|R
3000|$|The second {{category}} of mathematical models pursues the optimal product recovery strategy by improving acquisition, remanufacturing, and salvaging decisions [e.g., 28, 29, 30]. These contributions consider {{the quantity of}} product returns as a decision variable. Hence, these contributions are extremely useful to obtain the most from returns. However, particularly in <b>mail-ordering,</b> a major proportion of returns may be prevented or avoided before they actually occur, {{which would be the}} best option for many distance sellers. As Johnson [14] summarizes, “[t]he best return is no return.” [...]...|$|R
2500|$|The {{company did}} state its true {{location}} on its websites, but not [...] "clearly and conspicuously" [...] enough {{to offset the}} perception that they were British, the FTC later said. This deceit had impacts beyond invalidating any warranties. It meant that, contrary to what British buyers may have thought, their country's regulations on <b>mail-ordered</b> products {{did not apply to}} their purchases. Karnani and Balls of Kryptonite also claimed on their website that they had self-certified their compliance with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Program for protection of personal data, when in fact they had not.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{convictions}} under BWATA came in 1994 and 1995 and {{stemmed from}} a 1991 case in Minnesota. An American anti-government group headquartered in Minneapolis known as the Minnesota Patriot's Council <b>mail-ordered</b> castor beans and managed to extract about [...]7 grams of 5% ricin, despite having no specific expertise in biological warfare. The group planned to use the ricin to assassinate a deputy U.S. marshal and a local sheriff. In the end, {{four members of the}} Patriot's Council were convicted in the case under the BWATA law. It was reported that the amount of ricin was enough to kill about 100 people.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{microcomputers}} {{such as the}} Altair 8800 and Apple I were {{marketed to}} a niche of electronics hobbyists as most required assembly from a kit. In 1977, pre-assembled machines with BASIC in ROM became available, including the [...] "Trio of '77": the Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 Model I. The latter two retailed for under $1,000, but lacked game joysticks and high-resolution color video. Third-party developers created games {{for all of these}} platforms. The TRS-80 benefited from Radio Shack's retail stores, which displayed computers and accessories locally in an era where many personal computers were <b>mail-ordered</b> from manufacturers.|$|R
2500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the {{commercial}} centre of Stockholm was transplanted north of the old town that gradually started to transform into a slum district. [...] Västerlånggatan however escaped this fate, as it was connected to Drottninggatan by the bridge Riksbron in 1907, and the shops along the street were updated. [...] The medieval street façades were transformed in accordance to the taste of the day; plaster ornaments and cast iron colonettes <b>mail-ordered</b> from Germany replaced the medieval fronts, resulting in the present large shop windows usually displaying the well-preserved interiors from the later part of that century while concealing the often still intact medieval cores of the buildings.|$|R
50|$|Sidney Z. Jaffe, born March 28, 1912, founded Jafco in 1957 {{with his}} wife and family in Seattle. After opening Jafco's first {{location}} near South Lake Union, Jaffe expanded into the catalog business with <b>mail-ordering</b> and processing right at their facilities.
