Because hindgut fermentation starts only after and proceeds much slower than enzymatic digestion {{in the small}} intestine, fermentation products might, as nutrients, induce a prolonged physiological satiation of sows. To simulate hindgut fermentation and determine the fermentative release of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in vitro, gas production tests (GPTs) were performed with different raw materials after removal of enzymatically hydrolysable compounds. Fresh feces from sows that received standard sow feed was used as inoculum. Fresh, ensiled, or dehydrated by-products of the food industry (brewers¿ grains, liquid yeast feed, <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> <b>feed,</b> raw potato chips, potato steam peel, pressed potato pulp, sugar beet pulp (SBP)) and whole-plant products (grass, maize) were tested as individual products. Balances were drawn up of the in vitro flow of organic carbon (OC) to an ¿ileal¿ nutrient fraction, a ¿hindgut¿ fraction of SCFA and gas, and ¿fecal¿ remnants. The OC balances revealed large variations among raw materials {{in terms of their}} contribution to the different fractions. Potato steam peel gave the largest ¿ileal¿ nutrient fraction (77 % of total OC), the lowest was observed with fresh sugar beet pulp (9 % of total OC). In the GPT, SBP, and potato pulp brought about the highest ¿hindgut¿ SCFA yields (32 ¿ 49 % of total OC), and together with raw potato chips, the highest amounts of gas. Grass products and liquid yeast feed were slower fermented than most by-products. Moreover, whole-plant materials gave larger ¿fecal¿ OC portions than by-products, with the exception of fresh and dehydrated brewer¿s grains.

Each laboratory measured GPP over 144 h using standardised procedures with manual pressure transducers (MPT) and automated pressure systems (APS). The APS at ADAS used a pressure transducer and bottles in a shaking water bath, while the APS at Wageningen and IGER used a pressure sensor and bottles held in a stationary rack. Apparent dry matter degradability (ADDM) was estimated {{at the end of the}} incubation. GPP were fitted to a modified Michaelis-Menten model assuming a single phase of gas production, and GPP were described in terms of the asymptotic volume of gas produced (A), the time to half A (B), the time of maximum gas production rate (t(RM) (gas)) and maximum gas production rate (R-M (gas)). There were effects (P< 0. 001) of substrate on all parameters. However, MPT produced more (P< 0. 001) gas, but with longer (P< 0. 001) B and t(RM gas) (P< 0. 05) and lower (P< 0. 001) R-M gas compared to APS. There was no difference between apparatus in ADDM estimates. Interactions occurred between substrate and apparatus, substrate and laboratory, and laboratory and apparatus. However, when mean values for MPT were regressed from the individual laboratories, relationships were good (i. e., adjusted R- 2 = 0. 827 or higher). Good relationships were also observed with APS, although they were weaker than for MPT (i. e., adjusted R- 2 = 0. 723 or higher). The relationships between mean MPT and mean APS data were also good (i. e., adjusted R 2 = 0. 844 or higher). Data suggest that, although laboratory and method of measuring pressure are sources of variation in GPP estimation, it should be possible using appropriate mathematical models to standardise data among laboratories so that data from one laboratory could be extrapolated to others. This would allow development of a database of GPP data from many diverse feeds. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E

The trial used 360 steer calves (initial BW = 288 ± 11 kg) housed in 36 pens for 166 d in an incomplete 4 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Pens of steers were assigned to treatments according to a completely randomized design (four replicates per treatment combination).

40|$|Studied {{the effect}} of {{different}} levels of <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> meal (60 %) on the growth performance of broiler at Sindh Agriculture University Tandojam during October-November, 1999. 300 chicks were divided in six groups, Group A (control), while Groups B, C, D, E and F were given 3 %, 6 %, 9 %, 12 % and 15 % <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> meal respectively. It was observed that highest <b>maize</b> <b>gluten</b> meal MGM levels of 12 % (E) and 15 % (F) did not show positive effect {{on any of the}} quantitative and qualitative characters and group D (9 % MGM) was considered as an optimum MGM level for obtaining economical and profitable results. Group D (9 % MGM) consumed relatively less quantity of feed (4246. 51 g) per bird and produced significantly higher weight gain (2063. 50) g, feed conversion ratio (2. 05), dressing percentage (68. 95), liver weight (51. 39) g, gizzard weight (31. 27) g and heart weight (10. 81) g. No mortality was recorded in group D` and hence was most economical by offering Rs. 26. 34 /bird net profit as compared to Rs. 23. 33, 22. 99, 22. 36, 12. 49 and 11. 03 /bird net profit in groups F, E, C, B and A, respectively.

40|$|A steer {{finishing}} {{trial was}} conducted to evaluate level and source of dietary fiber on nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter excretion. One-hundred twenty steers were fed {{one of the following}} treatments: wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> (41. 5 % of diet DM), 7. 5 % roughage diet, and all concentrate diet. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter intake of steers fed wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> were greater than the other two treatments. Fecal nitrogen output was greatest with the wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> diet. All treatments lost about 50 % of excreted nitrogen through volatilization. The all concentrate treatment had the highest percentage of phosphorus and organic matter in runoff compared to the other two treatments. All treatments had 65 to 78 % of excreted phosphorus and 35 to 55 % of excreted organic matter incorporated into the top three inches of the soil.

40|$|Four ruminally {{cannulated}} and two intact multiparous Holstein cows {{were used}} in a 3 × 3 replicated Latin square design to evaluate digestibility and rumen traits in lactating dairy cows in response to <b>feeding</b> wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and a novel product containing raw soybean hulls and corn steep liquor. Three dietary treatments were fed in the experiment. The control contained (DM basis) 30 % alfalfa hay, 15 % corn silage, 32 % corn, 9. 3 % whole cottonseed, 4. 4 % solvent soybean meal (SBM), 3. 3 % expeller SBM, 1. 3 % fish meal, 1 % wet molasses, and 3. 7 % vitamins/ minerals. Wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> replaced 10 % alfalfa hay, 5 % corn silage, 5 % corn grain, and expeller SBM replaced solvent SBM to maintain diet rumen undegradable protein. The novel product replaced 10 % alfalfa hay, 5 % corn silage, 3 % solvent SBM, and 2 % corn. Diets were analyzed to have dietary crude protein percentage and energy density values (Mcal/lb, NEL) of 18. 7, 0. 75; 18. 7, 0. 77; 18. 7, 0. 74; for control, wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed,</b> and the novel product, respectively. Experimental periods were 14 days (10 days adaptation and 4 days collection). Acid insoluble ash was used to estimate fecal output. Dry matter intake averaged 37. 9 lb/day and total tract digestibilities of dry matter (DM), organic matter, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and crude protein did not differ among diets: 71. 7 %, 73. 2 %, 63. 1 %, 58. 5 % and 73. 0 %, respectively. Diets affected liquid dilution rate, ruminal pH, and ruminal concentrations of total volatile fatty acids and ammonia similarly. The molar ratio of acetate to propionate was greater (P< 0. 05) for control (3. 38) than for wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> (2. 79) and the novel product (2. 89). Inclusion of wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and the novel product at 20 % of dietary DM as a partial replacement for alfalfa hay, corn silage, corn grain, and SBM in diets fed to lactating dairy cattle supported lactational performance similar to the control diet. Additionally, combining wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> or the novel product with corn silage and alfalfa hay maintained milk fat yields and ruminal pH, thereby demonstrating that wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and the novel product can serve as an effective source of fiber when fed at 20 % of dietary DM. These results indicate that wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and the novel product tested can serve as alternative feedstuffs in lactating dairy cattle diets...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and a novel product containing raw soybean hulls and corn steep liquor on performance in lactating dairy cows. Forty-six multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized incomplete block design. Cows were housed in tie stalls for the first 13 weeks of lactation and moved to group pens {{for the remainder of}} the study. Cows were blocked by calving date and assigned to control, wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> (20 % of diet DM), or the novel product (20 % of diet DM). Diets were administered as total mixed rations at the first feeding postpartum. Control contained (DM basis) 30 % alfalfa hay, 15 % corn silage, 32 % corn, 9. 3 % whole cottonseed, 4. 4 % solvent soybean meal (SBM), 3. 3 % expeller SBM, 1. 3 % fish meal, 1 % wet molasses, and 3. 7 % vitamins/minerals. Wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> replaced 10 % alfalfa hay, 5 % corn silage, 5 % corn grain, and expeller SBM replaced solvent SBM to maintain diet rumen undegradable protein. The novel product replaced 10 % alfalfa hay, 5 % corn silage, 3 % solvent SBM, and 2 % corn. Diet crude protein % and energy density (Mcal/lb, NEL) for control, wet corn gluen feed, and the novel product were 18. 4, 0. 73; 18. 2, 0. 75; 18. 5, 0. 73; respectively. Milk, energy corrected milk, dry matter intake, and production efficiency (ratio of milk to DM intake) did not differ among diets during the first 91 days of lactation, but there was a diet by week interaction for production efficiency. Cows fed control were more efficient during the first 2 weeks postpartum than cows fed wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and the novel product, likely due to increased fat mobilization from adipose tissue because intake as a percent of body weight was less for cows fed control. During weeks 3 through 14 postpartum, wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and the novel product improved milk, energy corrected milk, and milk component yield, and production efficiency. Inclusion of wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and the novel product at 20 % of dietary DM as a partial replacement for alfalfa hay, corn silage, corn grain, and SBM in diets fed to lactating dairy cattle supported performance during early lactation and improved performance during mid and late lactation. In addition, combining wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> or the novel product with corn silage and alfalfa hay maintained milk fat yields, thereby demonstrating that they can serve as effective sources of fiber when fed at 20 % of dietary DM. Improved performance attributed to wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and the novel product is due to factors other than improved digestibility of the diets. These results indicate that wet corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> and the novel product can serve as alternative feedstuffs in diets fed to lactating dairy cattle...|$|R
40|$|Using {{agricultural}} feedstocks {{for industrial}} products affects {{domestic and international}} agricultural markets, {{all of which are}} encumbered with complex policies. This article examines the interaction of three seemingly unrelated policies: the Clean Air Act, the U. S. corn program, and European Union agricultural subsidies. More ethanol production, resulting from new regulations associated with the Clean Air Act, increases the use of U. S. corn and increases the supply of corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed,</b> an ethanol co-product. Corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> is primarily exported to Europe under a loophole in European Union trade barriers. But recent reform of European Union farm policy will lower the price of the European grain for which corn <b>gluten</b> <b>feed</b> is a substitute. This development lowers prices for a major ethanol co-product and thus makes ethanol itself less profitable just as the demand for the fuel is expanding.
