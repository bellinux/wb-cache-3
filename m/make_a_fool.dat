25|$|David is {{a failed}} comedian and rocker who also fails {{to grasp the}} notion of {{political}} correctness. He tends to either <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of {{himself in front of}} the office crew or make it intensely uncomfortable. The one who seems to enjoy him the most is Sam Bisaillon, former army cadet who worships David. He shares his desk with Louis Tremblay, who is secretly in love with the shy receptionist Anne Viens. The problem is that Anne is engaged to Luc, a macho warehouse employee.|$|E
25|$|The War Committee {{had only}} agreed (28 December 1915) with some {{reluctance}} to make {{preparations for the}} Western Front Offensive agreed at Chantilly, which Haig and Joffre agreed (14 February) {{should be on the}} Somme, although Robertson and the War Committee were not pleased at Joffre’s suggestion that the British engage in “wearing out” attacks prior to the main offensive. For three months, against a backdrop of Russia planning to attack earlier than agreed, Italy reluctant to attack at all and the scaling-down of the planned French commitment because of Battle of Verdun, Robertson continued to urge the politicians to agree to the offensive. He increasingly believed that France was becoming exhausted and that Britain would carry an ever greater burden. After Robertson promised that Haig “would not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of himself” (he told Repington that Haig was “a shrewd Scot who would not do anything rash”), the War Committee finally agreed (7 April).|$|E

In a comparison between the ZX81 and IBM PC published in Which Micro?, he commended the ZX81's user-friendliness and its on-the-fly syntax checking of BASIC programs, which he described as [...] "the feature that I, as a newcomer to computing, want to see incorporated into every micro." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1953, Waugh's {{popularity}} as {{a writer}} was declining. He was perceived as {{out of step with}} the Zeitgeist, and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available. His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, Officers and Gentlemen, had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating. Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: [...] "they tried to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford. Peter Fleming in The Spectator likened the interview to [...] "the goading of a bull by matadors".|$|E
500|$|A {{shortage}} of cash {{was the principal}} reason why, in 1953, Waugh agreed to be interviewed on radio by the BBC, first in the Overseas Service's Personal Call programme {{and then in the}} Frankly Speaking series. The second of these was broadcast on the BBC Home Service on 16 November 1953. Most of Waugh's friends thought that he had acquitted himself well, and he was mildly pleased with the result, writing to Nancy Mitford that [...] "they tried to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of me and I don't think they entirely succeeded". Nevertheless, the broadcasts preyed on Waugh's mind; he saw hostility in the attitudes of his interlocutors, a point noted by his 13-year-old son Auberon Waugh, who later wrote that the interviews [...] "drove my father mad". His friend, the poet John Betjeman, gave him William Burges's Narcissus washstand but Waugh became convinced that an ornamental tap was missing from the washstand, and was shaken when Betjeman denied the tap had ever existed.|$|E

500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E

Of his second marriage, Denver would later recall that [...] "before our short-lived marriage ended in divorce, she managed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> of me {{from one end of}} the valley to the other".|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Paul McCartney {{said that}} the Freddie and the Dreamers version of [...] "If You Gotta <b>Make</b> <b>A</b> <b>Fool</b> of Somebody" [...] was copied from an {{arrangement}} performed by the Beatles at a show in the Cavern. The Dreamers released their copied version of the song as a single, leaving the Beatles uncredited. Because of this incident, the Beatles decided to concentrate on their own compositions, rather than cover versions. The Beatles later forgave the Dreamers, and invited them to do a guest appearance in their 1964 Christmas Special.|$|E

2500|$|Comedian Freek de Jonge {{performed}} an 'election show' ('verkiezingsconference') {{on public television}} {{on the night before}} the elections. It was called [...] "De Stemming 2006" [...] (an ambiguous name which means both [...] "The Vote 2006" [...] and [...] "The Mood 2006") [...] In his ironic comedy show, which was totally focused on the elections, he ridiculed the candidates, making such a show a uniquely Dutch phenomenon. When asked whether this show would influence the upcoming elections de Jonge stated he would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> out of everyone, not favoring a single person. This was the second time he did such a show. The first one was in 2003, when it was the thirty-third best watched TV-programme in the Netherlands that year.
