5|$|There {{are several}} local nature {{reserves}} {{in and around}} Taunton, which are protected under a statutory designation in Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. South Taunton Streams is an urban wetland, and in the northern suburbs is the Children's Wood riverside reserve which provides a movement corridor for animals including otters {{along the banks of}} the River Tone. Birds occurring at the site include: kingfisher, dipper, grey wagtail, mute swan, grey heron and reed warbler. It is also home to butterflies such as the small and large skipper, <b>marbled</b> <b>white,</b> small heath and small copper, and to dragonflies and damselflies.|$|E

50|$|This {{site has}} a {{wildlife}} garden, woodland, meadows and lakes. Over 350 species of flowering {{plants have been}} recorded, and 30 butterflies including white admirals, green hairstreaks, <b>marbled</b> <b>whites</b> and grizzled skippers.|$|R
50|$|The {{common is}} {{woodland}} and scrub, together with two fields which are chalk grassland. In 2014 23 species of butterfly were recorded, including <b>marbled</b> <b>whites.</b> There are over 100 species of wild flowers, and herbs such as marjoram and basil.|$|R
5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including <b>marbled</b> <b>white</b> (Melanargia galathea), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of the art of the Chinese empire, jade has had a special significance, {{comparable}} with that of gold and diamonds in the West. Jade was used for the finest objects and cult figures, and for grave furnishings for high-ranking members of the imperial family. Due to that significance and the rising middle class in China, today the finest jade when found in nuggets of “mutton fat” jade – so-named for its <b>marbled</b> <b>white</b> consistency – can sell for $3,000 an ounce, a tenfold increase from a decade ago.|$|E

50|$|The {{site has}} marshy areas and fens {{next to the}} river, damp {{grassland}} and drier, more acidic areas. The river bank has water voles, and damp areas are dominated by meadow foxtail and Yorkshire fog, with some marsh marigold and marsh bedstraw. Plants in drier areas include betony, and mature hedgerows have {{a wide variety of}} invertebrates. There are butterflies such as skippers, meadow browns, ringlets and <b>marbled</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{extensive}} landscaped {{gardens are}} popular with visitors throughout the year. The most visited areas include {{the rose garden}} and the dahlia garden, which contain many dozens of varieties. Out of season the spring garden and winter dell are famed nationally, particularly in February when the snowdrops first appear.The lawns of the South Park are mown less frequently and this allows the many wildflowers to flower and set seed. Over 50 species of wildflower have been recorded, including bee orchid, twayblade, pyramidal orchid and common spotted orchid. In mid-summer, there are large numbers of butterflies such as meadow brown, gatekeeper, small skippers and <b>marbled</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|R
500|$|Scarce plants {{found at}} the warren include knotted {{pearlwort}} (Sagina nodosa), and slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum).

5000|$|Petiver {{visited the}} Netherlands in 1711 {{to study with}} Dutch entomologists. He {{recorded}} many English folk-names for butterflies, also coining some himself, and wrote {{some of the first}} butterfly books that used English names in addition to Latin. He himself was not very proficient in Latin although {{he was a member of}} several scholarly societies and an educated gentleman. He named the white admiral butterfly, and gave the name fritillary to another group of butterflies after the Latin word for a chequered dice box. He called skippers [...] "hogs", swallowtails [...] "Royal Williams", walls as [...] "Enfield Eyes" [...] and <b>marbled</b> <b>whites</b> as [...] "Half-Mourners".|$|R
25|$|Aussie {{colors are}} black, red (sometimes called 'liver'), blue merle (<b>marbled</b> black, <b>white,</b> and gray), and red merle (<b>marbled</b> red, <b>white,</b> and buff); {{each of these}} colors may also have copper (tan) points or white {{markings}} in various combinations on the face, chest, and legs. A black or red dog with copper and white trim is called 'tricolor' or 'tri', a black or red dog with white trim but no copper is called 'bicolor' or 'bi'. White, rather than pigment, on or around the ears is an indicator of increased risk for white-related deafness. Excessive white on the face and ears can place an individual dog {{at greater risk for}} sunburn and subsequent skin cancer.|$|R

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a normal gastric body, but <b>white</b> <b>marbled</b> {{appearance in the}} lesser curvature of the gastric angle and antrum.

After triple therapy (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and rabeprazole), endoscopy showed an improvement of the <b>white</b> <b>marbled</b> lesions and biopsy specimens showed no NHPH. The <b>white</b> <b>marbled</b> appearance limited to the gastric angle and antrum may be a potential characteristic finding of NHPH-infected gastritis...|$|R
