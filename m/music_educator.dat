25|$|Edward Bridges {{was hired}} as the band's new {{director}} in 1975. Bridges came from an assistant directorship of the band at the University of Georgia (of which {{he was also an}} alumnus) and was also retired from the Air Force. Bridges' style of leadership differed greatly from Sisk's and created immediate tensions between him and the band's student leadership, which had traditionally been in charge of the band's day-to-day operations. Some former band members have posited that this was intentional, that the Institute administration was looking to take back control of the band from the students. It is unclear whether Bridges' selection as director was done with or without the input of the band's leadership at the time; however, Bridges abolished the student leadership structure upon taking the position. The positions of band officers remained, but in a significantly diminished capacity. Eventually, the clash between Bridges' leadership style and the band's culture resulted in Bridges' departure. He was replaced by Ken Durham, who had been hired as assistant band director in 1976. Durham had been a <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> in Atlanta for many years and had directed the band at Headland High School in the 1960s. He served as the band's director until 1983 when he accepted a promotion at his job at Ameriprise.|$|E
500|$|Several {{commentators}} have rated Kelly the best accompanist in jazz, including critic Ray Comiskey and <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> Mark Levine. Drummer Philly Joe Jones said that, as an accompanist, Kelly [...] "puts down flowers behind a soloist. He {{never wanted to}} steal in. He just put together the right things." [...] Pianist Bruce Barth pointed out that part of Kelly's success as an accompanist came from [...] "occasional and compelling use of 'blues licks' and melodic phrases in place of chords." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{conventional}} musical practices {{sounds that}} are considered unmusical tend {{to be treated as}} noise. Oscillations and Waves defines noise as irregular vibrations of an object, in contrast to the periodical, patterned structure of music. More broadly, electrical engineering professor Bart Kosko in the introductory chapter of his book Noise defines noise as a [...] "signal we don't like." [...] Paul Hegarty, a lecturer and noise musician, likewise assigns a subjective value to noise, writing that [...] "noise is a judgment, a social one, based on unacceptability, the breaking of norms and a fear of violence." [...] Composer and <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> R. Murray Schafer divided noise into four categories: Unwanted noise, unmusical sound, any loud system, and a disturbance in any signaling system.|$|E

500|$|Smith's first {{textbook}} series, The Modem Music Series, in six volumes {{was published}} in 1898 by Scott, Foresman and Company, with rights later purchased by the Silver Burdette Company. It was a collaboration with Robert Foresman, another <b>music</b> <b>educator</b> who believed that children {{should be allowed to}} learn intuitively. [...] It set forth a new movement in music instruction which rejected the traditional sight singing memorization method of training and instead relied on the [...] "song method". In this type of instruction, students learned the skills for reading music from a combination of interval recognition, ear training and observation of songs. The books were successful, using many of Smith's own songs and became the basis for similar textbooks based on her ideas and works, such as the publication in 1909 by Charles H. Congdon called the Congdon Music Readers series, which incorporated 21 songs by Smith. Smith published a second textbook series, The Eleanor Smith Music Series, in 1908, which also contained six volumes and was widely distributed in US public schools.|$|E
