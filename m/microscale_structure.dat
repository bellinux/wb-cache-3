A common feature among the problems studied here {{is the presence of}} non-negligible <b>microscale</b> <b>structure</b> in various forms. Each problem is approached from the perspective that a macroscopic observable encodes aspects of the structure on the smaller scales. In some cases, the presence of microscopic structure transforms the macroscopic dynamics in a non-trivial fashion that would be virtually unpredictable without proper upscaling. The different types of <b>microscale</b> <b>structure</b> studied here include stationary morphological information (as would be encountered in porous materials), segregation of mass (as would be seen in a poorly mixed system), molecular-scale structural heterogeneities (i. e. surface roughness), and evolving morphologies (in biofilm growth in porous media).

Periodic <b>microscale</b> <b>structures</b> on the surface of Ti substrates were fabricated via direct laser interference patterning (DLIP). Radio-frequency magnetron sputter deposition of ultrathin nanostructured hydroxyapatite (HA) films was used to form an additional nanoscale grain morphology on the microscale-structured Ti surfaces to generate multiscale surface structures. The surface characteristics were evaluated using atomic force microscopy and contact angle and surface free energy measurements.

The lidar derived water vapor images showed <b>microscale</b> convective <b>structures</b> with a resolution of 1. 5 m, and mapped fluxes with 75 m spatial resolution. Comparisons of water vapor means over cottonwoods and adjacent grasses show similar values over both surfaces, but the spatial variability over the cottonwoods was substantially higher than over the grasses.

40|$|The {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} growth and transport dynamics within biological tissue is made particularly challenging by the complex and multiscale nature of this medium. For this reason so-called effective descriptions are frequently sought. These offer coarse-scale models that still accommodate aspects of microscale dynamics.

As a model system for investigating relevant phenomena, in this chapter we consider nutrient-limited growth of a porous medium (with broad application to vascularized tumor growth). Using asymptotic homogenization we derive the macroscale equations that describe a ‘double porous medium’ whose flow is influenced by both the tissue microstructure and growth that occurs in response to nutrient transport governed by an advection–reaction equation.

The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of turbulent eddy length scale on blood cell damage, and in particular {{to test the hypothesis}} that only eddies similar in size to blood cells can cause damage. The microscale flow near a red blood cell (RBC) in an idealized turbulent eddy is modelled computationally using an immersed boundary method. The model is validated for the special case of a tank-treading RBC. In comparisons between turbulent flow fields, based on Kolmogorov theory, the model predicts that damage due to the smallest eddies is almost independent of the Kolmogorov length scale. The model predicts that within a given flow field, however, eddies of sub-cellular scale are less damaging than larger eddies. Eddy decay time and the turbulent energy spectral density are highlighted as important factors. The results suggest that Kolmogorov scale is not an adequate predictor of flow-induced blood trauma, and highlights the need for deeper understanding of the <b>microscale</b> <b>structure</b> of turbulent blood flow...|$|E

40|$|Ice {{crystals}} {{in clouds}} {{exist in a}} virtually limitless variation of geometries. The most basic shapes of ice crystals are columnar or plate-like hexagonal prisms with aspect ratios determined by relative humidity and temperature. However, crystals in ice clouds generally display more complex structures owing to aggregation, riming and growth histories through varying temperature and humidity regimes. Crystal shape is relevant for cloud evolution as it affects microphysical properties such as fall speeds and aggregation efficiency. Furthermore, the scattering properties of ice crystals are affected by their general shape, {{as well as by}} microscopic features such as surface roughness, impurities and internal structure. To improve the representation of ice clouds in climate models, increased understanding of the global variation of crystal shape and how it relates to, e. g., location, cloud temperature and atmospheric state is crucial. Here, the remote sensing of ice crystal macroscale and <b>microscale</b> <b>structure</b> from airborne and space-based lidar depolarization observations and multi-directional measurements of total and polarized reflectances is reviewed. In addition, a brief overview is given of in situ and laboratory observations of ice crystal shape as well as the optical properties of ice crystals that serve as foundations for the remote sensing approaches. Lidar depolarization is generally found to increase with increasing cloud height and to vary with latitude. Although this variation is generally linked to the variation of ice crystal shape, the interpretation of the depolarization remains largely qualitative and more research is needed before quantitative conclusions about ice shape can be deduced. The angular variation of total and polarized reflectances of ice clouds has been analyzed by numerous studies in order to infer information about ice crystal shapes from them. From these studies it is apparent that pristine crystals with smooth surfaces are generally inconsistent with the data and thus crystal impurity, distortion or surface roughness is prevalent. However, conclusions about the dominating ice shapes are often inconclusive and contradictory and are highly dependent on the limited selection of shapes included in the investigations. Since ice crystal optical properties are mostly determined by the aspect ratios of the crystal components and their <b>microscale</b> <b>structure,</b> it is advised that remote sensing applications focus on the variation of these ice shape characteristics, rather than on the macroscale shape or habit. Recent studies use databases with nearly continuous ranges of crystal component aspect ratio and-or roughness levels to infer the variation of ice crystal shape from satellite and airborne remote sensing measurements. Here, the rationale and results of varying strategies for the remote sensing of ice crystal shape are reviewed. Observed systematic variations of ice crystal geometry with location, cloud height and atmospheric state suggested by the data are discussed. Finally, a prospective is given {{on the future of the}} remote sensing of ice cloud particle shapes...|$|E

Moreover, because nanostructures include significantly fewer charge carriers than <b>microscale</b> <b>structures,</b> electronic noise in nanostructures is enhanced compared to <b>microscale</b> <b>structures.</b> Additionally, in microprocessors, due to the small gate capacitance and reduced noise margin (due to reduced supply voltage to keep the electrical field at a reasonable level), the electronic noise results in bit errors. On the other hand, the enhanced noise is useful for advanced sensing applications which are called fluctuation-enhanced sensing. In this dissertation, we first survey our earlier results about the limitation of noise posed on specific nano processors. Here, single electron logic is considered for voltage controlled logic with thermal excitations and generic shot noise is considered for current-controlled logic. Secondly, we discuss our recent results on the electronic noise in nanoscale sensors for SEnsing of Phage-Triggered Ion Cascade (SEPTIC, for instant bacterial detection) and for silicon nanowires for viral sensing. In the sensing of the phage-triggered ion cascade sensor, bacteriophage-infected bacteria release potassium ions and move randomly at the same time; therefore, electronic noise (i. e., stochastic signals) are generated. As an advanced model, the electrophoretic effect in the SEPTIC sensor is discussed. In the viral sensor, since {{the combination of the}} analyte and a specific receptor located at the surface of the silicon nanowire occurs randomly in space and time, a stochastic signal is obtained.
