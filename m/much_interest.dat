5|$|There is <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> in the {{coordination}} chemistry of neptunium, because its five oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior, and {{the coordination}} chemistry of the actinides is {{heavily influenced by}} the actinide contraction (the greater-than-expected decrease in ionic radii across the actinide series, analogous to the lanthanide contraction).|$|E
5|$|After graduating high school, Diekman {{enrolled}} at Doane College, where he pitched for one season. He {{then transferred to}} Cloud County Community College in Kansas. Following his sophomore season, he attended a junior college baseball showcase at which, with a fastball well over , he drew <b>much</b> <b>interest.</b> He received an offer for a full scholarship to be a Nebraska Cornhusker, which he would have accepted had the Phillies not drafted him in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft's 30th round.|$|E

In 1924 the company launched the Unique lighter, a product that Dunhill and his brother Herbert had <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> in developing, and was the world's first lighter that could be operated with just one hand.|$|E

He does so with so <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> that he makes major life decisions by subconsciously taking on the behaviours of characters from these films.|$|E
5|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{had been studying}} this problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, there was <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role. In a conventional jet engine, thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle. In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during high-power portions of flight—take-off and high-speed dashes.|$|E
5|$|Attorney Hy Mayerson was {{an early}} pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with {{environmental}} attorney Victor Yannacone in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, {{one of the first}} civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor. The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> as the Triangle.|$|E
5|$|National {{competitions}} generally {{last one}} week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed {{the greatest number}} of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time. Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, telemetry giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.|$|E
5|$|The Southern removed {{everything}} they could use elsewhere, and by 8 November, had lifted the track from Lynton to milepost 15⅓ - on the Barnstaple side of Woody Bay station. On 13 November an auction was held, although the railway failed to attract <b>much</b> <b>interest.</b> Most rolling stock, and every loco except for Lew, was scrapped at Pilton. Some coaches were sectioned for use as garden sheds. Third class seats became garden furniture, and first class seats {{found their way into}} local snooker halls and Masonic lodges. In December, Plymouth ship breaker Sidney Castle won the tender to dismantle the railway. The remaining track was lifted by June 1936, and in September, surviving loco Lew was shipped to Brazil. The stations and track bed were auctioned in 1938.|$|E

5|$|The Tower of London {{has become}} {{established}} {{as one of}} the most popular tourist attractions in the country. It has been a tourist attraction since at least the Elizabethan period, when it w{{as one of the}} sights of London that foreign visitors wrote about. Its most popular attractions were the Royal Menagerie and displays of armour. The Crown Jewels also garner <b>much</b> <b>interest,</b> and have been on public display since 1669. The Tower steadily gained popularity with tourists through the 19thcentury, despite the opposition of the Duke of Wellington to visitors. Numbers became so high that by 1851 a purpose-built ticket office was erected. By the end of the century, over 500,000 were visiting the castle every year.|$|E
5|$|The {{band members}} {{subsequently}} focused on solo projects, and Ray and Dave released their own studio albums. Talk of a Kinks reunion circulated (including an aborted studio reunion {{of the original}} band members in 1999), but neither Ray nor Dave Davies showed <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> in playing together again. Meanwhile, former members John Gosling, John Dalton and Mick Avory had regrouped in 1994 and started performing on the oldies circuit along with guitar-player/singer Dave Clarke as the Kast Off Kinks. Gosling and Dalton retired in 2008 and were replaced in the band by former Kinks members Jim Rodford and Ian Gibbons. Ray Davies, Pete Quaife and Bob Henrit have occasionally made guest appearances with the group at Kinks fan club conventions.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} September 11 added {{new meaning to}} In Search of America, the project Jennings and Brewster started after {{the success of their}} {{previous}} collaboration. The two began writing the book in early 2001; after the terrorist attacks, they revisited many of the people they had interviewed to see how the events had affected them. To promote the book, the anchor and World News Tonight started a 50-state tour of the United States in April 2002 as part of a yearlong project, 50 States/One Nation/One Year. Jennings also anchored a six-part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book. Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book's publisher, In Search of America failed to generate <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> or sales.|$|E

5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting point between 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting point between 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)). Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> to the hungry people sifting through {{the tens of thousands of}} tons of rubble and debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to the workmen clearing away the rubble later during the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|Upon their arrival, {{many were}} in disbelief that the Rockets could thrive in Houston. They {{were coming to}} a city {{that did not have}} a {{suitable}} arena, and had not shown <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> in professional basketball. Houston was previously home to the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association for only two seasons between 1967 and 1969, where the average attendance was only 200. The city's largest indoor arena was 34-year-old Sam Houston Coliseum, but the Rockets quickly ruled out playing there even on a temporary basis. As the team owners planned out on building a proper arena, the Rockets were forced to play most of their games at the University of Houston's Hofheinz Pavilion, while playing occasional games at the Astrodome and San Antonio's HemisFair Arena.|$|E
5|$|Verdi had {{a younger}} sister, Giuseppa, who died aged 17 in 1833. From {{the age of}} four, Verdi was given private lessons in Latin and Italian by the village schoolmaster, Baistrocchi, and at six he {{attended}} the local school. After learning to play the organ, he showed so <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> in music that his parents finally provided him with a spinet. Verdi's gift for music was already apparent by 1820–21 when he began his association with the local church, serving in the choir, acting as an altar boy for a while, and taking organ lessons. After Baistrocchi's death, Verdi, {{at the age of}} eight, became the official paid organist.|$|E

5|$|While {{studying}} naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist Henri Becquerel {{discovered that}} they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These radioactive materials {{became the subject of}} <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles alpha and beta, {{on the basis of their}} ability to penetrate matter. In 1900, Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays. This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{disagree}} about who initiated {{the idea of}} organizing a national assembly. Some credit Jonas Basanavičius, while others argue for Jonas Kriaučiūnas. The organizational activities were largely taken on by the Lithuanian Christian Democrats and by Vilniaus žinios, a moderate newspaper owned by Petras Vileišis. Vilniaus žinios was the first legal Lithuanian-language daily newspaper to appear after the Lithuanian press ban was lifted on May 7, 1904; it was quite popular and its circulation soon reached 6,000 copies. On October 31 (October 18 O.S.), 1905 a fifteen-member organizational committee, chairman Jonas Basanavičius and secretary Jonas Kriaučiūnas, was given the task of convening the assembly. They published an appeal or a manifest to the Lithuanian people on November 11 (October 29 O.S.) in Vilniaus žinios. The appeal, signed by the chairman and the secretary, aroused <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> in the public. Invitations were extended to all persons who would be elected as representatives by their communities at volosts, and to all other educated people interested {{in the future of}} the Lithuanian state. At the end of the appeal there was an eight-point agenda to be discussed at the Seimas. It did not include the question of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1529, Cranmer stayed with {{relatives}} in Waltham Holy Cross to avoid an outbreak of the plague in Cambridge. Two of his Cambridge associates, Stephen Gardiner and Edward Foxe, joined him. The three discussed the annulment issue and Cranmer suggested putting aside the legal case in Rome in favour of a general canvassing of opinions from university theologians throughout Europe. Henry showed <b>much</b> <b>interest</b> in the idea when Gardiner and Foxe presented him this plan. It is not known whether the king or his new Lord Chancellor, Thomas More, explicitly approved the plan. Eventually it was implemented and Cranmer was requested to join the royal team in Rome to gather opinions from the universities. Edward Foxe coordinated the research effort and the team produced the Collectanea Satis Copiosa ("The Sufficiently Abundant Collections") and The Determinations, historical and theological support for {{the argument that the}} king exercised supreme jurisdiction within his realm.|$|E
