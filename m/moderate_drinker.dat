60|$|On the contrary, {{the pastor}} and the deacon were {{particularly}} gay, for men of their habitual sobriety. Although those {{were not the}} days of temperance, par excellence, neither of the guests was what might be termed even a <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker.</b> For a novelty in a sailor, Roswell Gardiner seldom touched anything but water, while the other two took their rum and water; {{but it was in}} moderation, as all the gifts of God should be used. As for the intemperate cry which makes it a sin to partake of any liquor, however prudently, it was then never heard in the land. On the whole, the clergy of all denominations might be set down as brandy-and-water men, a few occasionally carrying out their principle to exaggeration. But the Rev. Mr. Whittle was a sober man, and, though he saw no great harm in enlivening his heart and cheering his spirits with brandy taken in small quantities, he was never known to be any the worse for his libations.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{polymorphic}} enzyme {{alcohol dehydrogenase}} (ADH) catalyses {{the conversion of}} ethanol into the carcinogenic metabolite acetaldehyde which is partly excreted into the urine. Objectives of this pilot study are to determine whether this polymorphism {{may be related to}} bladder cancer and whether it modifies the relation between alcohol intake and bladder cancer. METHODS: 120 bladder cancer patients and 133 convenience controls were recruited at the University Medical Centre Nijmegen. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess alcohol intake and potential confounders. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and ADH 3 genotype was determined using PCR/RFLP. People with the ADH 3 genotype gamma 1 gamma 1 were compared to people with other ADH 3 genotypes. Above <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> (> 14 glasses of alcohol per week) were compared to <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals were computed using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: After correction for sex, age and smoking, ORs for ADH 3 genotype and alcohol intake were 2. 10 (1. 05 - 4. 22) and 1. 21 (0. 60 - 2. 44), respectively. <b>Moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> with the 'high-risk' (gamma 1 gamma 1) ADH 3 genotype appeared to have a threefold higher risk of bladder cancer compared to <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> with a 'low-risk' (gamma 1 gamma 2 or gamma 2 gamma 2) genotype. Surprisingly, the ORs for above <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> with the low-risk genotype (1. 95; 95 % CI: 0. 85 - 4. 48) and with the high-risk genotype (2. 18; 95 % CI: 0. 82 - 5. 77) were almost similar, suggesting no interaction. CONCLUSIONS: ADH 3 genotype is a possible risk factor for bladder cancer. Although <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> with the gamma 1 gamma 1 genotype seem to have the highest risk, we did not get a clear indication that ADH 3 genotype modifies the relationship between alcohol intake and bladder cancer...|$|R

60|$|I do {{not feel}} that it is right to {{suppress}} altogether any part of one's being. In itself abstinence seems to me a refusal to experience, and that, upon the lines of thought I follow, is to say that abstinence for its own sake is evil. But for an end all abstinences are permissible, and if the kinetic type of believer finds both his individual and his associated efficiency enhanced by a systematic discipline, if he is convinced that he must specialize because of the discursiveness of his motives, because there is something he wants to do or be so good that the rest of them may very well be suppressed for its sake, then he must suppress. But the virtue is in what he gets done and not in what he does not do. Reasonable fear is a sound reason for abstinence, as when a man has a passion like a lightly sleeping maniac that the slightest indulgence will arouse. Then he must needs adopt heroic abstinence, and even more so must he take to preventive restraint if he sees any motive becoming unruly and urgent and troublesome. Fear is a sound reason for abstinence and so is love. Many who have sensitive imaginations nowadays very properly abstain from meat because of butchery. And it is often needful, out of love and brotherhood, to abstain from things harmless to oneself because they are inconveniently alluring to others linked to us. The <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> who sits at table sipping his wine in the sight of one he knows to be a potential dipsomaniac is at best an unloving fool.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To clarify in the {{association}} between amount of ethanol consumption and serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GT) levels. Methods:GT values were measured from 195 individuals {{with a wide variety}} of well-documented ethanol consumption assessed by detailed personal interviews using a time-line follow-back technique. These included 103 heavy drinkers (90 men, 13 women) and 92 healthy volunteers (54 men, 38 women) who were either abstainers (n = 30) or <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> (n = 62). For comparisons, data were collected from GT measurements for establishing GT reference intervals from 2485 healthy volunteers including 1156 abstainers and 1329 <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Results: GT values in the individuals whose mean ethanol consumption exceeded 40 g of ethanol per day were significantly higher than those in the <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> with a mean consumption of 1 – 40 g/day (P < 0. 001) or in abstainers (P < 0. 001). The GT values in the group of <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> also exceeded those of the abstainers (P < 0. 001). The upper normal GT limits obtained from the data from abstainers were markedly lower (men 45 U/l, women 35 U/l) than those obtained from the popu-lation of <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> (men 66 U/l, women 40 U/l). Conclusions: Serum GT concentrations may respond to relatively low levels of ethanol consumption, which should be considered when defining GT reference intervals. The continuous increase in alcohol consump-tion at population level may lead to increased GT cut-off limits and hamper the detection of alcohol problems and liver affection in their early phase...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To compare {{alcohol use}} between {{depressed}} and nondepressed older adults, and to investigate correlates of alcohol abstinence and at-risk alcohol consumption in depressed older adults. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO). Participants A total of 373 participants (mean [standard deviation] age: 70. 6 [7. 3] years; 66 % women) {{diagnosed with a}} depressive disorder, and 128 nondepressed participants. Measurements Alcohol use was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Participants were categorized into abstainers (AUDIT score: 0), <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> (AUDIT score: 1 - 4), and at-risk drinkers (AUDIT score: ≥ 5). Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed with AUDIT categories as outcome, and demographic, social, somatic, and psychological variables as determinants. Results The depressed group consisted of 40. 2 % abstainers, 40. 8 % <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers,</b> and 19. 0 % at-risk drinkers. The depressed participants were more often abstinent and less often <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> than the nondepressed participants; they {{did not differ in}} at-risk drinking. Depressed abstainers more often used benzodiazepines but less often used antidepressants, and they had a poorer cognitive function than depressed <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Depressed at-risk drinkers were more often smokers and had fewer functional limitations but more severe depressive symptoms than depressed <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Conclusions Although alcohol abstinence was more common in depressed than in nondepressed older adults, 19 % of depressed persons were at-risk drinkers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effect of alcohol consumption on individual health status and health care utilization in Ireland using the 2007 Slán National Health and Lifestyle Survey, while accounting for the endogenous relationship between alcohol and health. Drinkers are categorized as those who never drank, non-drinkers, <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers,</b> or heavy drinkers, based on national recommended weekly drinking levels in Ireland. The drinking-status equation is estimated using an ordered probit model. Predicted values for the inverse mills ratio are generated, which are then included in the health and health-care utilization equations. Differences in health status for each category of drinker are examined, and the relationship between both alcohol consumption and health with a host of other personal and socio-economic variables is also identified. Given that the measure of health status available is self-assessed, the effect of alcohol consumption on health-care utilization is also analyzed as an alternative measure of health. Findings show that in Ireland, <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> enjoy the best health status. More <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> report having very good or excellent health compared with heavy drinkers, non-drinkers, or those who never drank. While heavy drinkers do not report having as good a health status as <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers,</b> they are better off in terms of health when compared with non-drinkers and those who are lifetime abstainers...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Previous {{research}} has focused mostly on abstainer and/or general drinker prototypes. The present studies examined an abstainer, <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> and heavy drinker prototype in relation to drinking behaviour. Design: Two studies among young adults aged 18 – 25 (paper-and-pencil, cross-sectional, N[*]=[*] 140; online, prospective, N[*]=[*] 451) assessed prototype favourability and participants’ perceived similarity to the prototypes. Participants were also categorised into abstainers, moderate, and heavy drinkers. Results: Similarity and favourability had similar sequences in both studies: the <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> and abstainer prototypes were evaluated most favourable and felt similar to; the heavy drinker prototype was rated the least favourable and felt similar to. Importantly, heavy drinking participants felt most similar to the <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> prototype and rated the heavy drinker least desirable. The results suggest a need for research to include other prototypes, such as the <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker,</b> besides the abstainer and heavy drinker. Conclusion: The studies provide insights into the contribution of alternative prototypes (i. e. <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker)</b> into the relationship between prototype perceptions and drinking behaviour. The results suggest tailoring prototype-based interventions according to drinking behaviour. Importantly, realistic perceived similarity to the more favourable <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> prototype may therefore need to be encouraged only after appropriate reductions in heavy drinkers’ alcohol consumption...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates whether college students' {{response}} to alcohol price and policies differ {{according to their}} drinking intensity. Individual level data on drinking behavior, price paid per drink, and college alcohol policies come from the student and administrator components of the 1997 and 1999 waves of the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) College Alcohol Study (CAS). Students drinking behavior is classified {{on the basis of}} the number of drinks they typically consume on a drinking occasion, and the number of times they have been drunk during the 30 days prior to survey. A generalized ordered logit model is used to determine whether key variables impact differentially the odds of drinking and the odds of heavy drinking. We find that students who faced a higher money price for alcohol are less likely to make the transition from abstainer to <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> and <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> to heavy drinker, and this effect is equal across thresholds. Campus bans on the use of alcohol are a greater deterrent to moving from abstainer to <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> than <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> to heavy drinker. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Adolescents form {{impressions}} {{about the}} type of peers who drink (i. e., drinker prototypes). The evaluation of, and perceived similarity to these prototypes are related to adolescents' drinking. Peer drinking norms {{play an important role}} in the formation of prototypes. We experimentally examined whether manipulation of peer norms changed the evaluation of and perceived similarity to drinker prototypes and whether these changes were moderated by peers' popularity. METHODS: In a pre-test, we assessed heavy drinker, <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> and abstainer prototypes, drinking behaviors and peer-perceived popularity among 599 adolescents. Additionally, 88 boys from this sample participated in a simulated chat room, in which they interacted with peers from school. These peers were in fact pre-programmed e-confederates, who were either popular or unpopular and who communicated either pro-alcohol or anti-alcohol norms. After the chat room interaction we assessed participants' drinker prototypes. RESULTS: Participants exposed to anti-alcohol norms were more negative about, and perceived themselves as less similar to heavy drinker prototypes, than participants exposed to pro-alcohol norms. We found no effects of peer norms on <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> and abstainer prototypes. Effects were not moderated by peers' popularity. We did find a main effect of popularity on perceived similarity to all prototypes. This indicated that participants rated themselves as more similar to heavy and <b>moderate</b> <b>drinker</b> prototypes and less similar to abstainer prototypes when they interacted with unpopular peers than with popular peers. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to anti-alcohol norms of peers leads adolescents to form more negative prototypes of the heavy drinker. This could be an important finding for prevention and intervention programs aimed to reduce alcohol consumption among adolescents...|$|E

Methods: One thousand two hundred and one males were recruited in the health promotion center of a university hospital. Evaluation of alcohol consumption and facial flushing was assessed via questionnaires and interviews. The criteria for MS were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria with a modified waist circumference cutoff value (men ≥ 90 cm) for Korean subjects. Subjects were divided into three groups according to the amount of alcohol they consume: nondrinkers, <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> (≤ 14 standard drinks per week), and heavy drinkers (> 14 standard drinks per week). They were also separated into two groups according to facial flushing: non-flushers (no occurrence) and flushers (steady occurrence).

Empirical surveys have focused primarily on identification of risk factors for high-level drinking but have done little to clarify the underlying mechanisms at work. Also, there have been few attempts to apply nonlinear dynamics to the study of these mechanisms and processes at the population level. A simple framework where drinking is modeled as a socially contagious process in low- and high-risk connected environments is introduced. Individuals are classified as light, moderate (assumed mobile), and heavy <b>drinkers.</b> <b>Moderate</b> <b>drinkers</b> provide the link between both environments, that is, they are assumed to be the only individuals drinking in both settings. The focus here is on the effect of <b>moderate</b> <b>drinkers,</b> measured by the proportion of their time spent in "low-" versus "high-" risk drinking environments, on the distribution of drinkers.

However, the full story even in a highly simplified setting is not so simple because "strong" local social mixing tends to increase high-risk drinking on its own.
