40|$|<b>Microfluidic</b> <b>flows</b> in MEMS {{devices are}} {{generally}} laminar flows, hence the mixing is difficult. To improve {{the mixing of}} <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flows,</b> a passive or active micromixer device is needed. In this poster, the design and simulation of a Bio-MEMS rotating microfluidic mixer is proposed. The micromixer takes three input flows and generates one output flow. A rotating blade is used to stir the microfluid inside the mixer to introduce extra turbulence, hence resulting in better mixing outcome. Compared to passive micromixer, the proposed active rotating micromixer leads to better mixing efficiency. The microfluidic mixer is designed and simulated in COMSOL. COMSOL simulation reveals the mixing mechanism of the microfluid flows. Based on the analysis, a set of optimized design parameters of the micromixer is achieved.

50|$|A {{lab-on-a-chip}} is {{a device}} that integrates one or several laboratory functions on a single chip that deals with handling particles in hollow microfluidic channels. It has been developed for over a decade. Advantages in handling particles at such a small scale include lowering fluid volume consumption (lower reagents costs, less waste), increasing portability of the devices, increasing process control (due to quicker thermo-chemical reactions) and decreasing fabrication costs. Additionally, <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> is entirely laminar (i.e., no turbulence). Consequently, {{there is virtually no}} mixing between neighboring streams in one hollow channel.

30|$|The {{incorporation}} of microfluidics with biosensing has the following advantages: multiplex assay and simultaneous {{separation of the}} targeted biomolecules for detection during the flow, for enhanced signal to noise ratio. However, it has the limitation due to the shear effect caused by the <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> on the antibodies immobilized on the sensing platform. In the current study, sensitivity variation due to <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> was established by detecting CA- 125 antigens in biofluid using gold interdigitated electrodes. At static drop condition, the signal response of antigen–antibody conjugation in gold nanoparticle-coated interdigitated electrodes is approximately 2.8 times than in plain interdigitated electrodes. At 20  kHz frequency, the signal response of plain interdigitated electrodes during antigen–antibody conjugation has increased from 260.80 to 736.33 pF when the gold nano particles are coated on the plain interdigitated electrodes. At <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> condition, the signal response of antigen–antibody conjugation in gold nanoparticle-coated interdigitated electrodes is 2.5 times than in plain interdigitated electrodes. At 20  kHz frequency, the signal response of plain interdigitated electrodes during antigen–antibody conjugation has increased from 205.85 to 518.48 pF when the gold nano particles are coated on the plain interdigitated electrodes. Based on the measured results, the following conclusions can be made. (1) The functionality of the individual layers in the sensing platform is validated with the measured change in capacitance. (2) The gold nanoparticle coated interdigitated electrode has higher sensitivity than the plain interdigitated electrode during the CA- 125 antigen antibody interaction. (3) The capacitive sensing signal response increased proportionally {{with the increase in}} concentration of the antigens during the antigen–antibody conjugation. (4) The effect of shear on the sensing signal response is evident given the lower capacitive signal during antigen–antibody conjugation in the <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> condition as compared to the static drop condition. The observed effect of shear stress in the <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> condition during the antigen–antibody conjugation can be mitigated by incorporating the following design changes in the sensing platform and microchannel. (i) The sensing platform with nano well-structure immobilized the antibody into each well, can reduce the shear effect during the <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow.</b> (ii) The surface treatment to the microchannel for controlling the hydrophilicity of channel reduce the shear caused by the <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> significantly and thus the effect of the shear on sensing platform can be controlled. Though our focus was on isothermal microfluidic devices, the future work on evaluating the influence of thermal conditions on the sensing signal response in the microfluidic platform would provide additional information regarding the stability of the bioconjugation chemistries in thermocycling microfluidic biosensing applications.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} a DNA aptamer, which was selected through SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) {{to be specific}} against the H 5 N 1 subtype of the avian influenza virus (AIV), {{was used as an}} alternative reagent to monoclonal antibodies in an impedance biosensor utilizing a <b>microfluidics</b> <b>flow</b> cell and an interdigitated microelectrode for the specific detection of H 5 N 1 AIV. The gold surface of the interdigitated microelectrode embedded in a <b>microfluidics</b> <b>flow</b> cell was modified using streptavidin.

The aptasensor had a detection time of 30 min with a detection limit of 0. 0128 hemagglutinin units (HAU). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the binding of the target virus onto the electrode surface. The DNA aptamer was specific to H 5 N 1 and had no cross-reaction to other subtypes of AIV (e. g., H 1 N 1, H 2 N 2, H 7 N 2).

As lower static water contact angle is a measurement of higher surface wettability [30, 33, 35, 36], so the meniscus movement was faster on the microchannel surface of with lower static contact angle [30].

30|$|Integrating {{microfluidics}} with biosensors is {{of great}} research interest with the increasing trend of lab-on-the chip and point-of-care devices. Though {{there have been numerous}} studies performed relating microfluidics to the biosensing mechanisms, the study of the sensitivity variation due to <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> is very much limited. In this paper, the sensitivity of interdigitated electrodes was evaluated at the static drop condition and the <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> condition. In addition, this study demonstrates the use of gold nanoparticles to enhance the sensor signal response and provides experimental results of the capacitance difference during cancer antigen- 125 (CA- 125) antigen–antibody conjugation at multiple concentrations of CA- 125 antigens. The experimental results also provide evidence of disease-specific detection of CA- 125 antigen at multiple concentrations with the increase in capacitive signal response proportional to the concentration of the CA- 125 antigens. The capacitive signal response of antigen–antibody conjugation on interdigitate electrodes has been enhanced by approximately 2.8 times (from 260.80 to 736.33 pF at 20  kHz frequency) in static drop condition and approximately 2.5 times (from 205.85 to 518.48 pF at 20  kHz frequency) in <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> condition with gold nanoparticle-coating. The capacitive signal response is observed to decrease at <b>microfluidic</b> <b>flow</b> condition at both plain interdigitated electrodes (from 260.80 to 205.85 pF at 20  kHz frequency) and gold nano particle coated interdigitated electrodes (from 736.33 to 518.48 pF at 20  kHz frequency), due to the strong shear effect compared to static drop condition. However, the microfluidic channel in the biosensor has the potential to increase the signal to noise ratio due to plasma separation from the whole blood and lead to the increase concentration of the biomarkers in the blood volume for sensing.|$|E
