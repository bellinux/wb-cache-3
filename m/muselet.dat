40|$|Due to dynamic effects, clearances, {{manufacturing}} and assembly errors in form-closed cam mechanisms, the follower jump can also occur. For conjugate cam mechanisms {{a technique to}} avoid the follower jump {{without the use of}} a spring involves making the conjugate cam profiles bigger than the kinematical ones by adding an external offset. This strategy produces an interference fit between the conjugate cam profiles and the follower train. This paper presents an ordered procedure to study the influence that the planned interference fit has on the evaluation of the contact forces, the expected fatigue life of the rollers, contact pressures and the lubrication conditions. The study is based on a conjugate cam mechanism with translational roller followers used in a real automatic process for manufacturing <b>muselets.</b> A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is proposed and the Hertzian theory for general profiles is used to model the nonlinear contact stiffness between the cams and the crowned rollers. The dynamic model predicts {{that it is difficult to}} obtain conjugate cam mechanisms with an infinite expected fatigue life of the rollers just by considering typical achievable manufacturing errors or clearances, and as happens in reality, a set-up process is highly recommended. The procedure is also tested with measured manufacturing errors on a coordinate measure machine—CMM—and with measured radial internal clearances for the rollers measured by an experimental apparatus. Also, to evaluate lubrication conditions, surface finishing measurements have been taken of the cams and the rollers with a surface profiler. Postprint (published version...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>muselet</b> (...) is a {{wire cage}} that fits over the cork of {{a bottle of}} champagne, {{sparkling}} wine or beer to prevent the cork from emerging {{under the pressure of}} the carbonated contents. It derives its name from the French museler, to muzzle. The <b>muselet</b> often has a metal cap incorporated in the design which may show the drink maker's emblem. They are normally covered by a metal foil envelope. Muselets are also known as wirehoods or Champagne wires.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{a bottle}} of {{champagne}} was produced, with the label and the <b>muselet</b> plate illustrated by the lovers of Peynet, pieces that have become rare. Also a second series of bottles in 2004 were made, making five different capsules.|$|E
50|$|When {{champagne}} {{was first}} produced {{the pressure of}} the sparkling wine was maintained by wooden plugs sealed with oil-cloth and wax. This method proved inconsistent either from leaking or blowing out of the stopper and a method of restraining the corks using cord was developed. In 1844 Adolphe Jaqueson invented the more secure method involving steel wire, however the early muselets were not easy to install and proved somewhat inconvenient to open. Further developments led to the modern <b>muselet</b> which is made of steel wire twisted to add strength and with a small loop of wire twisted into the lower ring which can be untwisted to release {{the pressure of the}} <b>muselet</b> and give access to the cork.|$|E
50|$|Muselets are now machine-made in millions. A modern {{development}} {{has seen the}} production of personalized caps within the <b>muselet,</b> which display the emblems or name of the manufacturer. These may vary in colour and design {{from year to year}} and between different manufacturers. This has stimulated a market for the collection of these caps.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} {{sugar in the}} liqueur d'expédition determines the {{sweetness}} of the Champagne, the sugar previously in the wine having been consumed in the second fermentation. Generally, sugar is added to balance the high acidity of the Champagne, rather than to produce a sweet taste. Brut Champagne will only have a little sugar added, and Champagne called nature or zéro dosage will have no sugar added at all. A cork is then inserted, with a capsule and wire cage (<b>muselet)</b> securing it in place.|$|E

50|$|The fame of {{the house}} grew {{following}} the rumour {{that it was a}} favourite of Napoleon, who bestowed upon the house a gold medal for its fine cellars. The Champagne house Juglar was absorbed into Jacquesson in 1829. By 1867 annual sales of Jacquesson bottles had reached 1,000,000, but a period of decline followed the death of Adolphe Jacquesson, inventor of the <b>muselet,</b> when the descendants ceased to continue the family business, and ownership changed hands over several decades, until in 1974 when it was bought by Jean Chiquet.|$|E
50|$|By time of {{the death}} in 1901 of the last {{original}} member of the community, Sister Saint Joseph (the former Cornelie <b>Muselet),</b> the congregation numbered over 100 Sisters. Over the next century, the congregation built a series of medical facilities answering different needs, from regular medical care {{to the care of}} unwed mothers. One of their institutions, St. Thomas Hospital, was the first to accept the work of Dr. Bob Smith, the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, and his first patient in this new program to deal with this condition. One member of the congregation, Sister Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A., (1889-1966) became a leading figure in this work.|$|E
5000|$|Bottled beer is sold {{with several}} types of bottle cap, but most often with crown caps, also known as crown seals. Some beers (for example Grolsch) are sold in [...] "beugel" [...] style bottles, known as [...] "flip-top" [...] or [...] "swing top" [...] in some English {{speaking}} countries. A number of beers are sold finished with a cork and <b>muselet</b> (or cage), similar to champagne closures. These closures were largely superseded by the crown cap {{at the end of}} the 19th century, but survive in premium markets. Many larger beers, including most forties and some growlers, use screw caps due to their resealing design.|$|E

5000|$|Mother Bernardine {{immediately}} {{volunteered to}} go herself. Securing {{the commitment of}} Sister Françoise Guillement to accompany her, she put her proposal for the mission to the community. Though the Sisters were reluctant to lose her talents, they voted unanimously to authorize the mission to America. Bishop Rappe, eagerly awaiting the Sisters' arrival, had written in the spring, [...] "Come, my daughters, I have now prepared a place for you. On it is good spring water and good fresh air." [...] Mother Bernardine then persuaded two of the postulants, Louise Brulois and Cornelie <b>Muselet,</b> to join in this missionary venture. The small group left France on September 24, 1851, {{with little more than}} chapel furnishings and boxes of linens for their home and nursing needs. During the voyage, they studied the basics of English to prepare for their new home.|$|E
50|$|Robert Senechal {{arrived in}} 1983 and stabilised {{the club in}} Division Four. They missed out on {{promotion}} by a narrow margin in 1984 - but were promoted in 1991. However, it was short-lived and they were relegated once again from whence they came. In June 1994, {{it was announced that}} Boulogne were in serious debt - owing ₣3 million. However, mayor and billionaire John <b>Muselet</b> intervened to save the club and appointed Jacques Wattez as chairman. Under the leadership of Wattez, the club adopted a new name - Union Sportive Boulogne Côte d'Opale - in July 1994. The debts of the club were wiped and Boulogne - although still struggling in Division Four - reached the last sixteen of the Coupe de France again in 1997. They earned a home tie against Ligue 1 side Olympique de Marseille. Although, Boulogne battled their way through the match, they narrowly lost 1-0.|$|E
50|$|The {{process for}} {{bottling}} wine is largely {{similar to that}} for bottling beer, except wine bottles differ in volumes and shapes. Traditionally, a cork is used to provide closure to wine bottles. After filling, a bottle travels to a corking machine (corker) where a cork is compressed and pushed into {{the neck of the}} bottle. Whilst this is happening, the corker vacuums the air out of the bottle to form a negative pressure headspace. This removes any oxygen from the headspace, which is useful as latent oxygen can ruin the quality of the product via oxidation. A negative pressure headspace will also counteract pressure caused by the thermal expansion of the wine, preventing the cork from being forced from the bottle. Champagnes and sparkling wines may further be sealed with a <b>muselet,</b> which ensures the cork will not explode off in transit. Alternative wine closures such as screw caps are available.|$|E
