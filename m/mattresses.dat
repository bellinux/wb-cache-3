5|$|In 2015, a {{systematic}} review {{of studies on}} <b>mattresses</b> concluded that medium-firm, custom-inflated <b>mattresses</b> were best for pain and neutral spinal alignment.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm <b>mattresses</b> are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm <b>mattresses.</b> There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, the {{government}} of Somaliland distributed rice, sugar, and plastic sheets for housing. After Chapala and the subsequent Cyclone Megh, the local Red Cross chapter distributed blankets, sleeping mats, and <b>mattresses</b> to the affected families. The CARE relief agency provided US$300,000 toward restoring water and relief goods.|$|E
50|$|Discount <b>Mattress</b> Barn (or simply <b>Mattress</b> Barn) was a {{chain of}} <b>mattress</b> stores located only in Florida. On August 29, 2014, it was {{announced}} that <b>Mattress</b> Firm would acquire all of the remaining <b>Mattress</b> Barn locations. In September 2014, all of the remaining stores converted into <b>Mattress</b> Firm.|$|R

5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable <b>mattresses,</b> bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Marco, the General Coordination of Civil Protection of the Ministry of the Interior {{declared}} a state of emergency for 48 municipalities in Veracruz. Relief goods were distributed to the affected areas by October9. The Government of Mexico reported that 4,700 blankets, 2,900 <b>mattresses,</b> 5,554 bottles of water (each containing 500milliliters), 260,000 boxes of milk, 250,000 packages of biscuits, and 12,400 boxes of school supplies had been distributed.|$|E
5|$|On August 23 the Haitian {{government}} sent food, sachets of potable water, <b>mattresses,</b> and medicines to {{the town}} of Bainet in the Sud-Est department. On August 24 the Pan American Development Foundation sent food to all people living in temporary shelters and Venezuela delivered 11 tonnes of emergency food to Sud-Est in 500 family bags. Hurricane assistance was then compounded by the country's standard humanitarian assistance programs and became indistinct from the country's continued poverty crisis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mattress</b> Giant Corporation was an American {{retailing}} {{company and}} <b>mattress</b> store chain founded in 1986 in Miami, Florida. The company {{was based in}} Addison, Texas. In 2012 it was announced <b>Mattress</b> Firm would acquire all <b>Mattress</b> Giant locations in the U.S in a $47 million deal, virtually all <b>Mattress</b> Giant locations will convert to <b>Mattress</b> Firm. Some stores were converted to Sleepy's which were later converted to <b>Mattress</b> Firm. The deal closed in July 2012 and it effectively ended <b>Mattress</b> Giant's presence as a bedding retailer. The website was operated through December 2012; and it delivered <b>mattress</b> related products to houses.Mattress Giant had a total of 360 stores in 14 states nationwide.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>mattress</b> {{warranties}} are voided if the <b>mattress</b> gets a stain, so most sleepers use <b>mattress</b> pads {{to prevent}} stains.|$|R
5|$|The World Food Program {{immediately}} placed 5,500Jamaicans on {{complementary food}} assistance, a daily ration of 1900kJ (450kcal) of High Energy Biscuits, for two weeks. Within three days US$398,000 of pre-prepared United States Agency for International Development (USAID) emergency supplies {{arrived on the}} island. The airlift was composed mostly of <b>mattresses,</b> blankets, plastic sheeting, hygiene kits and water containers. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) provided a US$200,000 grant to support the relief effort and the Chinese Red Cross, despite dealing with Typhoon Sepat, sent US$30,000 to its Jamaican counterpart {{for the purchase of}} emergency relief supplies.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Larry hit Mexico {{at around}} the same time as two other {{tropical}} storms. The Mexican Red Cross provided aid for 6,587 families throughout the country, while the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies launched an international appeal for aid. The appeal raised $284,472.8 (2003USD). The Mexican Red Cross distributed 4,000 food and hygiene packets to various places, and delivered 2,750 family packets and over 4,300 <b>mattresses</b> to citizens in Chiapas, as well as 5,000 school kits. A total of 38,750people benefited from the operation.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, Room Service, significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made {{it a lot easier}} to record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying himself for the next gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up <b>mattresses</b> against the windows, and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E

3000|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{foundation}} is to provide support to the <b>mattress,</b> enhance <b>mattress</b> performance, and extend the service life of a <b>mattress.</b> The foundation and <b>mattress</b> are generally paired as a matched set. Using a foundation that is not well-matched with the <b>mattress</b> can decrease <b>mattress</b> performance and service life, and may also affect the fire performance of the <b>mattress</b> set. The {{most common type of}} foundation is a rigid non-yielding foundation (e.g. box spring [...]) (Figure 4), which is constructed of several springs or shock absorbing torsion modules mounted on a rigid metal support. The boxspring is covered by a ticking, which usually matches the ticking fabric of a <b>mattress.</b> Foundations with foam filling and cotton battings have also been reported but are becoming obsolete in modern <b>mattress</b> sets.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 <b>Mattress</b> World {{had three}} {{stores in the}} state of Michigan. <b>Mattress</b> World was, {{according}} to a Furniture Today article, the apparent high bidder for six <b>Mattress</b> Discounters stores in Metro Detroit; <b>Mattress</b> Discounters was exiting the Michigan market.|$|R
5|$|In {{the more}} popular {{versions}} of the tale, only one pea is used. However, Charles Boner added in two more peas in his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions {{can be seen in}} various numbers of <b>mattresses</b> as well as feather beds. Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear at all, and the princess decides to lie all on her own.|$|E
5|$|The World Food Program {{immediately}} placed 5,500Jamaicans on {{complementary food}} assistance, a daily ration of 1900kJ (450kcal) of High Energy Biscuits, for two weeks. On August 22, {{three days after}} the hurricane struck the island, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) sent US$398,000 of emergency supplies to Jamaica's Norman Manley International Airport. These supplies included <b>mattresses,</b> blankets, plastic sheeting, hygiene kits and water containers. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) provided a US$200,000 grant to support the relief effort. The Chinese Red Cross, despite dealing with Typhoon Sepat, sent US$30,000 to its Jamaican counterpart for the purchase of emergency relief supplies.|$|E
5|$|The army sent about 800soldiers to Toronto {{to assist}} with the cleanup, {{providing}} blankets and <b>mattresses.</b> Toronto residents helped out with the relief effort: the Salvation Army received so many donations of clothes, footwear, blankets, food, and money that its storage facilities were overfilled, forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed. A Hurricane Relief Fund was established to coordinate financial donations, ultimately raising about $5.3million (CAD). The fund received donations from organisations, companies, and individuals including Pope Pius XII, the Ford Motor Company of Canada, the United Church of Canada, Laura Secord Candy Shops, and the British-American Oil Company. A portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses.|$|E
50|$|Scientific {{research}} has shown that the <b>mattress</b> influences SIDS outcomes; a firm, clean and well-fitting <b>mattress</b> lowers SIDS risk. However, neither <b>mattress</b> materialsnor using a second-hand mattressaffect SIDS risk. It is common to place a waterproof membrane between the <b>mattress</b> and the bedding to prevent uncontained bed wetting from damaging the <b>mattress.</b> Bed sheets ought to fit the <b>mattress</b> tightly so that the child cannot become entangled and suffocate; a common safety recommendation is to short sheet the bed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mattress</b> pad: Also {{known as}} a <b>mattress</b> topper, or underpad. This is used above the <b>mattress</b> and beneath a bottom sheet to add comfort.|$|R
50|$|Bedding {{underlay}} (or <b>mattress</b> overlay) is a thick, extra {{layer of}} padding between the bed <b>mattress</b> and bedding.

5|$|Will is dismayed {{to learn}} that his close friend, {{guidance}} counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), has arranged to marry her fiancé, football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), {{on the same day}} the glee club will compete at sectionals. Will goes on to discover that his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) has been lying to him for months about her supposed pregnancy. She actually experienced a hysterical pregnancy and hid the truth from him for several months by wearing a pregnancy pad under her clothes, while planning to secretly adopt Quinn's (Dianna Agron) baby. Will walks out on her and spends the night at the school, sleeping on one of the <b>mattresses</b> given to the glee club in payment for their commercial.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with <b>mattresses,</b> blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for {{vaulting}} distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing <b>mattresses</b> were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} conventions {{have produced}} many standard <b>mattress</b> and box spring sizes. Beds vary by {{country of origin}} as per the table below. These dimensions are for the <b>mattress</b> - actual bed frames are a little larger to accommodate the <b>mattress.</b> <b>Mattress</b> thickness varies considerably.|$|R
5000|$|Semi-Waveless <b>Mattress</b> - A semi-waveless <b>mattress</b> {{is a type}} of <b>mattress</b> that {{contains}} a few fiber inserts and/or baffles to control the water motion and increase support.|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} types of <b>mattress</b> protectors. Encasements are shields that protect the <b>mattress</b> directly, typically from bed bugs, and are often used in hotels. Protectors are used to protect the <b>mattress</b> from bed-wetting or allergic situations. In contrast, <b>mattress</b> pads and <b>mattress</b> toppers are primarily used to provide comfort features for the user. Pads are thinner, while the thicker toppers {{tend to be more}} comfortable and expensive.|$|R
5|$|On October20, the {{government}} of Cuba issued {{an appeal to the}} international community for assistance. The Red Cross provided $1.6million to the country, and various departments of the United Nations provided $80,000. The government of Japan sent about $104,000 worth of medical equipment, and Italy sent about $526,000 worth of medical supplies. The Canadian Red Cross donated a water purification unit, and the Spanish Red Cross sent blankets and cots. The German Red Cross also sent <b>mattresses</b> and blankets. The American Red Cross sent 9.5tons of food. Several other countries sent assistance, including the European Commission which sent $750,000 worth of supplies. There were early difficulties in transporting the relief supplies due to fuel shortages. Due to storm damage, 66,881people resided in shelters until their houses were rebuilt, or until they moved elsewhere. By March 1997, most people had returned to their homes, although some did so without a roof. There was a threat for water-borne diseases due to stagnant waters, although no such outbreaks occurred. The storm decreased the supply of the banana crop in 1997, coupled with a drought.|$|E
5|$|On October31, a {{disaster}} declaration was signed for Honduras {{due to the}} effects from Beta. USAID sent $50,000 in funds {{for the purchase of}} relief items such as blankets, foam <b>mattresses,</b> and hygiene kits. Two Fokker F27 aircraft were also supplied to help assist the transportation of relief supplies at a cost of $40,000. The United States Department of Defense sent military personnel to the affected areas from November4–8. During that time, more than 155,000lb (70,306kg) of relief supplies were airlifted to the affected communities. The United States embassy in Honduras also provided a C-12 Huron aircraft to transport 3,000lb (1,360kg) to Puerto Lempira. A total of $500,000 was sent in the form of relief supplies and transport to Honduras from USAID. The Spanish Government offered a C-130 Hercules containing emergency supplies to Honduras. The World Food Programme pre-positioned 509tons (461.7tonnes) of food to be used in temporary shelters and recovery activities. The government of Great Britain offered humanitarian assistance, consisting of 1,500 plastic bags, 1,800 jerrycans, one helicopter, five boats, 250 military personnel, and five medical assistants.|$|E
5|$|The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sent 300 food packages, 300 kitchen kits, 200 <b>mattresses,</b> 300 hygiene kits, 150 hammocks, plastic sheeting, and 26.4tons (24tonnes) of {{construction}} materials and tools to Nicaragua. As a precaution, about 2.2tons (2tonnes) of food was also {{sent to the}} National Society's warehouse in Bogotá. A total of $116,367 was also allocated from disaster relief funds. The Justice, Global & Ecumenical Relations Unit in Canada also provided $6,500 in relief funds to Nicaragua. Two shipments of relief supplies {{were sent to the}} hardest hit areas by Direct Relief International. The first shipment arrived on November9; it contained 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of antibiotics valued at $237,241. The second shipment arrived on November22; it contained numerous supplies, valued at $139,283, which would be delivered to the hardest hit areas. The governments of Sweden and France sent $37,191 and $36,058 in funds respectively.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mattress</b> {{protector}} is {{an item of}} removable bedding {{that sits}} on top of, or encases, a <b>mattress</b> to protect it.

40|$|An {{interrupted}} stitch type with favorable tissue characteristics {{will reduce}} local wound complications. We describe a novel high-strength, low-tension repair for the interrupted closure of skin, cartilage, and muscle, the double loop <b>mattress</b> stitch, {{and compare it}} experimentally with other interrupted closure methods. The performance of the double loop <b>mattress</b> technique in porcine cartilage and skeletal muscle is compared with the simple, <b>mattress,</b> and loop <b>mattress</b> interrupted sutures in both a novel porcine loading chamber and mechanical model. Wound apposition is assessed by electron microscopy. The performance of the double loop <b>mattress</b> in vivo was confirmed using a series of 805 pediatric laparotomies/laparoscopies. The double loop <b>mattress</b> suture is 3. 5 times stronger than the loop <b>mattress</b> in muscle and 1. 6 times stronger in cartilage (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). Additionally, the double loop <b>mattress</b> reduces tissue tension by 66 % compared with just 53 % for the loop <b>mattress</b> (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). Wound gapping is equal, and wound eversion appears significantly improved (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001) compared with the loop <b>mattress</b> in vitro. In vivo, the double loop <b>mattress</b> performs {{as well as the}} loop <b>mattress</b> and significantly better than the <b>mattress</b> stitch in assessments of wound eversion and dehiscence. There were no episodes of stitch extrusion in our series of patients. The mechanical advantage of its intrinsic pulley arrangement gives the double loop <b>mattress</b> its favorable properties. Wound dehiscence is reduced because this stitch type is stronger and exerts less tension on the tissue than the <b>mattress</b> stitch. We advocate the use of this novel stitch wherever a high-strength, low-tension repair is required. These properties will enhance wound repair, and its application will be useful to surgeons of all disciplines...|$|R
