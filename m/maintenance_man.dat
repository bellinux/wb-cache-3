5|$|David {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} promotional materials for the Alien prequel films. For Prometheus, rather than focusing on the film's connection with the Alien canon, the marketing team emphasized central characters, most prominently David. On March 17, 2012, director Ridley Scott hosted a panel for Prometheus at WonderCon, where attendees were provided with Weyland Corporation business cards that provided a website and telephone number. Upon calling the number, callers were played an automated message that stated that Weyland Corporation's lines were busy, at which point a text message was sent that linked to a video narrated by Fassbender that showed David being unboxed, prior to his awakening. A month later, on April 17, an extended version of the unboxing video was released, with David providing additional insight into his function aboard the Prometheus as the ship's butler and <b>maintenance</b> <b>man,</b> as well as advertising his ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. Released with the video was also a poster featuring David, which was printed as a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal.|$|E

25|$|On 18 February 1943, the Scholls {{brought a}} {{suitcase}} full of leaflets {{to the university}} main building. They hurriedly dropped stacks of copies in the empty corridors for students to find {{when they left the}} lecture rooms. Leaving before the lectures had ended, the Scholls noticed that there were some left-over copies in the suitcase and decided to distribute them. Sophie flung the last remaining leaflets from the top floor down into the atrium. This spontaneous action was observed by the university <b>maintenance</b> <b>man,</b> Jakob Schmied. Hans and Sophie Scholl were taken into Gestapo custody. A draft of a seventh pamphlet, written by Christoph Probst, was found in the possession of Hans Scholl {{at the time of his}} arrest by the Gestapo. While Sophie Scholl got rid of incriminating evidence before being taken into custody, Hans did try to destroy the draft of the last leaflet by tearing it apart and trying to swallow it down. However, the Gestapo recovered enough of it and were able to match the handwriting with other writings from Probst, which they found when they searched Hans's apartment.|$|E
500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and <b>maintenance</b> <b>man.</b> It is {{designed}} to be indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's going on? What do you think about these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and longing for a soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E

500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room. They said they heard two women arguing about {{business}} matters. Selena told Saldívar {{she could no}} longer be trusted, and demanded Saldívar return her financial papers. Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw the gun. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed it at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's <b>maintenance</b> <b>man,</b> reported hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen clutching her chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing the gun at her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll shoot me again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again".

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} maintenance planning which utilizes mathematics and economic theory to help select an optimal maintenance condition. The maintenance problem is discussed first with respect to short run (daily) routine operating decisions, and then with respect to long run decisions {{as they relate to}} equipment design and to maintenance facilities. The maintenance problem is then stated in mathematical terms. A cost minimizing maintenance model is described which takes account of such factors as deterioration and failure probabilities, manhours for preventive inspection and preventive repair, elapsed time for emergency diagnosis and repair, cost of setting up for periodic maintenance, cost of <b>maintenance</b> <b>men,</b> and cost of system downtime. A numerical example illustrates how the model can be used to determine the least cost combination of time between periodic maintenance, the number of <b>maintenance</b> <b>men,</b> and the number of periodics between inspections of each item for a required level of system operation. ...|$|R
