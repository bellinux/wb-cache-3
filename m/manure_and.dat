5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as <b>manure,</b> <b>and</b> also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat to}} humans in {{developed}} countries is rising {{as a result of}} social trends: the increase in organic farming, which uses <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> sewage sludge rather than artificial fertilizers, and spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and salad vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human feces (night soil) as fertilizer and to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat. While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters desperate for rapid weight-loss.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E

5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, <b>manure,</b> <b>and</b> hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} mainly used {{horses for}} logistical support; {{they were better}} than mechanized vehicles at traveling through deep mud and over rough terrain. Horses were used for reconnaissance and for carrying messengers, as well as pulling artillery, ambulances, and supply wagons. The presence of horses often increased morale among the soldiers at the front, but the animals contributed to disease and poor sanitation in camps, caused by their <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> carcasses. The value of horses, and the increasing difficulty of replacing them, was such that by 1917 some troops {{were told that the}} loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier. Ultimately, the blockade of Germany prevented the Central Powers from importing horses to replace those lost, which contributed to Germany's defeat. By the end of the war, even the well-supplied U.S. Army was short of horses.|$|E

25|$|In a {{concentrated}} animal feeding operation (CAFO), {{it is considered}} normal for {{a large number of}} animals to continuously occupy a very small area. The aisles that animals use to move around are consequently constantly coated with a moist layer of <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> urine from the many animals, leading to ailments such as foot rot due to the constant wet exposure. The <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> urine is usually just scraped off into gutters below slatted surfaces, and the surfaces and gutters are rarely washed completely clean, so molds, bacteria, and insects can grow and thrive in the potentially infectious waste. Feeding areas in a CAFO are also rarely stripped bare and washed with a disinfectant, as this would reduce the time available for animals to eat continuously, so molds and bacteria are also able to become established where the animals eat. The close confinement and lack of general environmental cleanliness leads to easier spread of infection and increased sickness, requiring the regular feeding of antibiotics to keep the confined animals healthy but which also leads to antibiotic resistance for bacteria constantly present in the CAFO.|$|E

30|$|Dried <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> ashes {{differ in}} their characteristics; {{incineration}} of dried manures led to increase in pH and concentration of nutrients especially exchangeable cations. Dried <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> ashes are comparable in terms of total organic carbon and total nitrogen content. Generally, the addition of amendment increased soil organic carbon, the effect of dried <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> ash on soil organic carbon is environment dependent, {{and the addition of}} amendment did not have residual effect on soil organic carbon. Ammonification and nitrification process was increased with the application of manure ash, especially PMA and the conversion of organic nitrogen to ammonium nitrogen is not only controlled by the characteristics of added material but also by the soil environmental condition. The release of nitrogen through nitrification process depends on the type of soil and amendment. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen availability release indices were not consistent with increasing time hence erratic. Nitrification is more pronounced under incubation and field conditions than ammonification process and vice versa was observed in screen-house experiment.|$|R
40|$|INDICATOR {{bacteria}} {{concentrations in}} non-snowmelt runofffrom adjacent <b>manured</b> <b>and</b> non-manured watersheds were monitored for 4 years. Significant {{differences in the}} quality of runoff from the <b>manured</b> <b>and</b> non-manured cropland were not consistently observed. Hydrological conditions greatly affected bacterial concentrations. Heavy runoff under wet weather conditions resulted in water quality degradation irrespective of cropping or manuring activity. Under relatively dry weather conditions, runoff from both the <b>manured</b> <b>and</b> non-manured cropland often met the recommended bacterial quality criteria for water to be used for recreation or as a source of public water supplies. The relatively better quality of manured cropland runoff in our study compared to other studies was attributed mainly to the management practice of dry weather manure application followed by immediate plowdown and the mostly level topography of the watersheds. Much lower indicator bacteria concentrations in long-term stored manure than in relatively fresh manure suggested a lower potential for runoff pollution from land application of the former...|$|R
