25|$|In {{order to}} handle the {{increasing}} size of ocean liners, new mooring systems have been introduced to allow successful berthing of these vessels. Most significantly was a special temporary <b>mooring</b> <b>system,</b> designed and implemented by engineering firm Arup Group in 2012 to allow the mooring of the Queen Mary II. This involved a series of temporary drag anchors to be installed on the seabed around Campbell's Cove and the passenger terminal to take the ship's bow lines. This temporary system has subsequently been kept for larger vessels to moor, pending the design and implementation of a more permanent design. As {{a result of this}} temporary mooring system's success, a permanent new mooring dolphin with both fixed above-water pile and a concrete deck mooring structure was introduced adjacent to Campbell's Cove {{to the north of the}} OPT.|$|E

40|$|Synthetic mooring ropes have {{a proven}} track record of use in harsh {{operating}} conditions {{over the past two}} decades. As one of the main users of ropes for permanent <b>mooring</b> <b>systems,</b> {{the oil and gas industry}} has opted for these components because they possess performance characteristics and economies of scale which are in many respects superior to steel components. Given this accrued experience, it is unsurprising that several marine renewable energy (MRE) device developers have utilised synthetic ropes, motivated by the need to specify economical, reliable and durable <b>mooring</b> <b>systems.</b> Whilst these components are potentially an enabling technology for the MRE sector, this is a new field of application which can feature highly dynamic mooring tensions and consequently existing certification practices may not be directly applicable. Based on the expertise of the authors, this paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of synthetic ropes in the context of MRE <b>mooring</b> <b>systems,</b> including key information about aspects of specification (performance attributes, classification and testing) as well as application (installation, degradation, maintenance, inspection and decommissioning).

40|$|As {{the main}} source of {{resonant}} excitations to most offshore <b>moored</b> <b>systems</b> like floating LNG terminals, the low-frequency wave loading is the critical input to motion simulations which are important for the design. Further to the analysis presented by Chen & Duan (2007) on the quadratic transfer function (QTF) of low-frequency wave loading, new developments including numerical results of different components of QTF are presented here. Furthermore, the time-series reconstruction of excitation loads in the motion simulation of <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> is analyzed and a new efficient and accurate scheme is demonstrated. 1. Formulations of QTF and its approximations The quadratic transfer function (QTF) of low-frequency wave loads F(ω 1, ω 2) is composed of two distinct parts: one dependent only on the quadratic products of first-order wave fields and another contributed by the second-order incoming and diffraction potentials. F(ω 1, ω 2) = Fq(ω 1, ω 2) + Fp(ω 1, ω 2) (1) Since the application of low-frequency QTF concerns generally the computation of excitation loading to a <b>moored</b> <b>system</b> whose resonant frequencies are often less than 0. 05 rad/s while wave frequencies ω are generally larger than 0. 30 rad/s, the dynamic behavior of <b>mooring</b> <b>systems</b> is sensitive only to the low-frequency QTF at small values of (ω 1 −ω 2). In Chen & Duan (2007), it is denoted that ∆ω = ω 1 −ω 2 and ω = (ω 1 +ω 2) / 2 then (ω 1, ω 2) = (ω+∆ω/ 2, ω−∆ω/ 2) (2) By assuming ∆ω ≪ 1, the quadratic transfer function (QTF) is developed as an expansion: F(ω 1, ω 2) = F 0 (ω, ω) + ∆ωF 1 (ω, ω) +O[(∆ω) 2] (3) with the zeroth-order term contributed by the quadratic products of first-order wave fields and formulated...|$|R
