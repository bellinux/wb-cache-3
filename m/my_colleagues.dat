5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I {{want you to know}} how much <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E
25|$|I {{pledge to}} walk in the shoes of <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> and refrain from name-calling or the {{questioning}} of character. It is easy to quickly sink to the lowest form of political debate. Harsh words often lead to headlines, but walking this path is not a victimless crime. This great House pays the price.|$|E
25|$|I saw the Curtiss planes {{approximately}} 300 meters {{below us}} and falling away below. These aircraft were {{no threat to}} us whatsoever! Now I just wanted to level out of my turning bank, since <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> were already at a substantially higher altitude. Keppler (his wingman), overshot me. Once again, I saw the Curtiss planes 300 meters directly below me and counted eleven aircraft.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear heart," [...] said I, [...] "isn't this enough? You're <b>my</b> councillor, <b>my</b> <b>colleague,</b> <b>my</b> right hand, {{the secret}} soul of my life--" ...|$|R
60|$|WHEN I {{arrived at}} <b>my</b> rooms, <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> hurried {{to meet me}} the moment I opened the door.|$|R
30|$|I’d like {{to express}} my {{gratitude}} to Dr. Wang and <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> Dr. Dvoyan for attention towards my research.|$|R
25|$|I'd like {{to thank}} {{everybody}} who voted for me and express my gratitude to all <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> at Sky Sports. This award is as much for them as myself and reflects our approach to football. My job has also been made easier by the thousands of individuals within the game who've answered my daily requests for information with the attention and care that make this job so enjoyable.|$|E
25|$|When I {{served as}} {{director}} of the Leipzig Bach Archive from 2001 to 2013, I and <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> there extensively refuted the basic premises of the thesis, on grounds of documents, manuscript sources, and musical grounds. There is not a shred of evidence, but Jarvis doesn’t give up despite the fact that several years ago, at a Bach conference in Oxford, a room full of serious Bach scholars gave him an embarrassing showdown.|$|E
25|$|<b>My</b> <b>colleagues</b> in the Government {{join with}} me in expressing to you our sense of the world's loss {{in the death of}} your {{distinguished}} husband. It will ever be a source of pride to our country that the great invention, with which his name is immortally associated, is a part of its history. On the behalf of the citizens of Canada, may I extend to you an expression of our combined gratitude and sympathy.|$|E

6000|$|Lestrade {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "I {{am afraid that}} <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> {{has been a little}} quick in forming his conclusions," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} expected, indeed, to {{have had}} the pleasure of seeing <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> here," [...] he added with quiet suavity, turning to the Alcalde.|$|R
25|$|Noten's design I Am Being Nice to <b>My</b> <b>Colleagues</b> (2001) {{consists}} of an A4 silver plate that is blank except for two indented concentric circles. This first ring is ready to wear. When the buyer wishes {{to have a new}} ring made, they can commission another designer to create another ring from the plate. Eventually only the silhouettes of previous rings will be left. Noten invites other designers to share his concept and create their own work within the concept's parameters.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} six months, {{as chair of the}} Co-operative Commission, I have been hearing {{evidence}} from organisations and individuals {{with a wide range of}} views on the direction that the movement should take. <b>My</b> <b>colleagues</b> and I have been impressed by many things: first and foremost, the goodwill towards the co-operative movement that is to be found in many, many places. There is also a willingness to embrace change and an awareness that no change is not an option.|$|E
25|$|Hughes vehemently opposed Japan's racial {{equality}} proposition. Hughes recognised {{that such a}} clause would {{be a threat to}} White Australia and made it clear to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted. When the proposal failed, Hughes reported in the Australian parliament:The White Australia is yours. You may do with it what you please, but at any rate, the soldiers have achieved the victory and <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> and I have brought that great principle back to you from the conference, as safe as it was on the day when it was first adopted.|$|E
30|$|I {{gathered}} {{data from}} various sources, including pre- and post-interviews, audiotape recordings of lessons, students’ LPs and reflections, {{and my own}} and <b>my</b> <b>colleague’s</b> reflections after teaching.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>colleague</b> {{read the}} paper, {{and handed it}} back to me without making any remark. I asked if he {{suspected}} the Prisoner of feigning conversion to please the Minister.|$|R
2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, {{he stated that}} [...] "Saddam is <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> and comrade for decades, and Barzan is my brother and my friend {{and he is not}} {{responsible}} for Dujail's events." ...|$|R
25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to <b>my</b> <b>colleagues,</b> would be a travesty.|$|E
500|$|When asked {{towards the}} end of his career whether he had been stung by the {{criticism}} he had received, Stevenson replied [...] "A lot of <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> are just constipated Methodists". There was no compulsory retirement age for a judge with Stevenson's length of service, which resulted in some speculation following the announcement of his retirement from the bench in 1979 that perhaps his unpopularity with certain sections of the media and establishment had led to pressure on him to step down.|$|E
500|$|On September 15, 2008, it was {{disclosed}} that: (a) Rangel had {{omitted from}} his financial reports details regarding his {{sale of a}} Washington, DC home; (b) discrepancies existed in the values he listed for a property he owns in Sunny Isles, Florida (varying from $50,000 to $500,000); and (c) inconsistencies appeared in his investment fund reporting. [...] He apologized, saying [...] "I owed <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> and the public adherence {{to a higher standard}} of care, not only as a member of Congress, but even more as the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee." [...] Republicans called for his removal as chair. [...] Rangel said there was no justification for that, as the mistakes were errors of omission, that would not justify loss of his position.|$|E
40|$|I have a {{colleague}} in the Department of Journalism who speaks {{about his work}} {{with a degree of}} passion that one usually doesn‘t hear in academic circles. An expert on Central Asian reporters. he covers reporters and editors working – or trying to work [...] in these authoritarian countries that were once part of the Soviet Union. <b>My</b> <b>colleague‘s</b> department head lauds his dedication and expertise. He gathers information with such consummate skill, she advises, that central Asian reporters risk being quoted in his articles. Asked why he writes about the problems journalists face in these countries, <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> talks about journalism, freedom of speech, and democracy. His voice resonates with fervor. ―Those countries are undemocratic,‖ he proclaims. ―There can be no democracy without a free press. I write about the problems these reporters and editors face…because they have to be free for us to be free. ‖ (<b>My</b> <b>colleague</b> does not discuss how notions of freedom of expression vary from one media system to another; to him, this freedom is an absolute right. ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{the game}} was 2-2, <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> Fawzi took the ball from the centre and dribbled past all the Hungarian players to score a third goal. But the referee {{cancelled}} the goal as an offside!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. <b>My</b> <b>colleague,</b> citizen Heron, has {{arranged}} for an escort of twenty men picked {{from the best}} regiment of the Garde de Paris to accompany us--yourself, him and me--to wherever you will direct us. Is that clear?" ...|$|R
500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
500|$|On 26 April, {{two days}} before [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] was due to air, the British {{government}} intervened to prevent its broadcast. Howe telephoned Lord Thomson, chair of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), to request he force the postponement of the broadcast {{on the grounds that}} Howe feared the documentary might prejudice the coroner's inquest. Thomson personally viewed [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before making the final decision to permit its broadcast, with two alterations to the commentary. He later wrote that, [...] "paradoxically", the decision [...] "was not a difficult one. <b>My</b> <b>colleagues</b> and I saw no reason why the IBA should prevent Thames' journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings, provided that the criminal record of the terrorists and the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction". With a slightly altered rationale—that the documentary could contaminate witness evidence at the inquest—Howe again attempted to prevent the programme's broadcast on the day it was due to be shown; after taking further legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to permit the showing of [...] "Death on the Rock".|$|E
500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – even though there are days when I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards <b>my</b> <b>colleagues</b> that they should think of doing this".|$|E
60|$|I {{could have}} {{answered}} this also, if our discussion {{had not been}} interrupted at the moment. The Doctor came into the library {{in search of a}} book. When he had left us, <b>my</b> <b>colleague's</b> strong prejudice against him instantly declared itself.|$|R
60|$|Having got a {{thorough}} insight {{myself into the}} governing principles of the system under which I had been chosen to serve, I went to look up <b>my</b> <b>colleague,</b> Captain Poke, in order to ascertain how he understood the great Leaplow Allegory.|$|R
40|$|<b>My</b> <b>colleague</b> and I {{came to a}} centre {{for rights}} {{protection}} {{of children and adolescents}} in a city in Northern Russia. It was a winter day with snow all over. In an open space between the houses, just before the entrance to the centre building, we met two eight or nine-year-old girls, skiing. They were smoking cigarettes. <b>My</b> <b>colleague,</b> who is a Russian, said as a joke: “Don’t you know when you smoke a second head will grow on your shoulders?” The answer came right-away: “I don’t care!” This little conversation in Russian was our introduction to a series of meetings with different spokespersons working at arenas with influence on child and adolescent welfare in the region...|$|R

5000|$|... "We were {{in total}} {{darkness}} for about 15 minutes...Suddenly we glimpsed wonderful reliefs and were extremely startled to {{find ourselves in}} the antechamber leading to a burial chamber. <b>My</b> <b>colleague</b> looked across at an inscribed wall and said, My God, its Maya." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if {{you killed}} me now, Sir Percy," [...] {{he said quietly}} and looking the man whom he so hated fully in the eyes, [...] "you could not destroy that letter which <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> is taking to Paris at this very moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is, your Grace," [...] said he, [...] "that <b>my</b> <b>colleague,</b> Dr. Watson, {{and myself}} had an {{assurance}} from Dr. Huxtable that a reward {{had been offered}} in this case. I should like to have this confirmed from your own lips." ...|$|R
