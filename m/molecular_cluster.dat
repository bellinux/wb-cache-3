Unlike [...] "high temperature dual injection" [...] methods of QD synthesis, the molecular seeding method circumvents {{the need for a}} high temperature injection step by utilising molecules of a <b>molecular</b> <b>cluster</b> compound to act as nucleation sites for nanoparticle growth. To maintain particle growth, further precursor additions are made at moderate temperatures until the desired QD size is reached. The process can easily be scaled to large volumes, and is used to produce Nanoco’s CFQD® heavy metal-free quantum dots.|$|E
50|$|The bonding {{in certain}} cadmium-free quantum dots, such as III-V-based quantum dots, is more {{covalent}} {{than that in}} II-VI materials, therefore {{it is more difficult}} to separate nanoparticle nucleation and growth via a high temperature dual injection synthesis. An alternative method of quantum dot synthesis, the “molecular seeding” process, provides a reproducible route to the production of high quality quantum dots in large volumes. The process utilises identical molecules of a <b>molecular</b> <b>cluster</b> compound as the nucleation sites for nanoparticle growth, thus avoiding the need for a high temperature injection step. Particle growth is maintained by the periodic addition of precursors at moderate temperatures until the desired particle size is reached. The molecular seeding process {{is not limited to the}} production of cadmium-free quantum dots; for example, the process can be used to synthesise kilogram batches of high quality II-VI quantum dots in just a few hours.|$|E
50|$|Photodissociation is a {{chemical}} reaction in which {{a chemical}} compound is broken down by photons. It {{is defined as the}} interaction of one or more photons with one target molecule. Any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound, such as visible light, ultraviolet light, x-rays and gamma rays. The technique of probing chemical reactions has been successfully applied to unimolecular dissociations. The possibility of using a femtosecond technique to study bimolecular reactions at the individual collision level is complicated by the difficulties of spatial and temporal synchronization. One way to overcome this problem is through the use of Van der Waals complexes of weakly bound <b>molecular</b> <b>cluster.</b> Femtosecond techniques are not limited to the observation of the chemical reactions, but can even exploited to influence the course of the reaction. This can open new relaxation channels or increase the yield of certain reaction products.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: TEM {{pictures}} {{that were taken}} at different polymerization times during the formation process of the in-tramolecularly cross-linked macromolecule (ICM) indicate that ICM growth undergoes three stages. At the first stage, monomers (i. e. prepolymers) react {{with each other to}} form small coils, called “dot molecules ” (DM), which are shown as small black dots in TEM pictures. At the second phase, the reaction of functional groups on the surface of DMs produces globular intramolecularly cross-linked macromolecules which are called pre-ICMs. At the third stages, the globular pre-ICMs react with each other to form ICMs. As soon as DMs formed, they aggregate into <b>molecular</b> <b>cluster.</b> DMs are re-stricted within the <b>molecular</b> <b>cluster.</b> This state of aggregation is beneficial to reaction between DMs, since a higher fre-quency of collision can occur in the <b>molecular</b> <b>cluster.</b> In fact, the <b>molecular</b> <b>cluster</b> is the key polymerization site in the controllable cross-linking polymerization system...|$|E

New particle formation (NPF) is the critical initial step of SA formation. New particles are commonly formed from gas-phase precursors (e. g., SO 2, volatile organic compounds) via nucleation and initial growth, in which <b>molecular</b> <b>clusters</b> with a mobility diameter smaller than 3  nm (hereafter referred to nanoscale <b>molecular</b> <b>clusters)</b> will be involved throughout the whole process.

Instruments {{for the detection of}} sub- 3 nm aerosols and clusters exist and need to be carefully calibrated and characterized. So far calibrations and laboratory tests have been carried out using mainly electrically charged aerosols, as they are easier to handle experimentally. However, the charging state of the cluster is an important variable to take into account. Furthermore, instrument characterization performed with charged aerosols could be biased, preventing a correct interpretation of data when electrically neutral sub- 3 nm aerosols are involved.

CBMC simulations for adsorption of quaternary water/methanol/ethanol/benzene mixtures show that water can be selectively adsorbed at pore saturation, making CuBTC effective in drying applications. Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) calculations anticipate the right hierarchy of component loadings but the quantitative agreement with CBMC mixture simulations is poor for all investigated mixtures. The failure of the IAST to provide reasonable quantitative predictions of mixture adsorption is attributable to <b>molecular</b> <b>clustering</b> effects that are induced by hydrogen bonding between water-water, methanol-methanol, and ethanol-ethanol molecule pairs.
