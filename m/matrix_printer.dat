25|$|The first dot-matrix {{printers}} {{were invented}} in Japan. In 1968, Japanese manufacturer Epson released the EP-101, the world's first dot-matrix printer. The same year, Japanese manufacturer OKI introduced the first serial impact dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> (SIDM), the OKI Wiredot.|$|E
25|$|The {{initializing}} {{codes for}} each model of printer {{had to be}} written into the application. To use a program such as Wordstar with more than one printer (say, a fast dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> or a slower but presentation-quality daisy wheel printer), a separate version of Wordstar had to be prepared, and one had to load the Wordstar version that corresponded to the printer selected (and exiting and reloading to change printers).|$|E
5000|$|Often {{considered}} the [...] "backbone" [...] of many industrial and back-office systems, {{there are several}} types of line <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> used today across diverse enterprise production environments including: manufacturing, supply chain, distribution & logistics, transportation, finance and banking. Dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> also known also as impact printers, represent the oldest printing technology, are still widely used today, due to its lowest 'cost per page' ratio. Dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> are divided on two main groups: serial dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> and line <b>matrix</b> [...] <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{printing}} {{speed of}} serial dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> with moving heads varies from 30 to 1550 cps. In contrast to this, line <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> {{are capable of}} printing much more than 1000 cps, resulting in a throughput of up to 800 pages/hour.|$|R
50|$|Line <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> {{are used}} for {{high-speed}} printing applications in industries such as manufacturing, banking, supply chain and back office environments. In these high-volume printing industries, line <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> are used to produce invoices, bank statements, product shipment and transportation documentation as well as product compliance labels.|$|R

2500|$|Strong Bad Emails (also {{known as}} [...] "sbemails") are {{arguably the most}} popular and {{prolific}} series, featuring Strong Bad answering emails from fans. Since starting in August 2001, the initially brief episodes have grown in length and scope, introducing numerous spin-offs, characters, and inside jokes, such as Homsar, Trogdor, Senor Cardgage, 20X6, the Teen Girl Squad shorts, and Homestar Runner Emails (also known as [...] "hremails"). The format, however, has remained largely unchanged. Each episode typically begins with Strong Bad singing a short song to himself while booting up his computer to check fan emails. Starting a reply, he typically mocks the sender's name, spelling, and grammar, and rarely answers questions directly. While early episodes focused mostly on Strong Bad sitting at the computer with occasional cutaways, over time, the cutaways would become more elaborate, allowing for more complex story lines to develop, growing tangentially from the initial email. Each episode closes with Strong Bad finishing his reply, closing the episode with a link to email Strong Bad appearing via [...] "The Paper", a dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> {{at the top of the}} screen. In later episodes, it is replaced with the [...] "New Paper", an inkjet printer, then with the [...] "Compé-per", a pop-up balloon, and finally with a CGI version of the original Paper, which instead promotes Strong Bad's Twitter account. Episodes will often feature extra jokes and sequences as Easter eggs, accessible only by clicking certain objects on the screen during the cartoon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{built-in}} display was a one-bit black-and-white, [...] CRT with a fixed {{resolution of}} 512×342 pixels, establishing the desktop publishing standard of 72 PPI. Expansion and networking were achieved using two non-standard RS-422 DE-9 serial ports named [...] "printer" [...] and [...] "modem"; {{they did not}} support hardware handshaking. An external floppy disk drive could be added using a proprietary connector (19-pin D-sub). The keyboard and mouse used simple proprietary protocols, allowing some third-party upgrades. The original keyboard had no arrow keys, numeric keypad or function keys. This was an intentional decision by Apple, as these keys were common on older platforms and {{it was thought that}} the addition of these keys would encourage software developers to simply port their existing applications to the Mac, rather than design new ones around the GUI paradigm. Later, Apple would make a numeric keypad available for the Macintosh 128K. The keyboard sold with the newer Macintosh Plus model would include the numeric keypad and arrow keys, but still no function keys. As with the Apple Lisa before it, the mouse had a single button. Standard headphones could also be connected to a monaural jack. Apple also offered their 300 and 1200bit/s modems originally released for the Apple II line. Initially, the only printer available was the Apple ImageWriter, a dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> which was designed to produce 144dpi WYSIWYG output from the Mac's 72dpi screen. Eventually, the LaserWriter and other printers were capable of being connected using AppleTalk, Apple's built-in networking system.|$|E
50|$|A line <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> is a {{computer}} printer that is a compromise between a line printer and a dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printer.</b> Basically, it prints a page-wide line of dots. It builds up a line of text by printing lines of dots.|$|E

50|$|PCL 3 was {{introduced}} in 1984 with the original HP LaserJet. This added support for bitmap fonts and increased the maximum resolution to 300 dpi. Other products with PCL 3 support were the HP DeskJet ink jet printer, HP 2932 series <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> and HP RuggedWriter 2235 <b>matrix</b> <b>printers.</b> PCL 3 is still in use on several impact printers which replaced the obsolete HP models.|$|R
50|$|This {{changed to}} some degree with the {{increasing}} popularity of dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers.</b> The characters on these systems were drawn {{as a series of}} dots, as defined by a font table inside the printer.

50|$|ESC/P, {{short for}} Epson Standard Code for Printers and {{sometimes}} styled Escape/P, is a printer control language developed by Epson to control computer printers. It was mainly used in dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> and some inkjet printers, {{and is still}} widely used in many receipt printers. During the era of dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> it was also used by other manufacturers (e.g., NEC), sometimes in modified form. At the time, it was a popular mechanism to add formatting to printed text, and was widely supported in software.|$|R

5000|$|Both line matrix and serial dot <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> use pins {{to strike}} against the inked ribbon, making dots {{on the paper}} and forming the desired [...] characters. The {{differences}} are that line <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> use a hammer bank (or print-shuttle) instead of print head, this print-shuttle has hammers instead of print wires, and these hammers are arranged in a horizontal row instead in vertical column. The hammer bank uses the same technology as the permanent magnet print head with the small difference that instead of print wires the print-shuttle has hammers.|$|R
