5|$|However, Wilson defends House when House's {{career is}} in jeopardy, after billionaire {{entrepreneur}} and then chairman of Princeton-Plainsboro's Board Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) proposes a motion for House's dismissal. Wilson {{is the only}} one to vote against the motion. In response, Vogler proposes and succeeds in obtaining Wilson's dismissal, but Wilson is soon reinstated thanks to Cuddy after she convinces the board that Vogler is the real threat to the hospital and his <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> worth his business-obsessed mindset. In a late Season episode it is revealed that Wilson suffers from clinical depression and takes medication. Wilson is also seen to write with his left hand, a trait he shares with Cuddy and Foreman, but when he performs detailed medical work, such as injections or incisions, or gesticulates while speaking, appears to be right-handed in general, suggesting he may be ambidextrous.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

25|$|The islanders {{want the}} top soil removed, but the <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{there for the}} cleanup. The {{opportunity}} for some Bikini islanders to potentially relocate back to their home island creates a dilemma. While the island may be habitable in the near term, {{virtually all of the}} islanders alive today have never lived there. Most of the younger generation have never visited. , unemployment in the Marshall Islands was at about 40 percent. The population is growing at a four-percent growth rate, so increasing numbers are taking advantage of terms in the Marshall Islands’ Compact of Free Association that allow them to obtain jobs in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} put new {{requirements on}} the employers, demanding that they deposit a sum of 1,500,000 LBP (1000 $) {{in the housing}} bank as a prerequisite to get authorization of employment. The housing bank is a government bank and the deposit {{is to ensure that}} the employer pays taxes and covers the airline tickers; should the domestic worker go home. The problem with these requirements is that the <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> used to fulfill its purpose of covering airline tickets when it is needed. The Lebanese government has as well been ineffective with implementing the migration workers ban from entering into Lebanon from the country of Nepal, the Lebanese government simply kept issuing pre-approved work permits and visas.|$|E

25|$|Returning {{to their}} suite, {{they find the}} boxer Mike Tyson, who orders the trio to return the tiger to his mansion immediately. Stu drugs the tiger with the {{remaining}} Rohypnol, and they drive towards Tyson's home in the Mercedes-Benz. However, the tiger awakens midway and attacks them, clawing Phil on the neck and damaging the car's interior. After pushing the car {{the rest of the}} way to the mansion, Tyson shows the trio footage of them at his house to help them locate Doug. While driving, their car is intentionally t-boned by a 2009 Cadillac Escalade. The passengers are revealed to be the gangsters from the chapel, and their boss Chow. Chow accuses the trio of kidnapping him and stealing $80,000 that was in his purse. As the trio denies this, Chow tells them he has Doug, and threatens to kill him if his <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> returned. Unable to find Chow's $80,000, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of card counting to win $82,400 playing Blackjack.|$|E
500|$|The title Allah jang Palsoe is a {{reference}} to money, with an underlying didactic message that <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> everything in the world, and that an unquenchable thirst for it would turn one into [...] "a money animal". Throughout the dialogue, money {{is referred to as}} the false God, with Lie as a character who deifies money to the point of ignoring his other duties and only realising his error after it is too late. Gie, although he does become rich, does not consider money a god, but is a philanthropist and holds to his morals. The Indonesian literary critic Sapardi Djoko Damono writes that such a message would have been popular among ethnic Chinese of the contemporary Indies, and as such the play would have been a favourite of social organisations.|$|E
500|$|One day, a shocked Lalita, who is {{employed}} at the Roy’s office, remembers a hotel project from Gurcharan’s ancestral haveli (palatial house). On an earlier occasion, Gurcharan had borrowed money from Naveen Roy after putting his haveli on mortgage. She understands {{that if the}} <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> repaid in a few months, Naveen Roy would take over the property. She immediately thinks of asking Shekhar for monetary help. Unforeseen circumstances prevent this, and Girish, upon realising this, alleviates their problem by making Gurcharan his business partner. Gurcharan repays the debt and the turn of events prompts Shekhar to think why Lalita chose to ask Girish for money instead of him. On one auspicious night, Shekhar and Lalita exchange garlands and consummate their [...] "marriage" [...] unbeknownst to anyone else.|$|E

500|$|Charles finally escaped Scotland in the French frigate L'Heureux {{and arrived}} back in France in September 1746. However, {{the fate of}} the <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as clear. Cluny is {{believed}} to have retained control of it, and during his long years as a fugitive was at the centre of various futile plots to finance another uprising. Indeed, he remained in hiding in his Highland [...] "cage" [...] for the next eight years. Meanwhile, a cash-strapped Charles was constantly looking for his money and at least some of it came to him later, paying for the minting of a campaign medal in the 1750s. However, it is said that all of the gold was never recovered. Charles, years later, accused Cluny of embezzlement. Whatever the case, the gold became a source of discord and grievance among the surviving Jacobites.|$|E
500|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a method by which a {{creditor}} can hold a security interest in loans, through inserting a clause into the contract which limits the purposes for which the borrower can use the money. If the funds are used for a different purpose, a trust is created around {{the money for the}} benefit of the moneylender. This allows the moneylender to trace any inappropriately spent funds, and, in the case of the borrower's insolvency, prevents the money from being taken by creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd, in which Lord Wilberforce maintained that in Quistclose situations, the intention must be to create a secondary trust {{for the benefit of the}} moneylender, arising if the [...] "primary trust" [...] (the appropriate use of the <b>money)</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fulfilled. The idea of a primary and secondary trust comes from Toovey v Milne, where money was lent by A to B, to pay off his debts. When B went bankrupt and returned the money to A, the courts held that the creditors could not recover this money, as it was held in a form comparable to a trust. Most situations in which a trust will arise require that a specific use of the money is identified by the contract.|$|E

2500|$|Outlining {{the scale}} of the problem, Duncan Smith said almost five million people were on {{unemployment}} benefits, 1.4million of whom had been receiving support for nine or more of the last 10 years.
