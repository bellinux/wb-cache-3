40|$|Plate {{subduction}} and mantle plumes {{are two of}} {{the most}} important material transport processes of the silicate Earth. Currently, a debate exists over whether the subducted oceanic crust is recycled back to the Earth's surface through mantle plumes, and can explain their derivation and major characteristics. It is also puzzling as to why plume heads have huge <b>melting</b> <b>capacities</b> and differ dramatically from plume tails both in size and chemical composition. We present data showing that both ocean island basalt and mid-ocean ridge basalt have identical supra-primitive mantle mean Nb/U values of 46. 7, significantly larger than that of the primitive mantle value. From a mass balance calculation based on Nb/U we have determined that nearly the whole mantle has evolved by plate subduction-induced crustal recycling during formation of the continental crust. This mixing back of subducted oceanic crust, however, is not straightforward, because it generally would be denser than the surrounding mantle, both in solid and liquid states. A mineral segregation model is proposed here to reconcile different lines of observation. First of all, subducted oceanic crustal sections are denser than the surrounding mantle, such that they can stay in the lower mantle, for billions of years as implied by isotopic data. Parts of subducted oceanic crust may eventually lose a large proportion of their heavy minerals, magnesian-silicate-perovskite and calcium-silicate-perovskite, through density segregation in ultra-low-velocity zones as well as in very-low-velocity provinces at the core-mantle boundary due to low viscosity. The remaining minerals would thus become lighter than the surrounding mantle, and could rise, trapping mantle materials, and forming mantle plumes. Mineral segregation progressively increases the SiO 2 content of the ascending oceanic crust, which enhances flux melting, and results in giant Si-enriched plume heads followed by dramatically abridged plume tails. Therefore, ancient mineral-segregated subducted oceanic crust {{is likely to be a}} major trigger and driving force for the formation of mantle plumes...|$|R

Many products are available for use in highway and bridge deicing and new products are introduced each year. The objectives of this research are to develop a laboratory test to evaluate the performance of chemical deicers, to investigate national, state, and local standards, and to develop best maintenance practices to optimize the use of chemical deicers. This research project consists of two phases: Phase 1 : conduct a literature survey to find data from existing laboratory tests used to evaluate deicer performance. Phase 2 : develop a laboratory test to evaluate the performance of chemical deicers and correlate the results with field data from roadway maintenance. Use the data from the laboratory, the field, and the literature survey to develop a summary of the best use of chemical deicers. ﻿The laboratory tests were developed by obtaining samples of sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium acetate, and beet juice based chemical deicers for evaluation. Two of the magnesium chloride based deicers were made from byproducts of the ethanol industry. The deicers were tested for ice melting performance, resulting pavement friction, the effect from direct sunlight, and the time to refreeze after application. The field data was collected by the Nebraska Department of Roads using Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems installed on plow trucks in concert with the Maintenance Decision Support System (MDSS). The MDSS is a computerized system that collects weather data from area weather stations and gives maintenance crews recommended application rates for different weather events.

Up to 100 percent increase in throughput is possible in the high RPM range (in comparison with a much longer traditional compression screw), provided that the feed capacity is sufficient. This usually requires the use of a grooved, well-cooled, feed section; the capacity of such a feed section depends, for a given screw geometry, on channel depth and granule dimensions. The melt leaves the melting section at a relatively low temperature. The melting section only melts the material and does not raise its temperature unnecessarily.

We examined complexes of Klenow fragment with DNAs containing various base mismatches. Single mismatches at the primer terminus caused a 3 - to 4 -fold increase in the equilibrium partitioning of DNA into the exonuclease site; the largest effects were observed for purine-purine mismatches. Two or more consecutive G.

Internal single mismatches produced larger effects than the same mismatch at the primer terminus, with a delta delta G relative to the matched sequence of - 1. 1 to - 1. 3 kcal/mol for mismatches located 2, 3, or 4 bases from the primer terminus. Although part of the observed effects may be attributed to the increased <b>melting</b> <b>capacity</b> of the DNA, it appears that the polymerase site also promotes movement of DNA into the exonuclease site by rejecting aberrant primer termini.

This master thesis is focused on the melting of ice below 0 &# 176;C with use of salt (the de-icing process). The use of dissolved salt (Sodium Chloride) is considered only, and the melting process that takes place in an adiabatic system. The increased understanding of the physics of ice melting will hopefully contribute into optimizing de-icing operations. The thermodynamics of ice melting by salt has been studied by developing a calculation model, which can be used to predict the final temperature of an &# 147;ice-salt solution&# 148; system and the amount of melted ice, for a given salt solution. Five solutions with different salt concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20 and 23 w%) have been experimentally tested to determine the temperature change inside the reactor caused by adding of a certain amount of ice to the solution. The calculated and experimentally determined values of final temperature (T_f) have been further compared to identify the discrepancy in obtained results and to which extent the developed model is theoretically applicable. The comparison between the model and experiments has shown that the model was able to predict the final temperature of the &# 147;ice-salt solution&# 148; system with high precision throughout the investigated temperature range between - 16 &# 176;C and 0 &# 176;C.

40|$|The use of {{chemicals}} is {{a critical part of}} a pro-active winter maintenance program. However, ensuring that the correct chemicals are used is a challenge. On the one hand, budgets are limited, and thus price {{of chemicals}} is a major concern. On the other, performance of chemicals, especially at lower pavement temperatures, is not always assured. Two chemicals that are used extensively by the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) are sodium chloride (or salt) and calcium chloride. While calcium chloride can be effective at much lower temperatures than salt, it is also considerably more expensive. Costs for a gallon of salt brine are typically in the range of 0. 05 to 0. 10, whereas calcium chloride brine may cost in the range of 1. 00 or more per gallon. These costs are of course subject to market forces and will thus change from year to year. The idea of mixing different winter maintenance chemicals is by no means new, and in general discussions it appears that many winter maintenance personnel have from time to time mixed up a jar of chemicals and done some work around the yard {{to see whether or not}} their new mix “works. ” There are many stories about the mixture turning to “mayonnaise” (or, more colorfully, to “snot”) suggesting that mixing chemicals may give rise to some problems most likely due to precipitation. Further, the question of what constitutes a mixture “working” in this context is a topic of considerable discussion. In this study, mixtures of salt brine and calcium chloride brine were examined to determine their ice melting capability and their freezing point. Using the results from these tests, a linear interpolation model of the ice melting capability of mixtures of the two brines has been developed. Using a criterion based upon the ability of the mixture to melt a certain thickness of ice or snow (expressed as a thickness of melt-water equivalent), the model was extended to develop a material cost per lane mile for the full range of possible mixtures as a function of temperature. This allowed for a comparison of the performance of the various mixtures. From the point of view of <b>melting</b> <b>capacity,</b> mixing calcium chloride brine with salt brine appears to be effective only at very low temperatures (around 0 ° F and below). However, the approach described herein only considers the material costs, and does not consider application costs or other aspects of the mixture performance than <b>melting</b> <b>capacity.</b> While a unit quantity of calcium chloride is considerably more expensive than a unit quantity of sodium chloride, it also melts considerably more ice. In other words, to achieve the same result, much less calcium chloride brine is required than sodium chloride brine. This is important in considering application costs, because it means that a single application vehicle (for example, a brine dispensing trailer towed behind a snowplow) can cover many more lane miles with calcium chloride brine than with salt brine before needing to refill. Calculating exactly how much could be saved in application costs requires an optimization of routes used in the application of liquids in anti-icing, which is beyond the scope of the current study. However, this may be an area that agencies wish to pursue for future investigation. In discussion with winter maintenance personnel who use mixtures of sodium chloride and calcium chloride, it is evident that one reason for this is because the mixture is much more persistent (i. e. it stays longer on the road surface) than straight salt brine. Operationally this persistence is very valuable, but at present there are not any established methods to measure the persistence of a chemical on a pavement. In conclusion, the study presents a method that allows an agency to determine the material costs of using various mixtures of salt brine and calcium chloride brine. The method is based upon the requirement of melting a certain quantity of snow or ice at the ice-pavement interface, and on how much of a chemical or of a mixture of chemicals is required to do that...|$|E
40|$|The first-melting {{temperature}} of haplogranite {{in the presence}} of H 2 O-NaCl-KCl solutions was determined experimentally at deep-crustal conditions of 6 - 14 kbar and 700 - 900 °C. Minimum melting occurs at fluid K/(K+Na) of 0. 2 - 0. 25. Melting temperature rises strongly with increasing salinity: at 10 kbar, first melting occurs at 800 °C with a H 2 O mole fraction (XH 2 O) of 0. 62 ± 0. 02, similar to the salinity of fluid inclusions in minerals of some granites and migmatites. At 900 °C and 10 kbar, XH 2 O is 0. 33 ± 0. 01 for first melting. All minimum melts are granitic over the entire P-T-XH 2 O range, with SiO 2 melt concentrations of 74 ± 2 wt% on a H 2 O-free basis and Al 2 O 3 and alkalis typical for granites. Normative quartz is near 30 % for all liquids. The K/(K+Na) ratios of minimum melts increase strongly with decreasing H 2 O activity: at 10 kbar and XH 2 O= 1, K/(K+Na) in the melt is 0. 25, whereas at XH 2 O= 0. 34 it is 0. 55. This "brine trend" is similar to, but more pronounced than, the trend described by decreasing H 2 O activity in H 2 O-CO 2 fluids, and it better explains the compositions of K-rich granites. Minimum-melting curves {{in the presence of}} brines of constant XH 2 O have strongly positive dP/dT slopes at P > 2 kbar, in contrast to vertical or negative dP/dT slopes for those in the presence of H 2 O-CO 2 fluid. There is therefore a wide P-T range over which migrating low-H 2 O-activity brines may generate subsolidus, deep-crustal metasomatism in the form of K 2 O and silica enrichment. Moreover, once melting occurs, rising accumulations of granitic magma may be fluid saturated and even increase their <b>melting</b> <b>capacity</b> with decreasing depth because of the strong pressure dependence of H 2 O activity in salt solutions. Our results offer an explanation for mid-crust migmatization and granite production: rising hot brines may provoke rock melting at some threshold of decreasing depth in the range 15 - 20 km. Because of their enhanced capacity for metasomatism, leading to eventual melting at granulite facies conditions of temperature, pressure and H 2 O activity, concentrated brines should be considered as possibly important agents in crustal evolution. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Living organisms {{must keep}} their DNA content intact {{to assure the}} {{integrity}} of their genomic information. DNA replication and DNA damage repair are the main efforts to accomplish this task. Hence, the failure of these mechanisms could lead to genomic instability and subsequently development of diseases such as cancers could occur. The DNA 2 enzyme was shown to have essential roles in DNA metabolism. In human cells DNA 2 was implicated in the completion of DNA replication and the repair of DNA double- strand breaks via the homologous recombination pathway. In addition, DNA 2 was shown to be important for telomeric and mitochondrial DNA maintenance as well as Okazaki fragment processing and cell cycle checkpoint activation in yeast cells. My PhD project started with the preparation of recombinant proteins that allowed biochemical investigations of their functions. I could purify human DNA 2 and its variants in an active state and in concentrations sufficient for our assays. Further I produced DNA 2 partners WRN and BLM helicases and various single-stranded DNA binding proteins such as the replication protein A (RPA). In my experiments, I could recapitulate DNA 2 ’s nuclease activity and its regulation by RPA. While {{in the absence of}} RPA DNA 2 degrades 3 ’ or 5 ’ terminated single-stranded DNA, the nuclease is restricted to degrade 5 ’ terminated DNA in the presence of RPA. I was able to describe the helicase activity of human DNA 2 nuclease- deficient mutant that had been a matter of contradiction in the field. We observed that the helicase activity of hDNA 2 is cryptic and it is masked by its nuclease activity. Studying DNA end resection processes, we found that DNA 2 functionally integrates with BLM and WRN helicases. We showed that the helicase activity of DNA 2 acts as a motor speeding up the degradation of ssDNA produced by its helicase partners WRN or BLM. We propose that the DNA 2 motor acts as a translocase on single-stranded DNA accelerating the degradation by the nuclease domain of hDNA 2. I also participated in several collaborative projects showing that DNA 2 cooperates with WRN/BLM in DNA end resection and the restart of reversed replication forks with WRN but not BLM in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we showed that RPA possesses double-stranded DNA <b>melting</b> <b>capacity</b> and characterized its dynamics at DNA forks...|$|E

The large and small microspheres were loaded with paraffin and cetyl alcohol PCMs, respectively, and coated with silica nanoparticles after sol-gel synthesis of trimethoxy(methyl) silane hydrolysate. The energy storing capacity of the form-stabilized PCM containing composite particles was monitored by differential scanning calorimetry. Accelerated thermal cycling tests were carried out to determine the thermal reliability of the microencapsulated PCMs. Paraffin and cetyl alcohol content of the microcapsules was 42. 9 % and 48. 9 %, respectively. The microcomposites with higher PCM content showed correspondingly higher latent heat storage <b>capacity</b> (<b>melting</b> and solidification enthalpies were 96. 1 J/g and 94. 7 J/g). However, there was low enthalpy change observed after 1000 thermal cycles of cetyl alcohol containing capsules, which indicated that its leakage from the microcomposites was not substantial...|$|R

The phase diagram data of the BaO-MgO, BaO-CaO, BaO-Al 2 O 3 and BaO-SiO 2 systems were evaluated and {{taken into account in}} the thermodynamic assessment in the present work. Associate model was employed to describe the liquid phase in the BaO-Al 2 O 3 and BaO-SiO 2 systems. Four sets of consistent thermo­dynamic parameters, which can explain most of the experimental data of the BaO-MgO, BaO-CaO, BaO-Al 2 O 3 and BaO-SiO 2 systems, were achieved. The calculated phase diagrams of BaO-MgO, BaO-CaO, BaO-Al 2 O 3 and BaO-SiO 2 systems were provided. By employing the optimized thermodynamic parameters, mixing of enthalpies of the liquid phase for the four systems and heat capacities for BaAl 2 O 4 and BaAl 12 O 19 were calculated and compared with the literature values...|$|R
40|$|In this diploma thesis, the {{possibilities}} to enhance the process production and energy efficiencyas well as the energy recovery potential of PFA 2 at Hydro-Sunndals&# 248;ra have been determined. To identify the potentials for energy recovery, it has been conducted energy balances. The resultsfrom the balances give {{an overview of the}} waste heat sources and their total energy content, togetherwith the temperatures at which they are available. The total energy in the waste heatsources for PFA 2 was found to be 17. 8 GWh/year. The largest waste heat sources were localisedin connection to the cooling agent of the casting ingot machine. Here disappears 12. 32 GWh/year through cooling water within a temperature range of 10 to 30 &# 176;C as well as convectionand radiation to surrounding. The cooling water section one was determined as the most promisingheat recovery potential with 7. 47 GWh/year. Furthermore the initialisation of liquid aluminiumalloy was revealed as a waste heat source with 5. 48 GWh/year. Here disappears 3. 34 GWh/year through the flue gas of the furnace within a temperature range of 288 to 1, 100 &# 176;C andcreates the most promising heat recovery potential at the furnace. The energy saving potential is divided into three groups: energy saving by existing equipment,optimising of equipment and waste heat recovery. Here energy saving by existing equipmentreveals 26. 4 MWh/year for an improved control quality of the melt temperature. The greatestpotential for energy saving by optimisation of the equipment was found to be 1. 98 GWh/year forthe implementation of regenerative burner. Furthermore effects an installation of a furnace pressurecontrol system 689. 14 MWh/year less energy consumption due to the avoided false air. Thegreatest energy saving potential for waste heat recovery was estimated to 1. 65 GWh/year for thepreheating of charged metals to 300 &# 176;C, instead of 20 &# 176;C. The preheating also leads to improvedsafety, because of the elimination of moist metal in the furnaces, and increases the process production,as a consequence of larger <b>melt</b> <b>capacity.</b> Furthermore, heat to power solutions revealedthe use of favourable electricity production by the generation of waste heat. Here the greatestgeneration potential was found to be in the flue gas from the furnace. A common Rankine cycle,with a direct heat recovery design and water as working fluid, was estimated with a recoverypotential of 1. 1 GWh/year. With the use of an organic Rankine cycle the potential can be recoveredto 489. 8 MWh/year for an indirect heat recovery design and pentane as working fluid. Thereare still some challenges associated with flue gas heat exchangers (dust) and operation of suchpower generation plants at alternating heat loads, but the technology is under rapid development. The waste heat generation potential for the casting ingot machine was determined with 411. 3 MWh/year for an ideal organic Rankine cycle heat recovery design, within a temperature rangeof 58 to 90 &# 176;C and R 134 a as working fluid. An alternative ideal organic flash cycle layout revealed 253. 4 MWh/year (&# 61544;expander = 0. 6) respectively 416. 5 MWh/year (&# 61544;expander = 0. 6), within atemperature range of 36 to 90 &# 176;C and butane as working fluid.
