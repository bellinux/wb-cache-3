[...] The ship will be used to expand operational envelopes that were not done by the previous deployment of USS Freedom to the region, particularly concerning the <b>mine</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> (MCM) package. Emphasis on MCM is based on periodic provocations made by North Korea, which has deployed sea mines around the peninsula that have sunk South Korean vessels in the past, so the Navy wants to test the MCM mission in and around the Korean peninsula. Another area of focus is to use the ship to provide [...] "non-traditional" [...] maritime lift for U.S. Marines due to constraints in the number of big deck amphibious vessels available to the 7th Fleet. [...] Operational trials made by [...] Freedom also showed the potential to improve vertical lift replenishment in shallow waters.

40|$|Unmanned {{underwater}} vehicles (UUV) {{are receiving}} increased attention for both {{military and civilian}} applications. For example, UUVs were deployed {{in the war against}} Iraq for <b>mine</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> missions and are becoming a necessary tool in the deep sea mining industry. If UUVs were able to dock while submerged, it would greatly increase their efficiency, as well as reduce the cost involved in their deployment and recovery. The ability to both operate and dock in a submerged state would also provide the UUV a degree of stealth. A future application where UUVs would prove a valuable asset is for harbor control where stealth is an essential quality. A submerged docking bay would enable the UUV to both upload completed mission data and download new mission objectives while recharging its batteries. To succeed in this endeavor, a control system capable of guiding the UUV safely into an underwater docking bay is required. This thesis describes the development of two different control algorithms, a fuzzy controller and a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). For simulation purposes, a 3 D model of a small UUV is generated using ADAMS/view software. Another model is generated i...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis develops (a) a mission-planning tool for a Navy <b>Mine</b> <b>Counter</b> <b>Measure</b> (MCM) force {{to find a}} minimum-risk route for a surface ship through a mapped minefield, and (b) a heuristic to identify a sequence of mines whose clearance (removal and/or deactivation) leads to a rapid reduction {{of the risk of}} a minimum-risk path. All modeling concepts reflect the requirements of the Republic of China Navy's MCM operations. The problem is formulated and solved as a shortest-path problem in a network. A grid of nodes, representing waypoints, is embedded in a representation of the operating area, while arcs are created to link waypoints. The risk function is defined in terms of the closest point of approach distance between each mine that falls within a maximum danger radius along a route. A complete planning tool is implemented using Excel and Visual Basic for Applications. A basic test scenario describes an operational area of 1, 000 by 3, 000 yards containing 30 mines; node spacing is 100 yards. The minimum-risk path is found in few seconds on a laptop computer, while a greedy "mine clearance list" is found in a few minutes. Republic of China (Taiwan) Navy author...|$|R

Four primary MCM missions were identified and statistically modeled in order to quantify and categorize critical functional characteristics that dictate success in an MCM mission. These modeled data were analyzed to determine the greatest contributing capability area.

40|$|Abstract—Mine-like object {{classification}} from sidescan sonar images {{is of great}} interest for <b>mine</b> <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> (MCM) operations. Because the shadow cast by an object is often the most distinct feature of a sidescan image, a standard procedure is to perform classification based on features extracted from the shadow. The classification can then be performed by extracting features from the shadow and comparing this to training data to determine the object. In this paper, a superellipse fitting ap-proach to classifying mine-like objects in sidescan sonar images is presented. Superellipses provide a compact and efficient way of representing different mine-like shapes. Through variation of a simple parameter of the superellipse function different shapes such as ellipses, rhomboids, and rectangles can be easily generated. This paper proposes a classification of the shape based directly on a parameter of the superellipse known as the squareness parameter. The first step in this procedure extracts the contour of the shadow given by an unsupervised Markovian segmentation algorithm. Afterwards, a superellipse is fitted by minimizing the Euclidean distance between points on the shadow contour and the superellipse. As the term being minimized is nonlinear, a closed-form solution is not available. Hence, {{the parameters of the}} superellipse are estimated by the Nelder–Mead simplex technique. The method was then applied to sidescan data to assess its ability to recover and classify objects. This resulted in a recovery rate of 70 % (34 of the 48 mine-like objects) and a classification rate of better than 80 % (39 of the 48 mine-like objects). Index Terms—Classification, mine-like objects, recovery, sidescan, sonar, superellipse fitting. I...|$|R
