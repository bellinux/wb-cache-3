The means <b>of</b> <b>mechanization</b> belongs to category of the one axle tool carrier and the zero turn mower. The aim {{of the study is}} practical comparison of the means <b>of</b> <b>mechanization</b> and their suitability for different grassland. The practical part of study deals of functional and operational aspects. Futher, the machines were compared in terms of operating cost. The machines are assigned to suitable operators, {{on the basis of this}} analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{improvement}} of the level <b>of</b> modernization and <b>mechanization</b> <b>of</b> railway infrastructure <b>maintenance,</b> Railway large maintenance machinery (RLMM) {{is considered to be}} one of the main equipment. We have accumulated large amounts of RLMM construction data. How to mine valuable information from these data has become an important research subject. The C 4. 5 algorithm of decision tree is a useful method of data mining and classification. The paper solves evaluation of RLMM construction problem based on the C 4. 5 algorithm. By means of extracting the attribute with maximum gain ratio as the root node of the decision tree from training sample data, the evaluation decision tree was constructed. The decision tree modeling of evaluation of RLMM construction was gained by the post-pruning approach. The experimental results and analysis show that this model has high precision and credibility. 1...|$|R
50|$|D. William Brosnan was a {{president}} of Southern Railway in the USA, a railroad that later merged with Norfolk and Western Railroad to form Norfolk Southern Railway. Born in 1903 in Albany, Georgia, {{he was the son}} of the town's fire chief. In 1923, he took a job as an engineer with the Georgia Department of Highways, before taking a job at as an apprentice student engineer for the Southern Railway, three years later, maintaining the right-of-way. Between 1931 and 1952, he had several promotions, from apprentice student engineer to junior engineer, to division superintendent, to general manager of the Central Lines of the Southern Railway, to vice president of operations. During his time as chief engineer for the Western Lines of the Southern Railway, in 1945 and 1946, he oversaw an increased <b>mechanization</b> <b>of</b> track <b>maintenance</b> and construction on the Southern Railway, and during his time as general manager for the Central Lines, he oversaw the automation of freight car classification in yards and terminals. He succeeded Harry A. deButts in 1962. In 1964 Brosnan was selected as the first recipient of the Man of the Year award by Modern Railways magazine, an award now presented by Railway Age magazine as the Railroader of the Year.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} endogenous technological {{changes of}} inputs from labor to capital in operations of a production process, i. e., a kind <b>of</b> <b>mechanization</b> <b>of</b> the production process. While retaining {{the property of}} decreasing returns in capital, we can show that because of complementary relationships between the accumulation of capital and the <b>mechanization</b> <b>of</b> the production process, long-run growth is possible through the accumulation of capital only. It involves no growth of total factor productivity. Furthermore, our model can partly present a micro-foundation of constant-elasticity-of-substitution production function. Investigating our model empirically, we confirm both technological progress and our technological change.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Kwara State Nigeria, to assess the level <b>of</b> <b>mechanization</b> <b>of</b> cassava processing. Data was collected using multi-stage sampling technique randomly selecting one hundred and twenty (120) processing centres from two ADP agricultural zones in Kwara State. A structured interview schedule was used as an instrument to elicit information on types and number of processing machines available to processors, gender of operators, source of power and type of prime mover, mode of operation and constraints to <b>mechanization</b> <b>of</b> cassava processing. The data collected was analyzed using simple descriptive statistics like mean, percentages and cross tabulations. Chi-square (X 2) analysis was used to test the independence of machine operators against sex (gender). The major constraints to <b>mechanization</b> <b>of</b> cassava processing were identified, rated on a 4 points Likert-Type scale and ranked to determine their severity. The results showed that the level <b>of</b> <b>mechanization</b> <b>of</b> cassava processing in Kwara State is generally low, with the most commonly available processing equipment as the peeling tool (common knife), the grater and local frying pans. Over 70 % of the processing equipment are manually operated, while electricity accounted for only about 0. 5 %. The chi-square test for the processing equipment versus the sex of the operator revealed that gender (sex) is dependent on processing machine at 1 % level of significance. The ‘very severe’ constraints to <b>mechanization</b> <b>of</b> cassava processing are lack of credit, scarcity of spare parts and lack of electricity, while Poor quality of fabrication materials and Inappropriate processing equipment are considered ‘Not severe’. The study recommended appropriate government policies aimed at reducing interest rates, encouraging research and development and provision of massive rural infrastructures...|$|R
