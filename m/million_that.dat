5|$|Friends of the High Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the High Line. Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of the High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 <b>million</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E

5|$|The bottom line, {{with the}} signing of the treaty, was that any capital ships under {{construction}} by the five signatories (the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan) had to be canceled and scrapped. For battlecruisers, this encompassed the United States Lexington class, Japan's , and Great Britain's G3 battlecruisers. For the U.S. Navy, the choice seemed clear. If it scrapped all six Lexingtons in accordance with the treaty, it would throw away $13.4 <b>million</b> <b>that</b> could otherwise go toward aircraft carriers. The Navy opted for the latter course.|$|E

5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} {{to admit that}} neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 <b>million</b> <b>that</b> had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Transport Scotland {{announced}} in June 2010 that three consortiums that had submitted expressions {{of interest in}} the project were to be invited to participate in a competitive dialogue; these were BAM UK, IMCD (Sir Robert McAlpine, Iridium Concesiones de Infraestructuras and Carillion) and New Borders Railway (Fluor, Miller and Uberior Infrastructure Investments). In mid-November 2010, the withdrawal of Fluor resulted in the third consortium pulling out of the bidding process. The second consortium withdrew in June 2011 following the decision by Carillion not to continue. This led to the cancellation of the tender procedure by Scottish transport minister Keith Brown. Network Rail was chosen by Transport Scotland to undertake the project and, following months of negotiations, a Transfer of Responsibility was signed at a ceremony held on 6 November 2012 at the Scottish Mining Museum in Newtongrange. Network Rail agreed to build the line by mid-2015 for £294 million, an increase on the estimated £230 <b>million</b> <b>that</b> the line was expected to cost and the £100 <b>million</b> <b>that</b> it was originally costed at in 2000. This figure is also substantially more than the £189 million which Network Rail Chief Executive Iain Coucher agreed to build the line in late 2007 or early 2008.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, BOT {{superintendent}} Philip E. Pheifer {{put forth}} a proposal for Second Avenue Subway services, which would branch extensively off to B Division. The subway was originally to be opened by 1951, but by 1945, plans for the Second Avenue Subway were again revised. Another plan was put forth in 1947 by Colonel Sidney H. Bingham, a city planner and former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) engineer. O'Dwyer and Gross believed that construction of a Second Avenue subway line would be vital to both increasing capacity on existing lines and allowing new branch lines to be built. Bingham's proposal involved more branch lines and track connections than did Phiefer's, and similar to the 1960s and 1990s phased proposals, was {{to be built in}} sections. However, by the next year, New York City was short $145 <b>million</b> <b>that</b> was needed for a $800 million program for rehabilitation and proposed capital improvements. The City petitioned the New York State Legislature to exceed its $655 million debt ceiling so that the city could spend $500 million on subway construction, but this request was denied.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Pelinka was {{inducted}} into his high school's wall of fame. Durant left Pelinka in the offseason. Iguodala declined a one-year $16 million contract from the Denver Nuggets and met with a half dozen teams when the free agency period opened. He then signed a four-year $48 million contract with the Golden State Warriors. Mayo was also an unrestricted free agent. Pelinka's 2010 fourth overall draftee Johnson signed a one-year deal with the Lakers for the 4th year veteran's minimum salary of $916,099 after, teaming with Pelinka clients Bryant as well as Kaman, who signed with the Lakers the prior week. Trevor Ariza switched agents to sign with Pelinka one year before his contract with the Washington Wizards was due to expire. On November 25, Bryant signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 <b>million</b> <b>that</b> will make him the first NBA player to play 20 years with the same franchise. He remained the league's highest-paid player, despite accepting the discounted deal; he had been eligible to receive an extension starting at $32 million per year.|$|E

Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists' head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct {{in exchange for the}} $3 <b>million</b> <b>that</b> had been spent on Boorman's screenplay. Down the hall from Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich when he learned that Bakshi wanted to discuss acquiring the rights to The Lord of the Rings. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a check to cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.|$|E
5|$|Looking Glass {{intended}} Flight Unlimited as {{a gateway}} into {{the video game}} publishing industry. According to Lerner, the idea of self-publishing had been considered when the company was founded. In 1995, Looking Glass projected that sales of Flight Unlimited would increase royalty revenues to $10 <b>million</b> <b>that</b> year, up from $1.5 million in 1994. Jeffrey A. Kalowski, the company's vice president of finance and administration, expected that the game would recoup its development costs and make a return {{before the end of}} the year. He predicted that, over the following 12 to 18 months, the company's number of employees would increase from 52 to 82. The company's executive vice president and general manager, Jerry Wolosenko, told The Boston Globe that the company hoped to publish six games each year. According to Doug Church, the pressure for Flight Unlimited to succeed meant that the concurrently-developed System Shock, which was not self-published, received little attention from the company's management.|$|E
