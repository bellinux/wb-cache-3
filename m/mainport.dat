40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{uncertainty in the}} long-term planning of infrastructures {{in general and of}} <b>mainports</b> such as airports and seaports is a key challenge for decisionmakers. Moreover, these uncertainties have increased over the last decades due to changes in owner structure, changes in rules and regulations, and the ever increasing connectedness of the world. This dissertation explores how the {{treatment of}} uncertainties in airport planning can be improved. Currently, the treatment is limited to one or a few forecasts for the future. Such an approach limits the exploration of the multiplicity of futures to those that are judged to be most likely. However, if the last decade has taught is anything, then it is that the future will be substantially different from the one we are anticipating now. The implication of this for decisionmaking is that any plan or policy optimized for one or a few forecasts is likely to perform poorly. An alternative approach that is capable of handling the multiplicity of futures and accepts the limits on predictability is needed. Such an approach should result in a plans consist of time-urgent low regret options that can be taken immediately, while establishing a framework for guiding future actions. Thus the decisionmaker is able to adapt the plan {{to the way in which}} the future unfolds. This dissertation presents such a dynamic adaptive planning approach, tailors this approach to the specifics of airport planning, and provides computational evidence for the efficacy of plans that are designed utilizing this approach.

40|$|Sustainable {{growth and}} the {{commercial}} success of "Mainport Holland", located in one of Europe’s most densely populated areas, is threatened {{by a lack of}} available land, a congested infrastructure, and an increasingly complex social, economic and political reality. To deal with these threats mainports, such as the Port of Rotterdam, are reengineering their planning processes. Instead of making plans based on an extrapolation of current trends, the aim is now to find answers to what-if questions which are applied to concurrent scenarios. <b>Mainport</b> planning is like solving a large jigsaw puzzle, but unlike a jigsaw puzzle the pieces used to solve the puzzle are not available beforehand, and there is no single best solution. Solving the <b>mainport</b> planning puzzle is a difficult, lengthy, knowledge and information intensive, multi- actor process. The challenge is to support invoking the memory and the creativity of multiple actors, with different objectives, that are specialized in different fields of knowledge, and that work in different contexts, such that effective <b>mainport</b> planning can be conducted. Adhering to the concept of studios, suites and services as introduced by Keen and Sol (2007), we introduced the design of a <b>Mainport</b> Planning Suite (MPS), i. e. a suite of services to support the actors in a studio-based planning process and improve their effectiveness in <b>mainport</b> planning. Following a design science strategy, we designed our MPS in an iterative way. First we studied <b>mainport</b> planning in practice in two exploratory case studies. From the exploratory case studies we found that supporting <b>mainport</b> planning should be focused on visualizing the knowledge and information that is used and produced during a <b>mainport</b> planning process. Based on the principles of visualization found in literature, we constructed a framework that we used to identify technology building blocks and requirements to design and implement an MPS. Based on the identified requirements we chose to design our MPS as a suite of loosely coupled services that are provided by a web portal. The main services provided by our suite are Map, Sketchbook, Matchbox, and Aspect Explorer, which support analysis, design, evaluation and choice in <b>mainport</b> planning. These services are supplemented with a number of services that support the process of planning, e. g. action lists, decision lists and project information services. The MPS was evaluated in two evaluation sessions at the Port of Rotterdam. For each evaluation session a prototype was assembled from the MPS services. During the first evaluation session a team of area planners was invited to participate in a fictive studio-based area planning meeting supported by our suite. Not all functionality was available during first evaluation session; therefore a second evaluation session was organized in which we used structured walkthroughs of an improved prototype. Based on the outcomes of the evaluation sessions, it is our strong conviction that an MPS is potentially useful and usable to improve the effectiveness of studio-based <b>mainport</b> planning. Future research might focus on the integration of simulation models in an MPS, the extent to which an MPS can support the automatic reporting of planning outcomes, the design of an approach for using an MPS, {{and the extent to which}} an MPS can be used in spatial planning in general.

40|$|Schiphol Amsterdam, {{the main}} airport of the Netherlands, {{is a dynamic}} node, where the space of places and space of flows meet. The days that Schiphol was just an airport are long gone. This makes it a complex entity. The {{different}} governments concerned with the future development of Schiphol appear to be indecisive and lack adequate knowledge needed to understand {{the dynamics of the}} airport, as a result of which the planning process is insufficient. It seems that reality and the administrative situation do not fit anymore. Spatial supply and demand differ enormously. Schiphol and the national government both conceptualize the airport by calling it a <b>mainport,</b> but both define the same concept differently. The <b>mainport</b> concept was formed in the mid-eighties, when the Dutch economy was in a period of recession. Two economic motors were appointed: the Rotterdam Harbour and Schiphol Airport. Now after almost twenty years Schiphol evolved enormously while the <b>mainport</b> concept used by the government hardly changed. How is this possible? In this paper I will describe the forming of the <b>mainport</b> concept and the evolution of Schiphol. After assessment of this evolution and the concept, which is done by a combination of in depth interviews, a comprehensive literature study and the analysis of the operative policy documents, I conclude with a problem inventory. I argue that this inventory can help us understand why the <b>mainport</b> concept and Schiphol differ today and why reality and the administrative situation do not fit anymore. In this way, the problem inventory will provide a good basic framework in order to find a solution and make sure that in the recent future reality and the administrative situation will be one again. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{increasing}} globalization, mainports play an important role. A number of gateways have emerged as transport nodes in the networks of air and sea routes which criss-cross the globe. Here, millions of travellers are transferred and millions of tonnes of freight are transhipped. Both Japan and the Netherlands play {{an important part in}} these ‘hub and spoke ’ networks. In this contribution we will deal with the dynamics of mainports in general, and more specifically with the mainports of the Netherlands. Our argument is that their function goes far beyond that of infrastructure, transport and logistics. Although they started out as transport nodes, the mainports in the Netherlands are now evolving into fully fledged business generators. The economic function of mainports will be strengthened by integrating <b>mainport</b> and brainport functions. It will be further reinforced by seizing the opportunity to combine the traditional <b>mainport</b> functions. This will involve connecting airlines with road and rail transport networks, connecting ocean shipping with inland shipping, cargo trains, trucks and pipelines and connecting transport nodes with an infrastructural node of ICT (information and communications technology) networks. For the Randstad Holland (the Netherlands ’ economic heartland in the west), we conclude that a stronger integration of gateway Rotterdam and <b>mainport</b> Amsterdam Schiphol could be considered. This could be achieved not only by strengthening their transport infrastructure, but first and foremost by planning, developing and integrating the ICT <b>mainport</b> functions...|$|E

Since 1990, infrastructure development has increasingly become the structuring force for the spatial dynamics of the Randstad. Schiphol was seen as the <b>mainport</b> for airlines, and Rotterdam-Europoort as the <b>mainport</b> for shipping lines and container transport. The landside infrastructural connections for Schiphol and Europoort had a big impact on the growth in the capacity of continental roads and rail lines.

40|$|Abstract Global supply {{chains are}} built on organizational, information, and {{logistics}} networks. Ports are connected via these networks and also need to connect these networks. Synchromodality is an innovative concept for container transportation, and the port {{plays an important role}} in connecting the various transportation networks. The large number of global supply chains that use the port as a hub require added value, and this can be provided by interconnecting the three types of networks, for example via the port community system. Global supply chains can be more sustainable when interconnected networks create visibility, together with the proper mechanisms to support value creation, not just monetary value, but also other values such as security and environmental footprint. The research required to further develop these topics make use of quantitative modeling from the field of operations management. This inaugural speech touches upon a number of these research challenges. The ambitions and plans of the chair “Ports in Global Networks” concern three interrelated research topics: (1) Synchronizing transportation networks; (2) Connecting sea ports to global supply chains; and (3) Coordinating global supply chains for sustainability.

40|$|Fundamental changes {{set a new}} {{scene for}} seaports. In the new situation, ports can no longer rely only on {{infrastructure}} and transport services to optimise their hinterland reach. To optimise inland accessibility, port authorities have to look beyond infrastructure and give more value to intangible aspects of accessibility. It is recommended to exploit and combine the knowledge available in the port community, by developing innovative logistic concepts to bind shippers and regions to the port. Such a new hinterland approach is especially relevant for the port of Rotterdam. Rotterdam seems to have difficulties to penetrate in regions outside its captive market: the share of rail transport still is relatively low and its presence in Central Europe falls short to its ?<b>mainport?</b> status. To secure its present market and to extend its market reach towards Central Europe, a more active orientation on the shipper is required as a complement to infrastructure investments.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{container}} traffic was {{the driving force}} behind the growth in cargo handling in the port of Antwerp, Belgium.

Thus in the hard disk drive (HDD) industry, local precision components suppliers such as MMI developed technological know-how and market expertise through their global production network (GPN) supplier relationships to global lead firms such as Seagate (in April 2011 adding Samsung HDD to its consolidated US acquisitions like Conner Peripherals, Control Data, DEC and Maxtor) and Western Digital (in 2011 acquirer of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies). Seagate and Western Digital thus have approximately half the global HDD market each; Western Digital supplies HDDs from south-east Asia to the likes of Apple and Dell while Seagate supplies Hewlett-Packard, Dell and IBM. The advent of ‘cloud’ computing is one important source of the de-stabilisation of HDD markets, the 2011 floods in Thailand exacerbated this, affecting Western Digital’s Thai production plants and Seagate’s component supplier base, both located on the Chao Phrya floodplain in Bangkok.

Future changes in aviation technologies require Air-traffic Control (ATC) professionals {{to be able to}} adapt to these coming changes in their profession. To be able to adapt to new situations professionals must be able to define learning needs, set learning goals and identify human and material resources (e. g. task selection) to fulfil these needs.

As a consequence, in ATC training, SDL skills should be developed in an adaptive training system (Van Meeuwen, Brand-Gruwel, Van Merriënboer, & De Bock, 2009). However, in order to self-direct learning, insight in to past performance is necessary. It requires a self-assessment from a present situation. Self-assessment can be seen as one of the self-regulated learning (SRL) skills (Zimmerman, 1990).

Paper {{presented at}} the AERA annual meeting, Vancouver, B. C. Self-regulated learning (SRL) skills are especially important in professions where the half-life of initial training and education is short and where knowledge and skill obsolescence is quick. An example of just such a profession {{can be found in}} the constantly evolving field of Air Traffic Control (ATC), and thus SRL skills are essential for ATC trainees. If Air Traffic Controllers are to become and remain competent we must gain insight into how ATC trainees regulate their learning during task performance, how the acquisition of SRL skills can be stimulated, and thus how this can be measured. This study examines the use of cued retrospective reporting to measure learners’ SRL activities during the execution of complex ATC tasks. Results show that cued retrospective reporting is a workable method for measuring an extensive collection of regulation activities of ATC trainees.

After an exposition of the concepts of mainports and gateways, the attention will be focussed on the critical relevance of mainports and gateways for two distinct countries, viz. the Netherlands and Finland. The difference between the transport networks of these two countries -seen from a European perspective- will be highlighted. The Netherlands has two principal mainports, viz.

Poster {{presented at the}} 16 th European Conference on Eye-Movements, Marseille, France. Errors in Air Traffic Control (ATC) are a risk to human life hence, air traffic controllers have to make fast and correct decisions. These decisions are based on complex visualizations of a surrounding area (figure 1). These visualisations are complex because they involve representations of many moving airplanes including their labels with crucial information (i. e., call sign, speeds, heading, etc.). Despite of increasing air traffic, live of people must not be at risk, so further understanding the causes for successful air traffic controllers as well as understanding the difficulties of less experienced air traffic controllers is crucial. Such findings may inform user interface designers and instructional designers in ATC. Hence, this study examined how experts, intermediates, and novices in ATC perceive and interpret ATC stimuli on a perceptual level (by means of eye-tracking) and on a performance level.

Cued retrospective reporting (CRR) is a verbal reporting procedure based on a cue (e. g. gaze replay), in which participants verbalize their thought processes during task performance after completing the task. CRR not only provides insight in the participants’ thought processes during task performance, but it might support the participants’ regulation process too. This leaves the following first research questions to answer: first, is there a relation between learners’ SRL-skills their SDL-skills? Second, improves self-assessment and SDL after a CRR?Kenniscentrum <b>Mainport</b> Schipho...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{strategic}} planning interventions in the Netherlands look {{likely to turn}} into planning failures: the Betuwe freight line, the Amsterdam-Brussels high-speed rail line, the Green Heart of the Randstad, the intended Almere ‘scale jump’, Amsterdam’s north-south light railway and so on. The same could happen with the planning of the second harbour extension of Rotterdam Seaport: the ‘second Maasvlakte’. They {{are more than just}} failures in financial terms or in terms of social and economic welfare. They also qualify as {{strategic planning}} failures as they bypass the growing fragmentation, networking, destabilising and dynamic re-clustering processes of present post-industrial societies. In spite of the window-dressing associated with collaborative, discursive or development-oriented approaches, actual spatial planning objectives in such cases are still inclusionary and conceptualised from the inside out, based on a procedural, structuralist or, at best, a structurationalist view of planning. This paper argues that to become more effective these planning interventions have to refocus themselves using a radical outside-in approach. Instead of working against the growing uncertainties, fragmentations, pluralisation and complexities of present day society, structuring and fixing them in time and space, planners should work from and with them. This paper will describe how this could be done using an actor-relational approach with respect to <b>Mainport</b> Rotterdam. This kind of planning needs to refocus on more open source associated planning strategies, inter-linking proposals for spatial-institutional resetting, beyond traditional governmental structures, plans and the idea of comprehensive planning...|$|E
40|$|Are {{we at the}} eve of a {{transformation}} in our economic system? “Yes”, according to several visionary scientists and policymakers. They predict the rise of an economy that is based on biological materials, the so-called bio-based economy. The key challenge is that due to several socio-economic developments, the world is expected to consume vastly more resources than today. The total demand for energy is projected to almost double in the next century. Increased scarcity will be accompanied by a constant struggle for supply to meet demand. Sometimes successful, sometimes less so, but always with rising and highly volatile prices as a consequence. New forms of feedstock, bio-based feedstock, will be embraced. This lecture describes some of the hurdles and challenges that the transition to the bio-based economy faces. It also describes the impact this transition will (need to) have on chemical engineering education. Finally, an first area of research focus is defined: bio aromatics. Ad de Kok studied Chemical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. He joined Dow Benelux in Terneuzen in 1977, where he held several positions in R&D and Technology Management in Polymers, Chemicals and Hydrocarbons in Europe, USA and the Pacific. During his career at Dow he earned a Master’s and Doctorate degree in Business Administration. In 2012 he retired from Dow Chemical and joined Research Centre <b>Mainport</b> Innovation at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, where he assumed responsibility for the Renewable Resources in Process Industry area as part of the Innovation in Process Industry cluster...|$|E
40|$|Collaborative {{approaches}} to local economic development have {{developed in a}} number of European countries. However collaborative working presents a new problem for policy makers and public management researchers. The problem is to design an institutional framework for the governance of economic development that provides for anchorage in the democratic system without loosing the benefits of flexible policy design and delivery. This is particularly important in a European context. The European Union has recognised the need for citizens to be more engaged in the governance of public policy at all scales - from local neighbourhoods to the transnational level. This chapter addresses the problem by examining the basic questions that any form of democratic governance design needs to address, and relating this to the case of economic development. The core democratic design questions are: How can legitimacy be secured? In what ways can relevant publics give consent to decisions? Through what means can the institution be held to account? The chapter discusses these three democratic imperatives and shows that different responses to these produce three archetypical governance designs - club, agency and polity. We then explore {{the way in which the}} problems of democratic governance have been solved empirically through longitudinal case studies of the expansion of <b>Mainport</b> Rotterdam and the management of economic, environmental, residential and transportation agendas in the Ghent canal area of the Flanders region of Belgium. The analysis shows that although different national and regional political contexts matter, the typology of archetypes offers a way of understanding the overall democratic orientation of a particular governance design as well as offering a basis from which policy makers can create their own solutions...|$|E

Indicators for {{successful}} learning in {{air traffic control}} training. Paper presented at the 5 th EARLI SIG 14 Learning and Professional Development Conference. Munich, Germany. Air Traffic Control (ATC) is a cognitive complex job. To access Air Traffic Control (ATC) training, a selection procedure takes place. This selection increases the chances of trainees reaching the high standards {{at the end of}} the training. Nevertheless, still a large number of trainees drops out. To improve trainees learning skills, in this study indicators {{for successful}} learning in ATC training have been examined; based on focus group meetings with ATC training experts, ATC trainers, and ATC trainees, indicators for successful learning were formulated. Results show that both the experts and trainers identify setting own learning goals, identifying own human and material resources, and self-efficacy as important indicators for successful learning. The trainees, however, identified the ability to adjust task performance and the orientation on task performance as important indicators for successful learning in ATC training. Overall, a significant agreement was found between the rankings of all three focus groups. This resulted in a ranking of most important indicators in ATC training by each group. The ranking of the experts and trainers correlated significantly, whereas no correlation was found between the trainee group and any of the other groups. Differences and similarities in agreement between groups are discussed. In addition guidelines for instructional design are formulated in which optimal trainee involvement in individual ATC competence development is discussed.
