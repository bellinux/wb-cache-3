Despite <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Peters</b> initial reluctance to engage in conversation, Ayesha wins her over, and an unlikely friendship develops between them. It is through Ayesha that the two families learn about each other so that various myths are understood and they realise they share many common views when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Peters</b> is also on speaking terms {{with the rest of the}} Ali family, which brings their two contrasting families together, crossing religious, cultural and racial barriers.|$|R

To be compelled by considerations of health to pass these by was enough to damp the liveliest optimist. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Peters</b> had suffered terribly.

5000|$|The film remains {{relatively}} {{faithful to}} the original novel. Major differences are {{in the relationship between}} the novelist and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Peters,</b> which is rather closer than in the novel. When Mr. Leyden attacks Dimitrios at the end, it appears to be partially in outrage at what Dimitrios has done to a person who has almost become a friend. Second, in the novel, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Peters</b> is fatally wounded by Dimitrios, but kills the latter before dying. In the film, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Peters</b> emerges, wounded but alive. He is seen being hustled out the door by the police, having urged the detective story writer {{to write a book about}} the case and saying he will have time to read it. Mr. Leyden says to him: [...] "Goodbye, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Peters</b> - au revoir. Sorry you won't be going to the Indies now," [...] ambiguously saying that Peters is or is not likely to recover. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Peters</b> says, [...] "You see? There's not enough kindness in the world." [...] "There's not enough kindness in the world," [...] had been Peters' tagline or slogan throughout the movie.|$|R

The animosity between the two only grows deeper as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Peters</b> tries to buy Tom out of some of his inventions, under the guise of making a profit. Tom refuses to allow anyone other than himself permissions to his patents, and this infuriates <b>Mr.</b> <b>Peters.</b> Later, Tom learns that his good friend, Mr. Damon, is having serious financial troubles.
