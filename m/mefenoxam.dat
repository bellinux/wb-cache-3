50|$|Yield loss due to seed rot {{can be as}} high as 30% {{in heavily}} {{infected}} acres. The disease infects the onion seed and will cause the onions roots to be gray and mushy. These roots and plants rapidly decay and decompose, killing the plant. <b>Mefenoxam</b> is recommended as treatment for seed rot.|$|E
50|$|Crown rot in {{asparagus}} {{was first}} reported in California in 1938 when Californian growers began {{to report a}} slimy, orange-yellow asparagus tissue with soft lesions causing post harvest losses of 20-30%. As lesions grow they eventually collapse and shrivel. In the 1980s it was shown that fungicidal treatments of metalaxyl increased yields by 80%. Today <b>mefenoxam</b> (metalaxyl-m) is the primary fungicide used to treat crown rot.|$|E
50|$|Leaf blight {{occurs in}} areas with hot and humid weather. The spores land on onion leaves, {{penetrate}} the skin, and rapidly kill the leaf. This causes a severe reduction in bulb size, as high as 50%, and can happen {{in less than a}} week. Applications of foliar fungicides can be used to control leaf blight. These include azoxystrobin, chlorotholonil copper, mancozeb, maneb, and <b>mefenoxam.</b>|$|E
50|$|Applying {{fungicides}} {{that contain}} chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb, or metalaxyl {{as the main}} ingredient on a regular schedule will help to eliminate the pathogen. You can also apply fungicides containing <b>mefenoxam</b> to the soil surface under the vines around 4-8 weeks prior to harvest. A third practice to help control the disease is to spray with another fungicide, difolatan, 4 times over a 10-day period. Soil should be fumigated before anything else is planted in previously-infected soil.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{conventional}} and organic fungicides {{are available and}} {{could be used to}} limit spread and yield losses during the spring, early summer and fall on crops and susceptible neighboring plants. Each of the 17 specific races of the white rust pathogen affects different plants so monitoring is essential as much as possible to limit overuse and cost of fungicide treatments. Common OMRI fungicides include sulphur, copper oxide, rosemary oil, and azadirachtin products. [...] Common conventional fungicides include <b>mefenoxam</b> and fosetyl-aluminum products.|$|E
50|$|Downy mildew is an {{extremely}} fast-developing disease in the onion. Studies have observed up to 40% of a field being infected {{in less than three}} days. The first symptoms of the disease are white and purple growths {{on the surface of the}} plant leaves. Eventually these leaves die. This in turn destroys the plant's photosynthetic abilities, stunting growth and sometimes killing the plant. Untreated downy mildew can reduce yields by 65%. Downy mildew is controlled with the same foliar fungicides as leaf blight: azoxystrobin, copper, mancozeb, maneb, and <b>mefenoxam.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} of chemical, genetic, and cultural methods {{are used to}} control sorghum downy mildew. A number of single-gene sources of resistance have been found, and many resistant varieties are commercially available. However, new pathotypes of the fungus continue to evolve to overcome different sources of host plant resistance. Seed treatments with the systemic fungicides metalaxyl and <b>mefenoxam</b> {{have been widely used}} to prevent systemic infections of Sorghum Downy Mildew. Metalaxyl, which inhibits protein synthesis in the pathogen, can also be applied as a foliar spray. In Texas, use of these two fungicides, in conjunction with the use of resistant hybrids, made the disease a minor problem until one of the pathotypes endemic in the region evolved resistance to both chemicals.|$|E
50|$|Pythium and Rhizoctonia {{are both}} {{seedling}} {{diseases of the}} cotton plant. They can be devastating to cotton plants because they develop when seedlings are unable to overcome the damage being caused by the invading fungus. The diseases often kill seeds before they grow. However, if the seeds do manage to sprout they demonstrate symptoms almost immediately. The stalks of the cotton plant will be weak, brown sunken lesions {{will appear on the}} stem, and the plant will often die before producing or will have very poor yields. Growers who plant early are especially susceptible because cooler temperatures and damper weather are conducive to these diseases. Therefore, growers who plant early are advised to use in-furrow fungicides for control: PNCB and iprodione for Rhizoctonia and etridiazole and <b>mefenoxam</b> for pythium. Recently, azoxystrobin has proven effective in controlling both rhizoctonia and pythium.|$|E
50|$|An {{array of}} studies have tested the {{curative}} and protective effects of various chemical compounds against P. ramorum in plants valued as ornamentals or Christmas trees. Many {{studies have focused on}} the four main ornamental hosts of P. ramorum (Rhododendron, Camellia, Viburnum, and Pieris). Several effective compounds have been found; some of the most effective include <b>mefenoxam,</b> metalaxyl, dimethomorph, and fenamidone. Many of these studies have converged upon the following conclusions: chemical compounds are, in general, more effective as preventives than in curatives; when used preventively, chemical compounds must be reapplied at various intervals; and chemical compounds can mask the symptoms of P. ramorum infection in the host plant, potentially interfering with inspections for quarantine efforts. In general, these compounds suppress but do not eradicate the pathogen, and some researchers are concerned that with repeated use the pathogen may become resistant to them. These studies and conclusions are summarized by Kliejunas.|$|E
50|$|Several {{kinds of}} {{management}} {{exist for the}} prevention and suppression of disease. A cultural method that can be effective in preventing disease is sanitation. Equipment should be cleaned after use in infested fields so the disease does not spread into uninfested fields. To disrupt chlamydospore germination crops should be grown in drained disease free soil. Also, avoid transplanting without thorough knowledge of the transplant. To limit spread of structures limit traffic in infected fields and always clean after exposure. Disease is favored by pH values greater than 6.2, so lowering the pH is an effective method for preventing germination. pH management can be difficult because tobacco cannot survive in very low pH soils. Soil pH 5.5 to 6 allow successful growth of tobacco and control of disease. The cultural control, Crop rotation, is very effective at limiting disease. The longer an infected field is planted in a crop other than the initial infected crop, the lower the population will become. A minimum three year rotation is recommended. Crop rotation is recommended in combination with resistant varieties as genetic controls. Burley Tobacco, Burley Tobacco hybrids, and Dark Tobacco are varieties of tobacco that are resistant to Black Shank. Resistance however is not reliable because a single variety has resistance to only a few races of Black Shank. Finding new lines of resistance is becoming increasingly important due to new discovered resistant races of the pathogen. Chemical control is most successful if used with resistant varieties. Metalaxyl or <b>mefenoxam</b> are chemistries used to control Phytophthora nicotianae. Ridomil Gold is an example a systemic pesticide with a Metalaxyl chemistry. <b>Mefenoxam</b> is twice as active as metalaxyl, but they both have the same mode of action. Successful chemical control is difficult because we are limited to these two chemistries that are basically identical. A study by Csinos and Bertrand found out {{at a rate of}} 3.36 kg/ha would not inhibit many of the common races used in their study. Overall, from their study they observed that Black Shank severity was increasing in Georgia due to Metalaxyl sensitivity and resistant races of Black Shank.|$|E
5000|$|Crop {{rotation}} {{may reduce}} the number of pathogens in the soil and, [...] "a minimum of a 3 years crop rotation which alternates with non-host species is recommended to avoid build-up of P. capsici spores." [...] Crops should also avoid conditions that would be conducive to the pathogen by using well drained soils and raised beds. [...] As stated above, [...] "Excess moisture {{is the single most important}} component to the initial infection and subsequent spreading of Phytophthora capsici." [...] Overall, a study by K.H. Lamour and M.K. Hausbeck found that [...] "crop rotation and <b>mefenoxam</b> are not likely to provide economic control". Mefenoxem is the active enantiomer contained in the racemic fungicide metalaxyl used to defend against Phytophthora capsici. Sexual recombination provides the genetic diversity to promote resistance towards fungicides in P. capsici. The failure of crop rotation as a means to control P. capsici may also be due to weeds playing the role of an alternative host in the absence of common hosts. According to a study done by the University of Florida, [...] "In Florida, and perhaps elsewhere, weeds may contribute to pathogen survival in the absence of a host crop or when propagules may not readily survive in soil or plant debris." [...] To avoid fruit rot of vegetable crops in the Cucurbitaceae family, trellising cucurbit fruits and other ways to keep the fruit off the ground is a way to control secondary inoculents (zoospores) from physically being splashed from the soil onto the fruit. Control of Phytophthora capsici is easier in drier climates with less rainfall such as California. In these areas, it is important to practice placing drip irrigation emitters away from the stems of pepper plants in order to reduce the incidence of crown rot in peppers.|$|E
5000|$|Infections {{of seeds}} and roots are {{initiated}} {{by both the}} mycelia and spores of Py. ultimum. Two spore types are made, depending on the strain. Py. ultimum is a species complex that includes var. ultimum and var. sporangiiferum. [...] The major distinguishing feature is that sporangia and zoospores (swimming spores) are produced only rarely by Py. ultimum var. ultimum. Both species make oospores, which are thick-walled structures produced by sexual recombination. Both species are self-fertile (homothallic), which means that a single strain can mate with itself. In addition to oospores, Py. ultimum var. ultimum also makes hyphal swellings which germinate in a manner resembling sporangia to form plant-infecting hyphae. One important ecological difference between {{the different types of}} spores is that sporangia and zoospores are short-lived, while the thick-walled oospores can persist for years within soil, surviving even winter freezes. Mycelia and oospores in soil can infect seeds or roots. This leads to wilting, reduced yield, and ultimately plant death. Common signs of a Pythium infection include stunting of the plants, brown coloration of root-tips, and wilting of the plant during the warm part of the day. Management of disease is challenging but focuses on sanitation, fungicides, and biological control. Fungicides include <b>mefenoxam,</b> thiadiazole, etridiazole, propamocarb, dimethomorph, and phosphonates. Biological control agents include the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces griseoviridis, and the fungi Candida oleophila, Gliocladium catenulatum, Trichoderma harziamum, and Trichoderma virens. [...] Effective resistance in the plant host is generally not available. Sanitation is very important since the pathogen can be easily introduced into pasteurized soil or even soil-free potting mixes on dirty tools or pots. Especially in greenhouses, fungus gnats may also help move the pathogen from place to place.|$|E
5000|$|Pythium irregulare {{requires}} {{very specific}} environmental conditions to produce disease, so control of environment is the first step. Because the zoospores require water {{to be able to}} move around, preventing standing water will decrease the chance of disease occurrence. Additionally, excess water can lead to an increase in insects that feed on roots, making it easier for the pathogen to spread, as it can make its way into the plant through wounds. Water levels can be controlled by avoiding planting in areas that have poor drainage and controlling irrigation as to not overwater plants. Because P. irregulare has oospores that survive under harsh conditions, sanitation is very important to limit the spread. Contaminated irrigation systems, tools, and seeds can spread the disease, so disinfection with heat or chemicals are necessary to prevent further spread, as well as purchasing certified clean seed. Additionally, in greenhouses scenarios it is important to sanitize soil, work benches, and tools with heat or chemicals as well. It is also important to avoid over-fertilizing plants, as fertilizers can suppress plant defenses and damage roots, making it easier for P. irregulare to infect. Finally, if you have had previous problems with Pythium irregulare, you can take preventative measures by mixing fungicides into the soil, although this is more easily achieved in a greenhouse scenario. It is important to create a fungicide plan with different rotations of fungicides if you choose to prevent disease this way in order to prevent the pathogen from becoming resistant to the fungicide. Some fungicides used to prevent P. irregulare include <b>mefenoxam,</b> fosetyl-Al, and etridiazole. Additionally, certain biological agents such as Trichoderma harzianum and Gliocladium virens can be used as biological control measures to prevent infection; however, this is also a more plausible control method in a greenhouse, again because it needs to be mixed into the soil. Crop rotation is not necessarily a good option for P. irregulare control because many crops are viable hosts, oospores can survive in the soil for many years, and the pathogen can survive on organic matter; however, rotation with a non-host crop may be able to reduce the pathogen load, thus decreasing infection in subsequent years ...|$|E

40|$|Pythium blight, {{a serious}} disease ofturfgrass, {{is caused by}} Pythium spp., {{including}} P. aphanideramtum, an oomycete fungus. Tank-mixing strategies, which deploy a mixture {{of two or more}} fungicides with different modes of action, have been used to suppress problems of fungicide resistance. However, few studies have examined how interactions within P. aphanidermatum populations may affect the proliferation of resistance. The isolates present in populations of P. aphanidermatum may vary in their fitness characteristics, and those characteristics may {{play an important role in}} competition among isolates. Different fungicide treatments impose characteristic selection pressures on Pythium populations, which may differentially affect the survival of resistant and sensitive isolates. In order to improve effectiveness of current strategies, the influence of interaction of fitness characteristics and fungicide treatments on proliferation of fungicide-resistant isolates needs to be elucidated. A collection of 44 field isolates of P. aphanidermatum was used to investigate variation in fitness characteristics. Growth rate of mycelia, sporulation capacity, and aggressiveness on perennial ryegrass, along with sensitivity to <b>mefenoxam,</b> were quantified. Sixteen isolates showed complete resistance to <b>mefenoxam.</b> In 28 sensitive isolates, <b>mefenoxam</b> sensitivity was not correlated with the other three fitness characteristics. A wide variation in fitness characteristics was detected among the isolates. In the second phase of the research, two test populations were constructed by mixing two mefenoxam-sensitive isolates possessing different fitness characteristics with a mefenoxamresistant isolate in appropriate ratios. Changes in the proportion of resistant isolates within each population under six fungicide treatments were monitored during five cycles of selection on perennial ryegrass under controlled conditions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} early treatment effect of soybean seeds and pre-sowing with different combinations of chemicals on the establishment of plants and crop yield performance. The design was in randomized blocks in a 2 x 7 factorial arrangement, with two times for seed treatment and seven treatments (six chemical treatments and an untreated control). The treatments were: 1) fipronil + pyraclostrobin + thiophanate methyl; 2) imidacloprid + thiodicarb + carbendazin + thiram; 3) abamectin + thiamethoxam + fludioxonil + <b>mefenoxam</b> + thiabendazole; 4) carbendazin + thiram; 5) fludioxonil + <b>mefenoxam</b> + thiabendazole; 6) carboxin + thiram; and 7) untreated control (water only). The assessments were: seedling emergence, final stand, plant height and insertion of first pod, number of pods per plant, seeds per pod and per plant, thousand-seed weight and grain yield. Early treatment of soybean seeds (240 days prior to sowing) hinders the establishment of the crop, the thousand-seed weight and grain yield in relation to the pre-sowing treatment. Chemical treatments tested containing fungicides and insecticides associated favor the establishment of the crop, but do not alter the soybean yield performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{neonicotinoid}} seed treatments on beneficial insects {{has been a}} controversial topic during the last years. While neonicotinoids are usually used as mixtures with systemic fungicides, {{few studies have examined}} the impact of the mixtures on beneficial insects. Pesticide mixtures can have synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects on the toxicity of neonicotinoids on non-target species. ^ Thiamethoxam with <b>mefenoxam</b> is the most used neonicotinoid insecticide/fungicide mixture applied to soybean. Based on the systemic nature of thiamethoxam and <b>mefenoxam,</b> residues of this insecticide/fungicide mixture can be present in soybean vegetative and floral tissue with potential impacts to beneficial insects. This study focuses on the interaction of these compounds, their environmental fate in plants, their toxic effects on honey bees, and lethal and sub-lethal effects on key predatory species in soybean. ^ Concentrations of neonicotinoids in both floral and vegetative tissues were low or not detected, and the effects on target and non-target insects {{are more likely to be}} sub-lethal, if at all. There was a mild antagonist interaction with the fungicide, resulting in reduced honey bee mortality. In predatory species, there were no significant differences in the abundance of Orius insidiosus and Chrysoperla rufilabris in soybean treated with thiamethoxam alone or with the mixture. Consumption of soybean aphid by both predators was not affected at evaluated concentrations of thiamethoxam in the insect prey. However, laboratory studies on toxicity of thiamethoxam on Orius insidiosus suggest potential toxic effects of this neonicotinoid based on the time of arrival of the predator to the field and the type of exposure to neonicotinoids. ^ Toxicity studies of mixtures of different classes of pesticides used in seed treatments are rarely available. To our knowledge this is the first study that evaluates the interaction of <b>mefenoxam</b> on acute toxicity of thiamethoxam. Studies of mixture toxicity of seed mixtures are imperative to minimize the risk of pesticides to beneficial insects by a careful selection of products with lower toxicity. ...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas {{isolates}} {{from different}} crop plants were screened for in vitro growth inhibition of Phytophthora capsici {{and production of}} biosurfactant. Two in vivo experiments were performed to determine the efficacy of selected Pseudomonas strains against Phytophthora blight of pepper by comparing two fungicide treatments [acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) and ASM + mefenoxam]. Bacterial isolates were applied by soil drenching (1 × 10 ⁸ cells/ml), ASM (0. 1 μg a. i. /ml) and ASM + <b>mefenoxam</b> (0. 2 mg product/ml) were applied by foliar spraying, and P. capsici inoculum was incorporated into the pot soil three days after treatments. In the first experiment, four Pseudomonas strains resulted in significant reduction from 48. 4 to 61. 3 % in Phytophthora blight severity. In the second experiment, bacterial treatments combining with olive oil (5 mL per plant) significantly enhanced biological control activity, resulting in a reduction of disease level ranging from 56. 8 to 81. 1 %. ASM + <b>mefenoxam</b> was the most effective treatment while ASM alone was less effective in both bioassays. These results indicate that our Pseudomonas fluorescens strains (6 L 10, 6 ba 6 and 3 ss 9) that have biosurfactant-producing abilities are effective against P. capsici on pepper, and enhanced disease suppression could be achieved when they were used in combination with olive oil...|$|E
40|$|In 2006, 2007, and 2008, we sampled 257 {{isolates}} of Phytophthora capsici from vegetables at 22 {{sites in}} four regions of New York, to determine variation in <b>mefenoxam</b> resistance and population genetic structure. Isolates were assayed for <b>mefenoxam</b> resistance and genotyped for mating type and five microsatellite loci. We found mefenoxam-resistant isolates {{at a high}} frequency in the Capital District and Long Island, but none were found in western New York or central New York. Both A 1 and A 2 mating types were found at 12 of the 22 sites, and we detected 126 distinct multilocus genotypes, only nine of which were found at more than one site. Significant differentiation (FST) was found in more than 98 % of the pairwise comparisons between sites; approximately 24 and 16 % {{of the variation in}} the population was attributed to differences among regions and sites, respectively. These results indicate that P. capsici in New York is highly diverse, but gene flow among regions and fields is restricted. Therefore, each field needs to be considered an independent population, and efforts to prevent movement of inoculum among fields need to be further emphasized {{to prevent the spread of}} this pathogen. © 2010 The American Phytopathological Society.

The disease is of worldwide importance and causes significant economic losses each year. Fungicides have been commonly used for the control of Phytophthora blight of pepper (Hwang and Kim, 1995). However, alternative methods of disease control are needed because {{of the emergence of}} pathogen strains resistant to the chemicals such as <b>mefenoxam</b> and metalaxyl (Parra and Ristaino, 2001) and the high concern about the adverse effects of pesticides on {{human health and the environment}} (World Health Organization, 1990).|$|E
40|$|Fungicides applied as soil drenches {{have been}} shown to {{adversely}} affect beneficial Arbuscular-Mycorrhizal Fungal (AMF) colonization of plant roots. We tested the effects of four common fungicides applied as seed treatments, <b>mefenoxam,</b> thiram, tebuconazole+metalaxyl and captan, on colonization of muskmelon (Cucumis melo), squash (Cucurbita pepo and C. moschata), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and corn (Zea mays) roots by the AMF Glomus intraradices. All inoculated seedlings were colonized with AMF, with treatment averages ranging from 6 to 99 % root length containing hyphae and 0 to 68 % containing vesicles. Overall, fungicidal seed treatment effects on AMF colonization were relatively minor and where significant effects were noted, they were inconsistent across species and/or sampling times. This study provides evidence that fungicidal seed treatments can be compatible with AMF inoculation and colonization...|$|E
40|$|There is no cucurbit {{cultivar}} with measurable {{resistance against}} Phytophthora blight, caused by Phytophthora capsici, available. Genetic complexity of sources of Phytophthora resistance and variation in genetics of P. capsici are the serious challenge in {{breeding for resistance}} to Phytophthora blight. At present, cultural practices and chemical use are the options for managing Phytophthora blight of cucurbits. The most effective strategy for controlling P. capsici in cucurbits was an integrated approach of crop rotation for ≥ 3 years, seed treatment with <b>mefenoxam</b> (0. 42 ml Apron XL LS/kg of seed), avoiding the use of contaminated water with P. capsici, and fungicide spray-applications. Among more than 50 fungicides tested, only dimethomorph (Acrobat, Forum), famoxadone-cymoxanil (Tanos), cyazofamid (Ranman), zoxamide-mancozeb (Gavel), mandipropamid (Ravus), and captan were found effective for control of P. capsici.

40|$|Stress {{caused by}} biotic factors can reduce soybean yields. It has been {{suggested}} that the soybean yield stagnation in Iowa could be related to stress caused by soilborne pathogens. Common agronomic practices could be selecting for pathogens considered minor (like Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia spp.) that are not managed by rotation, and no host resistance is available in the market to protect plants from infection. Soil fumigation has been the classic tool used to study the effect of root pathogens on root health and yield of many crops. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess root health in Iowa using soil fumigation. This research focused on early season pathogens and their potential interactions with beneficial organisms. It was hypothesized that soil fumigation could increase yield, decrease incidence of root-infecting pathogens, and have a profound effect on root characteristics. Furthermore, because of the proven beneficial effect that arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) have in soybean yields, it was also included to detect potential interaction with major soilborne pathogens like soybean cyst nematode (SCN), and to determine if seed-applied fungicides (<b>mefenoxam,</b> fludioxonil, <b>mefenoxam</b> + fludioxonil) affect AM colonization. At each of three locations in Iowa (De Witt, Nevada, and Whiting), 4 ha were fumigated with 1, 3 -dichloropropene in a mixture with chloropicrin from 2004 through 2006. There was evidence of an increase in yield of 400 kg ha- 1 caused by fumigation, although the response was not consistent across years and locations. Fumigation increased root surface area and root length density, but the effect varied according to location and cultivars. At Whiting, a high yielding location, there were no correlations between root characteristics and yield. At 21 day after emergence (DAE) a 27 % decrease in Pythium spp. incidence was found but with no changes in Rhizoctonia spp. or Phytophthora spp. incidence. Eighty-percent of the Pythium spp. isolated from seedlings was pathogenic. Visual root health ratings were not affected by fumigation but were correlated with Pythium spp. incidence. Positive correlations were found between SCN and Pythium spp., which was confirmed by higher incidence of Pythium spp. incidence in SCN-susceptible cultivars. Fumigation did not effectively decreased or increased AM colonization, and the observed differences were attributed to different levels of mycorrhizal dependency among varieties. Seed applied fungicides did not negatively affect AM colonization, although a slight reduction associated with the use of <b>mefenoxam</b> was observed on 2005, as well as an increase in colonization when fludioxonil was used. It was suggested that fludioxonil gave AM a competitive advantage over Rhizoctonia, the most prevalent pathogen in 2005. Overall, the factors that influenced yield the most were the presence or absence of the SCN-resistance trait. The use of SCN resistant cultivars could indirectly lead to an increased root health by reducing incidence of Pythium, and Rhizoctonia. Furthermore, locations with high SCN population densities at planting had the lowest yields...|$|E
