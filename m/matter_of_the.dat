5|$|Mahavira's teachings were {{compiled}} by his Ganadhara (chief disciple), Gautama Swami. The sacred canonical scriptures comprised twelve parts. According to the Digambaras, Āchārya Bhutabali {{was the last}} ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. Later, some learned Āchāryas started to restore, compile, and write down the teachings of Mahavira that were the subject <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Agamas. Āchārya Dharasena, in the 1stcentury CE, guided Āchārya Pushpadant and Āchārya Bhutabali as they wrote down these teachings. The two Āchāryas wrote on palm leaves, Ṣaṭkhaṅḍāgamaamong the oldest known Digambara Jain texts.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} {{of the book and}} the subject <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory. In this light, critic Peter Schwenger asserts that Agrippa can be understood as organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself. In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.|$|E

5|$|The tariff levels {{had been}} a major {{political}} issue since before the Civil War, and they became the most dominant <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1888 election.

5|$|All {{of these}} {{decisions}} were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or {{representative of the}} pope, {{as well as many}} bishops and abbots. Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to AlexanderII, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope GregoryVII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.|$|E
5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent state {{apparatus}} of the Orange Free State. He designed the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the model state the Orange Free State was to become in later years. Having worked in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, the government, and the State, Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the state apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live on with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E

The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the ailanthus silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production.

5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown the <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stolen money. Morrison {{claims to be}} working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E
5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that the subject <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind {{since the middle of}} the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.|$|E
