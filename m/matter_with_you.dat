500|$|What is the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> that, {{that even}} after the unending admissions of guilt in [...] you cannot stop {{representing}} yourself ever more radically as a criminal for whom twenty years in prison was [...] "too little"?... {{there appears to be}} a vast and incomprehensible discrepancy between your humble confessions and your present way of life. [...] For the former would lead one to expect a Speer in sackcloth and ashes; I, however, know you as a merry fellow who undertakes one lovely journey after another and who happily regales his old chums with tales of his literary and financial successes... our accusations against your former colleagues (Göring, Goebbels, Bormann, etc.) who, being dead, cannot defend themselves are agony to me... I hope and think that the day will come when you will no longer find it necessary to confess your guilt to all and sundry in order to persuade yourself of your virtue.|$|E
500|$|A heated {{nomination}} battle emerged between Clinton and Barack Obama. Ferraro became livid and distraught {{when one}} of her daughters voted for Obama in the Massachusetts primary, saying [...] "What is the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> <b>you?</b> You know Hillary. You have seen my involvement with her." [...] When her daughter responded by noting that Obama was inspirational, Ferraro snapped, [...] "What does he inspire you to do, leave your husband and three kids and your practice and go work for Doctors Without Borders?" [...] This {{was seen as an}} example of a generational difference among American women; in contrast to Ferraro's generation, younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president (especially one with Clinton's past history) compared to what writer Anne Kornblut called [...] "the milestone of electing an African American president". According to Kornblut, younger voters saw [...] "Clinton [...] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn't gotten there on her own".|$|E
2500|$|To {{build on}} the song's success, Motown {{released}} a duet album recorded with fellow Motown singing star Marvin Gaye, Together.

2500|$|Notre Dame {{football}} historian, John Kryk, later wrote: [...] "With that flowery lead, E.A. Batchelor of the Detroit Free Press popularized a moniker Notre Dame {{teams would}} later come to embrace– and aptly {{summed up the}} greatest athletic achievement to that point in Notre Dame history." [...] Kryk noted that, according to Notre Dame folklore, Batchelor had overheard a Notre Dame player trying to motivate his teammates at halftime by pleading, [...] "What's the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> guys?

2500|$|While hosting The Late Late Show, Tubridy {{has often}} clashed {{with his own}} guests, {{including}} Gordon Ramsay ("a bit, em, British for my liking"), Louis Walsh (giving Jedward a [...] "hard time" [...] on The Late Late Toy Show), Sinéad O'Connor (the [...] "crazy performing monkey" [...] incident), former MEP Paul Murphy (whose guest appearance contrasted glaringly with Miriam O'Callaghan's Prime Time interview of Enda Kenny the previous night) and Mia Farrow ("What's the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> anyway? Jesus!"). In May 2011, {{a former director of}} television at RTÉ, Helen O'Rahilly, said of The Late Late Show: “If I was back in charge of RTÉ, you wouldn't see this utter shite on Friday night”.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Gaye {{recorded}} a successful duet album with singer Mary Wells titled Together, which reached No. 42 on the pop album chart. The album's two-sided single, including [...] "Once Upon a Time" [...] and 'What's the <b>Matter</b> <b>With</b> <b>You</b> Baby", each {{reach the top}} 20. Gaye's next solo hit, [...] "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)", which Holland-Dozier-Holland wrote for him, reached No. 6 on the Hot 100 and reached the top 50 in the UK. Gaye started getting television exposure around this time, on shows such as American Bandstand. Also in 1964, he appeared in the concert film, The T.A.M.I. Show. Gaye had two number-one R singles in 1965 with the Miracles–composed [...] "I'll Be Doggone" [...] and [...] "Ain't That Peculiar". Both songs became million-sellers. After this, Gaye returned to jazz-derived ballads for a tribute album to the recently-deceased Nat [...] "King" [...] Cole.|$|E

2500|$|When the Seventh Fleet's escort {{carriers}} {{found themselves}} {{under attack from}} the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours, a message was received from Admiral Nimitz: [...] "Where is repeat where is Task Force 34? The world wonders". The tail end of this message, The world wonders, was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat {{on the deck of}} the bridge and began cursing. Finally Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral Robert [...] "Mick" [...] Carney, confronted him, telling Halsey [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> <b>you?</b> Pull yourself together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Batchelor also {{covered the}} Michigan Wolverines {{football}} {{team for the}} Free Press. After a predominantly Irish Notre Dame football team defeated Michigan, 11–3, in November 1909, Batchelor opened his report on {{the game with a}} line that gave the Notre Dame their nickname. Batchelor wrote, [...] "Eleven fighting Irishmen wrecked the Yost machine this afternoon. These sons of Erin, individually and collectively representing the University of Notre Dame, not only beat the Michigan team, but they dashed some of Michigan's fondest hopes ..." [...] Notre Dame football historian, John Kryk, later wrote: [...] "With that flowery lead, E.A. Batchelor of the Detroit Free Press popularized a moniker Notre Dame teams would later come to embrace - and aptly summed up the greatest athletic achievement to that point in Notre Dame history." [...] Kryk noted that, according to Notre Dame folklore, Batchelor had overheard a Notre Dame player trying to motivate his teammates at halftime by pleading, [...] "What's the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> guys? You're all Irish and you're not fighting worth a lick." ...|$|E
2500|$|The message (and its {{trailing}} padding) became famous, {{and created}} some ill feeling, since {{it appeared to}} be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey's decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. [...] "I was stunned as if I had been struck in the face", Halsey later recalled. [...] "The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something I am ashamed to remember", letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey's chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey's emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him, shouting, [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> <b>you?</b> Pull yourself together!" [...] Recognizing his failure, Halsey sulked in inactivity for a full hour while Taffy 3 was fighting for its lifefalsely claiming to be refueling his shipsbefore eventually turning around with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers and heading back to Samar, too late to have any impact on the battle.|$|E

2500|$|Stocky, {{grinning}} Capt. Frank Monroe Hawks, famed publicity flyer, {{holder of}} nearly all informal city-to-city speed records in the U.S. and Europe, was not grinning one day last week when attendants at the Worcester, Massachusetts, airport pulled him from beneath his crashed Travel Air [...] "Mystery Plane" [...] Texaco 13. Day before he had hopped from Detroit (in 3 hr. 5 min.). lectured the Worcester Boy Scouts on the necessity of developing foolproof planes, but had delayed his departure until the next morning because of a soggy field. An escort plane had nosed up when it landed just ahead of Capt. Hawks. After attempting to take off from a short dirt road which cut diagonally across the airport, he headed his low-wing monoplane down the field, less than 700 ft. in length. Oozy ground sucked at the wheels, kept him from attaining the 70 m.p.h. required to zoom off. Toward {{the end of the}} runway, going about 50 m.p.h., the ship bounced off a low mound, cut through heavy undergrowth, somersaulted over a stone wall. Hawks cut the motor in time, and saved himself from cremation. Capt. Hawks's nose and jaw were fractured, his face badly battered, several of his big, white teeth knocked out. He lay unconscious in the hospital for hours. Said Harvard Medical School's famed plastic surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian: [...] "I do not think his speech will be affected. The operation for restoring his face should leave scarcely a scar." [...] Capt. Hawks's good friend Will Rogers wired: [...] "Sure glad nothing broke but your jaw. That will keep you still for a while. If I broke my jaw, I could still wire gags. What's the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> anyhow; are you getting... brittle?" ...|$|E
