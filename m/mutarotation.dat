5000|$|The open-chain form is {{thermodynamically}} unstable, and it spontaneously isomerizes to the cyclic forms. (Although {{the ring}} closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, {{these would be}} highly strained, and are not observed in practice.) In solutions at room temperature, the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called <b>mutarotation.</b> [...] Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of α:β 36:64.

50|$|Anomerization is {{the process}} of {{conversion}} of one anomer to the other. For reducing sugars, anomerization is referred to as <b>mutarotation</b> and occurs readily in solution and is catalyzed by acid and base. This reversible process typically leads to an anomeric mixture in which eventually an equilibrium is reached between the two single anomers.The ratio of the two anomers is specific for the regarding sugar. For example, regardless of the configuration of the starting D-glucose, a solution will gradually move towards being a mixture of approximately 64% β-D-glucopyranoside and 36% of α-D-glucopyranose. As the ratio changes, the optical rotation of the mixture changes; this phenomenon is called <b>mutarotation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anomers can be interconverted {{through a}} process known as <b>mutarotation.</b> The anomeric effect more {{accurately}} called the endo-anomeric effect is the propensity for heteroatoms at C-1 to be oriented axially. This is counter intuitive as one would expect the equatorially anomer to be the thermodynamic product. This effect has been rationalized through dipole-dipole repulsion and n-σ* arguments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mutarotation</b> was {{discovered}} by Dubrunfaut in 1846, when {{he noticed that the}} specific rotation of aqueous sugar solution changes with time. In the same paper, he also identified that the inversion of sucrose in the presence of brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was not a consequence of fermentation. The organic fructose molecule was subsequently discovered by Dubrunfaut in 1847.|$|E
50|$|The process only {{provides}} {{direct access}} to aldoses, whereas some sugars of interest may instead be ketoses. Some ketoses may be accessible from similar aldoses by isomerization via an enediol intermediate; for example, on standing in aqueous base, glucose, fructose, and mannose will slowly interconvert since they share an enediol form. (See <b>mutarotation).</b> Some unusual sugars are also accessible via aldol addition.|$|E
50|$|The furanose ring {{will have}} either alpha or beta configuration, {{depending}} on which direction the anomeric hydroxy group is pointing. In a -configuration furanose, alpha configuration has the hydroxy pointing down, and beta has the hydroxy pointing up. It is the opposite in an -configuration furanose. Typically, the anomeric carbon undergoes <b>mutarotation</b> in solution, {{and the result is}} an equilibrium mixture of alpha-beta configurations.|$|E
50|$|Cyclization {{creates a}} new {{stereogenic}} center at the carbonyl-bearing carbon. The −OH group that replaces the carbonyl's oxygen may end up in two distinct positions relative to the ring's midplane. Thus each open-chain monosaccharide yields two cyclic isomers (anomers), denoted by the prefixes α- and β-. The molecule can change between these two forms by a process called <b>mutarotation,</b> that consists in {{a reversal of the}} ring-forming reaction followed by another ring formation.|$|E

50|$|The {{observed}} {{rotation of}} the sample is the weighted sum of the optical rotation of each anomer weighted {{by the amount of}} that anomer present. Therefore, one can use a polarimeter to measure the rotation of a sample and then calculate the ratio of the two anomers present from the enantiomeric excess, as long as one knows the rotation of each pure anomer. One can monitor the <b>mutarotation</b> process over time or determine the equilibrium mixture by observing the optical rotation and how it changes.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in this {{sequence}} is sodium hypobromite addition to quinotoxine to an N-bromo intermediate possibly with structure 2. The second step is organic oxidation with sodium ethoxide in ethanol. Because of the basic conditions the initial product quininone interconverts with quinidinone via a common enol intermediate and <b>mutarotation</b> is observed. In the third step the ketone group is reduced with aluminum powder and sodium ethoxide in ethanol and quinine can be identified.

50|$|<b>Mutarotation</b> {{consists}} of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different -OH group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the α and β forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is {{an essential component of}} the equilibrium.|$|E
50|$|The enzymatic {{mechanism}} of influenza virus sialidase {{has been studied}} by Taylor et al., shown in Figure 1. The enzyme catalysis process has four steps. The first step involves the distortion of the α-sialoside from a 2C5 chair conformation (the lowest-energy form in solution) to a pseudoboat conformation when the sialoside binds to the sialidase. The second step leads to an oxocarbocation intermediate, the sialosyl cation. The third step is the formation of Neu5Ac initially as the α-anomer, and then <b>mutarotation</b> and release as the more thermodynamically-stable β-Neu5Ac.|$|E
50|$|For example, if a {{solution}} of β-D-glucopyranose is dissolved in water, its specific optical rotation will be +18.7. Over time, some of the β-D-glucopyranose will undergo <b>mutarotation</b> to become α-D-glucopyranose, which has an optical rotation of +112.2. Thus {{the rotation of the}} solution will increase from +18.7 to an equilibrium value of +52.5 as some of the β form is converted to the α form. The equilibrium mixture is actually about 64% of β-D-glucopyranose and about 36% of α-D-glucopyranose, though there are also with traces of the other forms including furanoses and open chained form. The α anomer is the major conformer, although somewhat controversially; {{this is due to the}} anomeric effect with the stabilisation energy provided by n-σ* hyperconjugation.|$|E

40|$|When {{crystalline}} α-d-glucose {{prepared by}} crystallisation from cold concentrated acetic acid is dissolved in water its specific rotation is 113. 4 °, but slowly changes to 52. 5 °; β-d-glucose has an initial specific rotation of 17. 5 ° which also changes to 52. 5 °.

The full assignment of shifts for the various fructose tautomers enabled the use of 1 H NMR spectroscopy in studies of the <b>mutarotation</b> (5 – 25 C) and tautomeric composition at equilibrium (5 – 50 C). The <b>mutarotation</b> of b-pyranose to furanose tautomers in D 2 O at a concentration of 0. 18 M was found to have an activation energy of 62. 6 kJ mol 1.

40|$|Commercially {{available}} lactose {{is generally}} {{available in the}} form of alpha lactose monohydrate. The dissolution of this is slow in comparison to other sugars due to lactose existing in solution as alpha and beta lactose. When alpha lactose monohydrate has dissolved up to the alpha lactose solubility limit, no more can dissolve until some of the alpha lactose in solution has mutarotated to beta lactose. This makes <b>mutarotation</b> and the solubility of alpha lactose the two main limiting factors in lactose dissolution. A variety of factors can affect the <b>mutarotation</b> rate and solubility of lactose. Temperature and pH affect both significantly. The effect of carbohydrates in solution on the solubility of alpha lactose is particularly important as it has been found that beta lactose inhibits the solubility of alpha lactose. Dissolution of alpha lactose may be considered to consist of three steps; surface disintegration from the crystal, dissolution into the bulk of solution, and <b>mutarotation</b> of alpha to beta in solution. Attempts to model this process have previously been unsuccessful. For dissolution to total lactose concentrations above the alpha lactose solubility limit, {{it was found that the}} effect of beta lactose on the solubility of alpha lactose had a significant effect on the dissolution of lactose. For dissolution to total lactose concentrations below the alpha lactose solubility limit, it was found that the surface disintegration reaction was significant, particularly at low temperatures.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{computational}} study a complete reaction {{mechanism for the}} sugar's <b>mutarotation</b> promoted by tautomeric catalysts in vacuum is outlined. The rate determining step of the process consists in {{the breaking of the}} C-O bond of the sugar ring which occurs by a concerted double proton transfer between the substrate and the catalyst. After ring opening, the -CHO group of the substrate rotates around the C 2 -C 3 bond without dissociation of the substrate catalyst adduct. Theactivation energy of this step is generally less than 8 - 9 kcal mol(- 1). Alternative reaction paths which require the dissociation of the substrate catalyst complex are less favourable for both probability and energetic reasons. When the <b>mutarotation</b> is catalysed by the 2 -pyridone/ 2 -hydroxypyridine (PD/HP) tautomeric couple, the process may be promoted by either PD or HP derived from the dissociation of the (PD) (2), (HP) (2) or PD-HP dimers. According to B 3 LYP and MP 4 (SDQ) calculations the HP-promoted reaction path should be faster than the PD-promoted one. When the process is catalysed by the formamide/formamidic acid (F/FA) tautomeric couple, the reaction path promoted by FA, which is derived from the dissociation of the F-FA dimer, should be the most favourable, according to B 3 LYP, MP 2 and MP 4 (SDQ) calculations. Solvent effects in benzene, calculated by the PCM method, did not affect to a relevant extent the mechanism outlined in vacuum. The present study suggests, differing from the hypothesis formulated in many experimental studies, that the sugar's <b>mutarotation</b> process is more efficiently catalysed by the less stable tautomer or catalyst dimer rather than by the more stable one of both the PD/HP and F/FA couples...|$|E

Important differences are shown by pD vs. <b>mutarotation</b> rate profiles of 1 and 2. Coordination, in fact, causes: i) a spectacular {{increase of the}} rate due to kinetic template assistance of the carboxylic tail holding the metal {{in close proximity to}} the reactive centre and ii) a change in the dependence of the rate on the pD.

Analysis of up to twelve direct and reverse rate constants in the pD range 7. 0 – 2. 5 evidences ring size memory, and at least one reaction path which bypasses the aldehydo open chain intermediate.
