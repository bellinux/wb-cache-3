5|$|It now {{dawned on}} the Privy Council {{that it had}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake.</b> Led by the Earl of Arundel and the Earl of Pembroke, on 19 July the Council {{publicly}} proclaimed Mary as queen; Jane's nine-day reign came to an end. The proclamation triggered wild rejoicing throughout London. Stranded in Cambridge, Northumberland proclaimed Mary himselfâ€”as he had been commanded to do by {{a letter from the}} Council. William Paget and the Earl of Arundel rode to Framlingham to beg Mary's pardon, and Arundel arrested Northumberland on 24 July. Northumberland was beheaded on 22 August, shortly after renouncing Protestantism. His recantation dismayed his daughter-in-law, Jane, who followed him to the scaffold on 12 February 1554, after her father's involvement in Wyatt's rebellion.|$|E
500|$|Jimmy Burns, {{reviewing}} {{the book for}} the Financial Times, speculated that it was plausible that [...] "MI6's senior management realised they had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> in recruiting someone who thought that espionage was just one big adventure." [...] He concluded, however, that the book [...] "left me with {{the feeling that the}} spooks in Whitehall could have avoided a great deal of adverse publicity by agreeing to Tomlinson's original proposal: an employment tribunal held in camera." ...|$|E
500|$|Streep's {{first feature}} film role came {{opposite}} Jane Fonda in the 1977 film Julia, {{in which she}} had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: [...] "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake,</b> no more movies. I hate this business". However, Streep cites Fonda as having a lasting influence on her as an actress, and has credited her as [...] "open probably more doors than I probably even know about".|$|E

500|$|The new {{publisher}} scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, {{and began}} a campaign against vice. The Los Angeles police chief, James E. Davis, had a hands-off policy {{when it came to}} vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue. [...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake.</b> I helped them do it. But damn it, I had to make a living." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} {{widespread}} speculation, based on Riggs' unusually poor play and {{large number of}} unforced errors, that Riggs had purposely lost the match {{in order to win}} large sums of money that he had bet against himself, as a way to pay off his gambling debts. ESPN's Outside the Lines on August 25, 2013 featured {{a man who had been}} silent for 40 years who said he heard several members of the mafia talking about Riggs throwing the match in exchange for cancelling his gambling debt to the mob. On the other hand, the article says Riggs' close friend and estate executor Lornie Kuhle vehemently denied he was ever in debt to the mob or received a payoff from them. The article also quotes Riggs' son who claims his father felt he had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> and was depressed for six months following the match. Riggs wanted a rematch but not King. He considered suing her as a rematch had been part of the contract. King and Riggs would appear together spoofing their rivalry less than two months after the match on an episode of The Odd Couple (titled [...] "The Pig Who Came To Dinner") and they became good friends.|$|E

2500|$|Originally from Chicago, Illinois, Lewis {{had several}} run-ins {{with the law}} during the 1880s and early 90s. In 1880, Lewis was arrested for the {{shooting}} of Boston thief Billy Flynn in Detroit but was acquitted by a jury who ruled he had acted in self-defense. He later made the acquaintance of Gen. John A. Logan and, one night while dining {{with him at the}} Fifth Avenue Hotel, a hotel detective informed Logan of Lewis's identity. Logan scoffed at the detective's claim and remarked [...] "Why sir, that man is one of my best friends. You have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> here". Lewis excused himself after borrowing $500 from him and disappeared. He similarly befriended Charles Francis Adams and lured the elderly man into a Boston Common banco game where he and his friends swindled him out of several thousand dollars. Later in Philadelphia, he represented himself to Samuel J. Randall as the son of banker A.J. Drexel. He was apparently so convincing that, when the actual son of Drexel called on the house by chance, Ramsden believed the young man was the impostor and threw him out of his home. He and another noted banco man, [...] "Western Sam", spent an entire summer in Long Branch, New Jersey where they conned over $100,000 from residents. 3 May 1896 ...|$|E

Hitherto all who have ventured to measure their {{strength}} with the cardinal have been worsted, and many have lost everything and are now fugitives from France. Some have lost their lives as well as honours and estates. Bouillon is an independent prince, and so was Lorraine, and although the latter could put ten men {{in the field to}} every one the duke could muster, he has been driven from his principality. Soissons could not help him except with his name, nor can the Archbishop of Rheims. Not a few of the great nobles would join the duke did they think that he had a prospect of success. None have so far done so, though possibly some have given him secret pledges, which will count for nothing unless it seems that he is likely to triumph.|$|E

60|$|But he {{knew that}} he was no longer fit for a man's work, and that it would be well that he should abandon it. He had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake.</b> In his old age he had gambled for a large stake, and had lost it all. He had ventured to love;--to {{increase}} the small number of those who were nearest and dearest to him, to add one to those whom he regarded as best and purest,--and he had been terribly deceived. He had for many years almost worshipped the one lady who had sat at his table, and now in his old age he had asked her to share her place of honour with another. What that other was need not now be told. And the world knew that this woman was to have been his wife! He had boasted loudly that he would give her that place and those rights. He had ventured his all upon her innocence and her purity. He had ventured his all,--and he had lost.|$|E

You {{have never}} heard me speak of them before, and I {{consider}} the aims of these men would bring about anarchy. An anarchy that would deluge the land with blood seems to me detestable and wicked. But I cannot but think the government has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake</b> by its severity. These people are all enthusiastic fanatics. They see that things are not as they should be, and they would destroy everything to right them. Hate their aims as one may, one must admit that their conduct is heroic. Few have quailed in their trials. All preserve a calmness of demeanour that even their judges and executioners cannot but admire. They seem made of iron; they suffer everything, give up everything, dare everything for their faith; they die, as the Christian martyrs died in Rome, unflinching, unrepentant. If they have become as wild beasts, severity has made them so. Their propaganda was at first a peaceful one. It is cruelty that has driven them to use the only weapon at their disposal, assassination.|$|E
60|$|He {{took out}} his newspaper, {{but he could not}} fix his mind upon the {{politics}} of the day. Had he not <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>mistake?</b> Of what use to him in life would be that thing of a woman that sat opposite to him? Had not a great punishment come upon him, and had he not deserved the punishment? In truth, a great punishment had come upon him. It was not only that he had married a woman incapable of understanding the higher duties of married life, but that he himself would have been capable of appreciating the value of a woman who did understand them. He would have been happy with Lily Dale; and therefore we may surmise that his unhappiness with Lady Alexandrina would be the greater. There are men who, in marrying such as Lady Alexandrina de Courcy, would get the article best suited to them, as Mortimer Gazebee had done in marrying her sister. Miss Griselda Grantly, who had become Lady Dumbello, though somewhat colder and somewhat cleverer than Lady Alexandrina, had been of the same sort. But in marrying her, Lord Dumbello had got the article best suited to him;--if only the ill-natured world would allow him to keep the article. It was in this that Crosbie's failure had been so grievous,--that he had seen and approved the better course, but had chosen for himself to walk in that which was worse. During that week at Courcy Castle,--the week which he passed there immediately after his second visit to Allington,--he had deliberately made up his mind that he was more fit for the bad course than for the good one. The course was now before him, and {{he had no choice but}} to walk in it.|$|E
