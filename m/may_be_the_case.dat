5|$|During Operation Market Garden, the Allied {{parachute}} landings in the Netherlands, JG 11 {{was credited}} with 22 aircraft downed on 22 September, with two credited to Specht. Four days later, Specht claimed two RAF Hawker Typhoons near Deventer. According to RAF records only three Typhoons were shot down on 26 September; two to flak and one in aerial combat against Jagdgeschwader 53 Bf 109s near Apeldoorn. No fighters were recorded lost near Deventer. However, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that loss records were lost or not well kept, meaning Specht's claims cannot be traced and may well be accurate.|$|E
5|$|The time-line for Salamis is {{difficult}} to establish with any certainty. Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> but it is probably {{more likely that the}} Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying. Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at Phalerum. Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk. Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.|$|E
5|$|There are differing {{levels of}} {{qualification}} that the ambulance crew may hold, from holding no formal qualification to having a fully qualified doctor on board. Most ambulance services require at least two crew members to be on every ambulance (one to drive, and one to attend the patient), although response cars may have a sole crew member, possibly backed up by another double-crewed ambulance. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that only the attendant need be qualified, and the driver might have no medical training. In some locations, an advanced life support ambulance may be crewed by one paramedic and one EMT-Basic.|$|E

5|$|Many endemic Mascarene birds, {{including}} the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), {{are derived from}} South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for all the parrots there as well. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so {{it was possible for}} species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Newton and Gadow found the Rodrigues parrot to be closely related to the broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) due to their large jaws and other osteological features, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a head-crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It {{is also important to}} note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} children {{make use of}} multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues {{are available from the}} start of word learning, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use {{of a wide range of}} cues develops over time.|$|E

5|$|Observations {{show that}} nuptial flight {{does not occur}} before February. This is based on larvae {{spinning}} into cocoons by November, and by January, these cocoons could not produce adult workers or reproductive males and females. Queens are most likely fertilised by males sometime between February and April; however, scientists have seen alates engage in nuptial flight during March. Before emerging from their parent nest, queens will shed their wings inside the nest and mate with low-flying males nearby. After nuptial flight, a queen will isolate herself and form a small chamber underground, where she remains for seven to eight months. However, it is improbable that a queen can survive on her own storage of fat and wing-musculature for that long. During this time, the queen may emerge from her nest occasionally, but she will only lay eggs from October to November {{when there is a}} rich supply of food. While this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> some queens will lay eggs after a month of isolation during winter. M.regularis is a semi-clasutral ant, meaning that a queen will go out and forage in order to feed her young. Queens will emerge from their nests from time to time, during which they will capture insects for their young or feed on sweet substances. If food sources are deprived, a queen will only rely on her fat to feed the larvae until she perishes or finds food, but the larvae will not be cannibalised, and remain alive until a week after the queen's death. An individual ant may take eight months to develop from an egg to an adult.|$|E
