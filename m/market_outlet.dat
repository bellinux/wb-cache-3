40|$|In {{the era of}} {{a global}} economy, farmers face {{increasing}} pressure in developing a portfolio of various marketing channels. However, the literature on direct marketing strategies has mainly focused on consumers. Using farm-level data this study investigates factors associated with the choice of three direct marketing strategies. We apply a selectivity based approach for the multinomial logit model to assess {{the relationship between the}} choice of direct sales marketing strategy on the financial performance of the business. Findings from this study suggest that obtaining an Internet connection and accessing the Internet for farm commerce increases the likelihood of using intermediated <b>marketing</b> <b>outlets.</b> Using the Internet for farm commerce and operating diversified farms (more enterprises) is associated with increases in the likelihood that the farmer relies on direct to consumer <b>marketing</b> <b>outlets.</b> The gender of the operator, the portfolio of input acquisition and management practices, and participation in Federal, State, or local farm program payments is positively associated with total farm sales in all three direct marketing strategies. Finally, an accurate evaluation of the projected earnings from the direct-to-consumer <b>marketing</b> <b>outlet</b> must account for selectivity effects. direct <b>marketing</b> <b>outlets,</b> multinomial logit, farm sales, selectivity correction, Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, Farm Management, Production Economics,...|$|R

Primary data were collected from 120 farmers and 37 wheat traders using structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and Econometrics models were used to analyze the collected data. Results show that the main wheat value chain actors in the study area are input suppliers, farmers/producers, assemblers, wholesalers, processors, retailers, commission agents and cooperatives. Market concentration ratio at district level was 88. 7 % which indicated oligopolistic market structure. The result of 2 SLS indicated that size of landholding, livestock ownership, family size and quantity of wheat produced influences amount of wheat supplied to market significantly. The multinomial logit model result indicated that the likelihood to choose wholesalers <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was significantly influenced by frequency of extension contact, distance from market place, own price of the commodity and membership to cooperative compared to accessing assemblers wheat <b>market</b> <b>outlet.</b> The likelihood of accessing cooperative wheat <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was significantly influenced by price given to the commodity and distance from market place compared to accessing assembler <b>market</b> <b>outlet.</b> The likelihood of accessing processors <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was significantly influenced by price of commodity, ownership of transportation facilities and distance of processors from production place.

Own elasticities and cross-price elasticities are used to obtain insights into the effectiveness and implications of new policy measures.

Four separate product-specific models where also estimated and represent consumers’ choice of a retail <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> to purchase a particular tobacco product. In contrast to the joint product-outlet choice model, the two stage budgeting model rests {{on the assumption that}} consumers first choose a tobacco product, and then choose where to purchase it. In addition to estimating overall demand for the four tobacco products, models are estimated for tobacco products from three specific outlets: grocery stores, drug stores, and convenience stores.

40|$|Market {{access and}} value chain of dairy {{products}} in Wolaita zone was analyzed {{to identify and}} prioritize constraints {{and come up with}} strategic interventions, to identify determinants of participation decision and level of participation in-farm level milk value addition, to assess factors affecting milk sales decision and access to alternative milk <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> choices, to identify determinants of fluid milk purchasing sources and to identify factors affecting unpacked and packed fluid milk consumption. Secondary data sources used include journal articles, books, CSA, internet, national policies, zonal and wereda reports. Primary data were collected using participatory, rapid market appraisal and survey from random samples of 398 farmers, 198 consumers, 79 traders and 53 hotels/restaurants. The results show that farmers produced mean milk yield of 8 liters per day, out of which 27. 8 % was used for home consumption, 58. 2 % was sold to market outlets and 26. 6 % was used for value addition. About 27. 9 %, 22. 1 %, and 9. 4 % of the milk produced per day was sold to consumers, hotels/restaurants and cooperatives, respectively. The first-stage probit model results indicate that milk yield in liter per day, distance from urban centers, age, child, poor access to livestock extension services, shelf life, social factors (holidays and fasting), and labor availability determined household‟s decision to add values to milk. Heckman second stage results show that most of the factors determining decision of participation in milk value addition also determined the level of participation. The probit model results indicate that household size, presence of a child, landholding size, distance from urban center and milk yield per day {{played a significant role in}} the probability of milk sales decision. Conditional (fixed-effect) logistic model results indicate that compared to accessing individual consumer <b>market</b> <b>outlet,</b> the probability of accessing cooperative <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was higher for households who had better access to livestock extension services, many years of farming experiences, large landholding size and members to cooperative. Compared to accessing individual consumer <b>market</b> <b>outlet,</b> the probability of accessing hotels/restaurants <b>market</b> <b>outlet</b> was higher for households who had better access to livestock extension services and who owned large number of cows. Multinomial logit model results indicate that age of household head, household income, presence of a child, households who disagree with the statement „packed fluid milk is fattening‟, households who disagree with the statement „advertisement influences people so they buy fluid milk‟, who agree with the statement „price of packed fluid milk is expensive compared with unpacked fluid milk‟ and who own cows impacted consumption of unpacked fluid milk. Education level of household head, young aged household heads, households with at least a member who has medical prescription, households who accept the statement „sterilized milk contains preservatives‟ consumed packed fluid milk. Shortage of feed, low cattle productivity and genetics, inadequate extension services, inadequate institutional support and veterinary services were major constraints.
