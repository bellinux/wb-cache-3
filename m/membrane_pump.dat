40|$|Abstractras {{proteins}} induce germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) when microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. The {{mechanism of}} action is still unresolved, although several hypotheses have been proposed. Acylphosphatase is a cytosolic enzyme that specifically catalyses the hydrolysis of the carboxylphosphate bond of acylphosphate {{for the removal of}} acylphosphate residues of various <b>membrane</b> <b>pumps.</b> A direct effect of acylphosphatase on the regulation of ionic balance of a cell by interaction with ionic <b>membrane</b> <b>pumps</b> has been proposed. We have analyzed the effect of microinjecting acylphosphatase, by itself or along with ras-p 21 proteins or progesterone, into oocytes. The enzyme alone is unable to induce GVBD, but increases oocyte maturation induced by progesterone. By contrast, acylphosphatase blocked GVBD induced by microinjection of oncogenic ras-p 21. These data suggest that acylphosphatase acts synergistically or antagonistically with factors involved in proliferating signals by altering the intracellular ionic conditions of the cell, conforming the hypothesis that the intracellular ionic condition of the cell is important in the induction of proliferating signals, and that its perturbation may have a serious effect on signal transduction...|$|R

The {{release of a}} large amount of free Ca2+ can trigger a fertilized egg to develop, skeletal muscle cells to contract, secretion by secretory cells and interactions with Ca2+ -responsive proteins like calmodulin. To maintain low concentrations of free Ca2+ in the cytosol, cells use <b>membrane</b> <b>pumps</b> like calcium ATPase found in the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. These pumps are needed to provide the steep electrochemical gradient that allows Ca2+ to rush into the cytosol when a stimulus signal opens the Ca2+ channels in the <b>membrane.</b> The <b>pumps</b> are also necessary to actively pump the Ca2+ back out of the cytoplasm and return the cell to its pre-signal state.|$|R

Besides these specific mechanisms, alterations of drug transport also occur in parasites resistant to anthelmintics and depend on both the presence of <b>membrane</b> <b>pumps</b> such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and on the lipid composition of membranes. We recently showed in the nematode Haemonchus contortus, using eggs as a model, that the total cholesterol (TC) concentration alters the transport of lipophilic molecules due to <b>membrane</b> <b>pumps</b> such as P-glycoprotein and the resistance to anthelmintics. The effect of TC may depend {{on the presence of}} other lipids interacting with TC. Therefore, we analysed the lipid composition and its relationship with Pgp and resistance to anthelmintics. Better correlations were found between Pgp and free cholesterol (FC) than with TC. We also showed that the relationships between lipid composition and resistance to anthelmintics or Pgp depended on the equilibrium between FC and phospholipids (PLs), mainly PLs known to be present primarily in either the external leaflets of cell membranes or the internal leaflets. The PLs phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine played the most significant role, but phosphatidic acid also influenced drug resistance...|$|R

5000|$|Exertional {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{results from}} {{damage to the}} intercellular proteins inside the sarcolemma. Myosin and actin break down in the sarcomeres when ATP is no longer available due to injury to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Damage to the sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum from direct trauma or high force production causes a high influx of calcium into the muscle fibers increasing calcium permeability. Calcium ions build up in the mitochondria, impairing cellular respiration. The mitochondria are unable to produce enough ATP to power the cell properly. Reduction in ATP production impairs the cells ability to extract calcium from the muscle cell. [...] The ion imbalance causes calcium-dependent enzymes to activate which break down muscle proteins even further. A high concentration of calcium activates muscle cells, causing the muscle to contract while inhibiting its ability to relax.
