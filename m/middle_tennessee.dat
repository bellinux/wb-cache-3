5|$|After {{receiving}} the kickoff, <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> quarterback Joe Craddock led an 80-yard, 10-play drive. It included a fake punt that caught Maryland off-guard, which allowed the punter {{to complete a}} 28-yard pass for a first-down conversion. Craddock ended the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass. On Maryland's second offensive play of the game, Da'Rel Scott broke free for a 63-yard run for a touchdown. In the second quarter, <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> re-took the lead with a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Turner threw an interception that was returned 25yards to the Maryland five-yard line, and <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> subsequently scored on a rushing play. On Maryland's next possession, Turner completed a short pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey who ran for an 80-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Maryland advanced inside the <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> 35-yard line three times, {{but was unable to}} capitalize. <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> defenders saved two potential touchdowns with interceptions on their own two-yard line and in the end zone to preserve a Blue Raider victory, 24–14.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} week, <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> {{made two}} rapid-fire fourth-quarter {{touchdowns in a}} failed comeback attempt against the eventual Sun Belt Conference champions, Troy.

5|$|In May 1861, Isham G. Harris, the {{governor}} of Tennessee, appointed the state's attorney, Daniel S. Donelson, as a brigadier general and directed him to build fortifications on the rivers of <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee.</b> Donelson found suitable sites, but they were within the borders of Kentucky, still a neutral state at that time. Moving upriver, just inside the Tennessee border, Donelson selected {{the site of the}} fort on the Cumberland River that would bear his name. Colonel Bushrod Johnson of the Tennessee Corps of Engineers approved of the site.|$|E
5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{began the}} 2009 season after {{finishing}} 7–6 in 2008, including a season-ending {{loss in the}} 2009 Gator Bowl to Nebraska. Heading into 2010, Clemson returned many of its 2009 players, but faced questions about whether those players would perform better with another year of experience. Also under question was head coach Dabo Swinney, who was beginning his first full season as {{head coach of the}} Tigers after assuming control in the seventh game of 2008. Clemson attempted to answer some of the questions about the team's potential in {{the first game of the}} season, a 37–14 win against <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> State.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 1863, Longstreet {{suggested}} to Lee that his corps be detached from the Army of Northern Virginia and sent to reinforce the Army of Tennessee, where Gen. Braxton Bragg was being challenged in <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> by Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, Longstreet's roommate at West Point. It is possible that Longstreet believed that an independent command in the West offered better opportunities for advancement than a corps under Lee's shadow. Lee did detach two divisions from the First Corps, but ordered them to Richmond, not Tennessee. Seaborne movements of the Union IX Corps potentially threatened vital ports on the mid-Atlantic coast. The division of George Pickett started for the capital in mid-February, was followed by John Hood's, and then Longstreet himself was told to take command of the detached divisions and the Departments of North Carolina and Southern Virginia.|$|E
5|$|John Eaton {{was born}} on June 18, 1790 near Scotland Neck, Halifax County, North Carolina to John and Elizabeth Eaton.

The younger Eaton attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1802 to 1804. He then studied law, attained admission to the bar, and moved to Franklin, Tennessee, where he established a law practice.|$|E
5|$|Johnston decided upon {{a course}} of action that {{forfeited}} the initiative across most of his defensive line, tacitly admitting that the Confederate defensive strategy for Tennessee was a sham. On February 7, at a council of war held in the Covington Hotel at Bowling Green, he decided to abandon western Kentucky by withdrawing Beauregard from Columbus, evacuating Bowling Green, and moving his forces south of the Cumberland River at Nashville. Despite his misgivings about its defensibility, Johnston agreed to Beauregard's advice that he should reinforce Fort Donelson with another 12,000 men, knowing that a defeat there would mean the inevitable loss of <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> and the vital manufacturing and arsenal city of Nashville.|$|E
50|$|<b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee's</b> offense put {{together}} five scoring drives and Eldred King turned {{in one of}} the best performances ever by a Blue Raider receiver but it wasn't enough in a tough 31-22 setback to Mississippi State at Davis Wade Stadium.|$|R

5|$|The American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the United Way {{and other}} {{charitable}} groups also quickly mobilized volunteers to assist survivors {{in the aftermath}} across the regions affected. In the three hardest hit <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee</b> counties alone, the Red Cross sent out over 100 volunteers to deliver meals and supplies. Emergency assistance was also offered by the Tennessee Department of Human Services for low income victims in the counties affected by the tornadoes. In addition, the Nashville Predators announced that for their game on February 7 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, half the ticket sales revenue would be donated to the American Red Cross to help with their efforts, and that fans could make additional donations to Red Cross volunteers at the arena's main entrances.

5|$|The 2008 {{recruiting}} {{class was}} ranked 52nd {{in the nation}} by Scout.com and 38th by Rivals.com. Scout.com rated three recruits as four-star and six as three-star prospects, while Rivals.com rated six recruits each as four-star and three-star prospects. Kenny Tate, who was originally recruited as a wide receiver, was the only four-star prospect to see significant playing time in 2008. Before the season, he was converted to safety, a position that had been attrited by the graduation of former starters Christian Varner and J.J. Justice, and Tate also saw action on special teams. Cornerback Cameron Chism, who saw action in nine games as a reserve, recorded seven tackles on kickoff returns to tie for second on the team in special teams tackles. Tight end Matt Furstenburg saw limited play time on special teams against Delaware and <b>Middle</b> <b>Tennessee,</b> but injured his foot and was awarded a medical redshirt. Wide receiver Kevin Dorsey also sat out the season as a redshirt to recuperate from foot surgery. The other four-star recruits who sat out on redshirt status were wide receiver Kerry Boykins, tight end Devonte Campbell, and defensive tackle Masengo Kabongo. Running back Davin Meggett, the son of former New York Giants star Dave Meggett, was the only true freshman to start a game for Maryland in 2008, {{and he was a}} significant contributor throughout the season. Meggett was not a highly touted recruit, assessed by Scout.com as a two-star prospect, and his only other scholarship offers were from local-area Division I FCS schools. In 2008, however, he led all ACC freshman with 5.13yards per carry, and Megett finished the season with 457yards and four touchdowns as a reserve.|$|E
