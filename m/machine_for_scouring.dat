40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the scour {{resulting}} from water falls, such as a vertical waterjet impinging normally on a sediment bed, {{it is necessary to}} make clear the hydraulicmechanism of the beginning of motion of sand gravels, that is the criterion for scour,due to the flows caused by a vertical jet. The first part of this paper deals with the theoretical approach to solve the char-acter of flows close to a boundary which is caused by impingement of jets on a normalboundary. A theoretical consideration for the boundary layer growth on the normalboundary in the various cases of two and three dimensional jets, at submerged and non-submerged conditions is described with the aid of the results of some experiments. Inthe above considerations, the boundary layer growth in the vicinity of impingement ofjets is disclosed. In the second part, the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> from a vertical submerged water jet isanalyzed by the same procedure as done by the author in the previous paper entitled"Basic Studies on the Criterion <b>for</b> <b>Scour</b> from Flows Downstream of an Outlet". It isconcluded from the comparison between the theoretical and experimental results that thefundamental relationships in the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour,</b> which are reduced by the theory,are in good agreement with the experimental results. Based on both results of the theoryand the experiments, an empirical formula for the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> from a verticalsubmerged water jet is proposed, and moreover, some considerations on the method pre-venting the bed from scour are described...|$|R

In Part A of the trial, 321 cows on 15 farms {{were randomly assigned to}} either vaccination or placebo groups. On eight farms, 50 % of the dams were vaccinated, while on the other seven farms, 80 % of the dams were vaccinated. In Part B of the trial, 26 farms were randomly assigned to either a total vaccination program or to no vaccination program.

Enteropathogenic E. coli was identified on 13 of the 15 farms, rotavirus on 11 and coronavirus on ten. At least one of the three potential pathogens was found on every farm.

40|$|Calf-related {{drug use}} was studied on 104 {{randomly}} selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. About 20 % of dairy farmers were observed to administer antimicrobials preventively to healthy newborn calves (primarily as commercial “cocktails” of various antimicrobials, {{vitamins and minerals}} given in an oral bolus form) at some time during the year. About 30 % of the farmers were observed to use vitamins (primarily vitamins A,D and E) preventively. The pattern of types of antimicrobials used preventively appeared {{to be different from}} the pattern seen for therapeutic use. Chloramphenicol was the single most commonly used therapeutic antimicrobial in this population of calves, accounting for some 30 % of overall therapeutic antimicrobial use. In this study population, the prophylactic use of antimicrobials was associated with a decreased risk of being treated for pneumonia, and of dying, but an increased risk of being treated <b>for</b> <b>scours.</b> Case fatality rates for calves treated therapeutically varied, depending on the antimicrobial used and the routine of treatment. Calves treated with penicillin consistently suffered the highest case fatality rates. Case fatality rates for calves treated with chloramphenicol were considerably higher for calves treated once per day than for calves treated twice per day. For instance, calves first treated <b>for</b> <b>scours</b> with chloramphenicol, if treated once per day, suffered a case fatality rate of 22 %. <b>For</b> <b>scouring</b> calves treated twice per day the case fatality rate was just under five percent.

40|$|A new damage {{identification}} method <b>for</b> bridge <b>scour</b> was proposed, {{in the case}} {{that it was difficult}} to detect bridge scour depth applying testing equipment. Through integrative application of the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) and method of support vector machine (SVM), this method was used to identify the scour depths of bridge under conditions of ambient excitation. The following three steps are necessary for the application of this method to identify bridge scour. Firstly, a sample library about scour depth and upper structure vibration response was established using numerical methods and support vector machine method. Secondly, free response signal of bridge were extracted from random vibration signal of bridge upper structure using random decrement technique. Thirdly, based on above two steps, the bridge scour depth was identified using ERA and SVM. In the process of applying the method to identify bridge scour depth, the key is to find the sensitive points <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> depth of substructure using sample library and to gather the vibration response signal of accelerated velocity under conditions of ambient excitation. It was identified that the method has higher recognition accuracy and better robustness through experiments on a real bridge.

40|$|An {{equation}} {{was developed}} to predict current-induced scour beneath subsea pipelines in areas with small span depths, S. Current equations <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> prediction are only applicable to partially buried pipelines. The existence of small span depths (i. e. S/D < 0. 3) are of concern because the capacity <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> is higher at smaller span depths. Furthermore, it is impractical to perform rectification works, such as installing grout bags, under a pipeline with a small S/D. Full-scale two-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach and the Shear Stress Transport k-ω turbulence model. To predict the occurrence of scour, the computed maximum bed shear stress beneath the pipe was converted to the dimensionless Shields parameter, and compared with the critical Shields parameter based on the mean sediment grain size. The numerical setup was verified, and a good agreement was found between model-scale CFD data and experimental data. Field data were obtained to determine the mean grain size, far field current velocity and to measure the span depths along the surveyed pipe length. A trend line equation was fitted to the full-scale CFD data, whereby the maximum Shields parameter beneath the pipe can be calculated based on the undisturbed Shields parameter and S/D...|$|R

It will be located in a water depth of 29 m, where tidal currents and harsh wave conditions may cause soil erosion (scour) and possibly undermining of the foundation if not protected properly.

This paper summarizes the initial scour assessment, the design approach <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> protection, the experimental set-up, test program, monitoring techniques and results of the experiments. The test results revealed which zones of the scour protection around the foundation were most sensitive to shear failure and edge scour. In steps, the scour protection was strengthened in these zones and reduced in the more sheltered areas. The tests showed that the magnitude of rock displacement, apart from wave height and direction, was significantly influenced by the superimposed current velocity. Based on a test without scour protection, the sequence of installation was adjusted to minimize risks of scour during installation. Finally, a stable scour protection layout was obtained that was fully verified under extreme storms and long-term effects of edge scour...|$|R
