40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is {{not clear}} whether the {{incidence}} of <b>missed</b> <b>or</b> early colorectal cancers (CRCs) has decreased over time. We compared the rates of <b>missed</b> <b>or</b> early CRC after polypectomy between 1996 and 2006, and aimed to identify risk factors for these. METHODS: We performed a population-based, case-control study linking data from the Dutch Pathology Registry with data from The Netherlands Cancer Registry. Of all patients with an incident CRC in 1996 and 2006, we identified whether colonic histology specimens were available in the preceding 3 years. Patients with early <b>or</b> <b>missed</b> CRC were defined as those with previous colonic histology in the 6 to 36 months preceding CRC diagnosis. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with <b>missed</b> <b>or</b> early CRCs. RESULTS: CRC was diagnosed in 6941 patients in 1996 and in 10, 963 patients in 2006. The proportion of patients with early <b>or</b> <b>missed</b> CRC was 1. 7 % of all CRC patients in 1996 and 2. 3 % in 2006 (P =. 012). Early <b>or</b> <b>missed</b> CRCs had a lower tumor, nodal, and metastasis stage than regularly diagnosed CRCs (P <. 001), but rate of survival, adjusted for TNM stage, did not differ. CRCs of the right colon and transverse colon and splenic flexure were associated with a <b>missed</b> <b>or</b> early CRC (odds ratio [OR], 2. 34; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 80 - 3. 05; and OR, 2. 14; 95 % CI, 1. 49 - 3. 08, respectively), as was male sex (OR, 1. 31; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 62). CONCLUSIONS: Based on an analysis of the Dutch population, there has been no decrease in the occurrence of <b>missed</b> <b>or</b> early CRCs over a 10 -year period. Location in {{the right side of the}} colon was an independent risk factor for <b>missed</b> <b>or</b> early CRCs...|$|R
5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are <b>missing</b> <b>or</b> damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E

The new material was recorded with session musicians Vinnie Colaiuta and Jimmie Lee Sloas in October 2003.

Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.|$|E

5|$|More than 5,400 St. Louisans became {{casualties}} of the war, listed as either <b>missing</b> <b>or</b> killed in action.

By late 1945, returning soldiers encountered a chronic housing and job shortage in the city. The GI Bill allowed many St. Louis veterans to purchase homes and pursue higher education, which encouraged sub-urbanization that after the war reduced the city's population.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, about 150 men {{landed at}} Cape Murro di Porco and {{captured}} a radio station. Based on a warning of imminent glider landings transmitted by the station's previous occupants, the local Italian commander ordered a counter-attack but his troops {{failed to get}} the message. The scattered nature of the landings now worked in the brigade's favour as {{they were able to}} cut all telephone wires in the immediate area. Forces at the bridge came under repeated attacks from the Italians while the expected 5th Infantry Division relief did not appear at 10:00 as planned. By 15:30 only 15 of men at the bridge remained fit to fight and they were out of ammunition, as a result the Italians then recaptured the bridge. The first unit from the 5th Division, the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment of the 17th Brigade, arrived at the bridge at 16:15 and mounted a successful counterattack. The prior removal of demolition charges from the bridge had prevented the Italians from destroying it. The brigade then took no further part in the fighting and was withdrawn back to North Africa on 13 July. During the landings in Sicily, the losses by the 1st Airlanding Brigade were the worst of all the British units involved so far. They amounted to 313 killed and 174 <b>missing</b> <b>or</b> wounded. The accompanying glider pilots lost 14 killed, and a further 87 were <b>missing</b> <b>or</b> wounded.|$|E
