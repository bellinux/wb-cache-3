5|$|From {{the success}} of {{magazines}} in Japan, Nintendo knew that game tips were a valued asset.

The Fun Club drew kids in by offering tips for the more complicated games, especially Zelda, with its hidden rooms, secret keys and passageways. The <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> grew. By early 1988, there were over 1 million Fun Club members, which led then-Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa to start the Nintendo Power magazine.|$|E
5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E

25|$|In mid-September 2014, Milo Yiannopoulos, vocal {{critic of}} {{feminism}} and left-wing ideologies, published leaked discussions from a <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> for gaming journalists called GameJournoPros on the Breitbart News website. Yiannopoulos and Gamergate supporters saw the <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> {{as evidence of}} collusion among journalists. The list's founder acknowledged suggesting that journalists write an open letter of support to Quinn {{in response to the}} harassment she was facing, but said other members of the list had rejected his suggestion and helped him understand why his idea was inappropriate. Commentators did not consider the list to represent collusion, observing that it is a standard practice across professions to adopt informal venues for discussing matters of professional interest.

50|$|To {{prevent this}} abuse, MAPS and other {{anti-spam}} organizations encourage that all <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> use confirmed opt-in (also known as verified opt-in or double opt-in).

The confirmation message contains no advertising content, {{so it is not}} construed to be spam itself — and the address is not added to the live <b>mail</b> <b>list</b> unless the recipient responds to the confirmation message.

40|$|A {{census of}} agriculture, taken every five years, {{collects}} data and publishes information on agricultural production and sales, land in farms, and operator characteristics. A census farm is any agricultural operation that sells or {{has the potential}} to sell $ 1, 000 or more of agricultural products during the census year. The census of agriculture <b>mail</b> <b>list</b> is a multiple list frame. It is not constantly maintained, but is recreated prior to each census. Sources of the <b>mail</b> <b>list</b> include Internal Revenue Service (IRS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the previous census <b>mail</b> <b>list,</b> and several special ists. The initial <b>mail</b> <b>list</b> contains more records than the census is able to mail, due to budget considerations. For the 1992 Census of Agriculture, the initial <b>mail</b> <b>list</b> needed to be reduced from 3. 78 to 3. 55 million records ° A systematic procedure of selecting records for mailing and nonmailing was developed using CART Methodology. This methodology classified records into groups of probable farm and nonfarm operations. Groups of records least likely to be farm operations were dropped from the list until the 3. 55 million record cutoff was reached. Given the present climate of cost-cutting within the federal government, including the census bureau, the accuracy of determining which records to drop from the <b>mail</b> <b>list</b> is becoming an increasingly important issue as mailout sizes may be further educed.
