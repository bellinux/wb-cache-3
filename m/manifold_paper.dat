40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two papers which focuses on a particular diffusion type Dirichlet form   where  Here  is the basis in the Cameron-Martin space, H, consisting of the Schauder functions, and ν denotes the Wiener measure. In Paper I, we let  vary over the space of wiener trajectories {{in a way that}} the diffusion operator A is almost everywhere an unbounded operator on the Cameron–Martin space. In addition we put a weight function  on theWiener measure  and show that under these changes of the reference measure, the Malliavin derivative and divergence are closable operators with certain closable inverses. It is then shown that under certain conditions on , and these changes of reference measure, the Dirichlet form is quasi-regular. This is done first in the classical Wiener space and then the results are transferred to the Wiener space over a Riemannian <b>manifold.</b> <b>Paper</b> II focuses on the case when  is a sequence of non-decreasing real numbers. The process X associated to  is then an infinite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In this case we show that the distributions of a sequence of certain finite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes converge weakly to the distribution of the infinite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We also investigate the quadratic variation for this process, both in the classical sense and in the recent framework of stochastic calculus via regularization. Since the process is Banach space valued, the tensor quadratic variation is an appropriate tool to establish the Itô formula for the infinite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process X. Sufficient conditions are presented for the scalar as well as the tensor quadratic variation to exist...|$|E

40|$|When {{dealing with}} complex systems, it is {{essential}} that designers and system architects have a clear understanding of the system as a whole. The main ‘tool’ for this is the so-called ‘system architecture description’ or ‘reference architecture’.

Overviews of the system and its environment are the core of this system architecture description. However, HOW to create those overviews of complex systems is uncertain. Even more difficult is to keep those overviews up-to-date to be continually used.
