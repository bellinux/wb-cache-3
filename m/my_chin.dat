500|$|The second chapter, [...] "The Human Body", {{describes}} {{what happens to}} Mundin, Yolanda and Sofia in the dirty shed near the house. Yolanda plays with her boy cousin, Mundin, and {{in exchange for a}} Human Body doll and a modeling clay, shows him her genitals. Sofia also follows suit. ' [...] "Go on," [...] Mundin ordered impatiently. Fifi had caught on and lowered her pants and panties to her ankles. I gave my sister a defiant look as I lifted up my cowboy skirt, tucked it under <b>my</b> <b>chin,</b> and yanked my panties down (Alvarez, 235).' ...|$|E
500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking <b>my</b> <b>chin</b> and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E

Ponor said, [...] "I will say it again, and I want {{everyone}} to know, I will quit without regrets. I have worked every second for my team, I have worked every second for myself, I have worked every second for everybody. I have already been an Olympic champion.

2500|$|In {{an essay}} for the Wall Street Journal, Nathan Rabin wrote that Leno had [...] "raced past the reviled likes of Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia {{on the list}} of popular stand-ups hated by comedians and comedy writers." [...] Bill Zehme, the {{co-author}} of Leno's autobiography Leading with <b>My</b> <b>Chin,</b> told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The thing Leno should do is walk, period. He's got everything to lose in terms of public popularity by going back. People will look at him differently. He'll be viewed as the bad guy." [...] Joe Queenan from the Wall Street Journal went further in his criticism of Leno, jokingly comparing the controversy to Adolf Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
2500|$|Howard {{began to}} develop an {{interest}} in acting {{to the point where}} his grades worsened and began to play hookey from school. He said, [...] "I used to stand outside the theater knowing the truant officer was looking for me. I would stand there 'til someone came along, and then ask them to buy my ticket. It was necessary for an adult to accompany a juvenile into the theater. When I succeeded I'd give him my ten cents—that's all it cost—and I'd go {{up to the top of}} the balcony where I'd put <b>my</b> <b>chin</b> on the rail and watch, spellbound, from the first act to the last. I would usually select the actor I liked the most and follow his performance throughout the play." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 13, 2006, Knight {{was shown}} {{allegedly}} hitting player Michael Prince under the chin {{to get him}} to make eye contact. Although Knight didn't comment on the incident afterwards and has not yet done so, Prince, his parents, and Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince's chin and told him, [...] "Hold your head up and don't worry about mistakes. Just play the game." [...] Prince commented, [...] "He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised <b>my</b> <b>chin</b> up. He was telling me {{to go out there and}} don't be afraid to make mistakes. He said I was being too hard on myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|The men of {{the convoy}} then began {{launching}} boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the Shinyō Maru were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; [...] "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught {{all three of us}} and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out <b>my</b> <b>chin.</b> Nevertheless, I was able to work myself back up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that we were out in the ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth." [...] Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.|$|E

60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. One day, when I {{was tired}} of {{learning}} to walk forward with some of my feet and backwards with others and sideways with the rest all at once, I sat on a rock with <b>my</b> four <b>chins</b> resting on four of my palms, and four or my elbows resting on four of my knees. And suddenly it came into my mind that this monstrous machinery of heads and limbs was no more me than my statues had been me, {{and that it was}} only an automaton that I had enslaved.|$|R
60|$|So I {{enjoyed the}} finish alone.

It was theft, but I took him, and we talked {{all the way home}} of r-rats and r-rabbits and bones and baths and the other basic facts of life. That evening after dinner they slept before the fire, with their warm chins across the hollows of <b>my</b> ankles--to each <b>chin</b> an ankle--till I kicked them upstairs to bed.|$|R

60|$|My wife is {{too great}} a fool, poor soul, to be {{actively}} valuable in the present emergency; but she will be passively useful in keeping up Miss Vanstone's connection with me--and, in consideration of that circumstance, I consent to brush my own trousers, shave <b>my</b> own <b>chin,</b> and submit to the other inconveniences of waiting on myself for a limited period. Any faint glimmerings of sense which Mrs. Wragge may have formerly possessed appear to have now finally taken their leave of her. On receiving permission to go to London, she favored us immediately with two inquiries. Might she do some shopping? and might she leave the cookery-book behind her? Miss Vanstone said Yes to one question, and I said Yes to the other--and from that moment, Mrs. Wragge has existed {{in a state of}} perpetual laughter. I am still hoarse with vainly repeated applications of vocal stimulant; and I left her in the railway carriage, to my inexpressible disgust, with both shoes down at heel.|$|R

[...] She put the band of the skirt against her waist, and put forward her foot, and looked down, saying, [...] "It's just the right length, isn't it, Little Woman?—and they said I was tall—it was a wonder. Don't you wish it were yours, Little?—oh, you won't confess it. Yes {{you like to be}} as fine as anybody—that's why I bought you this piece of silk—isn't it sweet, though?—you needn't say there's too much lavender in it, there is not. Now!"

After six years of collaboration, he will always be an inspiration for me. I wish to express my gratitude to Khoo Siau Cheng, Thomas Henzinger, Joxan Jaffar and Abhik Roychoudhury for accepting to be in my thesis committee and for their helpful comments on my work. I am also indebted to Martin Sulzmann, Martin Rinard, Zhenjiang Hu, Robert Glück, Xavier Rival, Francesco Logozzo and Andrew Santosa for advices given over the years on research and my thesis work. During my graduate studies, I was fortunate to work with amazing colleagues who had influenced me both inside and outside of my research. I am grateful to Florin...|$|R

I turned to Isabel's voice, and saw her face uplifted, and her dear cheeks and nose and forehead all splashed and barred with sunlight and the shadows of the twigs of the trees behind me. And something--an infinite tenderness, stabbed me. It was a keen physical feeling, like nothing I had ever felt before. It had a quality of tears in it. For {{the first time in my}} narrow and concentrated life another human being had really thrust into my being and gripped my very heart.|$|R

2500|$|After filming Cobra, {{the cast}} of The Hooded Falcon sailed for France to be fitted for costumes. After three months, they {{returned}} to the United States, where Valentino's new beard, which he had grown for the film, caused a sensation. [...] "I opened once a paper and I tell you what was in. It was Rudolph Valentino with a beard upon his <b>chin.</b> <b>My</b> heart stopped off from beating and I fainted dead away, and I never want to come to life until the judgement day," [...] was soon printed in Photoplay. The cast and crew left for Hollywood to begin preparations for the film, but much of the budget was taken up during preproduction. Due to the Valentinos' lavish spending on costumes and sets, Ritz-Carlton terminated the deal with the couple, effectively ending Valentino's contract with Ritz-Carlton.|$|R

He stands erect, holding the reins of his swiftly-moving horses in his powerful left hand. Occasionally he shouts back to <b>my</b> father, whose <b>chin</b> is buried in a thick buffalo-skin coat.

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank <b>my</b> supervisor, {{professor}} <b>Chin</b> Wei-Ngan, for the time and knowledge that he shared with me. Working with him, was a new experience for me: a research project is, in many ways, different than course-work. It takes as well pleasure to work and a special programming discipline, to adapt to the research group formed by professor Chin Wei-Ngan, professor Khoo Siau Cheng and Dana Xu. Throughout my faculty years, I received precious advices and support from professor Nicolae Tapus and professor Irina Athanasiu. In a special moment, I needed courage and motivation to undertake an important project as this one, and they guided me to the right choice. I {{would like to}} thank The National University of Singapore for sponsoring my research here and especially professor Chin Wei-Ngan and professor Nicolae Tapus for making all this possible...|$|R
