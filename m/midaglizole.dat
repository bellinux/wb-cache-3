Med., 1991, 163 (2), 101 - 110 - To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} α 2 -adrenergic receptors on the secretions of pancreatic glucagon and insulin, clonidine, <b>midaglizole</b> and yohimbine were intravenously administered in four conscious sheep. Clonidine infusion at a dosage of 1. 0 nmol/kg/min produced hyperglucagonemia, hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. <b>Midaglizole</b> or yohimbine was infused for 30 min, at doses of 5, 10 and 50 nmol/kg/min during the clonidine infusion. The highest yohimbine infusion (50 nmol/kg/min) blocked the clonidine-induced responses of glucagon, insulin and glucose. On the other hand, the <b>midaglizole</b> (50 nmol/kg/min) infusion brought about no statistical effect on the clonidine-induced responses of glucagon, insulin and glucose. The α 2 -adrenergic antagonistic effect of <b>midaglizole</b> was clearly {{less than that of}} yohimbine in the present experiments. It is concluded that the glucagon secretion is enhanced and the insulin release is inhibited by α 2 -adrenergic stimulation in conscious sheep...|$|E
