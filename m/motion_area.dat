Four M 6 class (the 1997 Kagoshima on March and May, 1997 Yamaguchi, and 1998 Iwate) and several moderate-size earthquakes in Japan were analyzed. We {{examine the relationship between}} the strong <b>motion</b> generation <b>area</b> and the area of asperities, which is characterized based on heterogeneous slip distributions estimated from low-frequency (1 Hz) waveform inversions (Somerville et al., 1999).

The size and position of the strong <b>motion</b> generation <b>area</b> coincide with those of characterized asperities.

This human <b>motion</b> <b>area</b> also receives a number of inputs from other visual regions, including direct subcortical connections and callosal connections with the contralateral hemisphere. Little is currently known about such alternative inputs to V 5 /MT+ and how they may drive and influence its activity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the response of human V 5 /MT+ to increasing the proportion of coherent motion was measured in seven patients with unilateral V 1 damage acquired during adulthood, and a group of healthy age-matched controls. When V 1 was damaged, the typical V 5 /MT+ {{response to}} increasing coherence was lost. Rather, V 5 /MT+ in patients showed a negative trend with coherence that was similar to coherence-related activity in V 1 of healthy control subjects. This shift to a response-pattern more typical of early visual cortex suggests that {{in the absence of}} V 1, V 5 /MT+ activity may be shaped by similar direct subcortical input. This is likely to reflect intact residual pathways rather than a change in connectivity, and has important implications for blindsight function.

Patients show congenital nystagmus without perceiving oscillopsia. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to demonstrate the consequences of atypical chiasmatic crossing with monocular visual stimulation using functional mag-netic resonance imaging (fMRI). Sixteen patients with albinism and fifteen normally pigmented controls were stimulated with a monocular visual activation paradigm using flickering checkerboards. In patients, we observed contralaterally dominated activation of visual cortices correlating to clinical albinism parameters. This confirms albinism as a continuous range of hypopigmentation disorders. Additionally, albinos showed activation of the superior colliculus and of visual <b>motion</b> <b>areas</b> although the stimulus was stationary.

Whereas the retinal disparity dominates the binocular contribution to the BOLD activity in the anterior part of area MT(+), headcentric disparity modulation of the BOLD response dominates in area V 3 ab and V 6.

40|$|AbstractBinocular rivalry {{is thought}} to arise from a {{low-level}} cortical site. Experiment 1 evaluates this claim with respect to local and global motion processing by using a multiple-aperture motion stimulus and measuring the predominance of global coherence while one of the component gratings is engaged in rivalry. Results show that rivalry suppression of the component grating precludes global coherence. Presumably, suppression prevents the component motion signal from advancing to higher-level global <b>motion</b> <b>areas,</b> suggesting rivalry occurs between local and global motion processing. However, feedback from higher-level mechanisms might exert an influence on binocular rivalry and thus Experiment 2 measures how the predominance of a local target engaged in binocular rivalry with a competing local stimulus is affected when the target forms part of a globally coherent motion stimulus. The augmented level of target predominance during global motion relative to local motion indicates that higher-level motion mechanisms can feedback and influence the binocular rivalry process. Together, these data imply a looping hierarchy of motion processing stages, with rivalry suppression transpiring at an intermediate level and subject to feedback from higher-level <b>motion</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

Pursuit signals, which link the two reference frames, were also identified in these areas. To our knowledge, these results are the first demonstration of multiple visual representations of self-motion in these areas. The existence of such adjacent representations points to early transformations of the reference frame for visual self-motion signals and a topography by visual reference frame in lower-order motion-sensitive areas. This suggests that visual decisions for action and perception may take into account retinal and head-centric motion signals according to task requirements...|$|R

The retinotopic organization of early visual areas V 1 - 3 is well established, although anatomical landmarks can help to resolve ambiguities in poorly-defined functional maps. New morphing techniques are now available to define the metric mappings quantitatively within each retinotopic area. In the dorsal occipital regions, there is fair agreement that area V 3 A should be split into separate V 3 A and V 3 B maps, and that beyond them lies a further area, V 7. We specify the eccentricity mapping of both V 3 B and V 7 for the first time, showing how the latter is roughly parallel to the meridional mapping and offering formal accounts of such paradoxical behavior. In ventral occipital cortex, we support the analysis of Zeki and Bartels [1] and Wade et al.

Avoiding obstacles involves both perceptual processing of motion information and controlling appropriate defensive movements. Several higher-level <b>motion</b> <b>areas,</b> including the ventral intraparietal area (VIP), medial superior temporal area, parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), areas V 6 and V 6 A, and cingulate sulcus visual area, have been identified in humans by passive viewing of optic flow patterns that simulate egomotion and object motion. However, the roles of these areas in the active control of egomotion in the real world remain unclear. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the neural substrates underlying the passive observation and active control of translational egomotion in humans. A wide-field virtual reality environment simulated a daily scenario where doors randomly swing outward while walking in a hallway. The stimuli of door-dodging events were essentially the same in two event-related fMRI experiments, which compared passive and active dodges in response to swinging doors. Passive dodges were controlled by a computer program, while active dodges were controlled by the subject. Passive dodges activated several higher-level areas distributed across three dorsal motion streams in the temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortex. Active dodges most strongly activated the temporal–vestibular stream, with peak activation located in the right PIVC.
