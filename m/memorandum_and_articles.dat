30|$|In {{determining}} the sample size, a snowball sampling technique {{was used to}} identify possible respondents which are particularly useful in hard-to-track populations. Snowball sample, also called a referral sample, is one where the initial respondents typically are chosen using probability methods. Then the researcher uses the initial respondents to help identify the other respondents in the target population (Hair et al., 2007, p. 182). The {{reason for this is}} that there are more than five hundred NGOs registered and licensed by the Charity and Society Agency to work on environmental protection. However, as most of the registered NGOs are not active and did not have permanent addresses, random sampling becomes difficult to use. In collecting the secondary data, we use the <b>memorandum</b> <b>and</b> <b>article</b> of association, policy and strategy documents, publications, press releases, relevant proclamations and websites of the NGOs.|$|R
