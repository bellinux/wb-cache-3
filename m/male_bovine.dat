40|$|Luteinizing hormone (LH) {{secretory}} profiles {{have been}} determined for the <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> following castration and steroid replacement therapy. Serum LH concentrations increased approximately threefold {{during the first}} week following castration and thereafter remained elevated (6. 6 ±. 7 ng/ml). Castrates not receiving steroid replacement showed a rhythmic pattern of LH release that was of high frequency (mean pulse interval; 85 ± 5 min) and high amplitude (mean peak concentration, 11. 2 ± 1. 4 ng/ml). Chronic administration of estradiol- 17 β via subdermal Silastic implants reduced mean serum LH concentrations (2. 1 ±. 3 ng/ml) and blocked the pulsatile pattern of LH release in all steers. Similar administration of testosterone suppressed mean serum LH and blocked pulsatile LH release in two of four animals. The number of implants used in this study provided physiological concentrations of estradiol (9. 8 ± 1. 5 pg/ml) and testosterone (4. 1 +. 2 ng/ml) in systemic blood for the two respective treatment groups. Differences in the LH secretory profiles among testosterone;implanted steers may have been related, in part, to differences in the amounts of steroid not bound to serum proteins. These findings demonstrate that estradiol is a particularly potent inhibitor of pulsatile LH secretion in the <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> and suggest that gonadal steroid feedback on LH secretion may, in part, be imposed {{at the level of the}} hypothalamus. The mechanism for pulsatile LH release is discussed relative to a centrally-located luteinizing hormone releasing hormone pulse generator...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundA {{wide variety}} of {{treatments}} have been proposed {{in order to deal}} with prevention of postoperative adhesions formation, but, no definitive results have been achieved. In the present study, bovine amniotic fluid (BAF) has been investigated as a possible option. Materials and methods 84 male Wistar rats were undergone a laparotomy. After 2 weeks, adhesions were scaled grossly. Bovine amniotic fluid (in whole combination, without cells or without cells and proteins) extracted from cows carried either male or female calves was then applied to treated groups 2 weeks later during the second laparotomy. Adhesions were rescored 2 weeks later during a third laparotomy. Results and conclusionA significant reduction (P< 0. 05) in adhesions formation was observed only in rats treated with <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> amniotic fluid without cells and proteins. Therefore, BAF could be used in treatment of adhesion formation because it is inexpensive, readily available, and has minimal side effects...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in order to assess {{commercial}} front and rear cuts of dairy-origin cattle fed mesquite pod meal. Twenty-five non-castrated <b>male</b> <b>bovines</b> (Holstein-Zebu), distributed according to a completely randomized design, with five animals per treatment, were used. The feed contained about 121. 2 and 544. 98 g kg- 1 of crude protein and total digestible nutrients, respectively, and was composed of tifton grass hay, cornmeal, soybean meal, mesquite pod meal and mineral salt. The right half carcass of each animal was separated between the 5 th and 6 th ribs, in front and rear quarters, from which commercial cuts were obtained. There was no effect (p > 0. 05) as to the replacement of corn for mesquite pod meal on the weights and yields of front cuts (shoulder, brisket, chuck, hump and flanks) and rear cuts (tenderloin, shank, knuckle, thin flank, flat, eye round, rump tail, top side, cap of rump, rump, cut of rump, striploin, cap of cube roll).

30|$|The first lot, {{called the}} house herd (suredji), {{consists}} mainly of dairy cows, calves and <b>male</b> <b>bovines</b> used for traction or intended for imminent sale. The house herd remains all {{year in the}} attachment territory and the peripheral territories nearby. Some animals of ‘house herd’ are kept near dwellings and fed intensively with cottonseed cakes and crop residues for socio-economic purposes (Moritz 2010). This practice also is observed by crop farmers in the area who keep a few livestock (Faugère et al. 1990; Lericollais and Fall 1994).|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that intact <b>bovine</b> <b>males</b> gain weight faster and require less feed {{per unit of}} gain than castrate <b>bovine</b> <b>males.</b> Further, carcasses from intact <b>bovine</b> <b>males</b> have {{a higher percentage of}} retail or edible product, but meat from intact males {{is generally}} evaluated slightly lower on palatability characteristics, particularly tenderness, than carcasses from castrate <b>bovine</b> <b>males.</b> It has been suggested that much of the advantage of intact vs castrate for rate of gain, efficiency of gain, and composition of gain may be expressed by an age of about 1 year and the disadvantages, including aggressive male behavior, that result in reduced rate and efficiency of gain, begin at about 1 year of age (at or immediately after puberty). Thus, there was need {{to determine the effects of}} castration at about 1 year on rate of gain, efficiency of gain, composition of gain, meat characteristics, and behavioral characteristics. Reports have shown that, when the anabolic agent zeranol [6 -(6, 10 -dyhydroxyundecyl) -B-resorcyclic acid-d-lactone] is implanted in intact male calves at or before weaning, rate of gain is increased and rate of testicular growth is decreased. These experiments were conducted to determine the effects of castration and zeranol implants at 13 months of age on rate of gain, efficiency of gain, behavioral characteristics, and carcass and meat traits of <b>bovine</b> <b>males...</b>|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. TO {{investigate}} the expression {{and distribution of}} estrogen receptor protein and mRNA in bovine and rat retinas. METHODS. Western blot analysis with an antiestrogen receptor monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used to detect estrogen receptor protein in the bovine retina. Immunohistochemistry with an antiestrogen receptor mAb and in situ hybridization with an oligodeoxynucleotide sequence coding for estrogen receptor were applied to study the cellular distribution of estrogen receptor protein and its mRNA in <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> retina and rat retina of both sexes. RESULTS. Estrogen receptor protein was detected in bovine retina by Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical staining with the antiestrogen receptor mAb was widespread throughout the neural retina. Specific staining showed extensive distribution localizing in the nerve fiber layer, the ganglion cell layer, the inner nuclear layer, and the outer plexiform layer. Retinal pigment epithelium and choroid were also stained with the antiestrogen receptor mAb. By in situ hybridization, the expression of estrogen receptor mRNA was predominantly observed in ganglion cell layer, the inner nuclear layer, and outer portion of the outer nuclear layer.

40|$|Female {{and male}} embryos show {{differences}} in gene expression and metabolism from {{the onset of}} their genome. Those differences are affected by environmental factors. The objective {{of the study was}} to compare the apoptotic rates of in vitro–produced female and <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> blastocysts cultured in different conditions. Day 7 blastocysts obtained after IVF with sex-sorted semen and culture in two synthetic oviductal fluid–based media (containing fetal calf serum [FCS] or BSA, insulin, transferrin, and selenium) were simultaneously evaluated for two markers of apoptosis after 3 D reconstruction from confocal images: active caspase 3 by immunofluorescence and DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling. Higher levels of apoptotic cells were observed in female embryos whatever the culture condition but with a more pronounced difference in FCS medium. This result was confirmed using the unsexed semen of two bulls. The sex effect on apoptosis was detected in both the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm but was dependent on the embryonic size. In conclusion, this study reported that female bovine blastocysts are more prone to apoptosis than male ones but that culture in FCS exacerbates the differences in apoptosis between sexes, especially in small blastocysts...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} existing linear correlation between the consumed fatty acids and deposited in the muscle Longissimus dorsi 35 uncastrated <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> animals, crossbred Nellore predominance, with average weight of 428. 0 ± 32. 11 kg, ending in Brachiaria decumbens cv. Basilisk. The experimental design was completely randomized with five diets and seven animals for 74 days. Diets consisted of glycerin inclusion levels (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 %) in the dry matter (DM). The animals were weighed every 28 days to assess the weight gain (ADG) and adjusts the diets. Samples of Brachiaria decumbens, supplements, and Longissimus dorsi were analyzed for evaluation of fatty acid profile. The correlation was performed by estimating the coefficients of linear correlation.

Steers exhibited more marbling, (small+ vs. slight) a higher USDA quality grade, and reached market condition 5 d earlier than the intact males. Castration had a much greater effect on mean carcass cutout than did implant treatment. Whereas implant treatment affected percentage of blade and top sirloin, castration increased yield of every primal and subprimal cut studied except for lean trim and sirloin tip. Behavior characteristics of implanted and control bulls and steers were also studied. Implantation made bulls and steers more docile. Libido measurements were also lower for the implanted bulls as compared to non-implanted intact males.

40|$|Problems in the {{reproductive}} tract {{may result in}} difficulty or inability to copulate.

Twenty-one animals with normal penile conformation were subjected to surgical induction of penile deviation by excision of a fragment from the penile apical ligament and replacement with a chitosan slab or polypropylene mesh. The scarification of the tunica albuginea was assessed as a control. The results showed that the tested or evaluated surgical techniques were ineffective in penile deviation correction, since all the animals failed to reestablish the normal axis of the penis. However, microscopic exam revealed that the chitosan slabs proved to be less irritating to the receptor tissue. Therefore, the proposed surgical techniques using synthetic or biological implants were ineffective for the correction of induced penile deviation in bulls...|$|R
40|$|It {{has often}} been claimed that the bull {{fulfilled}} {{an important role in}} Bronze Age Greece. The {{reason for this is that}} many representations are found during excavations in this area. However, the assumption that the <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> had an essential role seems mainly to be based on assumptions, preconceptions about prehistory and later Greek myths. This thesis seeks to provide a more objective perspective on the situation and combines iconographic material, faunal remains and Linear B texts to give a more complete image. The focus lies on the Late Bronze Age, a period from which most data is available. The main question is what role the bull played in Late Bronze Age Greece, in religious and secular spheres and how these roles relate to each other. Every chapter is dedicated to a sub-question. For the iconographical material a methodology is used focussed on the recognition of behaviour and characteristics of the depicted bovine; this has never been done before in this field of research. Based on the analysis it is concluded that the bull played an important role as a prestigious animal used for sacrifice and bull games. Furthermore, a possible connection with the military is established. However, the religious role of the bull remains as yet disputable...|$|E
40|$|Inner {{centromere}} protein (INCENP) {{plays an}} important role in mitosis and meiosis as the main member of chromosomal passenger protein complex (CPC). To investigate the functional markers of the INCENP gene associated with semen quality, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) g. 19970 A>G and g. 34078 T>G were identified and analyzed. The new splice variant INCENP-TV is characterized by the deletion of exon 12. The g. 19970 A>G in the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) motif region results in an aberrant splice variant by constructing two minigene expression vectors using the pSPL 3 exon capturing vector and transfecting vectors into MLTC- 1 cells. INCENP-TV was more highly expressed than INCENP-reference in adult bull testes. The g. 34078 T>G located in the binding region of bta-miR- 378 could affect the expression of INCENP, which was verified by luciferase assay. To analyze comprehensively the correlation of SNPs with sperm quality, haplotype combinations constructed by g. 19970 A>G and g. 34078 T>G, as well as g. - 692 C>T and g. - 556 G>T reported in our previous studies, were analyzed.

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of cromossomic abnormalities in Brown Swiss animals, descending form herd karyotyped earlier. After 25 years, 127 animals (97 females and 30 males) from this herd were karyotyped by metaphases obtained from blood lymphocyte cultures. The typical diploid number 2 n= 60, 58 acrocentric and two X submetacentric chromosomes were confirmed in 94 females and in 27 males the sexual complement X and Y, both submetacentric, although from different sizes. Four females from gemelar parturition whit males were karyotyped. Three of them presented quimerism 60,XX/ 60,XY (one with 25. 8 % of female cells (XX) and 74. 2 % male cells (XY); one another with 10 % of cells XX e 90 % of XY and the third with 50 % of each type) showing genital masculinization, diagnosed as freemartism and discarded from herd.

40|$|Thiouracil is a thyrostat {{inhibiting}} {{the thyroid}} function, resulting in fraudulent weight gain if {{applied in the}} fattening of livestock. The latter abuse is strictly forbidden and monitored in the European Union. Recently, endogenous sources of thiouracil were identified after frequently monitoring low-level thiouracil positive urine samples and a "recommend concentration" (RC) of 10 ∼g/L was suggested by the EURL to facilitate decision-making. However, the systematic occurrence of urine samples exceeding the RC led to demands for international surveys defining an epidemiologic threshold. Therefore, six European member states (France, Poland, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Norway, and Belgium) have shared their official thiouracil data (2010 - 2012) collected from bovines, porcines, and small livestock with 95 and 99 % percentiles of 8. 1 and 18. 2 ∼g/L for bovines (n = 3894); 7. 4 and 13. 5 ∼g/L for porcines (n = 654); and 7. 4 ∼g/L (95 % only) for small livestock (n = 85), respectively.

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} on 86 <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> fetuses {{collected}} from abattoirs {{in the vicinity of}} Sydney, Australia. The fetal body length was used to calculate the approximate day of gestational age (DGA); most fetuses were between 60 and 150 DGA. The distances from the caudal pole of the kidney (metanephros) to, respectively, the tip of the scrotum, the distal end of the testis and the internal ring of the inguinal canal were measured, as well as the dimensions of the testis and gubernaculum testis. Distances of (1) testis to inguinal canal, (2) inguinal canal to scrotum, (3) testis to scrotum and (4) gubernaculum to scrotum were calculated from these measurements, which {{were made on}} both left and right sides. The total length of the gubernaculum testis increased during transabdominal passage and during transinguinal passage of the testis. Furthermore, the gubernaculum appeared to maintain the testis at a relatively fixed distance from the scrotum during transabdominal passage so that the inguinal canal appeared to move towards the testis. The greatest distance between the testis and the tip of the scrotum was found during the transinguinal passage of the testis and was 2. 8 cm for the left testis and 2. 3 cm for the right. When located within the scrotum, each testis was still 1. 6 – 1. 7 cm from the tip of the scrotum, so the distance to be traversed was only 0. 6 – 1. 2 cm. Following passage of the testis through the inguinal canal, the gubernaculum became shorter and its distal tip was displaced toward the distal end of the scrotum. Traction by the gubernaculum could account for the final transposition of the testis from the external inguinal ring to the scrotum. Other factors involved in displacement of the testis include differential growth patterns as well as increases in the dimensions of the testis itself...|$|E

40|$|The {{studies that}} {{comprise}} this thesis were performed {{in an attempt}} to identify and eliminate stressful conditions that may lead to infertility in the <b>male</b> <b>bovine.</b> The first project was performed to determine if ergot alkaloids directly affect bovine sperm motility. Percentage of motile spermatozoa was affected (P = 0. 015) by a three-way interactions between time, concentration, and alkaloid. Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine decreased (P = 0. 01) sperm motility in a concentration and time dependant manner and ergonovine had a minimal effect on overall sperm motility. The number of static spermatozoa also was affected (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) by a three way interaction and increased as ET and DHET concentrations increased. Percentages of progressively motile and rapidly motile spermatozoa decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) in a two way interaction between alkaloid and concentration. Overall, sperm motility was decreased by ET and DHET. Furthermore, the qualities of motility as represented by progressive, rapid, path velocity (VAP), progressive velocity (VSL), track speed (VCL), beat frequency (BCF), lateral amplitude (ALH), straightness (STR), elongated, and area were decreased by those alkaloids. These data verify that ergot alkaloids commonly found in toxic tall fescue are detrimental to bovine spermatozoa. In the second study two antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid) were added to bovine sperm culture media and cryopreservation extender. The antioxidant capabilities of these two vitamins could help reduce free radical production and help preserve sperm viability. There was an interactive effect between ascorbic acid concentration and storage method on the bovine sperm motility characteristics: motile, progressive, rapid, track speed (VCL), and straightness (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). A bull by ascorbic acid interaction (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) was observed for motile, progressive, rapid, path velocity (VAP), progressive velocity (VSL), and VCL characteristics.

40|$|Since liver is {{a target}} for growth hormone action, binding of 125 I-labeled human growth hormone to enzymatically {{isolated}} rat hepatocytes was studied. Specific binding was shown with hepatocytes from {{both male and female}} animals. There was a single class of receptors for human growth hormone on cells from males (affinity constant, Ka = 1. 16 x 10 (9) liters/mole; sites per cell, q = 6200). In <b>males,</b> <b>bovine</b> growth hormone was almost as potent as human growth hormone in displacing bound 125 I-labeled human growth hormone, while ovine prolactin was about 1000 times less potent. Cells from female rats bound more 125 I-labeled human growth hormone than cells from males. The cells from females contained at least two classes of receptors for human growth hormone. The receptor of highest affinity had the same affinity for human growth hormone as the single receptor found in males (Ka = 0. 96 x 10 (9) liters/mole). However, there were three to four times as many of these receptors per cell in females (q = 21, 000). In females, bovine growth hormone and ovine prolactin were both about 20 times less potent than human growth hormone. Treatment of male rats with estrone produced cells that show the same binding characteristics as females. These results indicate that human growth hormone binds to a somatogenic receptor in hepatocytes from male rats. In females and estrogen-treated males, the receptors that bind human growth hormone recognize lactogenic as well as somatogenic properties. This suggests that the lactogenic and growth-promoting effects of human growth hormone in the rat are mediated by different receptors...|$|R
40|$|Sex affects {{function}} of the developing mammalian embryo {{as early as the}} preimplantation period. There were two goals of the current objective. The first was to determine the degree and nature of differences in gene expression between female and male embryos in the cow at the morula stage of development. The second objective was to determine whether DKK 1, a molecule known to alter differentiation of the blastocyst, would affect gene expression differently for female and male morulae. In Experiment 1, female and male embryos were treated with DKK 1 at Day 5 after insemination. Morulae were harvested 24 h after treatment, pooled in groups of 20 for microarray analysis and RNA subjected to analysis of gene expression by microarray hybridization. There were 662 differentially expressed genes between females and males and 128 of these genes had a fold change ≥ 1. 5 between the two sexes. Of the genes upregulated in females, 49. 5 % were located in the X chromosome. Functional analysis predicted that cell survival was greater in female embryos. Experiment 2 involved a similar design except that transcripts for 12 genes previously reported to be affected by sex, DKK 1 or the interaction were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Expression of all genes tested that were affected by sex in experiment 1 was affected in a similar manner in Experiment 2. In contrast, effects of DKK 1 on gene expression were largely not repeatable in Experiment 2. The exception was for the Hippo signaling gene AMOT, which was inhibited by DKK 1. In Experiment 3, embryos produced by fertilization with unsorted sperm were treated with DKK 1 at Day 5 and abundance of transcripts for CDX 2, GATA 6, and NANOG determined at Days 5, 6 and 7 after insemination. There was no effect of DKK 1 on expression of any of the three genes. In conclusion, female and <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> embryos have a different pattern of gene expression as early as the morula stage, and this is due to a large extent to expression of genes in the X chromosomes in females. Differential gene expression between female and male embryos is likely the basis for increased resistance to cell death signals in female embryos and disparity in responses of female and male embryos to changes in the maternal environment...|$|E

As a proof-of-concept project, I aimed to target the primary male sex-determining gene Sry to the X chromosome in mice, to produce a transgenic XY male that would transmit Sry – and hence maleness – to both XX and XY offspring. In this project I aimed to target a 14. 5 kb DNA fragment containing Sry to an X-chromosome locus that escapes X-inactivation. After considering many potential loci, a targeting strategy and construct were designed for the SMCX locus, which is well conserved between mouse, human and bovine. A targeting vector with 5 kb and 3 kb arms of homology was also constructed without Sry, to target the locus. Attempts to introduce the 14. 5 kb Sry fragment into the construct were unsuccessful, and a smaller construct, containing only the coding sequence of the Sry gene driven by a strong promoter, is currently being made. In order to translate this transgenic approach into cattle, other facets of bovine sex determination required investigation. First, it was important to identify the necessary regulatory regions upstream of bovine SRY needed for the gene to be functional, and secondly to investigate the timing of testis development in <b>male</b> <b>bovine</b> embryos. To enable sequence comparison, I sequenced upstream of the bovine and goat SRY gene and through bioinformatic analysis identified regulatory regions common to several mammals. I identified four regions of high homology upstream of bovine SRY conserved between human, goat, and pig, but not mouse. These regions are likely to be important for the regulation of the gene in these species, as they share unique transcription factor binding sites. From this research I concluded that 9 kb upstream of bovine SRY were likely to be useful in transgenic strategies to produce sex-reversed cattle. Although I attempted to use a 15 kb bovine genomic fragment containing SRY to sex reverse XX mice, this project was unsuccessful. I also investigated the expression pattern of genes known to have a role in sex determination, including SRY, in early bovine embryos. I identified the major time points important for male sex determination, including the first appearance of the gonadal ridge from the mesonephros at day 31, the onset of SRY expression and its peak at day 39, and the appearance of testis cords at day 42, along with the pattern of expression of many other genes downstream of SRY. This information will allow future researchers to check that transgenic SRY expression is occurring at the correct time and place for it to be able to cause XX sex reversal in cattle. I also identified some of the major time points important for female sex determination, including that ovigerous cords form between CRL 37 - 91 in female bovine embryos. In addition I show the cellular differentiation of the cortex and medulla at this time. I have also predicted the female germ cell entry into meiosis around CRL 40 in bovine embryos through the use of qRT-PCR for STRA 8 and SYCP 3. This is the first detailed account of gene expression profiles in early female bovine embryos, unfortunately the data is incomplete due to an uneven distribution of embryo ages due to the difficulty of obtaining embryos from timed matings. Hopefully in the future obtaining more female embryos of the missing stages can complete the female data. This project has provided additional basic knowledge about bovine sex-determination events to ensure the possibility of making single-sex livestock a real possibility in the future. The similarity between human and bovine developmental time frames also points to cattle being a good alternative model for human development, and emphasises the need for further research in species other than mouse, with the aim of ultimately understanding our own biology...|$|E

There is an increasing interest {{in the identification of}} key factors and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of specific fat depots. This study aimed at elucidating the influence of breed and diet on adipose tissue membrane permeability and fluidity and their interplay on fat deposition in bovines. Two Portuguese autochthonous breeds, Alentejana and Barrosã, recognized as late and early maturing breeds, respectively, were chosen {{to examine the effects of}} breed and diet on fat deposition and on adipose membrane composition and permeability. Twenty-four <b>male</b> <b>bovines</b> from these breeds were fed on silage- or concentrate-based diets for 11 months. Animals were slaughtered to determine their live slaughter and hot carcass weights, as well as weights of subcutaneous and visceral adipose depots. Mesenteric fat depots were excised and used to isolate adipocyte membrane vesicles where cholesterol content, fatty acid profile as well as permeability and fluidity were determined. Total accumulation of neither subcutaneous nor visceral fat was influenced by breed. In contrast, mesenteric and omental fat depots weights were higher in concentrate-fed bulls relative to silage-fed animals. Membrane fluidity and permeability to water and glycerol in mesenteric adipose tissue were found to be independent of breed and diet. Moreover, the deposition of cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids, which may influence membrane properties, were unchanged among experimental groups. Adipose membrane lipids from the mesenteric fat depot of ruminants were rich in saturated fatty acids, and unaffected by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) dietary levels. Our results provide evidence against the involvement of cellular membrane permeability to glycerol on fat accumulation in mesenteric fat tissue of concentrate-fed bovines, which is consistent with the unchanged membrane lipid profile found among experimental groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of one centralised National Livestock Database (NLD) for {{the islands of}} Malta and Gozo was of crucial importance in the identification and traceability of bovines from 2002 to date. It was also important in covering legal obligations following Malta’s accession to the European Union (EU) in May 2004. This thesis describes how the processes of identification, registration and traceability of bovines have changed following Malta’s accession to the EU. The validation and integration of data originating from the different departmental sections such as the Identification and Registration section, the slaughterhouse and the National Veterinary Laboratory ensures that any discrepancies are highlighted and can be investigated. The various events recorded on the database allow for the cross-checking of compliance and eligibility of bovine producers applying for EU benefits. The main drawbacks and weak points of the system include financial costs for the government department, potentially late notification of births and deaths of new born calves and the insufficient uptake {{in the use of}} the latest technology by bovine producers for the notification of events such as births, deaths and movement of bovines. The fact that the NLD is a computerised and centralised system has made collection, management and analysis of data possible. As a result principles of data mining have been used in this thesis to study in detail ten year trends in the number of bovine dairy holdings together with the bovine population on these holdings and to compare these trends with those reported in other European countries. Six trends related to the number of bovine dairy holdings and their bovine population were analysed in the study: the trend in the number of dairy holdings on the Maltese Islands; the trend in the total number of bovines on dairy holdings; the trend in the number of female bovines over two years of age (F> 2 y); the trend in the average bovine population (average herd size) on dairy holdings; the trend in the average number of female bovines over two years of age; the trend in the number of female and <b>male</b> <b>bovines</b> and their ratios. The general trends showed that there was a significant decrease in the number of dairy holdings, in the bovine population and in the number of female bovines greater than 2 years of age on dairy holdings during the study period. The average herd size and the average number of females greater than 2 years of age on the individual dairy holdings showed no statistically significant changes. On the other hand, a significant increase in the ratio of female to <b>male</b> <b>bovines</b> was registered on these holdings. In the final part of this thesis, data on calf deaths was used to determine the overall mortality rates of live born calves up to 180 days of age in dairy herds on the islands of Malta and Gozo. This is the first time that data using the NLD is being used to determine the calf mortality rates from the whole dairy population of Malta and Gozo. Furthermore, five risk factors namely the island of birth, sex of calf, average herd size, the year and the season of birth were also studied. The data set used in the study consisted of a total of 44, 078 calves born between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2011. From this dataset, 28, 848 calves were born in Malta and 15, 230 in Gozo. In total 2, 821 calves were registered as having died before reaching 180 days of age. The overall calf mortality rate in live born calves up to 180 days of age was found to be 7. 08...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of LH and FSH {{secretion}} by estradiol {{was evaluated}} during sexual {{development in the}} bovine. Involvement of opioid neuropeptides in modulating estradiol inhibition of gonadotropin secretion during puberty in heifers was investigated {{in the first two}} experiments. Low levels of estradiol inhibited gonadotropin secretion in prepubertal ovariectomized heifers. Administration of the opioid antagonist, naloxone, blocked the inhibitory effects of estradiol and caused an increase in LH secretion. Naloxone had no effect on gonadotropin secretion in prepubertal heifers that were ovariectomized and not administered estradiol. As heifers matured, estradiol inhibition of gonadotropin secretion waned as did the ability of naloxone to disinhibit LH secretion in ovariectomized heifers treated with estradiol. By the time control heifers had attained puberty, estradiol no longer inhibited gonadotropin secretion and opioids had only minor inhibitory effects on LH secretion in ovariectomized heifers administered estradiol. ^ Estradiol feedback on gonadotropin secretion in <b>bovine</b> <b>males</b> {{during the time of the}} peripubertal change in estradiol feedback in bovine females was examined in the second experiment. Administration of low levels of estradiol inhibited LH and FSH secretion in gonadectomized <b>bovine</b> <b>males</b> and females. Inhibition occurred during the time intact heifers were prepuberty. During the time estradiol inhibition of gonadotropin secretion was abating in females, a simultaneous decline was observed in males. Moreover, at the end of the study, estradiol increased tonic LH secretion in gonadectomized males and females above concentrations detected in gonadectomized animals not receiving estradiol. This was at a time when intact heifers had initiated estrous cycles. ^ The final experiment investigated estradiol feedback on gonadotropin secretion in adult gonadectomized males and females administered various physiological concentrations of estradiol. Administration of low concentrations of estradiol increased mean concentrations of LH and amplitude of LH pulses in both sexes and increased mean concentrations of FSH in males, but did not alter FSH in females compared to administration of sham implants. High physiological concentrations of estradiol suppressed LH and FSH secretion in <b>bovine</b> <b>males</b> and females. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} homolog pairing is well characterised in meiosis of male mammals, but much less {{information}} is available from female meiosis. We have therefore studied telomere dynamics by FISH and synapsis formation by immunostaining of synaptonemal complex proteins (SCP 3, SCP 1) on ovarian sections from 15 bovine fetuses, which covered the entire female prophase I. Telomeres displayed a dispersed intranuclear distribution in oogonia and relocated to the nuclear periphery during the preleptotene stage. Tight telomere clustering (bouquet formation) coincided with synapsis initiation at the leptotene/zygotene transition. Clustering of telomeres persisted during zygotene and even into the pachytene stage in a subset of nuclei, while it was absent in diplotene/dictyotene stage nuclei. Thus, the bouquet stage in the bovine female lasts significantly longer than in the male. Further, we observed that synapsis in the female initiated both terminally and interstitially in earliest zygotene stage oocytes, which contrasts with the predominantly terminal synapsis initiation in early zygotene spermatocytes of the <b>bovine</b> <b>male.</b> Altogether, our data disclose a sex-specific difference in telomere dynamics and synapsis initiation patterns in <b>male</b> and female <b>bovine</b> germ cells that {{may be related to}} the sex-specific differences in recombination rates observed in this and other mammalian species...|$|R
