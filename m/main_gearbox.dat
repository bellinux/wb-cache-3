5|$|In 1974, Australia {{purchased}} 12 Westland Sea King Mk 50s as the Royal Australian Navy's new ASW helicopter; the Sea Kings {{replaced the}} aircraft carrier 's complement of Westland Wessex HAS31 in the following year. Early operations were troubled {{by a series of}} accidents. Between October 1975 to May 1979, four aircraft were lost in accidents, the primary causes were the loss of oil from the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Each {{power unit}} {{comprises}} two Soloviev D-25VF [...] turbo-shaft engines mounted below <b>main</b> <b>gearboxes</b> which each drive five-bladed [...] diameter rotors and the synchronisation shafts which run from wing-tip to wing-tip. Each paired engine pod has large access panels which open up for maintenance access and also form platforms for servicing crews to operate from.|$|R
25|$|The {{system is}} fully regenerative, {{all of the}} engine's power reaches the track either through the main {{driveshaft}} or the steering system, none of the energy is being lost to brakes or clutches. Additionally, since power is fed around the transmission to the steering system, in some designs the tank can be turned even when the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> is not engaged. The limitation on this feature is {{the strength of the}} steering shaft, which has to be strong enough to move the tank if this feature is desired, but otherwise can be made lighter if this is not needed.|$|E
25|$|On March 20, 1985, an Okanagan Helicopters S-61N (C-GOKZ) ditched in the Atlantic Ocean off of Owl's Head, Nova Scotia. The {{aircraft}} {{was en route}} from the MODU Sedco 709 offshore Nova Scotia to the Halifax International Airport(YHZ)when the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> suffered a total loss of transmission fluid. There were 15 passengers and two crew on board. There were no injuries during the ditching, however several passengers suffered varying degrees of hypothermia. As {{a result of this}} incident, improved thermal protection and other advancements in helicopter transportation suits were instituted for offshore workers on Canada's east coast.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1973 oil crisis, oil and gas companies began exploration and extraction activities farther offshore, thus creating a long-term need for more capable rotary aircraft. The development of the EC225, an enlarged variant of the AS332 Super Puma, was announced by Eurocopter in June 1998. The principal differences of the EC225 from the preceding AS332 are the adoption of Spheriflex rotor technology and new Turbomeca Makila 2A turboshaft engines, along with a redesigned <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> to accommodate the rotor and engine changes, and the addition of an integrated flight display system; these changes resulted in higher speeds and passenger comfort, as well as greater flight safety and reduced operating costs.|$|E

25|$|A pair of roof-mounted Turbomeca Turmo {{turboshaft}} engines {{power the}} Puma's four-blade main rotor. The helicopter's rotors are driven {{at a speed}} of roughly 265 rpm via a five reduction stage transmission. The design of the transmission featured several unique and uncommon innovations for the time, such as single-part manufacturing of the rotor shaft and the anti-vibration measures integrated into the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> and main rotor blades. The Puma also featured an automatic blade inspection system, which guarded against and alerted crews to fatigue cracking in the rotor blades. There are two hydraulic systems on board, these operate entirely independent of one another, one system powers only the aircraft's flight controls while the other serves the autopilot, undercarriage, rotor brake, and the flight controls.|$|E
25|$|Following the 22 October 2012 crash, {{the major}} North Sea Super Puma operators, CHC Helicopter, Bond Offshore Helicopters and Bristow Helicopters decided to ground all AS332 and EC225 Super Puma helicopters. On 25 October 2012 it was {{announced}} that the problem was suspected to relate to the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> vertical shaft; the AS 332 L1 and L2 versions of the Super Puma could be refitted with an older design, allowing them to resume flying. On 8 November 2012 some Super Pumas of Bond Offshore Helicopters returned to flight. The EC225 grounding continued into 2013, following the validation of new safety measures by the EASA, the type was progressively returned to service following modifications. By mid-2015, all 49 EC225s operating in the North Sea fleets in the UK had been retrofitted with a redesigned bevel wheel vertical shaft to avoid any recurrence.|$|E

50|$|The SR.N4 was {{powered by}} four Rolls-Royce Proteus {{turboprop}} engines. The Proteus engines each drove {{a set of}} 19 ft diameter steerable Dowty Rotol propellers, arranged in two pairs on pylons positioned {{on top of the}} craft's roof; upon the SR.N4's introduction to service, these were the largest propellers in the world. Six independent electrohydraulic systems, each driven from the <b>main</b> <b>gearboxes,</b> powered the movement of the fins and pylons, while a further four units were used to actuate the variable-pitch propellers.|$|R
5000|$|The ring of magnets {{installed}} on the AS332 L2 and EC225 <b>main</b> rotor <b>gearboxes</b> reduced the probability of detecting released debris from the epicyclic module.|$|R
25|$|The {{control system}} is complex {{due to the}} sheer size of the {{aircraft}} and the need to compensate for aeroelastic deformation of the structure, as well as the very large friction loads of the control rods, levers etc. To keep control forces felt by the pilots to a minimum, the control system is in three distinct phases. Phase one is direct mechanical control from pilot inputs which is fed into phase two. Phase two is the intermediate powered control system with low-powered hydraulic boosters transferring commands to the third phase. Phase three is the high-powered rapid action control actuators at the <b>main</b> <b>gearboxes</b> operating the swashplates directly.|$|R
2500|$|... 10 May 2012: G-REDW, an EC225 LP, {{carried out}} a {{controlled}} ditching following indications of {{a failure of the}} <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> (MGB) lubrication system and a subsequent failure indication warning on the emergency lubrication system. An investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) identified a 360° circumferential crack in the bevel gear vertical shaft in the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox,</b> in the vicinity of a manufacturing weld, causing disengagement of the drive to both mechanical oil pumps.|$|E

2500|$|... 1 April 2009 – A Bond Offshore Helicopters AS332L2 with 16 {{people on}} board crashed into the North Sea [...] off Crimond on the Aberdeenshire coast; there were no survivors. The AAIB's initial report found that the crash {{was caused by a}} [...] "catastrophic failure" [...] in the aircraft's <b>main</b> rotor <b>gearbox</b> {{epicyclic}} module.|$|R
2500|$|In 2015, AgustaWestland {{unveiled}} an AW139 variant with {{an increased}} gross weight of 7 tonnes, this enabling a range of 305km while carrying 12 passengers; existing AW139s can also be rebuilt to the newer heavy-weight model. The heavier airframe comes {{at the expense of}} decreased hot and high performance however. In November 2015, AgustaWestland demonstrated a 60-minute [...] "run-dry" [...] test (no oil) of an AW139's <b>main</b> <b>gearbox,</b> 30 minutes greater than any other certified rotorcraft at the time.|$|E
2500|$|The Mi-26's unique <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> is {{relatively}} light at [...] but can absorb , which was accomplished using a non-planetary, split-torque design with quill shafts for torque equalization. The Mil Design Bureau designed the VR-26 transmission itself, {{due to the}} normal gearbox supplier used by Mil admitting {{that it could not}} design such a gearbox. The gearbox housing is stamped aluminum. A split-torque design is also used for the [...] gearbox on the American three-engine Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{press conference}} on 3 May, the AIBN stated that the initial {{investigation}} and analysis of data from the combined FDR and CVR convinced them that pilot error could be ruled out {{and that there were}} no indications of any malfunction until one second {{before the end of the}} recording, which they assumed was the moment when the rotor detached. An AIBN spokesman said the accident was down to a technical fault and [...] "not an accident caused by human error". Later that day Airbus Helicopters updated their press release bulletin with a request for verification of the correct installation of all <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> suspension bar attachments for the EC225LP. They also stated that [...] "similar measures will be published shortly for the EC725AP in a specific ASB" [...] (Alert Service Bulletin).|$|E
5000|$|The M14-V26 variant {{has been}} {{developed}} exclusively for the Kamov Ka-26, where [...] "V" [...] stands for vertolet (helicopter) and [...] "26" [...] for Ka-26.

50|$|G-ASWI was a Westland Wessex 60, {{operated}} by Bristow Helicopters operating between Bacton Gas Terminal, in Norfolk, and Amoco gas platforms in the North Sea. On 13 August 1981 the helicopter lost {{power to the}} <b>main</b> rotor <b>gearbox,</b> going out of control during the ensuing autorotation.

2500|$|... 22 October 2012: G-CHCN, an EC225 LP of CHC Scotia, ditched in the North Sea 32 {{miles south}} west of Shetland whilst {{en route from}} Aberdeen to the West Phoenix {{drilling}} rig. All 19 on board were rescued. [...] A special bulletin issued by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the main and standby oil pumps were not working; a 360-degree crack found on the bevel gear vertical shaft of the gearbox had prevented the oil pump gears from being driven. A worldwide grounding of the type was initiated in response. In both of the 2012 incidents, although the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> lubrication system had failed, the backup system was working correctly but displaying an erroneous warning light, due to an incorrect specification of a pressure switch, {{which led to the}} helicopters being ditched.|$|E
2500|$|The S-76 is of {{conventional}} configuration, with a four-bladed fully articulated main rotor and a four-bladed anti-torque rotor {{on the port}} side of the tailboom. Two turboshaft engines are located above the passenger cabin. In the prototypes and initial production aircraft, these engines were Allison 250-C30s, {{a new version of the}} popular Allison 250 engine developed specially for the S-76, with a single-stage centrifugal compressor instead of the multi-stage axial/centrifugal compressor of earlier models of the engine, rated at [...] for takeoff. These engines are connected to the main rotor by the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox,</b> a three-stage unit with a bull gear as its final stage rather than the planetary gear used by previous generations of Sikorsky helicopters. This arrangement has 30% fewer parts and lower costs than a more conventional design.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{take-off}} (PTO) was {{integral to}} the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was [...] "...to have power take-offs everywhere!" [...] The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: [...] "the power take-off is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an [...] belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing." [...] PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up {{to the demise of}} the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.|$|E
5000|$|On 11 April the AAIB {{released}} its initial report into the accident {{in which it}} stated that the immediate cause of the accident was a [...] "catastrophic failure of the main rotor gearbox" [...] and the consequent detachment of the main rotor. Three safety recommendations were made, {{the first of which}} was that all Super Puma helicopters should receive additional checks on the <b>main</b> rotor <b>gearbox</b> epicyclic module.|$|R
25|$|In March 2012, it was {{reported}} that the project had been affected by the delay in the delivery of the <b>main</b> <b>gearboxes</b> for the carrier. The supplier, Elecon, attributed it to having to work around a number of technical complexities due to the length of the propulsion shafts. Other issues resulting in delays included an accident with a diesel generator and an issue with its alignment. In August 2011, the Defence Ministry reported to the Lok Sabha that 75% of the construction work for the hull of the lead carrier had been completed and the carrier would be first launched in December 2011, following which further works would be completed until commissioning. On 29 December 2011, the completed hull of the carrier was first floated out of its dry dock at CSL, with its displacement at over 14,000 tonnes. Interior works and fittings on the hull would be carried out until the second half of 2012, when it would again be dry-docked for integration with its propulsion and power generation systems.|$|R
50|$|Wreckage {{analysis}} showed that, while {{three of the}} main rotor blades exhibited only superficial damage, the fourth was fractured at a position approximately 76.75 in from the blade root, while the <b>main</b> rotor <b>gearbox's</b> casing was also fractured. Neither the gearbox nor the rotor head could be recovered. The rotor blade, which had been manufactured in March 1981, had been struck by lightning in 1999, when it was repaired by the manufacturer and returned to service.|$|R
