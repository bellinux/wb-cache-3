2500|$|Codeine {{has been}} used in the past as the {{starting}} material and prototype of a large class of mainly mild to moderately strong opioids; such as hydrocodone (1920 in Germany), oxycodone (1916 in Germany), dihydrocodeine (1908 in Germany), and its derivatives such as nicocodeine (1956 in Austria). However, these opioids are no longer synthesized from codeine and are usually synthesized from other opium alkaloids; specifically thebaine. [...] Other series of codeine derivatives include isocodeine and its derivatives, which were developed in Germany starting around 1920. [...] In general, the various classes of morphine derivatives such as ketones, semisynthetics like dihydromorphine, halogeno-morphides, esters, ethers, and others have codeine, dihydrocodeine, and isocodeine analogues.

40|$|Patient {{controlled}} analgesia (PCA) {{is widely}} used {{for the management of}} postoperative pain. PCA also permits a comparison to be made among analgesics in the clinical setting because it limits the variability introduced by third parties. Use of PCA to establish efficacy and potency data for an investigational drug, pentamorphone, compared with morphine is reported. Pentamorphone was found to be more efficacious than morphine in the first hour after surgery because significantly more patients were able to achieve a visual analogue scale of less than 30 mm with pentamorphone. Thereafter pentamorphone and morphine were found to be equally efficacious. Initially pentamorphone may be more potent than <b>morphine</b> <b>based</b> on the greater volume of morphine used in the first hour of therapy. However, a potency ratio could not be determined because this result was under conditions of unequal analgesia. The potency ratio determined at 24 h of therapy under equianalgesic conditions (252 : 1) is similar to previously reported potency data from laboratory studies (200 : 1).

30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that morphine is involved in immune system functions (Hutchinson et al. 2007; Madera-Salcedo et al. 2011). Morphine exhibits both peripheral anti-inflammatory and inflammatory roles (Askari et al. 2008; Pourpak et al. 2004). Although opioids can induce glial activation and neuroinflammatory reactions (Watkins et al. 2009), morphine-induced preconditioning {{has been found to be}} anti-neuroinflammatory (Rostami et al. 2012). In these studies, we used hydromorphone, an opioid receptor agonist and morphine derivative (Ricket et al. 2015), to prevent TBH-induced ROS production. Hydromorphone, one of the first line opioids as per the European guideline (Oosten et al. 2015), is widely used for acute and chronic pain management in both adults and children (Oosten et al. 2015; Mherekumombe and Collins 2015). Compared to morphine, hydromorphone has certain clinical advantages, such as reduced nausea and vomiting (Wirz et al. 2008), and lower histamine release (Guedes et al. 2007). To demonstrate its protective effect, we used hydromorphone to induce oxidative stress-related injury. Because there are few in vitro studies using hydromorphone, we choose an equi-analgesic dosage of hydromorphone as compared to <b>morphine,</b> <b>based</b> on previous studies (Min et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2012).

40|$|Translating {{pharmacogenetics}} {{to clinical}} practice {{has been particularly}} challenging {{in the context of}} pain, due to the complexity of this multifaceted phenotype and the overall subjective nature of pain perception and response to analgesia. Overall, numerous genes involved with the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of opioids response are candidate genes in the context of opioid analgesia. The clinical relevance of CYP 2 D 6 genotyping to predict analgesic outcomes is still relatively unknown; the two extremes in CYP 2 D 6 genotype (ultrarapid and poor metabolism) seem to predict pain response and/or adverse effects. Overall, the level of evidence linking genetic variability (CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 3 A 4) to oxycodone response and phenotype (altered biotransformation of oxycodone into oxymorphone and overall clearance of oxycodone and oxymorphone) is strong; however, there has been no randomized clinical trial on the benefits of genetic testing prior to oxycodone therapy. On the other hand, predicting the analgesic response to <b>morphine</b> <b>based</b> on pharmacogenetic testing is more complex; though there was hope that simple genetic testing would allow tailoring morphine doses to provide optimal analgesia, this is unlikely to occur. A variety of polymorphisms clearly influence pain perception and behavior in response to pain.
