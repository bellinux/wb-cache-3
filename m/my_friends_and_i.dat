[...] "That’s where <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hung out. It {{was a lot of fun}} to grow up in that era." [...] When a friend, Brandon Monk, had a basketball court installed in his back yard, Stevens [...] "appeared instantaneously." [...] He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for grilled cheese sandwiches over to Monk's house, so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook.|$|E
500|$|Stead {{finds that}} kids today {{are much less}} {{independent}} since her childhood. She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways. And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{looking back}} on his early films, Pauline Kael writes that Mankiewicz had, in fact, written (alone or with others) [...] "about forty of the films I {{remember}} best from the twenties and thirties. I hadn't realized how extensive his career was. ... and now that I have looked into Herman Mankiewicz's career it's apparent {{that he was a}} key linking figure in just the kind of movies <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> loved best. These were the hardest-headed periods of American movies ... the most highly acclaimed directors of that period, suggests that the writers...in little more than a decade, gave American talkies their character." ...|$|E

[...] They were <b>My</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> (1884), John Maidment (1885), Thraldom (1887), and The Comedy of a Country House (1889). Reviewing {{the second of}} these, The Manchester Guardian said, [...] "Readers of Little Comedies know how patiently and ingeniously Mr. Sturgis can draw what may be called the minor scoundrel – the scoundrel whose scoundrelism is so successfully concealed from the world and from himself {{that it is only}} a few people who know him to be a scoundrel at all. [...] He has made a fresh and more audacious study of this type in John Maidment, a study audacious but successful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1982 UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) {{designated}} the site a World Heritage Site. This {{is the only}} such site in Illinois and among only twenty-three World Heritage Sites in the United States. United States Representative Evelyn M. Bowles wrote about the Cahokia Mounds site: [...] "Through the years <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> made occasional Sunday afternoon trips to the Mounds. When I became the State Senator, it {{afforded me the opportunity}} to secure funds for the acquisition of additional acreage in which there are smaller Mounds. Many of these have contained additional artifacts." [...] The designation has helped protect the property and attract funds to conduct research on this significant civilization.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{before the}} derailment, {{witnesses}} recalled observing the train {{passing through the}} crossing at an excessive speed with no locomotive lights, [...] "infernal" [...] noise and sparks being emitted from the wheels. Gilles Fluet, a Musi-Café patron who was leaving the site just before the derailment, said the wheels were smoking lots of white smoke. The runaway train passed [...] behind him moving at highway speed. Travelling with no signals, the train jumped the track, sending a river of burning oil into the lake. [...] "It was moving at a hellish speed ... no lights, no signals, nothing at all. There was no warning. It was a black blob {{that came out of}} nowhere. I realized they were oil tankers {{and they were going to}} blow up, so I yelled that to <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got out of there. If we had stayed where we were, we would have been roasted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lowenthal {{has been}} {{involved}} in several live-action projects with his company Monkey Kingdom Productions with wife Tara Platt. In 2008, they [...] produced Con Artists, a mockumentary that chronicles some of their convention visits. They produced a psychological thriller film called Tumbling After which garnered an Award of Merit at the Accolade Film Festival. In 2011, Lowenthal and Platt produced Shelf Life, a web series where they act as action figures in a Toy Story-like environment, but with more adult humor. Lowenthal {{said in an interview that}} he wanted to make a show for nerds: [...] "I wanted to make the kind of thing that <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would watch. It’s got the four S’s: Sex, Social commentary, Slapstick and Superheroes." [...] In 2014, they produced a short steampunk-themed film called Topsy McGee vs. the Sky Pirates which was an official selection at the New York City International Film Festival. and was a finalist at the Dragon Con Independent Short Film Festival in the steampunk category.|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Maurice Garin well. I met him {{and talked}} to him almost every day because {{we lived in the}} same area, 200m from each other, at Lens. Le Père Garin, as my father and grandfather called him used to bring out a chair in fine weather and sit {{in the doorway of the}} little office of the service station he owned at 116 rue de Lille in [...] Lens, under the sign for Antar fuel and oil. My barber was in the neighbouring house and I used to go there once a month to have a crew cut, [...] which was the fashion in those days. <b>My</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were aged seven to ten and on our one-speed bikes we used to pin numbers on our back... and we never missed riding past Maurice Garin in a tight group so that he would see. It's strange that nobody thought to take a picture of me, the little kid, alongside the first great champion of the biggest race in the world. But life's like that.|$|E

2500|$|Hoppus {{describes}} himself as [...] "pretty straight" [...] until junior high, when he began skateboarding and listening to punk rock. He lived in Fairfax, Virginia (a suburb of Washington, D.C.) during his early high school years and attended Annandale High School during his second year, at which time he received his first bass guitar and attended his first concert: They Might Be Giants at the [...] shortly before his sixteenth birthday, March 4, 1988. [...] "I didn't know where I should stand or what I should do, so <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> bought some menthol cigarettes and smoked {{for the first time}} and tried to look as cool as we could. We probably looked like idiots," [...] Hoppus remembered. Hoppus received his first bass (a Mako) as a gift from his father, purchased at a local music shop in Annandale. He earned money for a set of amplifiers by helping him paint his house. Hoppus never took bass lessons, instead he taught himself by playing to bands such as the Descendents, The Cure, and Bad Religion. Hoppus has remarked that [...] "Silly Girl" [...] by the Descendents was the [...] "song that made me fall in love with punk rock music [...] that song changed my life forever." [...] Likewise, Hoppus borrowed a cassette version of The Cure's Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me from friend Wendy Franklin the summer following junior high school and was taken with [...] "Just Like Heaven".|$|E
