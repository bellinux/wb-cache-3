5|$|Bronze <b>mirrors</b> {{arrived to}} Japan from China {{as early as}} the Yayoi period and {{continued}} to be imported through the Tang Dynasty (618–907). During that period <b>mirrors</b> cast in Japan were imitations of Chinese prototypes and subsequently Japanese designs were established. All of these <b>mirrors</b> were generally circular, with a polished front, and a back decorated with molded or engraved reliefs, sometimes inlaid with gold or silver. Three <b>mirrors</b> or sets of <b>mirrors</b> decorated with floral and animal motifs have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} <b>mirrors</b> to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat <b>mirrors</b> can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic <b>mirrors,</b> and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon.

In the 1868 revival, however, <b>mirrors</b> were acquired for this scene.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium <b>mirrors</b> are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area <b>mirrors,</b> frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium <b>mirrors</b> are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E

5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic <b>mirrors,</b> {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the <b>mirrors</b> have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have <b>mirrors</b> polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the <b>mirrors</b> are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
