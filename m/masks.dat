40|$|The {{abnormal}} visual <b>masking</b> {{in those}} with schizophrenia, it has been proposed, arises from a deficiency in their magnocellular system. Two kinds of <b>masking</b> exist: Type-A and Type-B. Type-A <b>masking</b> {{is characterized by the}} <b>masking</b> being strongest when target and <b>mask</b> are presented simultaneously. Type-B <b>masking</b> is characterized by a non-monotonic <b>masking</b> curve, i. e. the <b>masking</b> is largest when the <b>mask</b> is presented at some time after the target. The proposed link between <b>masking</b> and magnocellular activity applies mainly to Type-B <b>masking.</b> Thus, a magnocellular deficiency, if it exists, should effect Type-B <b>masking</b> more prominently than Type-A <b>masking.</b> Here we review the relevant literature. The majority of studies of <b>masking</b> {{in those with}} schizophrenia, it is found, have examined only Type-A <b>masking.</b> These find substantial evidence for abnormal <b>masking.</b> Where Type-B <b>masking</b> has been obtained, evidence also exists for abnormalities. However, the abnormal <b>masking</b> in these cases is largely unrelated to the defining characteristic of Type-B <b>masking</b> (i. e. to the non-monotonic <b>masking</b> function). It is concluded that the evidence for linking <b>masking</b> abnormalities in schizophrenia specifically to Type-B <b>masking</b> is weak. This undermines the proposal that <b>masking</b> abnormalities in schizophrenia have a magnocellular origin...|$|R

40|$|Four-dot <b>masking</b> with {{a common}} onset <b>mask</b> was {{recently}} demonstrated in a fully attended and foveated target (Filmer, Mattingley & Dux, 2015). Here, we replicate and extend this finding by directly comparing a four-dot <b>mask</b> with an annulus <b>mask</b> while probing <b>masking</b> {{as a function of}} <b>mask</b> duration, and target-mask separation. Our results suggest that while an annulus <b>mask</b> operates via spatially local contour interactions, a four-dot <b>mask</b> operates through spatially global mechanisms. We also measure how the visual system’s representation of an oriented bar is impacted by a four-dot <b>mask,</b> and find that <b>masking</b> here does not degrade the precision of perceived targets, but instead appears to be driven exclusively by rendering the target completely invisible...|$|R
40|$|Visual overlay <b>masking</b> is {{typically}} studied with a <b>mask</b> and target {{located at the}} same depth plane. <b>Masking</b> is reduced when binocular disparity separates the target from the <b>mask</b> (G. Moraglia & B. Schneider, 1990). We replicate this finding for a broadband target <b>masked</b> by natural images and find the greatest <b>masking</b> (threshold elevation) when target and <b>mask</b> occupy the same depth plane. <b>Masking</b> was reduced equally whether the target appeared at a crossed or an uncrossed disparity. We measure the tuning of <b>masking</b> and {{determine the extent of}} the benefit afforded by disparity. Threshold elevation decreases monotonically with increasing disparity until T 8 arcmin. Two underlying components to the <b>masking</b> are evident; one accounts for around two-thirds of the <b>masking</b> and is independent of disparity. The second component is disparity-dependent and results in additional <b>masking</b> when there is zero disparity. Importantly, the reduction in <b>masking</b> with disparity cannot be explained by interocular decorrelation; we use a single-interval orientation discrimination task to exclude this possibility. We conclude that when the target and <b>mask</b> are presented at different depths they activate distinct populations of disparity-tuned neurons, resulting in less <b>masking</b> of the target. 12 page(s...|$|R
