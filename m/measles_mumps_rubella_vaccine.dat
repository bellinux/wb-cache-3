40|$|OBJECTIVE. We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the risk of serious neurologic disease after immunization in early childhood. METHODS. The results of a 3 -year prospective study of children (29 ̆ 635 months old) in Britain and Ireland with encephalitis and/or severe illness with convulsions and fever were linked to each child's vaccine history. Cases were reported via the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit's network. The self-controlled case-series method was used to investigate associations between immunization and acute potential adverse events. The risk periods investigated were 0 to 3 and 0 to 7 days post 9 ̆ 6 diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b or meningococcal C conjugate vaccine and 6 to 11 and 15 to 35 days post 9 ̆ 6 <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine.</b> RESULTS. A total of 157 disease episodes from 155 children met the analytical case definition. There were 11 cases of herpes simplex encephalitis and 23 cases of primary human herpesvirus 6 and/or 7 infection. There {{was no evidence of}} a raised relative incidence of serious neurologic disease in any of the specified risk periods {{with the exception of a}} raised relative incidence of 5. 68 in the 69 ̆ 611 days after <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Based on this relative incidence, between 3 and 6 of the 6 cases in this period were estimated to be attributable to the vaccine with a best estimate of 5. The 6 cases all had fever with convulsions lasting > 30 minutes; in all but 1, there was complete recovery by discharge from hospital. Of the 5 patients who recovered, 1 had a concurrent primary human herpesvirus 6 infection and one a primary human herpesvirus 7. CONCLUSIONS. Six to 11 days after <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> there is an increased risk of fever and convulsions lasting > 30 minutes. All 6 of the episodes temporally related to immunization met the criteria for complex febrile convulsions.

40|$|Abstract. Twenty healthy {{children}} were vaccinated, {{and then in}} a 5 years they were revaccinated with Priorix (<b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine),</b> according to the national immunization calendar. The aim {{of the study was to}} observe and compare the shaping and maintenance of immunological memory. Specific IgM, IgA, IgG antibodies in serum, and their subclasses as well as antibodies avidity were tested by ELISA. It was demonstrated that IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies shaped primary immune response to Priorix. Booster-effect was found in IgG and IgA antibodies in response to revaccination. Low avidity of antibodies in primary immune response changed to the high avidity (60 – 70 %) antibodies of memory response to measles and rubella, and remained low for antimumps antibodies. IgG 3 subclass was predominant, and IgG 1 and IgG 4 subclasses were involved in primary immune response. At the stage of immunological memory IgG 1 was predominanted and IgG 3 and IgG 4 became minor. </p...|$|E

40|$|Autism is a {{condition}} characterized by impaired cognitive and social skills, associated with compromised immune function. The incidence is alarmingly on the rise, and environmental factors are increasingly suspected to play a role. This paper investigates word frequency patterns in the U. S. CDC Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database. Our results provide strong evidence supporting a link between autism and the aluminum in vaccines. A literature review showing toxicity of aluminum in human physiology offers further support. Mentions of autism in VAERS increased steadily {{at the end of}} the last century, during a period when mercury was being phased out, while aluminum adjuvant burden was being increased. Using standard log-likelihood ratio techniques, we identify several signs and symptoms that are significantly more prevalent in vaccine reports after 2000, including cellulitis, seizure, depression, fatigue, pain and death, which are also significantly associated with aluminum-containing vaccines. We propose that children with the autism diagnosis are especially vulnerable to toxic metals such as aluminum and mercury due to insufficient serum sulfate and glutathione. A strong correlation between autism and the MMR (<b>Measles,</b> <b>Mumps,</b> <b>Rubella)</b> <b>vaccine</b> is also observed, which may be partially explained via an increased sensitivity to acetaminophen administered to control fever...|$|E

This study examined the effectiveness of these programs by reviewing rubella susceptibility in the population at risk for CRS, assessing the predictive value of a rubella vaccination record, and evaluating the effectiveness of the postnatal rubella vaccination program. From 1989 to 1993, rubella susceptibility in women aged 15 to 44 averaged 4. 6 % overall, but was significantly higher in women aged 15 to 19 years, averaging 14 %. The positive predictive value of a rubella vaccination record was 92 % overall, but it differed by type of vaccine product and vaccine viral strain; 99 % for any monovalent rubella vaccine, compared to 81 % for recipients of HPV- 77 DE- 5 strain MR (measles rubella) or MMR (<b>measles</b> <b>mumps</b> <b>rubella)</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The postnatal rubella vaccination program failed to provide testing for 13 % of pregnant women in the province in 1992, and 10 % of susceptible women in 1992 were not subsequently vaccinated. These results suggest that women of childbearing age in Newfoundland remain at risk of having children with CRS. The rubella vaccination record is not adequate proof of immunity for some of these women, and the postnatal vaccination program requires some improvement in order to prevent cases of CRS in the future...|$|E
40|$|In the United Kingdom the {{publication}} of a paper by Andrew Wakefield in The Lancet in 1998 prompted a public debate about the safety of the MMR (<b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella)</b> <b>vaccine.</b> In the ensuing years, MMR remained a focus of controversy, and MMR uptake declined despite extensive epidemiological evidence about the safety of the vaccine. On the ground, primary health practitioners found themselves in the front line when it came to advising parents on the safety of MMR but described a crisis in confidence as they tried to keep up-to-date with the research evidence on the vaccine. Scientific and clinical journals are an important vehicle in the dissemination of research findings to health practitioners, and their role in translating evidence and offering evaluative comment and guidance on controversial evidence may be heightened during a public health scare. The debate surrounding MMR safety provides a recent case study in which to examine how key journals and magazines translated evidence to health professionals. This paper examines the trends and patterns in the reporting of MMR evidence in key practitioner journals and magazines between 1988 and 2007.

40|$|AIM—To {{identify}} {{factors associated}} with non-uptake of preschool booster immunisation.  DESIGN—Data from the computerised child health system was used to study all children born in 1990 and living in South Glamorgan, Wales, on their 5 th birthday. Factors associated with preschool booster uptake were investigated using multiple logistic regression.  RESULTS—Preschool booster coverage in the study cohort was 91. 4 %. After adjustment for other variables, uptake was associated most strongly with completed primary immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, and polio vaccine or first dose <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Identifying children who miss either of these predicts 52. 4 % of those who miss the preschool booster.  CONCLUSION—Effective targeting of children who have missed previous immunisations could improve preschool booster uptake and ensure maximum uptake {{of at least one}} dose of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> and <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Achieving optimum measles vaccine coverage is vital to achieve the goal of measles elimination. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Vaccines {{are crucial}} to {{population}} health. Nevertheless, there are multiple barriers for parents or carers to vaccinate their children, resulting in lower than required population immunisation coverage. Aim This study aimed to identify the information needs and concerns of health consumer regarding childhood vaccination. Methods We conducted a retrospective, mixed method study of 1, 342 childhood vaccination-related calls to an Australian consumer medicines call centre, NPS Medicines Line (September 2002 -June 2010). Call narratives were explored to identify the key themes. Themes were compared for callers from high and low immunisation coverage areas (National Health Performance Authority data linked to caller postcode). Results Vaccines that raised the most questions were the <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> (29. 9 %), combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (18. 5 %) and varicella vaccine (17. 5 %). The most commonly identified theme was safety concerns (60. 4 %), with questions about vaccine constituents as the predominant issue (31. 6 %). Other common themes involved adverse drug reactions (12. 2 %) and general vaccine information (10. 4 %). The most important difference between low and high immunisation areas was the higher level of concern about vaccine preservatives (mercury and thiomersal) in low immunisation areas. Discussion The consistent number of vaccine-related calls, particularly about safety, demonstrates an information gap that {{can act as a}} barrier to vaccination. Improving health professionals’ awareness of the immunisation rate in their local area and the concerns that act as barriers to vaccination uptake for their patients can help to fill the information gap and improve immunisation coverage...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY AIM: Measles, rubella, mumps and viral {{hepatitis}} {{is still a}} considerable health problem around the world. The risk of contamination of health care workers is higher related to occupational causes. The aim {{of the study was}} to research the measles, rubella, mumps and hepatitis B seroprevalence among the female students of Medical Faculty and to apply the vaccines whom need the vaccination. METHOD: This descriptive study was conducted among female students attending Meram Medical Faculty of Selcuk University. Age and sociodemographic characteristics of 351 female students who participated in the study were recorded on the prepared forms. Serum specific IgG levels for measles, rubella, mumps, HBsAg and anti HBs levels were measured in the serum patterns of the participants. Statistical analyses were perfor&# 172;med using SPSS version 13. 0. RESULTS: The mean age of the students was 20. 5 years (min= 16. 0, max= 29. 0). Measles, rubella, and mumps seropositivity were 91. 6 %, 97. 2 % and 93. 5 % respectively. Of the students, 0. 7 % (n= 2) had HBs Ag seropositivity, 42. 4 % (n= 149) had antiHBs seronegativity. The rates of the measles, rubella, and mumps seropositivity were very high among the female students. Sixty two female students (17. 7 %) required the <b>measles</b> <b>mumps</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> (MMR). One hundred forty nine female students who have antiHBs seronegativity needed hepatitis B vaccination. CONCLUSION: In order to eradicate measles, mumps, rubella it is necessary that use of MMR vaccine should be expanded nationwide rapidly by the Ministry of Health; the regulation should be revised to include the children born before 2005.

40|$|Introduction: The {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} plantar warts {{continues to be a}} frustrating matter for both primary care physicians and dermatologists. There are new trends towards the use of immunotherapy in {{treatment of}} warts, as the immune system seems {{to play an important role}} in the control of warts infection. Aim: Assessing the efficacy of intralesional injection of MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella) in the treatment of plantar warts. Patients: One hundred patients complaining of plantar warts were included in this study. Methods: The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 : This group included 50 patients subjected to intralesional injection of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> (MMR). Group 2 : This group included 50 patients as a control group and subjected to intralesional injection of 0. 3 ml saline. Only single wart was injected. Injections were done at 3 -weeks interval until complete clearance or for a maximum of 3 treatments. Follow up of patients was done every month for six months for clinical assessment of results and to show any recurrence. Results: Regarding the response of the target wart, MMR- treated group showed significantly higher rate of complete clearance compared with the control group (82 % versus 0 % respectively). The rate of partial response was 6 % versus 30 %, and the rate of no response was 12 % versus 70 %, respectively. Regarding the response of untreated distant warts, MMR-treated group showed 86. 9 % complete and 13. 1 % partial clearance of the warts whereas the control group showed 100 % no response. This strongly indicates the development of a widespread HPV-targeted immunity as a response of antigen injection and represents a major advantage of the intra lesional immunotherapy. Conclusions: We found that treatment of plantar warts by MMR vaccine is effective, with good cure rates and excellent safety profile. ...|$|E

40|$|High {{vaccination}} coverage in children by age 2 years {{has resulted in}} historically low levels of most vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States (1), but coverage must be main-tained to reduce the burden of disease further and prevent a resurgence of these diseases, particularly in populations with lower {{vaccination coverage}}. This report describes national, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage by age 19 – 35 months for children born during January 2008 –May 2010, based on 2011 National Immunization Survey (NIS) results. Vaccination coverage remained above the national Healthy People 2020 target * of 90 % for ≥ 1 dose <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> (MMR) (91. 6 %), ≥ 3 doses of hepatitis B vac-cine (HepB) (91. 1 %), ≥ 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (93. 9 %), and ≥ 1 dose of varicella vaccine (90. 8 %). For the birth dose of HepB, coverage increased from 64. 1 % in 2010 to 68. 6 % in 2011; for the more recently recommended ≥ 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) and rotavirus vaccines, coverage increased from 49. 7 % to 52. 2 % and from 59. 2 % to 67. 3 %, respectively; and for the full series of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), coverage increased from 66. 8 % to 80. 4 %, reflecting recovery from the Hib shortage that occurred during December 2007 –September 2009 (2). The percentage of children who had not received any vaccinations remained at < 1 %. Children living {{below the poverty level}} had lower coverage than children living at or above poverty for ≥ 4 doses of diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) and ≥ 4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (by 6 percentage points each); the full Hib series (by 8 percentage points); and for rotavirus vaccination (by 10 percentage points).

40|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of vaccination for health care workers (HCWs), uptake of recommended vaccinations is low, particularly for seasonal influenza and pertussis. In addition, there is variation in uptake within hospitals. While all vaccinations recommended for HCWs are important, vaccination against influenza and pertussis are particularly imperative, given HCWs {{are at risk of}} occupationally acquired influenza and pertussis, and may be asymptomatic, acting as a reservoir to vulnerable patients in their care. This study aimed to determine predictors of uptake of these vaccinations and explore the reasons for variation in uptake by HCWs working in different hospital wards. HCWs from wards with high and low influenza vaccine uptake in a tertiary pediatric and obstetric hospital completed a questionnaire to assess knowledge of HCW recommended immunizations. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine predictors of influenza and pertussis vaccination uptake. Of 92 HCWs who responded, 9. 8 % were able to identify correctly the vaccines recommended for HCWs. Overall 80 % of respondents reported they had previously received influenza vaccine and 50. 5 % had received pertussis vaccine. Independent predictors of pertussis vaccination included length of time employed in health sector (P < 0. 001), previously receiving hepatitis B/MMR (<b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella)</b> <b>vaccine</b> (P < 0. 001), and a respondent being aware influenza infections could be severe in infants (p = 0. 023). Independent predictors of seasonal influenza vaccination included younger age (P < 0. 001), English as first language (P < 0. 001), considering it important to be vaccinated to protect themselves (P < 0. 001), protect patients (p = 0. 012) or awareness influenza could be serious in immunocompromised patients (p = 0. 030). Independent predictors for receiving both influenza and pertussis vaccinations included younger age (P < 0. 001), time in area of work (P = 0. 020), previously receiving hepatitis B vaccine (P = 0. 006) and awareness influenza could be severe in infants (P < 0. 001). A knowledge gap exists around HCW awareness of vaccination recommendations. Assessment of the risk/benefit value for HCWs and their patients, determines uptake of HCW immunization programs and should be considered in promotional HCW vaccination programs.

40|$|This report {{presents}} new recommendations {{adopted in}} June 2009 by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding {{use of the}} combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV, ProQuad, Merck & Co., Inc.). MMRV vaccine was licensed in the United States in September 2005 and may be used instead of <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> (MMR, M-M-RII, Merck & Co., Inc.) and varicella vaccine (VARIVAX, Merck & Co., Inc.) to implement the recommended 2 -dose vaccine schedule for prevention of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella among children aged 12 months- 12 years. At {{the time of its}} licensure, use of MMRV vaccine was preferred for both the first and second doses over separate injections of equivalent component vaccines (MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine), which was consistent with ACIP's 2006 general recommendations on use of combination vaccines (CDC. General recommendations on immunization: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2006; 55;[No. RR- 15]). Since July 2007, supplies of MMRV vaccine have been temporarily unavailable as a result of manufacturing constraints unrelated to efficacy or safety. MMRV vaccine is expected to be available again in the United States in May 2010. In February 2008, on the basis of preliminary data from two studies conducted postlicensure that suggested an increased risk for febrile seizures 5 - 12 days after vaccination among children aged 12 - 23 months who had received the first dose of MMRV vaccine compared with children the same age who had received the first dose of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine administered as separate injections at the same visit, ACIP issued updated recommendations regarding MMRV vaccine use (CDC. Update: recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] regarding administration of combination MMRV vaccine. MMWR 2008; 57 : 258 - 60). These updated recommendations expressed no preference for use of MMRV vaccine over separate injections of equivalent component vaccines for both the first and second doses. The final results of the two postlicensure studies indicated that among children aged 12 [...] 23 months, one additional febrile seizure occurred 5 - 12 days after vaccination per 2, 300 - 2, 600 children who had received the first dose of MMRV vaccine compared with children who had received the first dose of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine administered as separate injections at the same visit. Data from postlicensure studies do not suggest that children aged 4 [...] 6 years who received the second dose of MMRV vaccine had an increased risk for febrile seizures after vaccination compared with children the same age who received MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine administered as separate injections at the same visit. In June 2009, after consideration of the postlicensure data and other evidence, ACIP adopted new recommendations regarding use of MMRV vaccine for the first and second doses and identified a personal or family (i. e., sibling or parent) history of seizure as a precaution for use of MMRV vaccine. For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at age 12 [...] 47 months, either MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine or MMRV vaccine may be used. Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination options with the parents or caregivers. Unless the parent or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC recommends that MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine should be administered for the first dose in this age group. For the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at any age (15 months- 12 years) and for the first dose at age >or= 48 months, use of MMRV vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines (i. e., MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine). This recommendation is consistent with ACIP's 2009 provisional general recommendations regarding use of combination vaccines (available at [URL] which state that use of a combination vaccine generally is preferred over its equivalent component vaccines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mass {{childhood}} vaccination has had {{a profound}} impact on reducing morbidity and mortality from a number of infectious diseases. Ironically, as vaccine preventable diseases become less common and so less visible to the public, greater attention is afforded to vaccine risks. In the UK, Japan, France and the USA, controversies about the safety of vaccines have led to declining public confidence in the practice which, at times, has lowered immunisation rates, leading to disease outbreaks and deaths. Public health workers are often perplexed at how to respond in such situations. In order to plan effective communication strategies it is necessary to understand how controversies about vaccine safety escalate. This thesis describes the nature of public controversies about vaccine safety by examining the discourses of the anti-vaccination lobby, the mass media, parents and health professionals. THE ANTI-VACCINATION MOVEMENT: This thesis first explores the activities of the anti-vaccination movement and their efforts to disseminate their core messages to the wider public. In Australia, the anti-vaccination lobby are a largely unseen force in sustaining controversies about vaccine safety. This small but vocal movement are well organised and strategic. A description of their activities in Australia demonstrates the comprehensiveness of their efforts to oppose vaccination at the political, community and mass media level. THE NEWS MEDIA: The news media have the potential to influence public perceptions about childhood vaccination. To complement previous research on the nature of anti-vaccination reportage, this thesis examines positive coverage from four and a half years of newsprint articles about immunisation published in Australian newspapers. Located at the core of anti-vaccination discourse is an appeal to an individualistic ideology that upholds vigilance against the erosion of civil liberties, suspicion of authority figures and the back-to-nature idyll. By contrast, pro-vaccination rhetoric is centred on notions of threat from personified and malevolent infectious disease and vaccines as saviours and modern medical miracles. PARENTS AND VACCINE SAFETY: Focus groups with new mothers explore how they deconstruct competing messages about vaccine safety, using vignettes from broadcast media. Results suggest that anti-vaccination claims are most potent when they come from medical sources and/or include stories and images of allegedly vaccine-damaged children. Mothers apply complex assessments of risk and benefit in their decision-making and draw on analogies to explain their position. Trust in vaccine providers, personal experiences with vaccine preventable diseases, the advice of family and friends, and scepticism about the media as a source of information are important in decision making. Implicit in attempts to counter negative publicity are assumptions that factual information about disease and vaccines will alone reassure parents. However, when their support for vaccination is challenged, mothers are more likely to mobilise images of children with vaccine preventable diseases than numerical assessments of risk and benefit. More generally, parental support of vaccination is sustained by recourse to normative beliefs and the desire to follow convention. Parents also have an underlying desire to actively protect their children from diseases that are dreaded. VACCINATION PROVIDERS: Their encounter with vaccine providers is fundamental to parental decision making and negotiation of conflicting messages about vaccination. An interview study with doctors incorporating simulated scenarios explores how doctors address parental concerns about vaccination in the clinical encounter. In this study, doctors acknowledge a mother’s concerns, tailor their discussion to the individual circumstance of the mother and convey the notion of choice. They attempt to compare vaccine and disease risks using mainly qualitative estimates of disease and adverse event incidence. Possibly less helpful aspects of the encounters are when doctors became adversarial, discredit a mother’s source of information, ask hypothetical “how would you feel if…” questions, over-use scientific language, enter into games of scientific ping pong or give bland “you’re wrong” statements. Doctors face difficulty when communicating with patients whose paradigms are diametrically opposed to their own. Influencing these encounters is their underlying relationship with the patient, messages from the mass media and theories that help guide the doctor’s communication efforts. THE MODEL: This thesis proposes a model for how vaccine controversies can lead to sustained declines in vaccination rates. This is achieved through highlighting the above perspectives and examining the current controversy over the combined <b>measles,</b> <b>mumps,</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine</b> and it’s unsupported link to autism. It suggests that vaccine safety concerns ‘catch fire’ when the source of a controversy is trusted, seen as expert and coming from a prestigious body or publication. Greater potency is gained when vaccines are implicated as the cause of a dreaded condition and when the link has some biological plausibility face value. Moving personal testimony about allegedly vaccine-damaged children can eclipse official attempts to provide factual reassurances which, by comparison, appear bland and uncompelling. Finally, a less acknowledged but possibly more important factor is the erosion of confidence among health professionals and confusion at the level of service delivery where upstream changes can have exponential effects...|$|E
