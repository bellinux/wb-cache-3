For <b>mask</b> <b>presentation,</b> baseline and task right frontal EEG asymmetry as well as maternal ratings predicted fear behavior during the mask task. For stranger approach, task-related right frontal EEG asymmetry predicted fear behavior during stranger approach after controlling for baseline asymmetry. There was a trend for task-related right frontal EEG asymmetry to predict fear during presentation of a toy spider after controlling for baseline asymmetry.

Emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety have been associated with hyperactivity of the amygdala, but it is unknown whether antidepressant treatment directly affects amygdala responses to emotionally significant information. METHODS: The current study assessed the effects of 7 days administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram, on amygdala responses to <b>masked</b> <b>presentations</b> of fearful and happy facial expressions in never-depressed volunteers using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging.

40|$|The N 400 is an {{endogenous}} event-related brain potential (ERP) that {{is sensitive}} to semantic processes during language comprehension. The general question we address in this paper is which aspects of the comprehension process are manifest in the N 400. The {{focus is on the}} sensitivity of the N 400 to the automatic process of lexical access, or to the controlled process of lexical integration. The former process is the reflex-like and effortless behavior of computing a form representation of the linguistic signal, and of mapping this representation onto corresponding entries in the mental lexicon. The latter process concerns the integration of a spoken or written word into a higher-order meaning representation of the context within which it occurs. ERPs and reaction times (RTs) were acquired to target words preceded by semantically related and unrelated prime words. The semantic relationship between a prime and its target has been shown to modulate the amplitude of the N 400 to the target. This modulation can arise from lexical access processes, reflecting the automatic spread of activation between words related in meaning in the mental lexicon. Alternatively, the N 400 effect can arise from lexical integration processes, reflecting the relative ease of meaning integration between the prime and the target. To assess the impact of automatic lexical access processes on the N 400, we compared the effect of <b>masked</b> and unmasked <b>presentations</b> of a prime on the N 400 to a following target. Masking prevents perceptual identification, and as such it is claimed to rule out effects from controlled processes. It therefore enables a stringent test of the possible impact of automatic lexical access processes on the N 400. The RT study showed a significant semantic priming effect under both unmasked and <b>masked</b> <b>presentations</b> of the prime. The result for masked priming reflects the effect of automatic spreading of activation during the lexical access process. The ERP study showed a significant N 400 effect for the unmasked presentation condition, but no such effect for the <b>masked</b> <b>presentation</b> condition. This indicates that the N 400 is not a manifestation of lexical access processes, but reflects aspects of semantic integration processes...|$|R

This hypothesis is tested in two experiments using modifications of the dot mask paradigm developed by Lleras and Moore (2003). Target—mask individuation is manipulated by the presentation of additional display items that influence the linking apparent motion seen between a target and a spatially separated mask (Experiment 1), and by the use of placeholders that maintain the target object’s presence during <b>mask</b> <b>presentation</b> (Experiment 2).

Words were presented both masked and unmasked while electrodermal activity was measured. Under unmasked conditions, SCRs were largest for spider words followed by general threat words, then neutral words.

40|$|Background: Converging {{lines of}} {{evidence}} have implicated the amygdala in the pathophysiology of {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). We previously developed a method for measuring automatic amygdala responses to general threat-related stimuli; in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we used a passive viewing task involving <b>masked</b> <b>presentations</b> of human facial stimuli. Methods: We applied this method to study veterans with PTSD and a comparison cohort of combat-exposed veterans without PTSD. Results: The findings indicate that patients with PTSD exhibit exaggerated amygdala responses to masked-fearful versus masked-happy faces. Conclusions: Although some previous neuroimaging studies of PTSD have demonstrated amygdala recruitment in response to reminders of traumatic events, this represents the first evidence for exaggerated amygdala responses to general negative stimuli in PTSD. Furthermore, by using a probe that emphasizes automaticity, we provide initial evidence of amygdala hyperresponsivity dissociated from the “top-down ” influences of medial frontal cortex. Bio...|$|R

In the first study, fifteen AD patients and 26 elderly controls {{engaged in a}} lexical decision task {{with a list of}} words and non-words while event-related brain potentials were recorded. Embedded in the list were two repetition conditions: one where words were repeated at relatively long lags and one where words were repeated shortly after a brief <b>masked</b> <b>presentation.</b> Although elderly controls displayed behavioral and ERP repetition priming for words repeated at long lags, AD patients did not. In contrast, both controls and AD patients displayed an ERP repetition priming effect for the words repeated shortly after a brief <b>masked</b> <b>presentation.</b> Although the 2 ERP priming effects differ in elderly controls, the masked priming effect was also different between controls and AD patients. The results are used to critically assess the utility of an impaired/intact dichotomy when examining memory performance in brain damaged populations and are interpreted as lending support to dimensional models which postulate complex interactions between brain regions. In the second study utilizing the participants from the first study, eighteen AD patients and 22 elderly controls had their EEG recorded under four conditions: eyes open and closed resting baseline, and a verbal and spatial categorization task. EEG power was examined in 6 spectral bands revealing significant differences in the Theta band across all conditions and in the Alpha band during resting eyes closed and the categorization tasks. Alpha activity was examined utilizing instantaneous frequency analysis (IFA) in order to produce a measure of amplitude per unit time in the eyes open baseline and for the verbal and spatial cognitive tasks. The IFA analysis revealed that AD patients, relative to controls, failed to show an event-related decrease in alpha activity across the entire scalp during the performance of the 2 cognitive tasks. The failure of AD patients to display the expected alpha decrease in the left frontal region was significantly correlated with verbal task performance.

40|$|A key {{question}} {{that has come to}} dominate a large body of research on perception to action coupling is the role that consciousness plays in such binding. In fact, there is now considerable evidence that visual stimuli can affect response tendencies even when the stimuli are not consciously perceived. Furthermore, there is also now evidence that subliminally presented stimuli can induce inhibitory effects. It is argued that this inhibitory reversal implements an emergency breaking mechanism - once the evidence for a response is removed (as accrues from <b>mask</b> <b>presentation)</b> the corresponding motor action is suppressed. These results prompt consideration of the computational mechanism that underlies such an inhibitory reversal. Our proposal is that the effect arises from the interplay of response competition (as implemented by lateral inhibition) and a threshold gated direct suppression of strongly activated response nodes. The latter of these is implemented using dedicated opponent processing circuits, Here we present a neural networks-based implementation of these principles, the behaviour of which has a good fit to the available data...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that reminders of one's mortality provoke hostile reactions to those who threaten one's worldview, but such reminders have not been found to create conscious negative affect.

40|$|To {{study the}} dynamic interplay between {{different}} component {{processes involved in}} the identification of fragmented object outlines, a discrete-identification paradigm was used in which the <b>masked</b> <b>presentation</b> duration of fragmented object outlines was repeatedly increased until correct naming occurred. Survival analysis was used to investigate whether and when different types of information such as contour integration cues (proximity, collinearity, and fragment density), fragment properties (low versus high curvature), stimulus complexity (global symmetry, number and saliency of the parts), and memory factors (natural versus artifactual), influenced the timing of identification. The results showed that the importance of these different types of information can change over the time course of object identification, indicating so-called time-course contingencies. Most importantly, the straight segments of a contour played a larger role for complex outlines with high part saliency during early (bottom-up) grouping processes, whereas the curved segments of object outlines were more important during later (top-down) matching processes for simpler outlines with lower part saliency. This new insight can explain why different studies on shape-based object identification have produced seemingly contradictory results. status: publishe...|$|R
