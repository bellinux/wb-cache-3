50|$|Address space layout {{randomization}} {{is based}} upon the low chance of an attacker guessing the locations of randomly placed areas. Security is increased by increasing the search space. Thus, address space randomization is more effective when <b>more</b> <b>entropy</b> is present in the random offsets. Entropy is increased by either raising the amount of virtual memory area space over which the randomization occurs or reducing the period over which the randomization occurs. The period is typically implemented as small as possible, so most systems must increase VMA space randomization.|$|E

In a cyclic process, therefore, the entropy of the system {{at the beginning of the}} cycle must equal the entropy at the end of the cycle.

30|$|The final acts of tubulin docking {{are governed}} by the {{complexity}} of physical interactions. Firstly, due to the left-handed helical lattice symmetry of microtubule wall the docking tubulin interacts with tubulins, which already constitute the GTP-cap tip by means of spatially configured electrostatic interactions. Secondly, it also interacts with the other (competing) docking tubulins, and here are included electrostatic interactions, and excluded volume. Obviously tubulin, before its final addition to the GTP-cap tip, is undergoing strong nonlinear regime of cooperative interactions. Both, the strong interaction cooperativeness and nonlinearity phenomena are necessary ingredients in symmetry breaking during new structure formation [71]. In fact, single microtubule, as well as complex microtubules spatial patterns, manifests distinct symmetry features. On the other hand, from the thermodynamic point of view, since microtubule system is inherently open system, then so-called, spontaneous processes of microtubule growth and self-organization within the system are driven by the production of <b>entropy,</b> <b>more</b> specifically <b>entropy</b> decrease. Taking into account entropy decrease, breaking the symmetry, nonlinearity and cooperativeness of relevant physical interactions, and specific geometry of tubulin molecule, they all together endow the system as the whole {{with the power to}} resolve the enigma of ‘blind mason’ by navigating the tubulin through adjusting its energy, position and proper orientation in order {{to be added to the}} GTP-cap tip.|$|R
