5000|$|Hi. My name is Sam Garcia. I'm from Colorado Springs, Colorado. The {{following}} {{question is for}} Rudy Giuliani. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Giuliani,</b> a while back, a friend and I were having a discussion about you {{and some of the}} other Republican candidates. He blatantly made this statement somewhere along the line: Rudy Giuliani is using September 11, 2001, to propel himself into the White House. My question to you is: How do you respond to this accusation and other accusations similar to it? ...|$|E
5000|$|Hello. My name is Andrew Fink, and I have a {{question}} for Rudy Giuliani. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Giuliani,</b> at a recent NRA convention, you stated that it's every American's right to be secure. Yet, on March 21 of the year 2000, The Boston Globe quoted you as saying, [...] "Anyone wanting to own a gun should have to pass a written exam." [...] Considering the Constitution grants us {{the right to bear arms}} as a means of protection, why do you believe that citizens should be required to pass an exam in order to exercise their right to protect themselves and their families? Thank you.|$|E

[...] The article reported that he seized control of the cleanup of Ground Zero, taking control away from established federal agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He instead handed over responsibility to the [...] "largely unknown" [...] city Department of Design and Construction. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of respirators. Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed.|$|R

50|$|In a {{strongly}} worded article published {{next to a}} photo of an unborn baby in the womb, Cardinal Edward Egan compared tolerating abortions to the reasoning used by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin to commit mass murders.With regard to self-professed Catholic politicians who support abortion, Egan adhered to the Church's discipline of forbidding Holy Communion to such persons due to the public scandal. In April 2008, after newspapers had published photographs of former Mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani receiving Communion at a Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral offered by Pope Benedict XVI, Egan issued a public statement:The Catholic Church clearly teaches that abortion is a grave offense against the will of God. Throughout my years as Archbishop of New York, I have repeated this teaching in sermons, articles, addresses, and interviews without hesitation or compromise of any kind. Thus it was that I had an understanding with Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, when I became Archbishop of New York and he was serving as Mayor of New York, {{that he was not}} to receive the Eucharist because of his well-known support of abortion. I deeply regret that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Giuliani</b> received the Eucharist during the Papal visit here in New York, and I will be seeking a meeting with him to insist that he abide by our understanding.|$|E
