40|$|Fluid–particle {{systems as}} {{commonly}} encountered in chemical, metallurgical and petroleum industries are mostly polydisperse in nature. However, the relations {{used to describe}} fluid–particle interactions are originally derived from <b>monodisperse</b> <b>systems,</b> with ad hoc modifications to account for polydispersity. In previous work it was shown that for bidisperse systems with moderate diameter ratios of 1 : 2 to 1 : 4, this approach leads to discrepancies, and a correction factor is needed. In this work we demonstrate that this correction factor also holds for more extreme diameter ratios of 1 : 5, 1 : 7 and 1 : 10, although the force on the large particles is slightly overestimated when using the correction factor. The main origin of the correction is that the void surrounding the large particles becomes less {{in case of a}} bidisperse mixture, as compared to a <b>monodisperse</b> <b>system</b> with the same volume fraction.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} particle size distribution on the rheological properties of concentrated colloidal dispersions both steady-state shear and oscillatory measurements have been performed on well-characterized bimodal dispersions of sterically stabilized PMMA particles. Replacing a minor amount of large particles by small ones in a concentrated dispersion, keeping the total effective volume fraction constant, decreases the viscosity quite drastically. On the other hand, replacing a small amount of small particles by big ones hardly effects the viscosity at all.

40|$|A {{particle}} size distribution is incorporated into a three-dimensional homogenisation scheme, devised {{on the scale of}} a particle and its immediate (or first ring) of neighbours. Based on this scheme, micropolar continuum models for polydisperse, dry, and densely packed granular assemblies of spherical particles undergoing quasi-static deformation are developed for various {{particle size}} distributions. Three different cases are considered: (1) a monodisperse assembly, (2) a defect particle in an otherwise monodisperse assembly, and (3) an assembly of a given {{particle size distribution}}. In Case 1, an additional dependence on particle radius is found in 3 D systems, compared with previous 2 D constitutive laws. In Case 2, it is found that a small (large) particle in an otherwise <b>monodisperse</b> <b>system</b> increases (decreases) the stress compared to a purely monodisperse assembly, but the couple stress may increase or decrease depending on the relative size of the rolling resistance compared with the tangential stiffness coefficients. On the other hand, if the defect particle is substantially smaller or larger than the monodisperse particle size, the stress and couple stress are always increased. In Case 3, three different distributions are examined, i. e. square, normal and a lognormal distribution. For Cases 2 and 3, both the stress and the couple stress increased with the degree of dispersity, from the lower bound value corresponding to the <b>monodisperse</b> <b>system</b> considered in Case 1.

40|$|We perform {{extensive}} Monte Carlo simulations {{to investigate}} the phase behaviour of colloidal suspensions of hard board-like particles (HBPs). While theories restricting particle orientation or ignoring higher ordered phases suggest {{the existence of a}} stable biaxial nematic phase, our recent simulation results on <b>monodisperse</b> <b>systems</b> indicate that this is not necessarily the case, even for particle shapes exactly in between prolate and oblate geometries, usually referred to as self-dual shape. Motivated by the potentially striking impact of incorporating biaxial ordering into display applications, we extend our investigation to bidisperse mixtures of short and long HBPs and analyse whether size dispersity can further enrich the phase behaviour of HBPs, eventually destabilise positionally ordered phases and thus favour the formation of the biaxial nematic phase. Not only do our results indicate that bidisperse mixtures of self-dual shaped HBPs cannot self-assemble into biaxial nematic phases, but they also show that these particles are not able to form uniaxial nematic phases either. This surprising behaviour is also observed in <b>monodisperse</b> <b>systems.</b> Additionally, bidisperse HBPs tend to phase separate in coexisting isotropic and smectic phases or, at relatively large pressures, in a smectic phase of mostly short HBPs and a smectic phase of mostly long HBPs. We conclude that limiting the particle orientational degrees of freedom or neglecting the presence of positionally ordered (smectic, columnar and crystal) phases can dramatically alter the phase behaviour of HBPs and unrealistically enlarge the region of stability of the biaxial nematic phase.
