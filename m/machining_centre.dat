40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{availability}} and productivity of manufacturing systems, process monitoring has become an important matter in modern automated plants. The traditional monitoring technologies are based on single sensors and are insufficient, especially for manufacturing processes of highly complicated and automated systems. Instead, multi-sensor based technologies are developing rapidly and are widely used for such monitoring tasks. This paper introduces a multi-sensor based process monitoring system for an existing <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The system can monitor the major manufacturing process faults or abnormalities of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> and provide maintenance planning through measuring and analysing multiple sensor parameters such as power, vibration, temperature and pressure of spindle, feed axes, and hydraulic and pneumatic systems of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The general structure of the monitoring system and {{the implementation of the}} main steps of the monitoring system development are presented in detail...|$|E

In order to detect collision between the robot arm and its environment, an accurate model was built using a computer aided design (CAD) system and the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) notation was used to represent the robot arm transformation matrix. When collision was detected for a given contact point, both cutter location and robot arm positions were modified.

40|$|Abstract. In {{small and}} medium batch series {{manufacturing}} the small tool and workpiece changing time {{is one of}} the main objectives to follow in obtaining high productivity. These auxiliary times are defined as the times consumed with preparing and changing the next tool or workpiece to follow the machining process, times that usually overlap the machining process. For this purpose <b>machining</b> <b>centres</b> are equipped with an automatic tool changer system and an automatic pallet changer system. The palletizing systems imply eliminating the times consumed with the alignment, fixing and clamping of the workpieces, these systems consisting of several mechanisms: the pallet, the automatic pallet changing mechanism, the positioning mechanism and the pallet clamp/unclamp mechanism.

Both approaches have a systematic and computerised algorithm to search automatically for the nonlinear and interaction terms between different temperature variables. The experimental results on a <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> show that both the MRA and the ANN can accurately predict the time-variant thermal error components under different spindle speeds and temperature fields.

D. work conduced in the frame of automotive sector. 1 Problem statement In the field of industrial systems, the continuous control of system performances is one of the major key to ensure enterprise competitiveness and to face economic issues, particularly in automotive sector, context of this Ph. D. work. In manufacturing industry, system performances can be related both to the production system itself through its feature and operating condition and the product/service it is delivering. This respectively correspond to the effectiveness/efficiency of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> (e. g. productivity, availability) and the quality of the machined part (e. g. dimensional variation, surface roughness). According to Renault postulate, degradation at component level can considerably affect the quality of the machined part, in spite of periodic maintenance policy. Health state of each component (individual view) could be seen not critical for the component itself but combination of these degradations could lead to deviation of the product parameter. Moreover, product quality deviation is often resulting from the combination of degradation of several system components (Cocheteux et al. 2010). Then, to preserve quality of machined part, operators have to reconsider machining parameters.
