5|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> {{concerns}} {{facing the}} government in exile in 1940 was the situation of Belgian refugees in the United Kingdom. By 1940, at least 15,000 Belgian civilians {{had arrived in the}} United Kingdom, many of them without their possessions. The refugees had originally been dealt with by the British government, however in September 1940, the government established a Central Service of Refugees to provide material assistance and employment for Belgians in Britain.|$|E

5|$|For many at the indaba, the <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> {{motivator}} was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula {{considered the}} Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, {{he understood that}} Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged {{to protect him from}} incursions by the Boers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> political issues today.|$|E
5|$|Men without property, {{who were}} thereby {{excluded}} from the qualifying social classes of the adsidui, were exempted from military service {{on the grounds that}} they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> circumstances, even these proletarii were pressed into service, though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops in all of these classes would fight together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.|$|E
5000|$|... "Down in a Hole" [...] {{is a power}} ballad by Alice in Chains, {{featured}} on their album Dirt (1992). It is the twelfth song on <b>most</b> <b>pressings</b> of the album and fourth or eleventh on others. The song was included on the compilation albums Nothing Safe: Best of the Box (1999) and Music Bank (1999).|$|R

It also appears as track 39, track 10 (mostly in Europe and Australia) or as a hidden track {{following}} [...] "Flood" [...] on track 9. On certain Japanese imports, [...] "Disgustipated" [...] is track 70. In all cases, it {{is listed as}} track 10 on the album itself.|$|R
5000|$|While {{many fans}} {{perceive}} this song as being {{inspired by the}} Steven Spielberg film E.T., it is really about a school in Southern California that's actually called [...] "Heartlight". The song was inspired by writings from students from that school. On <b>most</b> <b>pressings</b> of High Adventure and on some Loggins greatest hits compilation albums, it is officially titled simply [...] "Heartlight". The title was expanded to [...] "Welcome to Heartlight" [...] to avoid confusion with Neil Diamond's song also called [...] "Heartlight".|$|R
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> {{economic}} {{matter the}} Nazis initially faced was the 30 percent national unemployment rate. Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, created in May 1933 a scheme for deficit financing. Capital projects were {{paid for with}} the issuance of promissory notes called Mefo bills. When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money to do so. While the national debt soared, Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the debt. Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|Among the company's {{other goals}} {{was that of}} helping finance road {{projects}} on Øygarden. The <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> issue was the section from Kolltveit on Store Sotra to the bridge, part of National Road 555. In 1976, the company issued NOK5 million in an interest-free loan to the project, which was repaid in 1982 and 1983. Similar conditions were imposed for NOK2 million for National Road 561 to Nordra Straumsundet and NOK1.2 million {{for the establishment of}} the Solsvik–Rong Ferry in 1974. The rest of the subsidies were given as grants. The main project was National Road 561, which ran from Kollveit northwards through Øygarden, for which the company paid NOK28.6 million. It paid a further NOK9.3 million for other projects in Sotra and Øygarden, including connections to Turøy and Misje.|$|E

5|$|When the {{national}} service scheme was ended following {{the election of}} the Whitlam Government in late 1972, the 3rd Division lost a large number of personnel. At this time, the division's artillery assets included two artillery field regiments, a medium regiment, and a divisional locating battery, and although on paper the division was a large, combined arms formation, in reality many of its units were hollow and inadequately equipped, and in the decades following this the division, and indeed the CMF in general, underwent a period of uncertainty as the government attempted to solve the issues that the organisation faced, the <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> of which was the question of its role and strategic relevance, as well as those concerning conditions of service, centralisation of training and access to equipment.|$|E
5|$|After {{the sudden}} and {{unexpected}} death of Carneiro Leão in September 1856, his cabinet only {{managed to survive}} him by a few months. The Emperor, although critical {{of the way the}} Conciliation had been implemented, had learned to appreciate its merits and was eager that it continue. PedroII's support gave the Conciliation another chance, and allowed Paranhos to return to government once more as Foreign Minister on 12 December 1858. The <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> issue facing Paranhos was the Paraguayan government's persistent refusal to allow Brazilian ships access to Mato Grosso province. At that time, the best and fastest way to reach that distant Brazilian province was to travel via the Atlantic and from there up the rivers which flow between the nations south of Brazil. One of the reasons for Brazil's war against Argentina in 1851 was to assure the free passage of its ships. The crisis between Brazil and Paraguay had dragged on since Paranhos's tenure as Foreign Minister in Carneiro Leão's cabinet. On 12 February 1858, Paranhos signed a treaty with Paraguay which allowed Brazilian ships unrestricted navigation of Paraguayan rivers. This prevented the outbreak of war—or at least deferred the conflict until 1864.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> {{foreign policy}} {{concerns}} when Grant took office were resolving the Alabama claims against Great Britain and whether to recognize Cuban belligerency. The {{dispute with the}} United Kingdom stemmed from a complex of grievances centering on attacks on American shipping during the Civil War by the , a Confederate warship constructed in England. Senator Charles Sumner, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, believed the British had violated American neutrality and demanded reparations. Sumner convinced his fellow Senators to reject the Johnson administration's proposed settlement, believing that Britain should directly pay $2 billion in gold or, alternatively, cede Canada to the United States. Fish and Boutwell convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were more important than acquisition of territory, and the two nations agreed to negotiate along those lines. To avoid jeopardizing negotiations, Grant refrained from recognizing Cuban rebels who were fighting for independence from Spain, {{which would have been}} inconsistent with American objections to the British granting belligerent status to Confederates. A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, but not fault. The Senate approved the Treaty of Washington, which also settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries, by a 50–12 vote in 1871.|$|E
5000|$|The group {{recorded}} {{their first}} album, The Only Truth, which {{was released in}} 1972. Some discographies and music catalogs continue to list the album’s release date as 1968 or 1969. The confusion over the release date may come from the album’s serial number of 69000 (originally released through the unpublished Starshine label) {{and the fact that}} the album had a very short release period. The first single from the album was [...] "Who Can I Say You Are". <b>Most</b> <b>pressings</b> of this single incorrectly list the album's original title as 'The First Supper'. In the 1980s and 1990s, the original vinyl LP pressing of the album had become somewhat of a collector’s item due to its rarity, and the fact that it came with a full-size color poster.|$|R
5000|$|Reappear Here is {{a limited}} vinyl, {{containing}} five tracks (four of them so far exclusive to this release), including a new track called [...] "All I See".

This was a 100-copy batch, although as with <b>most</b> <b>pressings</b> some extra copies were made. Currently there are 109 copies known in existence (108 autographed and numbered, and one unnumbered unsigned copy). 78 copies were given out at the discretion of Hybrid and Distinct'ive Records, and the remaining 30 were prizes as part of a Disappear Here promotion contest that ended on 31 April, 2010.

Oldbuck was the {{foremost}} and <b>most</b> earnest, <b>pressing</b> forward with unwonted desperation to the very brink of the crag, and extending his head (his hat and wig secured by a handkerchief under his chin) over the dizzy height, {{with an air of}} determination which made his more timorous assistants tremble.|$|R
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> threat {{for many}} species, {{particularly}} the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, {{and for the}} most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and even mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naïve seabirds. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand's Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. Gould's petrels breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.|$|E
5|$|The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general {{election}} {{and led by}} Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the <b>most</b> <b>pressing</b> issue facing the empire: Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress (led by Mahatma Gandhi) and the Muslim League (led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to {{how it should be}} implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than June 30, 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.|$|E
