In India, the development of short-duration and shortstatured sorghum hybrids resulted in a quantum jcrmp in productivity from 560 kg ha" in 1970 to 1020 kg ha" in 1996. However, yield potentials of sorghum hybrids are not fully realized as they are highly susceptible to grain moulds, which not only cause yield loss but also reduce grain quality and market value.

Alongside this, the efficacy of thiram and Bavistin [carbendazim] SD and ST in controlling seed mould fungi was determined. Infection of seed coat, endosperm and embryo of sorghum was due to Fusarium verticillioides and Curvularia lunata [Cochliobolus lunatus]. Infection of plant tissues was lower in resistant than susceptible cultivars. Infection by C. lunata and F. verticillioides ranged from 20 to 84 % and from 12 to 74 %, respectively. All the fungicide treatments reduced the grain colonization by mould fungi in cultivars Bulk Y, SPV 104, IS 8545 and PKV 801 compared to the control. Seed treatment with thiram reduced seed infection by C. lunata, whereas seed treatment with bavistin reduced seed infection by F. verticillioides.

In this study, 13 grain <b>mould</b> <b>resistant</b> and seven susceptible lines of sorghum were analysed for biochemical defence mechanism. The levels of total phenols and phenylalanine ammonia lyase were almost same in the resistant and susceptible genotypes. However, two additional isoforms of peroxidase were found in the three of the 13 resistant genotypes. The isoform peroxidase corresponding to the R f value of 0. 25 was found in the resistant genotypes IS 13969, ICSB 377 and IS 8219 - 1, and two genotypes IS 13969 and ICSB 377 had an additional isoform corresponding to the R f value of 0. 32.

5000|$|Spiramycin is a 16-membered ring macrolide. It was {{discovered}} in 1952 {{as a product of}} Streptomyces ambofaciens. As a preparation for oral administration it has been used since 1955, in 1987 also the parenteral form was introduced into practice. The antibiotic action involves inhibition of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell during translocation. Resistance to spiramycin can develop by several mechanisms and its prevalence is to a considerable extent proportional to the frequency of prescription in a given area. The antibacterial spectrum comprises Gram-positive cocci and rods, Gram-negative cocci and also Legionellae, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, some types of spirochetes, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium species. Enterobacteria, pseudomonads and pathogenic <b>moulds</b> are <b>resistant.</b> Its action is mainly bacteriostatic, on highly sensitive strains it exerts a bactericide action. As compared with erythromycin, it is in vitro weight for weight 5 to 20 less effective, an equipotential therapeutic dose is, however, only double. This difference between the effectiveness in vitro and in vivo is explained above all by the great affinity of spiramycin to tissues where it achieves concentrations many times higher than serum levels. An important part is played also by the slow release of the antibiotic from the tissue compartment, the marked action on microbes in sub-inhibition concentrations and the relatively long persisting post-antibiotic effect. Its great advantage is the exceptionally favourable tolerance-gastrointestinal and general. It is available for parenteral and oral administration ...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{production}} of patulin in apple fruits is mainly by Penicillium expansum, there is no information {{on the ability of}} heat <b>resistant</b> <b>moulds</b> that may survive pasteurization to produce this mycotoxin in juice packages during storage and distribution. In this study, {{the production}} of patulin by Byssochlamys spp (Byssochlamys nivea FRR 4421, B. nivea ATCC 24008 and Byssochlamys fulva IOC 4518) in cloudy and clarified apple juices packaged in laminated paperboard packages or in polyethylene terephthalate bottles (PET) and stored at both 21 degrees C and 30 degrees C, was investigated. The three Byssochlamys strains were able to produce patulin in both cloudy and clarified apple juices. Overall, the lower the storage temperature, the lower the patulin levels and mycelium dry weight in the apple juices (p< 0. 05). The greatest variations in pH and degrees Brix were observed in the juices from which the greatest mycelium dry weights were recovered. The maximum levels of patulin recovered from the juices were ca. 150 mu g/kg at 21 degrees C and 220 mu g/kg at 30 degrees C. HPLC-UV, HPCL-DAD and mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the ability of B. fulva IOC 4518 to produce patulin. Due to the heat resistance of B. nivea and B. fulva and their ability to produce patulin either in PET bottles or in laminated paperboard packages, the control of contamination and the incidence of these fungi should be a matter of concern for food safety.

40|$|Given {{the rise}} in {{incidence}} of invasive fungal infections, limited range of effective antifungal agents and increasing resistance amongst pathogenic fungi, there is an urgent need to explore novel drug targets and new antifungal agents. The fungal virulence determinant, phospholipase B (PLB) {{is considered to be}} one such a potential target for antifungal drug therapy and prompted the development of various classes of PLB inhibitors, including the bis(alkylpyridinium) alkanes compounds and miltefosine (MI), both of which have ‘lipid-like” structures. This thesis demonstrates that the novel compounds, bis(alkylpyridinium) alkane, and especially, MI may be effective antifungal agents. Key findings were that bis(alkylpyridinium) alkanes had in vitro activity against pathogenic yeasts such as Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp., while MI demonstrated synergistic activity against <b>resistant</b> <b>moulds</b> such as Scedosporium, Fusarium and the mucormycetes in combination with either posaconazole or voriconazole. This work also provides insight into how MI causes apoptosis-like cell death in yeast, namely via activation of the metacaspase encoded by MCA 1. An efflux pump Hxt 13 p was also identified in yeast which when overexpressed led to MI resistance. Further study into the antifungal properties and mechanisms will provide more useful information necessary for using such compounds to boost drug development.

Calcineurin and its chaperone, the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90), represent an important pathway for fungal virulence that can be targeted at different levels. We investigated the antifungal activity of compounds directly or indirectly targeting the Hsp 90 -calcineurin axis against different mould species. Methods The in vitro antifungal activity of the anticalcineurin drug FK 506 (tacrolimus), the Hsp 90 inhibitor geldanamycin, the lysine deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A and the Hsp 70 inhibitor pifithrin-μ was assessed by the standard broth dilution method against 62 clinical isolates of Aspergillus spp. and non-Aspergillus moulds (Mucoromycotina, Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp., Purpureocillium/Paecilomyces spp. and Scopulariopsis spp.) Results FK 506 had variable antifungal activity against different Aspergillus spp. and was particularly active against Mucor spp. Geldanamycin had moderate antifungal activity against Fusarium spp. and Paecilomyces variotii. Importantly, trichostatin A had good activity against the triazole-resistant Aspergillus ustus and the amphotericin B-resistant Aspergillus terreus as well as the MDR Scedosporium prolificans. Moreover, trichostatin A exhibited synergistic interactions with caspofungin against A. ustus and with geldanamycin against Rhizopus spp. for which none of the other agents showed activity. Pifithrin-μ exhibited little antifungal activity. Conclusions Targeting the Hsp 90 -calcineurin axis at different levels resulted in distinct patterns of susceptibility among different fungal species. Lysine deacetylase inhibition may represent a promising novel antifungal strategy against emerging <b>resistant</b> <b>mould...</b>|$|R

Mold growth was carried out under different conditions of water activity (a w) (0. 99, 0. 96, 0. 95, 0. 93, 0. 90) and ascospore age (I) (30, 51, 60, 69, 90 days). Growth parameters as length of adaptation phase (&# 955;), maximum specific growth rate (µmax) and maximum diameter reached by the colony (&# 955;) were obtained through the fit of the Modified Gompertz model to experimental data (measuring radial colony diameter). Statistica 6. 0 was used for statistical analyses (significance level &# 945; = 0. 05). The results obtained clearly showed that water activity is statistically significant and that it influences all growth parameters, while ascospore age does not have any statistically significant influence on growth parameters. Also, these data showed that by increasing a w from 0. 90 to 0. 99, the &# 955; value substantially decreased, while µmax and &# 955; values rose.

40|$|The {{risks for}} {{invasive}} fungal infections, particularly mould infections such as invasive aspergillosis, among {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant (HSCT) recipients {{are linked to the}} duration and severity of myelosuppression and immunosuppres-sion. Strategies to prevent invasive fungal infections have focused primarily on the use of orally administered azole antifungal agents during the neutropenic period rather than on the more prolonged post-engraftment period. The major limitations of these studies included the heterogeneity among the subjects studied for fungal infection risk factors, the agents administered, the dosing, and duration of prophylaxis. More recent studies have attempted to examine the efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis strategies among allogeneic HSCT recipients to day 100 and beyond. It is clear that a variety of products have efficacy in preventing invasive candidiasis, including imidazole and triazole antifungals, low-dose amphotericin B, and the echinocandin, micafungin; however, only the extended spectrum azole, itraconazole, has been shown to impact the incidence of proven invasive aspergillosis. Other extended spectrum azole antifungal agents, voriconazole and posaconazole, are being studied as long-term prophylaxis in high-risk HSCT recipients. While clinical trials have suggested that a duration of prophylaxis against moulds of six months or more may be required, it remains unclear if this is required in all cases. The prophylactic efficacy over time may be linked to the degree of immunosuppression as measured by markers such as the numbers of circulating CD 4 T lymphocytes. Concerns about selection for <b>resistant</b> <b>moulds</b> among long-term recipients of these drugs are emerging. The cumulative experience to date suggests that long-term antifungal chemoprophylaxis is feasible and effective when applied in defined circumstances.
