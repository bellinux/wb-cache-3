Metallographic investigations were performed nearby the fracture in the roll. Observations were conducted on polished sections, first not etched, and then etched, which allowed us to trace carefully the propagation of the fracture. There was found a strict correlation between the microstructure of the roll and the progress occurring in the crack. It was ascertained that the basic reason for the damage to the roll was banded precipitations of ledeburitic cementite. In addition, cementite formed a continuous network. Another microstructure defects of that roll are also precipitations of secondary carbides on the boundaries of former grain of austenite as well as the occurrence of upper bainite in its matrix.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the role of the {{microstructure}} in the tribological wear processes occurring in a cast iron <b>mill</b> <b>roll.</b> For this purpose, a piece of a broken roll, made in Italy, was collected. Its microstructure consisted of modular graphite, transformed ledeburite and a matrix composed of bainite and martensite. Metallographic investigations were performed on the roll working surface in conjunction with metallographic tests effected within its surface layer. There was established the relation between the microstructure of the roll and the process of its tribological wear. The following was ascertained: micro-shrinkages or graphite precipitations nearby the working area cause cracks between those places and the working area; in the surface layer, cracks occur usually in the zone of ledeburitic cementite. At places of considerable precipitations of ledeburitic cementite, the tribological wear intensity of the roll is lower. A banded layout of precipitations of ledeburitic cementite facilitates a selective spalling of some parts of the roll material. The results of this study allow broadening the data base related to the effect of the microstructure on tribological wear of mill rolls, which in future will permit one to design their proper microstructure of cast iron mill rolls...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} roll {{eccentricity}} compensation in steel-strip rolling mills is examined. A novel roll eccentricity sensor is {{proposed for the}} task of retrieving the desired reference signal from the available roll-force measurement. The sensor implements a modified comb filter structure which can be arranged in either tunable or adaptive form. Simulation results based on typical experimental data indicate that the proposed sensor is appropriate and offers distinct advantages over other methods. The proposed comb filter is new {{in the sense that}} it consists of a number of second-order notch filter models with specially constrained bandwidth characteristics. An approximate gradient-based adaptive algorithm is used for the frequency estimation. The important feature of such an algorithm is that it is robust and is simple to implement. The advantages of the sensor include fast convergence and accurate parameter estimates. No extra positional sensors are required since this information can be easily obtained from the phase estimates. Finally, the sensor is not based on approximate mill models; it treats the problem as a harmonic series buried in noise. The resulting solution is based on time domain measurements that characterize the <b>mill</b> <b>roll</b> eccentricity conditions during operation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{possibility}} of using grooving to measure volume {{and type of}} residual stresses distribution in hard faced work rolls for cold rolling with high hardness of an active layer is described in this paper. Intorduction Residual stresses {{have a significant impact}} on the longevity of the work rolls of cold rolling. At high level and unfavorable allocation residual stresses summarize with contact and heat stresses and cause early fracture of a work roll active layer. It is important to be aware of volume and features of residual stresses distribution and to manage the process when they are formed to decrease their negative influence on the durability of work rolls. It should be taken into consideration when the fabrication process of work rolls (thermo hardening, active layer hard facing, etc.) or work roll steel type is being changed. That is why it is necessary to create favorable stress condition to increase reliability as well as durability of work rolls for cold rolling [1]. Such steels as 9 Х, 9 Х 2 В are usually used to produce a unit-forged <b>mill</b> <b>roll.</b> The necessary intense and uniform hardness of working layer, its height, and favorable stress condition in work rolls are reached by means of different ways of thermal treatment.

Numerical results point out that graphite expansion notably affects the evolution of stress-strain fields within the casting to an extent that it could lead to the formation of macroscopic cracks {{in the early stages of}} the casting solidification. Furthermore, the numerical analysis highlights that the thermal deformation of the permanent mold contributes to increase the risk of cracks to occu...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{role of the}} {{chemical}} composition of cast irons for <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> in tendencies of diffusionless transformations in the matrix was determined. The investigations of {{the chemical}} composition, microstructure and hardness influence on tribological properties of mottled cast iron {{is presented in the}} paper. Design/methodology/approach: The research stand is generally used in the tribological tests, and the counter sample of the material also common in such tests. Bearing steel 100 Cr 6, of a hardness of 57 HRC, was applied as a counter sample. The tribological tests were performed at a load of 100 N. Samples for tests were taken from seven <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> made by various producers. Mottled cast irons had a different chemical composition. Findings: The role of individual alloying elements in a tendency of the diffusionless transformations in the matrix, hardness, wear resistance and friction coefficient of mottled cast irons used for the <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> was estimated. The hardness increase rather increases the wear resistance of the investigated cast irons. Research limitations/implications: The possibility of designing the chemical composition of mottled cast iron {{in such a way as}} to obtain the low tribological wear at retaining, at the same time, the high friction coefficient was found.

40|$|The surface {{deterioration}} of work rolls constitutes a significant constraint on {{the operation of}} hot mills, as the duration of rolling campaigns are greatly restricted by the surface condition of the rolls. Work roll changes account for {{a large proportion of}} downtime in the operation of hot strip mills, resulting in financial penalties for the mill operators in terms of lost production and roll maintenance. It is generally accepted that thermal fatigue represents one of the main factors influencing work roll wear in the finishing stands of a hot strip mill. In order to assess the thermal fatigue behaviour of typical work roll alloy grades, a series of tests were performed on high-speed steel (HSS) and high-carbon high-chromium steel samples using a stand alone twin-disc simulation machine under conditions that are comparable to those of hot rolling of steel. The progressive changes in surface condition of the roll samples were monitored and anal ysed by means of stylus profilometry, optical and scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results were compared with fragments of scrapped work rolls taken from the mill.

A challenge of single kernel testing using an instrument such as the Perten Single Kernel Characterisation System (SKCS) is to relate the results to actual breakage achieved during roller milling. As a step toward this, wheat varieties covering a wide hardness range were broken in the SKCS and in the Satake STRâ€“ 100 test roller <b>mill</b> (<b>roll</b> gaps of 0. 3 â€“ 0. 8 mm; sharpâ€“toâ€“sharp and dullâ€“toâ€“dull roll dispositions) and the resulting breakage materials were studied for the two systems. The particle size distribution (psd) produced on breakage of wheat by the SKCS itself was measured using laboratory scale plansifting, and compared with the psd produced from first break milling at different roll gaps and under different roll dispositions. Under both sharpâ€“toâ€“sharp and dullâ€“toâ€“dull milling in the roller mill, the effect of increasing kernel hardness {{was due to the}} increase in the average size of the broken particles which showed that harder kernels do not break so readily. However, milling under dullâ€“toâ€“dull disposition at larger roll gaps showed the average psd decreased slightly with increasing kernel hardness. This unexpected result was also observed from the SKCS. Harder kernels resulted in smaller particles in the broken material which indicates a very positive crushing action within the SKCS.

40|$|Thermal fatigue {{represents}} {{one of the most significant}} causes for roughing <b>mill</b> <b>roll</b> deterioration and possible failure. The materials ability to withstand thermal cycling is strictly correlated to its microstructural properties, which are the result of the solidification process and following heat treatment. Rolls for hot strip rolling mills are usually produced by centrifugal casting, without subsequent forging. A crucial role is played by the eutectic carbide network developing on solidification, which represents a preferential pattern for crack propagation. For this reason conventional highly alloyed HSS are not a popular substitute for traditional Chromium steel rolls in rougher stands. The so- called “semi-HSS”, containing less C (0. 7 - 0. 9 %C) and alloying elements are usually preferred by users requiring improved roll material. Specially developed “HSS for roughers ” are being tested in various mills, but they are out of the scope of this paper. The present work is part of a continuing effort by INNSE Cilindri (RIVA Group) and Trento University to improve the “semi HSS ” grades. In particular the thermal fatigue resistance of a new class of low-C semi HSS is evaluated. For purpose of comparison, both a conventional semi-HSS and a HSS grade were also considered. The test is based on induction heating (Tmax= 670 °C) and water cooling of cylindrical discs. Experimental results confirm the lower susceptibility towards heat checking of the new grades, containing reduced amount of eutectic carbides, the best behaviour being exhibited by a steel with a mixed martensite-bainite matrix microstructure.

40|$|A 2 -dimensional {{model of}} a <b>mill</b> <b>roll</b> {{temperature}} distribution and radial thermal expansion is presented. The emphasis is on selective axial coolant distribution {{as a method of}} controlling strip profile. The Fourier equations describing heat conduction are solved using the method of finite differences. The following effects are considered: (i) The temperature distribution within the roll and strip just prior to entry to the roll bite. (ii) The heat generated in the strip due to deformation. (iii) The heat generated by friction between the strip and the roll. (iv) The temperature distribution of the strip and roll af ter each pass. (v) The heat conducted into the roll when in contact with the strip. (vi) The heat removed from the roll by the coolant, the air and the back-up rolls. The model also takes account of the geometry of the roll. This complexity means that different models for the roll and strip temperature distributions are required. The model evaluates individual heat transfer coefficients along the axis of the roll in order to simulate the effectiveness of each spray zone in removing heat from the roll. A simplified method of evaluating roll thermal cambers, derived from the model, is presented. The model shows good agreement between predicted and measured roll thermal cambers. The model is linked to a strip profile prediction model and used to investigate the effects of changing spray patterns and roll bend on profile. It was found that changing spray pattern has a significant effect on strip profile. It was concluded that: (i) Level spray patterns gave the best shape. (ii) Edge sprays sensitivity is important. (ii) over-cooling outside the strip provides good parabolic shape. ' (iv) A change to exit side, spray levels has a significant effect on strip profile. (v) Exit side sprays only has a tendency of rolling out the middle of the slab (i. e. a flat middle). (vi) All level sprays on the exit side of the roll only produce a distorted profile on the strip. It was also found that for any given change in roll thermal camber, there is a corresponding change in strip profile. The two changes can be related by a linear factor. The value of this factor has been investigated and found to be product and mill dependent. ...|$|E
