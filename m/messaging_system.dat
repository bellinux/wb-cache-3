Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private <b>messaging</b> <b>system</b> software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements.

However, unless dramatic breakthroughs in standards are made soon, each of these communities will be isolated, unable to exchange messages. This article describes the major stadardization issues raised by EMS: message structure standards; delivery standards; address identification standards; and, user interface standards. The {{problem of how to}} set EMS standards is also discussed. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{low cost}} and nearly {{instantaneous}} sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills have made collaborative work dramatically easier, {{with the help}} of collaborative software. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the free software movement, which has produced, among other things, Linux, Mozilla Firefox, and OpenOffice.org (later forked into LibreOffice). Internet chat, whether using an IRC chat room, an instant <b>messaging</b> <b>system,</b> or a social networking website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day. [...] Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.|$|E

These messages appeared in speech bubbles over the avatar's head and in a chat log. Users could switch between text chat and voice chat from within the chat log. Voice chat, with the use of a headset, was available within personal spaces and clubs, or on private voice chat channels with groups of up to eight users. The user could also perform visible gestures (or [...] "e-motes") such as waving, nodding, or dancing. A [...] "quick chat" [...] feature, with predetermined phrases, was also available. Users could also indicate the emotional status of their avatar, which was displayed below their name. Some avatar costumes also had additional e-motes.|$|E
2500|$|Destinys {{style has}} been {{described}} as a first-person shooter that incorporates role-playing and massively multiplayer online game (MMO) elements, but Bungie has avoided defining Destiny as a traditional MMO game. Instead, the game has been referred to as a [...] "shared-world shooter," [...] as it lacks many of the characteristics of a traditional MMO game. For instance, rather than players being able to communicate with all other players in the game or on a particular server — as is the case in many conventional MMO games — Destiny includes on-the-fly matchmaking that allows players to communicate only with other players with whom they are [...] "matched" [...] by the game. To communicate with other players in the game world, players must use their respective console's <b>messaging</b> <b>system.</b> Time-limited events and modes are also occasionally added or featured in-game. Activities in Destiny are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types across the Cosmodrome and the Plaguelands (added with Rise of Iron) on Earth, its Moon, Venus, and Mars. There are also PvP maps for Mars's moon Phobos and the planet Mercury. A social space on Mercury was added with the House of Wolves expansion, but requires players to go undefeated in the Trials of Osiris Crucible mode in order to access it. Another PvE area, a massive ship called the Dreadnaught that is situated in the rings of Saturn, and two PvE missions on Phobos were added with The Taken King expansion.|$|E
