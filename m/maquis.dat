5|$|He was {{assigned}} as an instructor in Starfleet's Advanced Tactical Training and achieved {{the rank of}} lieutenant commander. Following {{the death of his}} father in 2368 while defending his colony from the Cardassians, Chakotay resigned his Starfleet commission and joined the <b>Maquis.</b> At the time of his resignation, one of his students was Ro Laren. After he joined the <b>Maquis,</b> he became captain of a vessel named the Val Jean, with a crew which among others included his lover Seska (Martha Hackett), B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), and Tuvok (Tim Russ), who was actually Captain Janeway's Chief of Security, on an undercover mission to infiltrate the <b>Maquis.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{several months}} it was {{partially}} occupied by some German units. In 1944 {{some members of}} the <b>maquis</b> were hidden there.|$|E

5|$|On board a Runabout, Odo (René Auberjonois) and Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) are {{in pursuit}} of a <b>Maquis</b> vessel in the Badlands. They pursue the vessel to a small moon and land nearby. They find that the <b>Maquis</b> vessel is empty, and split up to search for the pilot. After a short while, Odo comes across Kira, whose foot is caught in an {{expanding}} crystal mass. Odo is unable to either remove the crystal from Kira, or transport Kira back to the Runabout.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{an action}} {{figure of a}} Kazon was {{released}} {{as part of a}} second wave of Playmates Toys' Star Trek merchandise. The same year, Applause produced a ceramic mug whose design was based on the face of a generic Kazon male. Several figures on Kazon spacecrafts were released by Revell, such as those for the raider ship and torpedo. Revell included the raider ship figurine {{as a part of a}} three-piece set, along with ones for a <b>Maquis</b> ship and USS Voyager.|$|E
5|$|Out of the 804 {{species of}} flora {{distributed}} throughout the park, six are endemic, completely exclusive to the park area, and cannot be observed anywhere else on earth, while another 30 are indigenous. The most common and widely distributed plant species throughout the national park are Mediterranean <b>maquis</b> shrubs such as the Phoenician juniper (Juniperus phoenicea). Other common vegetative species within the area include the oleaster-leafed pear (Pyrus elaeagnifolia), Turkish pine (Pinus brutia), and elm-leaved sumach (Rhus coriaria).|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and <b>Maquis</b> crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) is abducted, along with Tuvok (Tim Russ), while on a survey mission and forced by her captors to fight in an arena for the entertainment of others.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and <b>Maquis</b> crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, Voyager encounters a swarm of space-borne lifeforms, which mistake the vessel for a member of their species. The presence of the aliens induce a premature mating cycle in Kes (Jennifer Lien), causing her and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) to question whether or not they are ready to have children.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (<b>maquis),</b> miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and <b>Maquis</b> crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, the Voyager crew discover a ship sent from Starfleet that could take them back to the Alpha Quadrant in just 3 months, but it will mean abandoning their vessel. However, it is all revealed to be an elaborate trap as the alien Arturis (Ray Wise) attempts to gain his revenge on the crew for preventing the destruction of the Borg.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, Sihanouk {{ordered the}} arrest of Chinese {{middlemen}} involved in the illegal rice trade, thereby raising government revenues and placating the conservatives. Lon Nol was forced to resign, and, in a typical move, the prince named new leftists to the government to balance the conservatives. The immediate crisis had passed, but it engendered two tragic consequences. First, it drove thousands of new recruits {{into the arms of}} the hard-line <b>maquis</b> of the Cambodian Communist Party (which Sihanouk labelled the Khmers rouges ("Red Khmers")). Second, for the peasantry, the name of Lon Nol became associated with ruthless repression throughout Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time after}} his stay in Marseille, Tzara joined the French Resistance, {{rallying}} with the <b>Maquis.</b> A contributor to magazines {{published by the}} Resistance, Tzara also {{took charge of the}} cultural broadcast for the Free French Forces clandestine radio station. He lived in Aix-en-Provence, then in Souillac, and ultimately in Toulouse. His son Cristophe was at the time a Resistant in northern France, having joined the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans. In Axis-allied and antisemitic Romania (see Romania during World War II), the regime of Ion Antonescu ordered bookstores not to sell works by Tzara and 44 other Jewish-Romanian authors. In 1942, with the generalization of antisemitic measures, Tzara was also stripped of his Romanian citizenship rights.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the main German units retreated through Lyon. On 2September the 36thInfantry Division arrived at Lyon {{to find the}} <b>Maquis</b> {{fighting}} the Milice {{with much of the}} factory areas on fire. The next day, Lyon was liberated and 2,000 Germans were captured, but the rest had already continued their retreat north. Lyon celebrated for two days with the Americans. The Allies made a last-ditch attempt to cut off the Germans with an offensive towards Bourg-en-Bresse by the 45thDivision and the 117thCavalry Squadron from the original Taskforce Butler. However, the 45thDivision was not able to overcome the German defenses near the town. The 117thCavalry Squadron had more success, bypassing Bourg-en-Bresse and taking Montreval and Marboz north of Bourg-en-Bresse instead. By 3September Montreval was secure, but the squadron soon found itself trapped by units from the 11thPanzer Division, which surrounded the town. As a result, the squadron was almost annihilated, and the German escape route was again open. The American units then retired to Marboz.|$|E
5|$|During the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) the château was {{occupied}} several {{times by the}} English. It was demolished in 1442, but was soon rebuilt using the original stones. In the religious wars of 16th and 17th centuries the château was a base for Huguenot forces, and in 1650 it was partly demolished by royal troops. Another château was erected but it received extensive damage in a fire in 1793 during the French Revolution. The château was renovated in the romantic style after the Bourbon Restoration of 1815, and has been extensively modified since then. During World War II (1939–45) the château housed French troops and refugees from Alsace-Lorraine in 1940 and for several months it was partially occupied by some German units. In 1944 {{some members of the}} <b>maquis</b> were hidden there. The château was listed as a monument historique on 31 March 1966, and obtained full protection on 19 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{the pilot}} episode of Voyager, while the crew on the Val Jean seek to evade a Cardassian vessel captained by Gul Evek (Richard Poe) in the Badlands, the vessel is transported some 70,000 light years across the galaxy into the Delta Quadrant by the {{creature}} {{known as the}} Caretaker. After the Federation starship USS Voyager is also trapped in the Delta Quadrant and Tuvok was revealed to be a Starfleet agent, Chakotay agrees with Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{to work together to}} find two of their missing crew. Following an attack by the Kazon, Chakotay destroyed the Val Jean to save Voyager and the <b>Maquis</b> crew joined the Federation ship. Chakotay was given a provisional rank of commander and named executive officer, the second-in-command of the vessel and the crew seeks to return home to the Alpha Quadrant.|$|E
5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and <b>maquis.</b> The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E
5|$|Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata) is also rufescent {{and very}} similar to M. rufobrunnea. It is found in mountainous forests and <b>maquis</b> and forms a marked sinus at the {{attachment}} of the cap with the stem, which is pure white. At maturity, it develops more or less parallel, ladderlike interconnecting ridges. Microscopically, it often has moniliform paraphyses with septa extending in the upper half and has more regularly cylindrical or clavate 'hairs' on the stem, up to 100 μm long. M.guatemalensis, found in Central America, has a color ranging from yellow to yellowish-orange, but never grey, {{and it has a}} more distinct reddish to wine red bruising reaction. Microscopically, it has smaller paraphyses, measuring 56–103 by 6.5–13µm. The New Guinean species M.rigidoides has smaller fruit bodies that are pale ochre to yellow, without any grey. Its pits are less elongated than those of M.rufobrunnea, and it has wider paraphyses, up to 30µm.|$|E
5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to know who she is. Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the <b>Maquis</b> ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion. She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away. Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder, but not of his feelings for her.|$|E
5|$|In early August 1944, Bezen Perrot was {{evacuated}} from Rennes joining the Germans in their {{retreat to the}} east, as Allied troops continued their advance from the north. During the unit's stay in Paris, Chanteau deserted causing others to follow his example. Three of the deserters later defected to the French Forces of the Interior, fighting in the Liberation of Paris. On 15 August, it was stationed in Creney-près-Troyes where it participated in the execution of 49 suspected <b>Maquis.</b> It passed through Strasbourg in October, reaching Tübingen in December. On 16 December, the unit celebrated {{the first anniversary of}} its formation. Lainé and Péresse were promoted to Untersturmführer and Sturmscharführer respectively, 18 other members received promotions and Wound Badges when they were due. On 29 December, Lainé reorganized the unit into four groups of 8 to 10 men. The first group joined the Waffen-SS, the second and third groups were dispatched to the Black Forest where they received sabotage and radio operation training accordingly. The fourth group consisted of members who were unsuitable for all other tasks, a self-proclaimed propaganda section. The Allies continued to pressure on forcing the 2nd and 3rd Groups to relocate to Fürstenfeldbruck on 25 April 1945. The staff of Bezen Perrot moved to Marburg in the same month. As Germany's defeat seemed imminent members were instructed to return to Brittany and go into hiding to areas where they would not be likely to be recognized. Those who had not joined the Waffen-SS were left on their own.|$|E
25|$|Ivorians have a {{particular}} kind of small, open-air restaurant called a <b>maquis,</b> which is unique to the region. A <b>maquis</b> normally features braised chicken and fish covered in onions and tomatoes, served with attiéké or kedjenou.|$|E
25|$|New Caledonia has its {{own version}} of <b>maquis</b> (<b>maquis</b> minier) {{occurring}} on metalliferous soils, mostly in the south. The soils of ultramafic rocks (mining terrains) have been a refuge for many native flora species because they are toxic and their mineral content is poorly suited to most foreign species of plants.|$|E

25|$|All over France, the <b>maquis</b> {{attempted}} to seize towns in June 1944, expecting the Allies {{to be there}} soon, often with tragic results. For instance, in Saint-Amand-Montrond, the <b>maquis</b> seized the town and took 13 miliciens and their associated women prisoners, including the wife of Francis Bout de l'An, a senior leader of the Milice who intervened to take personal charge of the situation to get his wife back. A joint German-milice force marched on Saint-Amand-Montrond, causing the <b>maquis</b> to retreat and when the Axis forces arrived, eleven people were shot on the spot while a number of hostages were taken. The Milice chief of Orléans and the archbishop of Bourges were able to negotiate an exchange on 23 June 1944, where the <b>Maquis</b> released their female hostages (except for one woman who chose to join the <b>maquis)</b> {{in exchange for the}} Milice releasing their hostages, through the Germans refused to free any of their hostages and instead deported them to the concentration camps. As for the miliciens taken hostage, the maquisards knew if they were freed, they would reveal their hideout and their names as both the miliciens and maquisards had grown up in the same town and knew each other well (men on both sides had once been friends) {{while at the same time}} food was in short supply, making their hostages a drain on their food supplies; leading to the maquisards to hang their hostages (shooting them would make too noise) out in the woods. Bout de l'An decided to seek revenge for his wife's captivity by sending a force of miliciens under Lécussan to round up the surviving Jews of Bourges and buried 36 Jews alive out in the woods, as Bout de l'An believed that resistance was all the work of the Jews.|$|E
25|$|In June and July 1944, the massif became {{important}} in World War II {{with the establishment}} of the Free Republic of Vercors, led by the <b>Maquis</b> du Vercors, a base for the French Resistance against German occupation.|$|E
25|$|Many Spanish escapees joined French Résistance groups; others formed {{their own}} {{autonomous}} groups which {{became known as}} the Spanish <b>maquis.</b> In April 1942, Spanish communists formed an organisation called the XIV Corps, an armed guerrilla movement of about 3,400 combatants by June 1944. Although the group first worked closely with the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), it re-formed as the Agrupación de Guerrilleros Españoles (Spanish Guerrilla Group, AGE) in May 1944. The name change was intended to convey the group's composition: Spanish soldiers ultimately advocating the fall of General Francisco Franco. After the German Army had been driven from France, the Spanish <b>maquis</b> refocused on Spain.|$|E
25|$|To the north, {{below the}} steep cliffs of the plateau, lies a narrow belt of Mediterranean farmland. Olives and other {{mediterranean}} {{fruits and vegetables}} are grown here. To the south, the forest and farmland gives way to juniper bush <b>maquis</b> and pre-desert scrub with some winter grazing.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests: This {{ecoregion}} {{occupies the}} coastal strip of southern Anatolia between the Taurus Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. Plant communities include broadleaf sclerophyllous <b>maquis</b> shrublands, forests of Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis) and Turkish Pine (Pinus brutia), and dry oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands and steppes.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} was {{preceded by}} weeks of intense resistance activity. Coordinated with the massive bombardments of the Transportation Plan {{and supported by the}} SOE and the OSS, partisans systematically sabotaged railway lines, destroyed bridges, cut German supply lines, and provided general intelligence to the allied forces. The constant harassment took its toll on the German troops. Large remote areas were no-go zones for them and free zones for the maquisards, so-called after the <b>maquis</b> shrubland that provided ideal terrain for guerrilla warfare. For instance, a large number of German units were required to clear the <b>maquis</b> du Vercors, which they eventually succeeded with, but this and numerous other actions behind German lines contributed to a much faster advance following the Provence landings than the Allied leadership had anticipated.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Spanish Civil War the executions of the “enemies of the state” {{continued}} (some 50,000 people), {{including the}} extrajudicial (death squad) executions of members of the Spanish <b>maquis</b> (anti–Francoist guerrillas) and their supporters (los enlaces, “the links”);in the province of Córdoba 220 <b>maquis</b> and 160 enlaces were killed. Thousands of men and women were imprisoned after the civil war in Francoist concentration camps, approximately 367,000 to 500,000 prisoners in 50 camps or prisons. In 1933, before the war, the prisons of Spain contained some 12,000 prisoners, but, by 1940, one year after {{the end of the}} civil war, there were 280,000 prisoners contained in more than 500 prisons throughout the country. The principal purpose of the Francoist concentration camps was to classify the prisoners of war from the defeated Spanish Republic; men and women classified as “unrecoverable”, were put to death.|$|E
25|$|After {{reaching}} Britain, Wake {{joined the}} Special Operations Executive. On {{the night of}} 29/30 April 1944, she parachuted into occupied France near Auvergne, becoming a liaison between London and the local <b>maquis</b> group headed by Captain Henri Tardivat in the Forest of Tronçais. From April 1944 until the liberation of France, her 7,000+ maquisards fought 22,000 German soldiers, causing 1,400 casualties, while suffering only 100 among themselves.|$|E
25|$|After the {{official}} {{end of the}} war, guerrilla warfare was waged on an irregular basis by the Spanish <b>Maquis</b> well into the 1950s, gradually reduced by military defeats and scant support from the exhausted population. In 1944, a group of republican veterans, who also fought in the French resistance against the Nazis, invaded the Val d'Aran in northwest Catalonia, but were defeated after 10 days.|$|E
25|$|Aegean and Western Turkey {{sclerophyllous}} {{and mixed}} forests: These Mediterranean-climate forests occupy the coastal lowlands and valleys of western Anatolia bordering the Aegean Sea. The ecoregion has forests of Turkish pine (Pinus brutia), oak forests and woodlands, and <b>maquis</b> shrubland of Turkish pine and evergreen sclerophyllous trees and shrubs, including Olive (Olea europaea), Strawberry Tree (Arbutus unedo), Arbutus andrachne, Kermes Oak (Quercus coccifera), and Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis).|$|E
25|$|He {{participated in}} {{establishing}} {{a section of the}} <b>maquis</b> where he officially became one of the local leaders in the Vercors Plateau and in the Chartreuse Mountains. He helped people to avoid being taken into the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), the Nazi forced-labour program agreed upon with Pierre Laval, by creating in Grenoble the first refugee for resistants to the STO; he founded the clandestine newspaper L'Union patriotique indépendante.|$|E
25|$|Only {{a limited}} {{minority}} {{took part in}} the armed battles. Although women were typical partisan resistance fighters in Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and the occupied USSR, feared and as numerous as men, they were a small minority in the <b>maquis</b> in France. It has been speculated that this may have been influenced by the fact that French women were not subject to the Service du travail obligatoire (English: Compulsory Work Service; STO), as were women in other occupied territories.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the blow}} inflicted by Barbie by arresting Moulin, by 1 October 1943 the AS {{had grown to}} 241, 350 members, through most were still unarmed. For the most part, the AS refrained from armed {{operations}} as it {{was no match for}} the Wehrmacht. Instead the AS forced on preparing for Jour J when the Allies landed in France after which the AS would swing into action. In the meantime, the AS focused on training its members and conducting intelligence-gathering operations for the Allies. In October 1943, Joseph Darnand, the chief of the Milice who long been frustrated at the unwillingness of the Germans to arm his force finally won the trust of the Reich by taking a personal oath of loyalty to Hitler and being commissioned as a Waffen-SS officer together with 11 other Milice leaders. With that, the Germans finally started to arm the Milice, which promptly turned its guns on the Resistance. The weapons the German provided the Milice with were mostly British weapons captured at Dunkirk in 1940, and as the <b>maquis</b> received many weapons from the SOE, it was very often the case that in the clashes between Milice and the <b>Maquis,</b> Frenchmen fought Frenchmen with British guns and ammunition.|$|E
