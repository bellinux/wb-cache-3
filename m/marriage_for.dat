5|$|Cosimo {{went about}} {{arranging}} a <b>marriage</b> <b>for</b> his elder son, Ferdinando, in 1686. He ushered {{him into the}} marriage as the other Tuscan princes, Francesco Maria de' Medici and Gian Gastone de' Medici, were sickly and unlikely to produce children. The main suitors were: Violante of Bavaria, a Bavarian princess, Isabel Luisa of Portugal (the heiress-apparent of Portugal), and the Elector Palatine's daughters.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age for <b>marriage</b> <b>for</b> a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E

Soon after the divorce, Johnson began dating Lauren Hashian, {{the daughter of}} Boston drummer Sib Hashian.

5|$|Meanwhile, Guddu's lover Sweety, {{sister of}} the {{politician}} Sunil Bhope, reveals that she is pregnant with Guddu's child and expresses her wish to marry Guddu. They marry later that night. Bhope hears about his sister's actions and sends his men to apprehend the lovers. Bhope's men gatecrash Guddu's wedding and beat him, then realise {{that he is a}} migrant from Uttar Pradesh. This enrages Bhope, who orders his men to kill Guddu and return Sweety to his house so he can arrange a <b>marriage</b> <b>for</b> her.

Thorgerd was initially reluctant to marry {{the son of a}} slave, refusing to believe that Olaf's mother was a princess. However, she ultimately agreed to the match after an hours-long private conversation with Olaf. At the wedding Olaf gave Egil an ornate sword from Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Deshasthas are {{historically}} an endogamous and monogamous {{community for}} whom marriages take place by negotiation.

5|$|The {{early life}} of Chinese revolutionary and {{politician}} Mao Zedong covered the first 27 {{years of his}} life, from 1893 to 1919. Born in Shaoshanchong, Shaoshan in Hunan province, Mao grew up {{as the son of}} Mao Yichang, a wealthy farmer and landowner. Sent to the local Shaoshan Primary School, Mao was brought up in an environment of Confucianism, but reacted against this from an early age, developing political ideas from modern literature. Aged 13 his father organised a <b>marriage</b> <b>for</b> him with Luo Yigu, the daughter of another land-owning family, but Mao denounced the marriage and moved away from home.|$|E

5|$|The poet Eka Budianta {{notes that}} {{a common theme}} in Soeman's works was the {{strength}} of love {{and its ability to}} overcome obstacles. Soeman wrote of the power of romance and <b>marriage</b> <b>for</b> love in response to the treatment of women in adat (traditional) culture. Among the Malays of Riau, arranged marriages were common, and women would sometimes be married to men older than their father. Before marriage, young women would be secluded and unable to interact with any men except for the ones chosen to be their husbands. Similarly, Soeman used Kasih Tak Terlarai to criticize the mistreatment of orphans after adoption.|$|E
5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees {{marriage as a}} unique bond between {{two people who are}} in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light. There are often political or other non-romantic functions that must be served and the relative wealth and power of the potential spouses may be considered. <b>Marriage</b> <b>for</b> political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern seen for centuries among European rulers.|$|E

5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than <b>marriage</b> <b>for</b> men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{discharged}} Palatine Theodore Csanád {{and restored}} Julius Kán {{in the second}} half of 1222. The following year, Pope Honorius urged Andrew to launch a new crusade. If the report of the Continuatio Claustroneuburgensis is reliable, Andrew took the cross to show that he intended launch a new crusade, but no other sources mention this event. Andrew planned to arrange a new <b>marriage</b> <b>for</b> his eldest son, Béla, but Pope Honorius mediated a reconciliation between Béla and his wife in the autumn of 1223. This angered Andrew, and Béla fled to Austria. He returned in 1224, after the bishops persuaded Andrew to forgive him.|$|E
5|$|Henry and his {{new wife}} did not {{conceive}} any children, generating prurient speculation as to the possible explanation, {{and the future of}} the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered Stephen of Blois as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial <b>marriage</b> <b>for</b> Stephen to a wealthy heiress, Matilda. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E

5|$|Joint {{families}} were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even {{father and son}} have been recorded in inscriptions. Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women. The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of early <b>marriage</b> <b>for</b> women. Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 {{years of age and}} the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger. This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes. Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow would immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families. The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged. The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes.|$|E

After talk of Ileana marrying the Tsar of Bulgaria or the Prince of Asturias, she was eventually betrothed to Alexander, Count of Hochberg, a minor German prince, in early 1930.
