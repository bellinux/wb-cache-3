40|$|Introduction Mohr's {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} when shear failure {{along a plane}} takes place, the normal stress and the shear stress acting on that plane have a characteristic functional relationship. This function relating and, it is proposed, depends on the material and can be represented on the plane by a line defining the critical values of and for shear failure. In practice this critical line is constructed tangen-tially to Mohr circles representing different combinations of principal stresses applied to specimens of a particular material and is therefore {{referred to as the}} <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope.</b> For some materials a straight <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope</b> with the equation = c + µ appears from the results of triaxial testing. Furthermore in the routine testing of some materials (e. g. soils) a straight line envelope is sometimes assumed a priori. In such tests small deviations of the Mohr circles from the envelope are attributed to errors and a best-fitting straight line is used to obtain the parameters (µ, c) necessary to characterize the properties of the material. We describe here a procedure for calculating a best-fitting straight <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope</b> from data consisting of the applied principal stresses (i. e. from the Mohr circles). The concept of best-fit used The criterion used for selecting the envelope of best fit is illustrated in Fig. 1. By means of a least-squares fit we represent the <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope</b> by a straight line = c + µ- subject to the condition that...|$|E
40|$|Abstract For {{the purpose}} of {{exploring}} deformation characteristics of jointed rock masses, influence of joint inclination and confining pressure on the mechanical behavior of discontinuous rock a series of compression tests were conducted under satisfactory testing conditions on three types of sandstone from various locations. Three groups of jointed specimens were used in this research, including specimens containing saw cut planar joint, shear-surface joint and split breakage joint. The specimens were tested triaxially up to 70 MPa confined pressure. A 5 MN servo-controlled stiff testing machine was employed and a monitoring system was set up using a microcomputer controlled logger. The deformation characteristics of jointed specimens with saw cut joints were different in low and high confinements, however, in split breakage joints sliding behavior was the same in low and high confinements. <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope</b> for 60 ° inclination in split breakage joints was above that of 45 ° in both saw cut and split breakage joints, i. e. a higher coefficient of sliding friction or a higher shear strengt...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{predicting}} pore pressure has been invented. The method utilizes currently recorded drilling measurements {{to predict the}} pore pressure of the formation through which the bit is drilling. The method applies Mohr?s Theory to describe the stresses {{at the bottom of}} the borehole. From the stress state and knowledge of <b>Mohr?s</b> <b>Envelope,</b> the pore pressure is predicted. To verify the method, a test procedure was developed. The test procedure enabled systematic collection and processing of the drilling data to calculate the pore pressure prediction. The test procedure was then applied to industry data that was recorded at the surface. The industry data were composed of wells from different geographical regions. Two conclusions were deduced from the research. First, Mohr?s Theory indicates that the model is valid. Second, because of too much variation in the torque measurements the model cannot be proved and requires further investigation...|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the literature on design stresses in silos revealed that limiting stress analysis is traditionally used in the design of silos for static lateral stresses, and that overpressures due to the unloading process are allowed for by empirical overpressure factors. It is hypothesized that dilation (volume increase due to shear strain) of the stored material may be a rational explanation for overpressures. Tests in a specially constructed triaxial apparatus indicate that maize, wheat and barley dilate during standard triaxial shear tests, whereas oats, which has higher void ratios, does not. The tests also show that the <b>Mohr</b> failure <b>envelopes</b> are not linear, as normally assumed, but are concave downwards. General expressions for the compression loading tangent modulus and the <b>Mohr</b> failure <b>envelope</b> are developed, and the parameters for the four grains, each at three bulk densities, evaluated. For the maize, wheat and barley, the highest friction angles and initial tangent moduli and the lowest failure strains occur at the intermediate bulk densities. Standard and constant volume tests indicate that stress-strain characteristics are more dependent upon grain packing and stress history, whereas frictional behavior is more dependent upon the geometry and surface roughness of the individual grains...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{the problem of}} working unit stability, showing a limit state of a rock tension with the <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope</b> known from a theory of failure, is described. It is obvious that a load of {{building}} units in mountain massives can be expressed easily either by simple or multiaxial compressions, and then, {{on the basis of}} individual states characteristics, individual conditions of stability can be observed. So we may understand that such building units can be broken even in case of a certain discharge, i. e. lowering of one of main tensions of both of them as well. Combined methods of discharge and surchage can be used too. Another reactive power of an enormous value is caused by pre-fault then. In the OKR district it means even 10 % of the seam thickness with common conditions (e. g. saddle seams). An area of a contact between a seam, original rocks and seam thickness should be taken into consideration as serious conditions of rock bumps origin. If this contact area is wavy of the seam thickness is small (possibly both conditions are valid), there will be no risk of any rock bump...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{and analyses}} two different possible problems {{determined by the}} future realization of some ski-tracks in the Sappada area. The alternating strato of siltstone, sandstone and marl, which crop out on the slopes flanking the Lech Rio (track 01; Fig. 1), justified the determination, for each lithotype, of the ten parameters of discontinuity, later used to define the RMR, RMRc, SMR and modified GSI systems. The cross-section of such a complex stratification was obtained through the delimitation of some areas - structural regions -, distinguished by homogeneous physical and mechanical properties, though characterized by different proportions of the above mentioned lithotypes. Besides, it was traced {{the presence of a}} weathered surface portion of the rock mass, which has different strength characteristics. The stability analysis, computed through the SLOPE/W program, allowed determining minimum factors of safety and the associated critical slip surfaces. Two different strength models were employed: in the former, known as Coulomb's shear strength criterion, the cohesion and the angle of internal function were respectively obtained using Hoek's equations of 1998 and the RMR system, where the two geomechanical characteristics are conditioned by the calculation methods used; in the latter, the generalized Hoek & Brown criterion for jointed rock masses, along with the equations suggested by Balmer G. in 1952, resulted in an equivalent <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope,</b> relating normal and shear stresses mechanically distinguishing every structural region...|$|E
40|$|This report {{concerns}} the stabilization of three crushed limestones by an ss- 1 asphalt emulsion and an asphalt cement, 120 - 150 penetration. Stabilization is evaluated by marshall stability and triaxial shear tests. Test specimens were compacted by the marshall, standard proctor and vibratory methods. Stabilization is evaluated primarily by triaxial shear tests in which confining pressures of 0 to 80 psi were used. Data were obtained on {{the angle of}} internal friction, cohesion, volume change, pore water pressure and strain characteristics of the treated and untreated aggregates. The <b>MOHR</b> <b>envelope,</b> bureau of reclamation and modified stress path methods {{were used to determine}} shear strength parameters at failure. Several significant conclusions developed by the authors are as follows: (1) the values for effective angle of internal friction and effective cohesion were substantially independent of asphalt content, (2) straight line MOHR envelopes of failure were observed for all treated stones, (3) bituminous admixtures did little to improve volume change (deformation due to load) characteristics of the three crushed limestones, (4) with respect to pore water characteristics (pore pressures and suctions due to lateral loading), bituminous treatment notably improved only the bedford stone, and (5) at low lateral pressures bituminous treatments increased stability by limiting axial strain. This would reduce rutting of highway bases. At high lateral pressures treated stone was less stable than untreated stone...|$|E

30|$|Three {{different}} types of triaxial tests were performed: (1) pore pressure stepping tests at variable pore pressure conditions. During the pore pressure stepping tests, the confining pressure (σ 3) was held constant at 55 and 65  MPa, respectively. The pore pressure was decreased in three steps from 80 % to 50 % and 25 % of the confining pressure or from 90 % to 60 % and 30 % of the confining pressure, respectively. This allowed examining the peak strength at different effective confining pressure conditions. (2) In the confining pressure stepping tests, deformation tests were conducted at up to five different confining pressures. In these tests, the confining pressure was increased in each deformation phase in 10 -MPa steps up to five times from 25 to 65  MPa, while the pore pressure was generally 80 % of the confining pressure. Confining pressure stepping tests allow {{the determination of the}} peak strength at different confining pressure conditions of a sample. Deformation was stopped at the yield point in the pre-failure phase (Kovári and Tisa 1975) to avoid damage of the specimen and permit multiple tests. This procedure allows calculations of <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelopes</b> from the data to derive cohesion and angles of internal friction. Also, the influence of the variable pore pressure conditions can be studied in these tests. (3) A cyclic test (18  cycles) at constant confining pressure and constant pore pressure: In this test, confining pressure and pore pressure were kept constant (σ 3 [*]=[*] 55  MPa, pore pressure = 80 % of σ 3). The sample was cyclically loaded to a differential stress of 70  MPa. After the holding times, the axial load was decreased. This procedure was repeated 18 times. The cyclic test allows simulation of the effect of cyclic loading during earthquake cycles.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with an investigation of some factors influencing the use of coarse colliery discards as a fill material for reinforced earth construction. The work carried out {{in this study is}} primarily a laboratory study, investigating the properties of the fill materials, reinforcements and the soil-reinforcement interaction coefficients. Test were carried out on Cardown colliery discards to establish the geotecnical properties and to establish weather the discards satisfied the criteria set out by BE 3 / 78 (revised) and the DTp specification for Highway works(1986). Instruments ranging fro free field strain coils were used to measure strains in the soils. All methods utilised are reported. But, the success of the methods considered varied {{due to the nature of}} the fill materials. A through investigation was carried out to establish the shear strength envelope. The shear strength envelopes were established, they are as follows: i 0 Particle sizes pertaining to the whole grading curve; ii) Specific particles size ranges; These tests indicate that the envelope can e segregated into two sections, one for the low stress region and another for the high stress region. The results of the former indicate tht the shear strength is stress dependent and can be accurately fitted by curvilinear regression analyses. The interaction tests carried out in this study and the data reviewed fro the other sources when represented non-dimentionally indicates that the RMS strips and the Tenser SR 2 grinds yield the highest alpha values and hence the coefficients of friction. The result of shales tested with RMS strips yeild the highest coefficients of interaction. Envelopes have been formulated, subsequent to the collection of data for all the materials considered in this study. The results indicates that the alpha values as presented in BE 3 / 78 (re viced) are conservative, in the case of the RMS strips. The pull-out tests carried out in this study indicates that the RMS strips are the most efficient of all the conventional strips. The grid tests yielded the highest pull-out forces and they were most efficient of all the reinforcements tested. The field pull-out test data as reported by we indicated that the friction coefficients were lower with respect to the laboratory Data. This can be attributed to the difference in compaction. Comparison of the coefficient of friction indicates that the skin friction tests as measured in the shearbox are lower with respect to the pull-out test data. An equation was formulated using the results of the established <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelopes</b> with respect to particle size, skin friction tests and the spacing of the ribs in a RMS strip. The predicted values are accurate to within 10 % of the measured values. The assessments of the cost benefits of using collier discards as the fill materials indicate that the benefit of colliery discard utilization is dependent on the cost of the fill and the haulage costs. With the benefits being over 30 % with respect to conventional structures. The results of this study indicate that colliery discards when carefully selected and tested can be used as a fill material in reinforced earth constructions...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutive}} {{behavior of}} uncemented granular {{materials such as}} strength, stiffness, and localization of deformations are to a large extend derived from interparticle friction transmitted between solid particles and particle groups. Interparticle forces are highly dependent on gravitational body forces. At very low effective confining pressures, {{the true nature of}} the <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope,</b> which defines the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for soils, as well as the relative contribution of each of non-frictional components to soil's shear strength cannot be evaluated in terrestrial laboratories. Because of the impossibility of eliminating gravitational body forces on earth, the weight of soil grains develops interparticle compressive stresses which mask true soil constitutive behavior even in the smallest samples of models. Therefore the microgravity environment induced by near-earth orbits of spacecraft provides unique experimental opportunities for testing theories related to the mechanical behavior of terrestrial granular materials. Such materials may include cohesionless soils, industrial powders, crushed coal, etc. This paper will describe the microgravity experiment, 'Mechanics of Granular Materials (MGM) ', scheduled to be flown on Space Shuttle-MIR missions. The paper will describe the experiment's hardware, instrumentation, specimen preparation procedures, testing procedures in flight, as well as a brief summary of the post-mission analysis. It is expected that the experimental results will significantly improve the understanding of the behavior of granular materials under very low effective stress levels...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises five manuscripts {{resulting from}} a study on a critical problem {{in the oil industry}} called 2 ̆ 2 Sanding 2 ̆ 2. Sanding is a phenomenon in which sand from a formation is drawn into a well during production and pumped along with oil and gas. This occurs in weakly cemented sands and sandstones, and can cause significant damage, including erosion of pipelines, loss of production, and in extreme cases the loss of oil wells. A knowledge of the strength of these formation is critical for the effective analysis of sanding potential and design of possible preventive measures. ^ The objective of this research is to develop a practical tool for estimating the strength of weakly cemented sands (i. e. unconfined compressive strength, real cohesion, and friction angle) from commonly measured geophysical logs (compression wave velocity, shear wave velocity, and porosity). To achieve this, an extensive laboratory testing program was conducted on artificially cemented samples of varying densities and levels of cementation. Geophysical measurements on these samples included bulk density and shear wave velocities. The laboratory testing program included triaxial compression tests, unconfined compression tests and indirect tension tests. Real cohesion and tangential friction angles were estimated using a nonlinear <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope.</b> ^ Based on the laboratory results, four empirical models were developed that related small strain shear modulus or compression/shear wave velocity ratios with shear stresses at failure. Because in situ logs are influenced by environmental conditions, and pore fluid composition, a methodology was developed to estimate strength from synthetic velocities. This methodology has the potential to estimate the unconfined compressive strength, and real cohesion of weakly cemented sand directly from field measured porosity and compression wave velocity logs. ...|$|E
40|$|Basaltic {{rocks are}} thought to {{constitute}} a volumetrically significant rock type on the Moon, Mercury, Mars, and Venus, {{in addition to the}} Earth. Spacecraft images of surfaces with known or suspected basaltic composition on these bodies, particularly on Venus, indicate that these rocks have been deformed in the brittle regime to form faults and perhaps dilatant cracks, in addition to folding and more distributed types of deformation. Predictions of brittle fracture or other types of deformation are made by comparing calculated stresses from a tectonic model to some criterion for rock strength. Common strength criteria used in the planetary science literature for near-surface deformation include a Griffith tensile-strength criterion for intact rock, a <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope</b> for intact basalt, and a brittle strength envelope based on Byerlee's law of rock frictional resistance. However, planetary terrains of basaltic composition consist of much more than just intact basaltic rock. The aggregate basaltic material, termed the 'rock mass,' consists of both the intact rock and the associated fracture, faults, lithologic contacts, and other discontinuous surfaces. A basaltic rock mass is the relevant material for which strength properties must be defined and calculated model stresses must be compared to in order to more accurately predict brittle deformation. For example, the various strengths of a rock mass are less than that of intact material of the same composition. This means that tectonic models which compare stresses to intact failure strengths overestimate the stresses required for fracture and so underestimate the extent and magnitude of brittle deformation predicted in these models. On the other hand, rock mass shear strength can be greater than that predicted from Byerlee's law. The concept of rock mass strength is central to many engineering design studies in which calculated stresses are used to predict brittle fracture, and this experience indicates that brittle strength envelopes which assume properties for intact rock (Griffith parabolas) or sliding along a single, continuous surface (Byerlee's law) inadequately characterize the tensile, compressive, and shear strengths of rock masses. The criterion adopted here to relate stresses to rock mass fracture is based on a Griffith-type curve for tensile normal stress and a concave downward curve for compressive normal stress. It is the only available criterion that explicitly considers the weakening effects of discontinuities within the rock mass on the stress state required for fracture...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough many intact rock types {{can be very}} strong, a {{critical}} confining pressure can eventually be reached in triaxial testing, such that the <b>Mohr</b> shear strength <b>envelope</b> becomes horizontal. This critical state has recently been better defined, and correct curvature or correct deviation from linear Mohr–Coulomb (M-C) has finally been found. Standard shear testing procedures for rock joints, using multiple testing of the same sample, in case of insufficient samples, can be shown to exaggerate apparent cohesion. Even rough joints {{do not have any}} cohesion, but instead have very high friction angles at low stress, due to strong dilation. Rock masses, implying problems of large-scale interaction with engineering structures, may have both cohesive and frictional strength components. However, it is not correct to add these, following linear M-C or nonlinear Hoek–Brown (H-B) standard routines. Cohesion is broken at small strain, while friction is mobilized at larger strain and remains {{to the end of the}} shear deformation. The criterion ‘c then σn tan φ’ should replace ‘c plus σntan φ’ for improved fit to reality. Transformation of principal stresses to a shear plane seems to ignore mobilized dilation, and caused great experimental difficulties until understood. There seems to be plenty of room for continued research, so that errors of judgement of the last 50 years can be corrected...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work determined the shear strength parameters (angle of friction and cohesion), {{and the rock}} mass parameters (Tensile Strength, Global Strength and Deformation Modulus) of Obajana and Ewekoro limestone deposits of Nigeria. The Hoek – Brown constants were also evaluated and the <b>Mohr</b> – Coulomb <b>Envelope</b> plotted for the deposits. Obajana Deposit is unique while that of Ewekoro is of three different categories based on hardness, density and mere visual inspection. Schmidt hammer hardness and Density tests were performed. The results obtained were {{used to evaluate the}} Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) and consequently, the Point load index (Is) of the rock studied. The shear strength parameters for the kinematic analyses were obtained using Roclab 1. 0 from Rocscience with the evaluated intact uniaxial compressive strength, estimated geological strength index, material constants, disturbance factor of the rock and the intact modulus as input parameters. This gives friction angles of 28. 980, 24. 720, 31. 860 and 28. 980; and cohesion of 3. 414 MPa, 1. 928 Mpa, 5. 566 MPa and 2. 902 MPa for Obajana, Ewekoro Type I, Ewekoro Type II and Ewekoro Type III deposits respectively. The intact modulus of 12000 mPa and highest level of disturbance by blasting (1) were used. These two chosen values are to ensure maximum factor of safety if the result of the shear strength and rock mass parameters are used in mining and civil design works...|$|R
40|$|Series of {{undrained}} compression (UUC), undrained extension (UUE), consolidated undrained compression (CU), and {{uniaxial compression}} (UC) tests {{were carried out}} on samples of Chalk Marl from the Channel Tunnel. The analysis {{of the results of}} these tests has shown that the Chalk Marl is characterised by slightly non-linear stress-strain behaviour, very brittle failure, a substantial loss of post-peak strength and small strains to failure. <b>Mohr</b> failure <b>envelopes</b> in terms of effective stress for vertical and horizontal specimens were found to be straight lines within the range of stresses investigated. The stress-strain relationships are characterised by hysteresis of residual strain upon removal of stress. A series of isotropically consolidated drained tests on specimens of different orientations was carried out. The effect of anisotropic consolidation was studied by carrying out some anisotropically consolidated drained tests using the modified Hoek Cell. Strength and deformation characteristics measured lateral deformations, Poisson's ratio and the range of the elastic behaviour were studied in detail. Values of the elastic parameters required for the isotropic mathematical model were determined. The anisotropic behaviour of Chalk Marl in drained and undrained conditions was analysed and the five elastic parameters required to describe the complete anisotropic stress-strain relationships were determined. It was found that Chalk Marl exhibits a marked degree of deformation anisotropy, with a degree of anisotropy n = E'h/E'v = 1. 5. The undrained and drained strengths were nearly isotropic. The effect of stress path on the undrained deformation behaviour was studied both under isotropic and anisotropic consolidation conditions. A series of multi-stage stress path tests on vertical and horizontal specimens was carried out [...] The testing technique followed was to subject the same specimen to three stages of consolidation and after each stage, the specimen was subjected to three or more different stress paths, simulating the-stress changes experienced by different soil elements around the tunnel excavation during tunnelling operation. It was found that the stress path followed has a significant effect on the deformation behaviour and the pore pressure response. The long term time-dependent deformation behaviour was studied under different states of stress including onedimensional, uniaxial, drained triaxial and undrained triaxial conditions. It was shown that the relationships between creep strains and log time are generally non-linear with only a limited range of linearity during the early periods of creep. The behaviour is characterised by limited strain instabilities and the absence of secondary and tertiary creep phases, i. e. creep being of primary nature only...|$|R
40|$|Soil-steel {{structures}} are flexible conduits made of corrugated metal sheets and {{buried in a}} well compacted granular media. Classical methods of design for conventional sized flexible buried conduits are simple and not suitable for long span structures, especially under relatively shallow cover. Herein, the live load effect cannot be considered secondary {{as in the case}} of conduits under deep cover. Also, field experience has shown that failure of the structure could be initiated by soil failure. The present codes avoid the problems associated with shallow cover by requiring a minimum depth of cover. This requirement is empirical and does not differentiate between the different shapes of conduits. A plane strain finite element analysis is developed and used to study long span soil-steel structures of different shapes under any depth of cover and loading condition with due consideration given to the soil state of stress. The structure wall is replaced by conventional beam elements. Soil is simulated by a combination of constant strain and linear strain compatible elements. Storage and time requirements for the numerical solution are kept to the lowest level without sacrificing the desired accuracy. Two-noded spring type interface elements are introduced between soil and culvert elements. Nonlinear stress-dependent hyperbolic relationships are used to model the soil and shear behaviour of interface elements. Construction procedure is simulated by automatically generating the finite element mesh layer by layer and by including the effect of compaction in the incremental analyses. Live load is applied concentrically or eccentrically, in increments. Initiation and propagation of soil failure are detected based on a curved <b>Mohr</b> <b>envelope,</b> and applying a stress transfer technique. A finite element program is developed on the basis of the foregoing analytical procedure to predict the state of stresses in the system due to dead and live loads, as well as the live load causing soil failure. The analytical results are compared with experimental results for live load tests conducted on existing long span soil-steel structures under shallow cover. The results of laboratory tests carried out until failure of soil are also compared with the analytically predicted values. Reasonable agreement is found in both cases. An analytical study establishes the parameters governing soil failure above the conduit. These parameters include the depth of cover, magnitude and position of loading, and the size and geometric shape of the conduit. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

We present results of a laboratory study designed to assess the significance of the phase offset between slope-normal and slope-parallel cyclic stresses on the generation of coseismic landslide displacements. Using a dynamic back-pressured shearbox that is capable of simulating variably-phased slope-normal and slope-parallel dynamic loads, we subjected sediment samples to a range of dynamic loading scenarios indicative of earthquake-induced ground shaking. We detail the variations in strain accumulation observed when slope-normal and slope-parallel stresses occur independently and simultaneously, {{both in and out of}} phase, using a range of dynamic stress amplitudes. Our results show that the instantaneous phasing of dynamic stresses is critical in determining the amount of coseismic landslide displacement, which may vary by up to an order of magnitude based solely on wave phasing effects. Instantaneous strain rate is an exponential function of the distance normal to the <b>Mohr</b> Coulomb failure <b>envelope</b> in plots of shear stress against normal effective stress. This distance is strongly controlled by the phase offset between dynamic normal and shear stresses. Our results demonstrate that conditions considered by conventional coseismic slope stability models can either over- or under-estimate earthquake-induced landslide displacement by up to an order of magnitude. This has important implications for accurate assessment of coseismic landslide hazard...|$|R
