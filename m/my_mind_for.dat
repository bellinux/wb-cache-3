500|$|In May 2006, a {{panel of}} {{researchers}} at the {{annual conference of the}} Mormon History Association blamed the tragedy on a failure of leadership. Lyndia Carter, a trails historian, said Franklin D. Richards [...] "was responsible, in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>for</b> the late departure" [...] because [...] "he started the snowball down the slope" [...] that eventually [...] "added up to disaster". Christy agreed that [...] "leadership from the top, from the outset, was seriously short of the mark." [...] Robert Briggs, an attorney, said [...] "It's almost a foregone conclusion... there is evidence of negligence. With leaders {{all the way up to}} Brigham Young, there was mismanagement." [...] On the other hand, Rebecca Bartholomew and Leonard J. Arrington wrote, [...] "Memories of what was perhaps the worst disaster in the history of western migration have been palliated by what could also be regarded as the most heroic rescue of the Mormon frontier." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{especially}} {{pleased with the}} emotional experience of playing the game, particularly with other players. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer {{described it as a}} [...] "non-denominational religious experience" [...] that, with the addition of another player, moves beyond metaphors and becomes a [...] "pilgrimage" [...] to the player. A reviewer writing for Edge magazine said the emotional arc of the game hits with [...] "occasionally startling power", while Patrick Shaw from Wired said the game made him feel a [...] "wide range of emotions... wonder, fear, even sadness". Miller said all three times he played the game, [...] "each time, without fail, individual moments... managed to give me goosebumps, and those moments have remained on <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> weeks afterward". Joel Gregory of PlayStation Official Magazine praised the game's story for being open to the player's interpretation, leaving an ambiguity that drew him in. The addition of an unnamed second player was described by Donlan as brilliant and as a [...] "master stroke", and Edge said it made for [...] "a more absorbing, more atmospheric experience".|$|E
500|$|In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, {{travelled}} {{to their}} Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, {{which had been}} published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he felt like he was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, [...] "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> many years." [...] He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he [...] "had to more or less graft {{the first half of the}} book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".|$|E

500|$|The Atlanta Braves' Marquis Grissom and slugger David Justice {{were part}} of a Braves roster that, heading into the 1997 season, was the MLB's highest-paid. Grissom ($4.8 million annual salary) and Justice ($6 million) were traded to the Indians in return for Lofton ($4.75 million) and Alan Embree ($206,000). [...] "This is a trade of {{enormous}} magnitude for two very, very good franchises. We're talking about franchise-type players", Hart said. For Lofton, considered [...] "the centerpiece of the Indians' 1990s revival", it was a return to the National League. [...] "The trade will be in the back of <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> a long time, but it's baseball. It happens to nearly everybody. I'm [...] to play every day. It's all Braves from now on", Lofton said. By April 19, the Braves were 133 and Lofton's hitting (.453 batting average) had won favor with his new Braves teammates. [...] "If he keeps hitting [...]400 he'll fit in just fine", said Chipper Jones. For the season Lofton's [...]333 batting average and 27 stolen bases were team-highs (his stolen base total was to that point a career-low). He was caught stealing 20 times, an MLB-high. Atlanta won the National League East division with a MLB-best 10161 record. The Braves swept the Houston Astros in the 1997 National League Division Series (NLDS), three games to none. In the 1997 National League Championship Series (NLCS), the Braves lost to the Florida Marlins, four games to two (the Marlins later defeated the Cleveland Indians in the World Series). For the NLCS, Lofton batted [...]185 and was one of three Braves' players who recorded seven strikeouts in the series. For Lofton, who was eligible for free agency {{at the end of the}} season, it was his only season spent with the Braves.|$|E
2500|$|Bolyai's son, JÃ¡nos Bolyai, {{discovered}} non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; {{his work}} was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: [...] "To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> the past thirty or thirty-five years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Everest was the {{television}} debut of A. R. Rahman, who composed {{the music for}} the telenovela. Rahman said at the launch that he used tracks created by students from his music college for the show. Rahman also said: [...] "Venturing into television was on <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> a couple of years. Ashutosh came to me with the concept which was so intriguing. It {{is a very good}} start for me." ...|$|E
