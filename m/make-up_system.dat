40|$|To {{enable a}} more {{realistic}} and accurate calculation of the radiological consequences of a steam generator tube rupture (SGTR), a fission product transport model was developed. As the radiological releases strongly depend on the thermal-hydraulic transient, the model {{was included in the}} RELAP 5 input decks of the Belgian Nuclear Power Plants. This enables the coupled calculation of the thermal-hydraulic transient and the radiological release. The fission product transport model tracks the concentration of the fission products in the primary circuit, in each of the SGs {{as well as in the}} condenser. This leads to a system of six coupled, first order ordinary differential equations with time dependent coefficients. Flashing, scrubbing, atomisation and dry out of the break how are accounted for. Coupling with the thermal-hydraulic calculation and correct modelling of the break position enables an accurate calculation of the mixture level above the break. Pre-and post-accident spiking in the primary circuit are introduced.

40|$|In the {{unlikely}} event of {{a nuclear power plant}} long duration station black-out, as in the Fukushima Daiichi (1 F) severe accident (SA), it was recognized that the suppression chamber (S/C) functions of heat sink and fission product (FP) scrubbing will degrade, resulting in the S/C pressure increase, reduction of the scrubbing efficiency and subsequent necessity of venting operations. Consequently, a relatively large amount of FPs, in particular highly volatile elements (e. g. CH 3 I), is likely to be dispersed into the environment. As a method to evaluate the degradation of the pool characteristics under discharge of steam and non-condensable gases through vent pipes and steam through different quencher geometries of <b>make-up</b> <b>systems,</b> an experimental campaign was recently started at the SIET research laboratory in Italy. Two different quencher geometries, representing vent pipes and the reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) exhaust pipes in 1 F 2 and 1 F 3, were adopted. Several combinations of steam and air mass flow rates were tested to scale down the main conditions occurred during the 1 F SA. Measurements of pool water temperature in different locations and visualization with high-speed camera represent the main outcome of the experimental activity. The preliminary results have demonstrated that a relatively small concentration of air in the steam flow is able to suppress the occurrence of chugging of the steam, with reduced mixing in the pool. Both RCIC quenchers adopted induced large chugging {{at the bottom of the}} pool which are effective to avoid temperature stratification, thanks to the large water recirculation and vertical mixing within the pool. At decreased subcooling, mixing in the pool ceases and the quenchers with holes disposed in the vertical direction, as in the RCIC exhaust pipe of the 1 F unit 3, introduce intense stratification that drastically reduces the condensation efficiency of the S/C pool. Quencher of 1 F 2 RCIC does not present stratification possibly dependent on the distance of the pipe outlet to the pool floor. Given the reduced size of the pool compared to the plant scale, the observed phenomena should not be extrapolated for the whole S/C. The objective of the ongoing experimental activity is to construct a database based on the high-speed filming, measurements of major quantities such as water temperature, steam pressure and FPs concentration to foster the development of physical models for both lumped parameter SA codes and detailed computational fluid dynamics software, in an effort to enhance the understanding of the complex phenomena following the 1 F accident...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Climatic Wind Tunnel (CWT) is a facility used by the motor industry to test vehicles under climatic extremes {{without the need for}} expensive overseas test programs. This work focuses on the application of computer simulation to the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) plant that makes up a CWT facility. The objective being to reduce its operational costs through the identification of energy saving operational strategies. When in operation the CWT has a peak power consumption of 3 MW. The implementation of any measures that would reduce this peak load would give rise to considerable savings in the operating costs of the facility. Computer simulation is an accepted technique for the study of systems operating under varying load conditions. Simulation allows rapid analysis of different strategies for operating plant and the effectiveness of achieving the desired effect without compromising the buildings performance. Models for the components of the CWT have been developed and coded in Neutral Model Format. These models have then been linked together in a modular simulation environment to give a model of the complete plant. The CWT plant naturally decomposesin to four major subsystems these being the test chamber, the soakroom, air <b>make-up</b> and refrigeration <b>system.</b> Models of all the primary and secondary HVAC plant are described as is how they constitute the systems that make up the CWT. Validation tests for individual components {{as well as for the}} systems have been carried out. To illustrate the potential of the application of computer simulation into finding improved modes of operation that would reduce the energy consumption of the facility, four studies have been carried out. The studies involve the possibility of scheduling the operation of condenser fans as a function of refrigeration load and outside ambient temperature, methods for the pre-test conditioning of a vehicle, a reduction in the secondary refrigerant flow temperature and an increase in the thickness of the insulated panels from which the facility is constructed. The studies carried out showed that there was potential for moderate energy savings to be made in the operation of the facility and that extended simulation runs would allow for the in-depth assessment of a large range of possible modes of plant operation in order to identify the areas where the greatest savings are possible...|$|R

Through the efforts of many of the world's finest engineers and scientists the world is now realizing the benefits of an environmentally friendly approach to manufacturing. These benefits, which include more efficient process operation, less waste generation and reduced emissions, have produced the unforeseen benefit of reduced production costs and higher quality products. Process dryers and ovens are used in the manufacture {{of a wide variety of}} products produced by the companies represented at the Industrial Energy Technology Conference. This equipment is installed and operating in facilities that produce printed materials, packaging materials, adhesive tapes, pharmaceutical diagnostic materials, coated papers & films, foil laminations, electronic media, and photographic & x-ray films. They are also used extensively in the food industry. The products manufactured include baked goods, cereals, pet food, tobacco, and many other products. Ovens are used to bake and cure surface coated materials. Such as building siding, window frames, window blinds, automotive parts, wood products, and miscellaneous metal parts. More stringent environmental regulations are also impacting the design and operation of coating and food processes. Today air pollution control devices are used on many of the above applications to control the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC's) and odors. As emission limits have decreased, the use of permanent total enclosures PTE's are becoming a standard part of the process line design. These enclosures are used to obtain 100 % capture of the solvents used in the process. In addition, concerns over solvent concentrations in ovens along with concerns over exposure limits to employees have combined to drive process exhaust flows ever higher. Increasing process exhaust flows has been the common approach to addressing process and environmental issues. This increase in exhaust flows has resulted in significant increases in energy use and operating costs...|$|R
