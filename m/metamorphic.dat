5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older rocks are {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these <b>metamorphic</b> rocks include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. <b>Metamorphic</b> rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the <b>metamorphic</b> rocks were intruded by igneous granitic rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker <b>metamorphic</b> gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma intrusions of diabase rocks 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and pegmatite intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss. Precambrian rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits, as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits.|$|E
5|$|A major {{geological}} {{structure in}} the region is the Northern Patagonian Batholith. This structure, formed by plutonic rocks including granodiorite and tonalite, is crossed north-south by the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone and surrounded by <b>metamorphic</b> rocks west and volcanic rocks east of the batholith.|$|E
5|$|Argon-39, with a {{half-life}} of 269 years, {{has been}} used for a number of applications, primarily ice core and ground water dating. Also, potassium–argon dating and related argon-argon dating is used to date sedimentary, <b>metamorphic,</b> and igneous rocks.|$|E
50|$|The Pooranoo <b>Metamorphics</b> were {{deposited}} {{at the end}} of the Capricorn Orogeny. The maximum depositional age of the Pooranoo <b>Metamorphics</b> is contrained by detrital zircon {{dates of}} 1680 +/- 14 Ma derived from arenaceous metasediments.|$|R
50|$|Rocks in {{the area}} {{range in age from}} Pre-Cambrian (probable) igneous and <b>metamorphics</b> to Pre-Cretaceous <b>metamorphics.</b> The Vincent Thrust Fault, the oldest major fault in the range, dating to the Mesozoic, passes through the area.|$|R
50|$|The Geology of Idaho is complex, with outcroppings {{of differing}} ages of volcanics, {{undifferentiated}} <b>metamorphics</b> and sedimentary structures.|$|R
5|$|Garnet {{is another}} mineral that {{contains}} appreciable amounts of hafnium {{to act as}} a geochronometer. The high and variable Lu/Hf ratios found in garnet make it useful for dating <b>metamorphic</b> events.|$|E
5|$|The Saw Mill's basin {{is part of}} the Manhattan Hills in the New England Uplands physiographic region. It is {{primarily}} underlain by <b>metamorphic</b> rock such as gneiss, schist and marble. They can be seen in some bedrock outcrops in and around the river.|$|E
5|$|Basement rock {{under the}} Mono–Inyo chain {{consists}} of the same granitic and <b>metamorphic</b> rock {{that make up the}} Sierra Nevada. Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3.5 million to less than 760,000 years old. Volcanism occurred north of the chain, in the Bodie Hills, as far back as 28 million years. Nearly all the rock east of the Sierra Nevada in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin.|$|E

5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks {{are part of the}} Franciscan Assemblage, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of <b>metamorphic</b> rocks such as greenstone. For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of the}} creek, schist and other <b>metamorphic</b> rocks {{can be found}}, while sedimentary rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|Fueguino lies on a {{peninsula}} on {{the southeastern}} side of Cook Island, Tierra del Fuego, {{but it also}} extends to Londonderry Island. The main Tierra del Fuego island lies northeast of Fueguino. This area of southern Tierra del Fuego {{is part of the}} Fuegian Andes, which are formed by various intrusive, effusive and <b>metamorphic</b> forms on the Scotia Plate.|$|E
5|$|Labrador is the easternmost {{part of the}} Canadian Shield, a vast area {{of ancient}} <b>metamorphic</b> rock {{comprising}} much of northeastern North America. Colliding tectonic plates have shaped much of the geology of Newfoundland. Gros Morne National Park has a reputation of being an outstanding example of tectonics at work, and as such has been designated a World Heritage Site. The Long Range Mountains on Newfoundland's west coast are the northeasternmost extension of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E

5|$|Many {{varieties}} of Precambrian bedrock are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, {{as well as}} <b>metamorphic</b> rocks derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Greenstone of the Superior craton located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7billion years old. Igneous rocks of the Duluth Complex comprise the bedrock of the eastern Boundary Waters. Ancient microfossils {{have been found in}} the banded iron formations of the Gunflint Chert.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains {{contains}} low-to-high-grade <b>metamorphic</b> rocks. Many of {{the rocks}} of the Blue Ridge {{appear to be the}} metamorphosed equivalents of Proterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks.

5|$|The Precambrian gneiss and schist {{that make}} up the {{majority}} of the steep walls of the Black Canyon formed 1.7 billion years ago during a <b>metamorphic</b> period brought on by the collision of ancient volcanic island arcs with the southern end of what is present-day Wyoming. The lighter-colored pegmatite dikes that can be seen crosscutting the basement rocks formed later during this same period.|$|E
30|$|This area {{lies in the}} {{semi-arid}} {{region of}} Andhra Pradesh and is susceptible to various threats such as growing urban areas as well as developing agricultural areas. This area is underlain by variety of geological formations comprising from the oldest archaeans to recent alluvium. Hydrogeologically, these formations are classified as consolidated (hard), semi-consolidated (soft), and unconsolidated (soft) formations. The consolidated formations include mainly migmatized high grade <b>metamorphics</b> (essentially garnetiferous amphibolites and pelitic schist), low grade <b>metamorphics</b> (essentially amphibolites and pelitic schists) of Nellore schist belt, and granitic gneiss and Cuddapahs (quartzites and shales) of Pre-cambrian period.|$|R

5|$|The Trout Creek Mountains are {{composed}} mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, {{which was then}} beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land {{now known as the}} Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older <b>metamorphic</b> rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these <b>metamorphic</b> rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{underlying}} much of Manhattan is a {{mica schist}} known as Manhattan schist. It is a strong, competent <b>metamorphic</b> rock created when Pangaea formed. It {{is well suited}} for the foundations of tall buildings. In Central Park, outcrops of Manhattan Schist occur and Rat Rock is one rather large example.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} bedrock includes very ancient Archean gneiss, <b>metamorphic</b> beds {{interspersed with}} granite intrusions created during the Caledonian mountain building period (the Caledonian orogeny), commercially important coal, oil and iron bearing carboniferous deposits and {{the remains of}} substantial Paleogene volcanoes. During their formation, tectonic movements created climatic conditions ranging from polar to desert to tropical and a resultant diversity of fossil remains.|$|E
50|$|Gold {{deposits}} {{exist in}} the Mabein region within the 500 km2 Shante gold belt within the Mogok <b>metamorphics</b> north and north-east of Mandalay.

50|$|The Moogie <b>Metamorphics</b> {{consists}} of schist and gneiss, which represent deformed and metamorphosed sandstone, siltstone and shale, and carbonate rocks. This rock unit is known {{only from the}} Glenburgh Terrane. These rocks were first deformed during the 2005-1960 Ma Glenburgh Orogeny, when they were also intruded by granites of the Dalgaringa Supersuite.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{majority}} of Carpathian <b>metamorphics</b> protoliths have TDM model Sm/Nd ages between 1. 6 and 2. 0 Ga. This suggests an important episode of continental crust formation after the 2. 0 Ga. The Biharia lithogroup (Apuseni Mountains) and the Tulghes lithogroup (East Carpathians) furnished Zircon U/Pb ages from metagranitoids and acid metavolcanics, respective, around 500 Ma; {{this is a}} sign of existence of some Lower Proterozoic protoliths among Carpathian <b>metamorphics.</b> The bimodal intrusions which are piercing the volcano-sedimentary sequence of Paiuseni lithogroup in Highiş Massif (Apuseni Mountains) have given Permian ages on Zircon U/Pb data. The Paiuseni lithogroup probably represents the fill of a rift basin of the same age. The Arieseni, Muntele Mare and Vinta granitoid intrusions from Apuseni Mountains, with U/Pb ages between Lower Devonian and Permian, indicates some contractional and extensional processes, in connection with Variscan Orogeny...|$|R
5|$|The {{superficial}} rock of Orkney {{is almost}} entirely Old Red Sandstone, mostly of Middle Devonian age. As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the <b>metamorphic</b> rocks of the Moine series, as may {{be seen on the}} Mainland, where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, and again in the small island of Graemsay; they are represented by grey gneiss and granite.|$|E
5|$|These Precambrian igneous and <b>metamorphic</b> rocks {{underlie}} {{most of the}} state, and {{are exposed}} in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso. Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Bjorøy Tunnel, the geology of the area was thought to consist entirely of <b>metamorphic</b> basement rocks similar to those exposed on the surrounding islands. The Jurassic sediments encountered in the tunnel included breccia and conglomerate in contact with the underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments, some of which was quite unconsolidated. Spore and pollen samples gave an Oxfordian age (Late Jurassic) for the sequence. The sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by a fault zone, which later reactivated, disrupting the bedding and causing steep dips.|$|E
