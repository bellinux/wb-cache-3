In order to estimate the rate sensitivity of a material (tantalum), quasi-static and SPHB tests were performed at room temperature within the rate spectrum ranging from 5 × 10 − 4 s− 1 to 103 s− 1.

40|$|There {{are many}} studies of spatial memory in food-storing birds, but {{comparable}} studies in songbirds are rather rare. We have devised a Morris-maze analogue for zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Here {{we examined the}} discriminative behavior of zebra finches ( N = 10) in the maze analogue used inprevious experiments. The birds, when released from different positions into the aviary, had to choose one baited feeder from four feeders. When the birds had learned this task, their performance in trials with a <b>modified</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the feeders was tested. Removal of a non-baited feeder did not disturb discrimination performance, while displacement {{of the position of}} the baited feeder (so asto move it closer to other feeders) disturbed discrimination. These results suggest that the bird sidentified the baited feeder by absolute position in reference to extra-maze cues, and that the non baited feeders affected the discriminative behavior by acting as distractors...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Desalination and Water Treatment[© Bermudez-Contreras and Thomson]. The Clark pump reciprocating pressure intensifier is a well established mechanism for highly efficient brine stream energy recovery in small scale seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination systems. This paper describes operation of a modified Clark pump in which the roles of the two pairs of chambers are reversed and the general arrangement of the complete RO system is substantially altered. In particular, the low-pressure motorised pump that feeds into the standard Clark pump is replaced by a high-pressure motorised pump that sits in parallel with it. A conceptual comparison of the original and <b>modified</b> <b>arrangements</b> is presented, followed by a discussion of the practical modifications made to a standard Clark pump in order to test the concept. The initial tests were successful and results indicating specific energies in the range 3. 5 to 4. 5 kWh/m 3 are presented...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, RNA {{interference}} pathways have been employed as {{a useful tool for}} reverse genetics in trypanosomatids. Angomonas deanei is a non-pathogenic trypanosomatid that maintains an obligatory endosymbiosis with a bacterium related to the Alcaligenaceae family. Studies of this symbiosis can help us to understand the origin of eukaryotic organelles. The recent elucidation of both the A. deanei and the bacterium symbiont genomes revealed that the host protozoan codes for the enzymes necessary for RNAi activity in trypanosomatids. Here we tested the functionality of the RNAi machinery by transfecting cells with dsRNA to a reporter gene (green fluorescent protein), which had been previously expressed in the parasite and to α-tubulin, an endogenous gene. In both cases, protein expression was reduced by the presence of specific dsRNA, inducing, respectively, a decreased GFP fluorescence and the formation of enlarged cells with <b>modified</b> <b>arrangement</b> of subpellicular microtubules. Furthermore, symbiont division was impaired. These results indicate that the RNAi system is active in A. deanei and can be used to further explore gene function in symbiont-containing trypanosoma tids and to clarify important aspects of symbiosis and cell evolution.

40|$|Among {{specific}} amyloid ligands, Congo red and its analogues {{are often}} considered potential therapeutic compounds. However, {{the results of}} the studies so far have not been univocal because the properties of this dye, derived mostly from its supramolecular nature, are still poorly understood. The supramolecular structure of Congo red, formed by π–π stacking of dye molecules, is susceptible to the influence of the electric field, which may significantly facilitate electron delocalization. Consequently, the electric field may generate altered physico-chemical properties of the dye. Enhanced electron delocalization, induced by the electric field, alters the total charge of Congo red, making the dye more acidic (negatively charged). This is a consequence of withdrawing electrons from polar substituents of aromatic rings—sulfonic and amino groups—thus increasing their tendency to dissociate protons. The electric field-induced charge alteration observed in electrophoresis depends on dye concentration. This concentration-dependent charge alteration effect disappears when the supramolecular structure disintegrates in DMSO. Dipoles formed from supramolecular fibrillar species in the electric field become ordered in the solution, introducing the <b>modified</b> <b>arrangement</b> to liquid crystalline phase. Experimental results and theoretical studies provide evidence confirming predictions that the supramolecular character of Congo red is the main reason for its specific properties and reactivity...|$|R
40|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{it can be}} {{said that}} the resistance to separation of mortar and concrete from reinforcing steel (or other materials) with which it is in contact is called bond strength. These days different kinds of concrete are manufactured, all with different properties. But bond strength is something which is essentially a well sort after quality for any RCC structure or element. Bond strength can be easily found out by standard pull-out test machine. But in this work, the bond strength was measured using Universal testing machine (UTM) with some <b>modified</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The bond between the concrete and steel reinforcement was investigated for two different kinds of concretes. Using reinforcing bars bond strengths were measured using Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) specimen and Normal Cement Concrete (NCC) specimen. Castings of SCC specimens were carried out without compaction, while the normal concrete specimens were casted with substantial compaction and vibration. The study revealed that SCC specimens generated higher bond to reinforcing bars in comparison with NCC specimens. Secondly, the correlation between bond strength and compressive strength of NCC is more consistent. Thirdly, the results obtained with UTM were compared with the results obtained with standard pull-out test machine and they were found in permissible limits...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Results {{are given}} of wind-tunnel tests of a nacelle-shaped body fitted with two lifting fans in tandem. Lift, drag and {{pitching}} moment were measured {{both with the}} fans installed with axes vertical and also in a <b>modified</b> <b>arrangement</b> with 15 deg rearward tilt. In the latter case, the effects of simple inlet and exit cascades were also examined. The effects of aerodynamic interaction between efflux and mainstream were almost as serious for this slab-sided nacelle as when the same fan was installed in a large wing. The adverse effect on lift was slightly reduced by rearward movement of the fan when only one fan was in use and the other duct sealed, but a greater improvement was obtained when the front fan was used and allowed to induce additional downflow through the open rear duct thus reducing {{the magnitude of the}} lower surface suctions. Five-tube yawmeter traverses in the two vertical fan ducts just above the fans showed much less flow maldistribution at forward speeds compared with the fan in wing because of the 1 -diameter length of duct between surface and traverse station. The decay of the cross flow with depth and the effect of variation of one fan rotational speed upon the flow in the other duct were also examined...|$|R
