40|$|Abstract. The {{need for}} {{systematic}} evaluation of process quality {{and of the}} resulting products {{has always been an}} issue of primary importance within the software engineering community. In the past few years many factors have determined changes in the software process scenario that inevitably impact on software quality. To this end, goal oriented measurement models, such as Goal Question Metrics (GQM), have become essential for assessing desired quality and for enacting software process improvement (SPI). Although the importance of measurement is a shared issue, many software organizations encounter difficulties and strive to define and adopt measurement plans successfully. Causes are most likely attributable to critical issues such as <b>measurement</b> <b>plan</b> dimensions, complexity, dependencies among goals. Often the industrial projects are characterized by GQM plans with numerous quality factors and, consequently, numerous goals. This makes both measurement and interpretation procedures quite onerous. Furthermore, managing a <b>measurement</b> <b>plan</b> turns out to be quite costly and requires numerous investments. To this end, this work proposes a GQM-based approach (Multiview Framework) that provides support in designing a structured <b>measurement</b> <b>plan</b> in order to overcome the common problems mentioned previously, and manage large industrial measurement plans. The proposed approach has been validated through a post mortem analysis, consisting in a legacy data study, carried out on industrial project data. ...|$|E

The dimensional <b>measurement</b> <b>planning</b> operation is carried out to define how the measurements {{are going to be}} collected and it has to consider the reliability, uncertainty and economics of the measurement procedure. The thesis work has been performed to map the current knowledge regarding measurement strategies and principles and to develop recommendations regarding a framework which defines how the <b>measurement</b> <b>planning</b> work should be carried out. The purpose of the work was thereby to perform a state-of-the-art study to map the available theoretical and empirical measurement strategies and principles. The purpose was also to test the impact of the strategies in a measurement experiment in order to validate the methodology. To fulfil the purpose of the work, a literature review and a case study was initially performed. The literature review investigated the available academically knowledge and the requirements defined in international standards regarding the <b>measurement</b> <b>planning</b> work. The case study mapped the methodologies and principles which were used in industry through contextual research and qualitative interviewing. The majority of the case study was carried out at Saab Aeronautics but to obtain a wider understanding of the topic a survey were also conducted where additional manufacturing companies were participating. The outcome of the case study and the literature review were thereafter merged and further analysed though the measurement analysis. The case study and the literature review shown that there existed several different methodologies and guidelines regarding how the work should be and was performed. Some of the factors which were further investigated were the impact of the number of measurement points, distance between the measurement points, uncertainty of the strategy and the considerations connected to the selection of the geometrical features. The measurement analysis provided insights regarding the impact on average, minimum-, maximum deviation and the variance due to the amount and distribution of the inspection points. The findings were presented as a resulting outcome of the recommended measurement strategy framework methodology. The methodology of analysing the impact of the measurement strategy was therefore implemented into the recommendations regarding the <b>measurement</b> <b>planning</b> framework. The purpose of the framework is to offer a reliable, standardized and traceable <b>measurement</b> <b>planning</b> process where knowledge sharing and continuous improvements are possible to implement. In addition to the analysis of the <b>measurement</b> <b>planning</b> strategy the most important findings to consider in the adjacent process steps were investigated and presented. These findings are presented to enable a broad understanding of the requirements throughout the measurement process at Saab Aeronautics. The knowledge obtained in the literature review, case study and the measurement experiment was included in the measurement strategy framework which was the delivery of the thesis work...|$|R

The performance <b>measurement</b> <b>planning</b> is made based on the company's vision, mission and strategy which are divided into four perspectives. The process planning is formed as a development of the company's balanced scorecard using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The data used for this planning were derived from a number of sources, they are internal data in the company (financial data, customers' data, internal business process data and employees' data) and the data obtained from the respondents (in this case, customers and employees).
