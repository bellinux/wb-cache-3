In August 2013, the fifth prototype was dispatched to the UK, so that AgustaWestland's UK branch could begin work on certifying the type for SAR operations.

40|$|This paper reviews {{technologies}} in extravehicular activity and space robotics that are applicable to routine operational use {{in conjunction with}} the Orion crew exploration vehicle, and proposes several possible approaches to enable complex orbital operations on dedicated Orion missions. Preliminary designs and performance assessments are presented for a <b>mission</b> <b>kit</b> to enable Orion servicing. This design includes an external airlock with EVA suits for two crew members, robotics for grappling the target spacecraft and for dexterous servicing support for the EVA crew, and accommodations for orbital replacement units and other supplies needed for servicing. As an example, details are presented for how this unit would be used to allow Orion to perform all activities currently planned for the upcoming SM- 4 shuttle servicing mission for Hubble Space Telescope. Performance estimates for dexterous robotic-enhanced EVA are drawn from both analytical and experimental research in EVA/robotic collaboration at the University of Maryland Space Systems Laboratory. The paper discusses the “Achilles ’ heel ” of the concept: the limited payload capacity of the Ares I launch vehicle. Solutions examined include a lightweight servicing system capable of being carried between Orion and the launch vehicle in a manner analogous to the lunar module placement in the Saturn V. Alternatively, for missions with higher logistics requirements for servicing or assembly, the entire servicing package could be launched on a lower-cost expendable launch vehicle, and Orion would be the active partner in rendezvous and docking to both the servicing package and the target spacecraft...|$|E

40|$|The routine {{delivery}} of large payloads to {{low earth orbit}} has become a reality with the Space Transportation System (STS). However, once earth orbit has been achieved, orbit transfer operations represent an inefficient use of the Space Shuttle. The Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) will add a new and needed dimension to STS capabilities. Utilized in a reusable manner, the OMV is needed to deliver and retrieve satellites to and from orbital altitudes or inclinations beyond the practical limits of the Space Shuttle and to support basic Space Station activities. The initial OMV must also be designed to permit the addition of future <b>mission</b> <b>kits</b> to support the servicing, module changeout, or refueling of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), and the retrieval and deorbit of space debris.

2500|$|An MQ-9 can adopt various <b>mission</b> <b>kits</b> and {{combinations}} {{of weapons and}} sensors payloads to meet combat requirements. Its Raytheon AN/AAS-52 multi-spectral targeting sensor suite includes a color/monochrome daylight TV, infrared, and image-intensified TV with laser rangefinder/laser designator to designate targets for laser guided munitions. The aircraft is also equipped with the Lynx Multi-mode Radar that contains synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that can operate in both spotlight and strip modes, and ground moving target indication (GMTI) with Dismount Moving Target Indicator (DMTI) and Maritime Wide-Area Search (MWAS) capabilities.

40|$|Many Spacelab {{payloads}} could significantly {{benefit from}} {{an extension of the}} duration of sortie missions beyond the nominal seven days. However, longer sortie missions require the addition of Shuttle or Spacelab <b>mission</b> extension <b>kits,</b> which results in a significant reduction in allowable scientific payload weight. An analysis of extended-duration sortie missions was performed. Payload requirements and detailed descriptions of Shuttle and Spacelab baselines were the primary inputs to the analysis. Payload benefits from extended-duration missions were established by surveying payload requirements and interviewing discipline specialists. The net weight available to Spacelab payloads as a function of mission length was derived. The impacts on Shuttle and Spacelab to provide extended-duration mission support and the corresponding impacts on payloads were established. Several alternatives to baseline systems and operations were studied as possibilities to increase available payload weight...|$|R

40|$|The Integrated Medical Model (IMM) is a {{probabilistic}} model that uses simulation to predict mission medical risk. Given a specific mission and crew scenario, medical events are simulated using Monte Carlo methodology to provide estimates of resource utilization, probability of evacuation, probability {{of loss of}} crew, {{and the amount of}} mission time lost due to illness. Mission and crew scenarios are defined by mission length, extravehicular activity (EVA) schedule, and crew characteristics including: sex, coronary artery calcium score, contacts, dental crowns, history of abdominal surgery, and EVA eligibility. The Integrated Medical Evidence Database (iMED) houses the model inputs for one hundred medical conditions using in-flight, analog, and terrestrial medical data. Inputs include incidence, event durations, resource utilization, and crew functional impairment. Severity of conditions is addressed by defining statistical distributions on the dichotomized best and worst-case scenarios for each condition. The outcome distributions for conditions are bounded by the treatment extremes of the fully treated scenario in which all required resources are available and the untreated scenario in which no required resources are available. Upon occurrence of a simulated medical event, treatment availability is assessed, and outcomes are generated depending on the status of the affected crewmember at the time of onset, including any pre-existing functional impairments or ongoing treatment of concurrent conditions. The main IMM outcomes, including probability of evacuation and loss of crew life, time lost due to medical events, and resource utilization, are useful in informing mission planning decisions. To date, the IMM has been used to assess mission-specific risks with and without certain crewmember characteristics, to determine the impact of eliminating certain resources from the <b>mission</b> medical <b>kit,</b> and to design medical kits that maximally benefit crew health while meeting mass and volume constraints...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND In {{the last}} decades, {{there have been}} several natural {{disasters}} and global catastrophies with a steady increase in humanitarian relief work. This has resulted in increased research in the field of humanitarian aid, however the focus is mostly on the victims of the disasters and not on the individuals and organisations providing aid. OBJECTIVES The intent of this research is to review the information available on pre-deployment interventions and recommendations such as vaccinations and other health preserving measures in volunteers and professionals deploying abroad in humanitarian relief missions. METHODS We performed a systematic literature review of papers written in English, French, Italian or German. We searched the following databases: Cochrane, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and also hand searched reference lists. The cut-off date for the publication search was November 20 th, 2014. In addition to the literature search we also sent a questionnaire to 30 organisations to detail their approach to preparing relief workers. RESULTS We identified 163 papers of possible relevance and finally included 35 papers in the systematic review. Six organisations provided information on pre-deployment preparation of aid workers. Identified papers show that pre-deployment physical and mental fitness are paramount for success in humanitarian missions. However, in many settings, pre-travel medical and psychological assessments and/or training/education sessions are not mandatory. We identified high-risk hazards for aid workers (often location specific), these included: travellers׳ diarrhoea, vector-borne infections, accidents, violence, tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis A, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, seasonal and H 1 N 1 influenza. CONCLUSIONS The medical evaluation can identify problems or risk factors, such as psychological frailty, that can be exacerbated by the stressful settings of humanitarian missions. In this pre-travel setting, the status of routine vaccinations can be controlled and completed, medication dispensed and targeted preventive advice provided. A <b>mission</b> specific first-aid <b>kit</b> can be recommended. There is a lack of evidence-based literature on the theme of pre-travel advice guidelines for humanitarian workers. We propose a shared database of literature on this topic as a resource and suggest that some standardization of guidelines would be useful for future planning...|$|R
