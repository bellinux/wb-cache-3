5|$|Although the United States {{remained}} officially neutral until April 1917, it {{was increasingly}} throwing its {{support to the}} Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Interior <b>Ministry</b> <b>official</b> Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer. Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess phenol. Much of the phenol {{would go to the}} German-owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden's American subsidiary; Heyden was the supplier of Bayer's salicylic acid for aspirin manufacture. By July 1915, Edison's plants were selling about three tons of phenol per day to Schweitzer; Heyden's salicylic acid production was soon back on line, and in turn Bayer's aspirin plant was running as well.|$|E

5|$|Almost 90% {{of ethnic}} Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents of Cambodia, {{and do not}} carry citizenship papers such as identity cards or birth certificates. The 1996 Cambodian law on nationality technically permits Vietnamese residents born in Cambodia to take up citizenship, but faced resistance from mid-ranking interior <b>ministry</b> <b>officials</b> who generally refrain from registering Vietnamese residents due to concerns of political implications from opposition parties if citizenship were to be granted. A minority of Vietnamese residents were able to obtain citizenship only after paying bribes to interior <b>ministry</b> <b>officials,</b> or were married to Khmer spouses. The minority of Vietnamese residents who hold citizenship reported of interior <b>ministry</b> <b>officials</b> confiscating their citizenship papers. As a result, the Vietnamese faced legal restrictions from getting access to public healthcare, education, employment and buying land for housing as the majority do not carry Cambodian citizenship. Stateless Vietnamese built floating settlements in-lieu of buying land-based dwellings which require citizenship papers. According to field research carried out by Cambodia's Minority Rights Organisation, interior <b>ministry</b> <b>officials</b> would confront Vietnamese fishermen in the Tonle Sap and demand bribes {{in order to allow}} them to carry out fishing.|$|R

500|$|At around 19:00, Georgian President Saakashvili {{announced}} a unilateral ceasefire and no-response order. The ceasefire reportedly held {{for about three}} hours. The separatists shelled Tamarasheni and Prisi after Saakashvili's ceasefire.

According to the Long War Journal, Al Qaeda's senior leadership including Ayman al Zawahiri and Osama Bin Laden were thought to shelter in the region (Bin Laden was then in Pakistan). Taliban spokesman stated [...] "The fighting in Afghanistan is getting heavier. When the Americans drop bombs on civilians, ordinary people want revenge – that's why they are joining the Taliban, strengthening us" [...] pointing out their [...] "ability to enter the bases and kill Americans."
