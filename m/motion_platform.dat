5|$|The ride {{vehicles}} are themed {{to look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a <b>motion</b> <b>platform</b> atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|E
2500|$|This ride {{system was}} invented {{specially}} for the Indiana Jones Adventure, and {{has only been}} implemented in one other attraction: Dinosaur, located at Disney's Animal Kingdom (opened as CTX: Countdown to Extinction). However, the Japanese counterpart uses linear-inductive actuators instead of three hydraulic rams. The 35 gallons of hydraulic fluid used on the Disneyland version takes two hours {{to clean up the}} track when a hose splits, in which if there is hydraulic failure, the vehicle is incapable of driving. Because of Japan's environmental codes regarding oil spills, the design team elected to substitute electromagnetic actuators on the ride vehicle. [...] Three of these actuators are used to create a three-dimensional (pitch, roll, and elevation) <b>motion</b> <b>platform</b> chassis on which the car body sits.|$|E

Most of these systems were developed mainly by flight simulation enthusiasts, were sold as do it yourself projects, and could be assembled in the home from common components for around one thousand US dollars ($1,000). [...] Recently, there has been increased market interest in <b>motion</b> <b>platforms</b> for more personal, in-home, use.

Today one can find high-end, multiple-occupant motion platforms in use with entertainment applications in theme parks throughout the world.

As a result of the force required to move the weight of these larger simulator systems and one or more occupants, the <b>motion</b> <b>platform</b> must be controlled by powerful and expensive hydraulic or electromagnetic cylinders. The cost of this type of <b>motion</b> <b>platform</b> exceeds US$100,000, and often goes well into the millions of dollars for the multi-occupant systems found at major theme park attractions.

40|$|Research {{conducted}} using the Vertical Motion Simulator at the NASA Ames Research Center examined {{the contributions of}} <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> and visual level-of-detail (LOD) cueing to tasks that required altitude and/or yaw control in a simulated AH- 64 Apache helicopter. Within the altitude control tasks the LOD manipulation caused optical density to change across altitudes by a small, moderate, or large amount; while <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> was either present or absent. The results from these tasks showed that both constant optical density and <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> improved altitude awareness in an altitude repositioning task, while the presence of <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> also led to improved performance in a vertical rate control task. The yaw control tasks had pilots'sit 4. 5 ft {{in front of the}} center of rotation, thus subjecting them to both rotational and lateral motions during a yaw. The pilots were required to regulate their yaw, while the <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> was manipulated in order to present all combinations of the resulting rotational and lateral motion components. Ratings of simulation fidelity and sensed <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> showed that the pilots were relatively insensitive to the rotational component, but highly aware of the lateral component. Together these findings show that: 1) <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> cues are important when speed regulation is required during altitude change; 2) <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> contributes to the perception of movement amplitude; 3) lateral, but not rotational, motion cues are essential to the perception of vehicle yaw; and 4) LOD management yielding constant optical density across altitudes improves altitude awareness...|$|R

50|$|The Link family firm in Binghamton {{manufactured}} player pianos and organs, and Ed Link {{was therefore}} familiar with such components as leather bellows and reed switches.

His design had a pneumatic <b>motion</b> <b>platform</b> driven by inflatable bellows which provided pitch and roll cues. A vacuum motor similar to those used in player pianos rotated the platform, providing yaw cues. A generic replica cockpit with working instruments was mounted on the <b>motion</b> <b>platform.</b> When the cockpit was covered, pilots could practice flying by instruments in a safe environment.

40|$|M. Ing. A two-axis gimbal {{system in}} the form of a pitch-roll gimbal and a <b>motion</b> {{simulating}} <b>platform</b> were developed to extend the capability of an existing ground-to-air prototype gun-turret. The objective was to stabilize the line of sight (LOS) of the gimbal system despite disturbances introduced by the <b>motion</b> simulating <b>platform</b> in real time. The main sensor used for the stabilization is a two-axis accelerometer which was mounted directly on the inner gimbal (roll gimbal) to form a direct-mass stabilization architecture. The stabilization control algorithm was designed and executed in the Labview® environment on a PC, and the accelerometer data is used to drive the two DC motors used as the actuators of this control system. The design of the <b>motion</b> simulating <b>platform</b> was based on a simplified Stewart-Platform and uses pneumatic cylinders as actuating limbs. All sensors and actuators in the <b>motion</b> simulating <b>platform</b> and the gimbal system are integrated with the National Instrument’s CompactRio® and Labview®. The result was a simple stabilization controller capable of achieving basic stabilization of the LOS. However, the hardware and software of this project are capable of more complex control algorithms and that forms the bulk of the suggestions for further studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{locomotion}} in virtual environments is a diverse and rewarding research area. Yet, creating effective and intuitive locomotion techniques is challenging, especially when users cannot move around freely. While using handheld input devices for navigation may often be good enough, {{it does not}} match our natural experience of motion in the real world. Frequently, there are strong arguments for supporting body-centered self-motion cues as they may improve orientation and spatial judgments, and reduce motion sickness. Yet, how these cues can be introduced while the user is not moving around physically is not well understood. Actuated solutions such as <b>motion</b> <b>platforms</b> can be an option, but they are expensive and difficult to maintain. Alternatively, within this article {{we focus on the}} effect of upper-body tilt while users are seated, as previous work has indicated positive effects on self-motion perception. We report on two studies that investigated the effects of static and dynamic upper body leaning on perceived distances traveled and self-motion perception (vection). Static leaning (i. e., keeping a constant forward torso inclination) had a positive effect on self-motion, while dynamic torso leaning showed mixed results. We discuss these results and identify further steps necessary to design improved embodied locomotion control techniques that do not require actuated <b>motion</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R

Image degradation caused by <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> blur is a common problem for space based imagers. <b>Platform</b> <b>motion</b> blur is accentuated by long exposure times, large object distances, or rapid motion [1] and in many applications it is dominant over object <b>motion</b> blur. <b>Platform</b> <b>motion</b> blur varies across the image field in a structured fashion, characterized by translation and rotation; therefore, it can be modeled using an affine transform. Image deconvolution with a point spread function (PSF) estimate is used to deblur images degraded by spatially variant (SV) motion blur [2]. Limitations in this process can be reduced by measuring the PSF during image acquisition using additional hardware. A low spatial resolution, high temporal resolution video camera {{can be used to}} estimate a PSF [3], however, this increases size, weight, power and processing costs. One approach is to measure camera motion using accelerometers unfortunately the resolution of the measurements do not scale with the focal length of the lens [4]. The structured nature of <b>platform</b> <b>motion</b> blur makes it sufficient to detect motion from the image itself at a few locations in orde...|$|R
