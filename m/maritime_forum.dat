Östersjön är ett stort handelsområde där striktare krav från SECA träder i kraft den 1 januari 2015. Fartyg med LNG-drift diskuteras flitigt som ett alternativt bränsle inom den svenska sjöfartsnärningen, då utsläppen av NOx, svavel och partiklar är mindre än tjockoljan (HFO). Ett av problemen med LNG i Sverige är att det i dagsläget inte finns ett tillräckligt utvecklat infrastrukturnät för flytande naturgas. I denna rapport har vi med hjälp av kvalitativa intervjuer kartlagt svenska aktörer inom LNGs infrastrukturutveckling och vad det är som hämmar utvecklingen. Vår analys av intervjuerna visade att utvecklingen bromsades av att ingen vågat ta första steget. Hamnarna vill inte bygga terminaler om det inte finns en marknad för {{distribution}} och rederierna vill inte bygga fartyg om det inte finns tillgänglighet av LNG. Det har också framkommit att intresset från den svenska staten har varit mycket svagt, näst intill obefintligt.

Shipping companies {{have started to}} look for alternative fuel to achieve better environmental outcome. The Baltic Sea today is a major trading area for shipping. On 1 of January 2015 {{a new set of}} brand new and stricter regulation is getting implemented and these regulations are called SECA. Vessel running on LNG as an alternative fuel is today discussed extensively within the Swedish <b>Maritime</b> <b>forum</b> where emissions of NOx, sulfur and particles are less recipients than in heavy fuel oil (HFO). One of todays problems with a LNG distribution in Sweden are that the infrastructure is incomplete and outdated. This report has been built upon qualitative interviews with important actors within the Swedish <b>maritime</b> <b>forum</b> and also what impedes the development of the LNG’s infrastructure. The outcome of the interviews showed that the development has been slowed down because none within the Swedish martime forum have dared to take the first step. The ports does not want to develop terminals when there is no market demand and the shipping companies does not want to build vessel that runs on LNG when there is no market for distribution. Swedish governments involvement has been very weak, almost non-existing. There are also gaps in the Swedish regulations and restrictions of LNG cargo handling. This is aslo one of the factors that the development of LNG has been impeded. ...|$|E

It also could symbolise a {{grouping}} of maritime partners {{on the southern}} edge of South-east Asia: Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore. MANIS regional <b>maritime</b> cooperation <b>forum,</b> could address a vast range of concerns for the member countries such as illegal fisheries, natural resources, smuggling and transnational crime. In this paper, Dr John Blaxland of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, draws on his decades of experience working in and across Southeast Asia to argue for a new forum that can help overcome some of the region’s short and long term challenges. This paper explores the range of existing regional forums in Southeast Asia, and shows why MANIS is both different and necessary. It looks at how each of the countries might view such a forum, and shows why there are benefits to each. This paper has also been translated into Bahasa Indonesia.

[...] 1 pageThe organisers of the Barcelona World Race (BWR), the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC) and the <b>Maritime</b> Catalan <b>Forum</b> (FMC) {{agreed on}} equiping the FMC boat, {{participating}} in the race, with a SeaBird MiniCTD. The idea was {{for the first time}} to explore how such oceanic races could help to monitor surface temperature and salinity all around the world ocean in real time. The boat spent 112 days to complete the rond trip, sending 12 - 30 real-time samples/day via ARGOS satellites, using a transmitter developed at the ICM. Data was also stored in the instrument, at 192 samples/day to allow further final global analyses. In the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite mission processing chain, sea surface salinity (SSS) values are retrieved from brightness temperature data at level 2 (L 2). Global maps of SSS are being generated at level 3 (L 3) using spatial and temporal weighted averages. Finally, improved representations of the SSS field are obtained at level 4 (L 4) where satellite data is blended with data from other sensors. In the present study, validation of L 2, L 3 and L 4 products using data from BWR and ARGO buoys is presented, covering the race period from January to April 2011. Differences between these two sets of data are also investigated as the uppermost robust measurements from Argo profilers have larger depths than the ones associated to the BWR boatPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} focuses {{attention on}} safety challenges within the Norwegian shipping industry. A status {{picture of the}} shipboard safety culture and the interrelationships with safety management and organizational factors is given. Three research questions are explored: (1) What characterizes safety culture and safety management within the shipping industry? (2) What {{is the relationship between}} safety culture and safety performance within the shipping industry? (3) What characterizes shipping companies’ application of the safety management concept? In order to explore these research questions, four aims were defined to guide this work: (1) to outline and discuss the application of safety culture and safety management within merchant shipping; (2) to outline and discuss relevant theories of safety culture and safety management and analyze the relationship between safety culture and safety management; (3) to support the use of a methodological framework for the assessment of safety culture in relation to safety management; and (4) to assess safety culture within merchant shipping and analyze the relationship with safety management and actual performance. The research questions are further examined and specified in six journal articles. The thesis is divided into two main parts. Part I includes the overall framework in relation to research aims. Part II presents the six journal articles. In part I, chapter 1, a general introduction and a status picture of risk, safety management, and safety culture within the shipping industry are presented, which gives reason for the research aims and questions introduced in the chapter. Chapter 2 outlines the safety responsibilities within the industry at the international, national, and company levels. Emphasis is placed on the vi International Safety Management (ISM) Code, which provides the minimum standards and guidelines for operational safety management. Chapter 3 provides theoretical clarification and framing with regard to safety culture and safety management. This chapter also introduces a general working model used in the studies of safety culture and safety management in this thesis. Chapter 4 presents the methodological approach. The thesis builds upon a mixed method approach where both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used. The main results are briefly summarized in Chapter 5, followed by a discussion in Chapter 6 and concluding remarks in Chapter 7. The concluding remarks concern study limitations, implications, and suggestions for future research. The thesis draws upon theory from both the socio-anthropological and organizational psychological directions. In accordance with the organizational psychological perspective, a survey was carried out. A safety culture questionnaire developed by Studio Apertura, a constituent centre of The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), in collaboration with the Norwegian DNV and the research institution SINTEF was used. In total, 1, 574 questionnaires were distributed to 83 tanker and bulk/dry cargo carriers, with 1, 262 being returned from 76 of the vessels. The vessels were initially randomly selected from the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association member list, but as participation was voluntary, some withdrawal occurred. Statistical analysis involves descriptive statistics, factor analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling. The statistical survey results were complemented by qualitative data obtained through document studies, case studies including two tanker companies and two bulk/dry cargo companies, vii interviews, participating observations and field studies at sea, and participation in other <b>maritime</b> <b>forums.</b> The study results indicate several deficiencies in all parts of a traditional safety management system defined as: (1) the reporting and collection of experience data from the vessel; (2) data processing, summarizing, and analysis; (3) the development of safety measures; and (4) implementation. The underreporting of experience data is found to be a problem, resulting in limitations related to the data-processing process. Regarding the development of safety measures, it is found that the industry emphasizes the development of standardized safety measures in the form of procedures and checklists. Organizational root causes related to company policies (e. g., crewing policy) is to a lesser degree identified and addressed. The most prominently identified organizational influential factors are the shipping companies crewing policy, which includes rotation systems, crew stability, and contract conditions, and shipboard management. The companies’ orientation toward local management, which includes leadership training, educational, and other managerial support, are also essential. The shore part of the organization is identified as the driving force for development and change in the shipboard safety culture. Thus, safety campaigns should to a larger degree include and be directed toward shore personnel...|$|R
