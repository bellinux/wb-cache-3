50|$|Biocidal {{products}} are often composed of mixtures {{of one or}} more active substances together with co-formulants such as stabilisers, preservatives and colouring agents. Since these substances may act together to produce a combination effect, an assessment of the risk from each of these substances alone may underestimate the real risk from the product as a whole. Several concepts are available for predicting the effect of a mixture on the basis of known toxicities and concentrations of the single components. Approaches for mixture toxicity assessments for regulatory purposes typically advocate assumptions of additive effects;. This means that each substance in the mixture is assumed to contribute to a <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> in direct proportion to its concentration and potency. In a strict sense, the assumption is thereby that all substances act by the same mode or mechanism of action. Compared to other available assumptions, this concentration addition model (or dose addition model) can be used with commonly available (eco)toxicity data and effect data together with estimates of e.g. LC50, EC50, PNEC, AEL. Furthermore, assumptions of additive effects from any given mixture are generally considered as a more precautionary approach compared to other available predictive concepts.|$|E
50|$|Humans and {{wildlife}} are rarely exposed to solitary contaminants, {{but rather to}} complex mixtures of potentially harmful compounds. Dioxins and DLCs are no exception. This {{is important to consider}} when assessing toxicity because the effects of chemicals in a mixture are often different from when acting alone. These differences can take place on the chemical level, where the properties of the compounds themselves change due to the interaction, creating a new dose at the target tissue and a quantitatively different effect. They may also act together (simple similar action) or independently on the organism at the receptor during uptake, when transported throughout the body, or during metabolism, to produce a joint effect. Joint effects are described as being additive (using dose, response/risk, or measured effect), synergistic, or antagonistic. A dose-additive response occurs when the <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> is determined by the sum of the component chemical doses, each weighted by its relative toxic potency. A risk-additive response occurs when the mixture response is the sum of component risks, based on the probability law of independent events. An effect-additive mixture response occurs when the combined effect of exposure a chemical mixture is equal to the sums of the separate component chemical effects, e.g., incremental changes in relative liver weight. Synergism occurs when the combined effect of chemicals together is greater than the additivity prediction based on their separate effects. Antagonism describes where the combined effect is less than the additive prediction. Clearly it is important to identify which kind of additivity is being used. These effects reflect the underlying modes of action and mechanisms of toxicity of the chemicals.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mixture</b> <b>effects</b> {{are well}} known {{problems}} but chemical legislations are typically based on single chemical toxicity, which is unfortunate as chemicals occur as mixtures in the environment. There are mathematical models to assess additive <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> {{that are based on}} linear <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> such as toxicodynamic interactions. Chemicals with same or different mode-of-actions can also interfere with each other’s elimination pathways that can result in toxicokinetic interactions and cause indirect <b>mixture</b> <b>effects.</b> Therefore, chemicals that inhibit CYP enzymes in the elimination pathways of different classes of environmental pollutants can cause non-linear <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> that are more-than-additive. More-than-additive <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> have been observed between azoles and other classes of environmental pollutants such as estrogenic chemicals and aromatic hydrocarbons, as a result of toxicokinetic interactions via CYP 1 A/CYP 3 A inhibitions. There is need for new mathematical models to assess non-linear <b>mixture</b> <b>effects.</b> We have initiated the development of alternative mathematical tools to forecast non-linear <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> that are based on toxicokinetic interactions from earlier lab-studies in fish and fish cells. Time-dynamic is a key factor in toxicokinetic interactions and therefore we will combine multiple differential equations in the models. These equations describe how one chemical’s concentration changes over time in relationship to changes of another chemical’s concentration over time and how that affect biomarker responses such as CYP 1 A and vitellogenin. We will use statistical tools to quantitatively fit the suggested models with data from lab-studies. Non-linear models can be used to describe synergistic <b>mixture</b> <b>effects.</b> Those could be bottom-up-models, where we start from the different chemicals involved, or they could be top-down-models, where we fit a multi-dimension function to a given dataset using an auxiliary non-linear model.

As a first step, the project examines how the current European (EU) pesticide legislation and the consequent ecological risk assessment applied in the Nordic approval-zone relate to <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> of <b>mixtures</b> where co-formulants is a part. It is concluded that the ecological risk assessment performed during the approval of pesticide formulations in accordance to the relevant legislation, to a wide extent does {{take into account the}} contribution of co-formulants to the toxicity of pesticide formulations. Requirements of ecotoxicological examination of mandatory tank mixes (i. e. mixtures of pesticides formulations or the addition of pesticide adjuvants, according to the label required for optimum effect) are also included in the legislation. However, there are no test requirements for mixtures of pesticide formulations applied to the field, solely {{in order to reduce the}} number of applications (i. e. non-mandatory tank mixtures), or to mixtures of pesticide formulations generated by sequential field application. Since there are no tests requirements for non-mandatory tank mixtures, which is the most frequently used application method of pesticides, or for sequential mixtures, there is good reason to believe that there occurs <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> that are not taken into account, neither in the current European pesticides legislation nor in the Nordic ecological risk assessment. Hence, it was suggested that inclusion of risk assessment of these non-mandatory mixtures could improve the European pesticides legislation. In addition to the legislative and regulatory analysis, the toxic <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> of the active ingredient of the widely used RoundUp herbicde, glyphosate, and the co-formulant, POEA, to the ordinary yellow onion, Allium cepa, was examined in a root growth inhibition assay and by applying the use of a "fixed-ratio" study design.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we showed}} {{theoretically}} {{that differences in}} litter water content, evaporation rate and reaction rate sensitivity to water content can give account of non-additive litter <b>mixture</b> <b>effect.</b> More specifically two litters with the same dependence to litter water content and contrasted water content, and 2 litters with contrasted decomposition sensitivity to litter water content can exert synergistic <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> on decomposition when the 2 litters interact. In these situations, water can flow from the wettest to the driest litter, changing the whole reaction rate without changing the whole litter water content. The reaction rate increase of the litter receiving the water was relatively {{more important than the}} reaction rate decrease of the litter supplying the water. These theoretical considerations were validated with experimental data. Sphagnum rubellum and Molinia caerulea decompose faster in measured mixture than expected from the rates obtained in monoculture incubation. Sphagnum rubellum litter can contain more water, which evaporates at a slower rate than Molinia caerulea. It is thus proposed that water flowed from Sphagnum rubellum litter to the Molinia caerulea litter, with a substantial increase of the decomposition of the latter. The physical and biochemical litter characteristics towards water explains a fraction of the synergistic effect of mixing the 2 litters, which suggests that other factors intervene in this effect, such as the carbon substrate...|$|E

This thesis is concerned with the relevance of mixture effects from unintentional mixtures in the aquatic environment and the ecological risk assessments and risk management within EU that should address such risks. The aim was to investigate to what extent the <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> of propiconazole (a pesticide and biocide) and resorcinol (a cosmetic ingredient and active ingredient in human medicines), which both enter the aquatic environment, pose a risk beyond that of the individual chemicals, and how mixture effects from such unintentional mixtures are assessed and managed within EU.

We subsequently conducted an analysis of the relevant EU legislations: REACH, the Water Framework Directive, the Biocide regulation, the Plant protection products regulation, the Human medicine directive and the Cosmetic regulation, to investigate if and how they deal with mixture effects in relation to resorcinol and propiconazole.

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose {{for the first time}} an {{approach}} for the tentative derivation of effect-based water quality trigger values for an apical endpoint, the cytotoxicity measured by the bioluminescence inhibition in Vibrio fischeri. The trigger values were derived for the Australian Drinking Water Guideline and the Australian Guideline for Water Recycling as examples, but the algorithm can be adapted to any other set of guideline values. In the first step, a Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) describing the 50 % effect concentrations, EC 50, was established using chemicals known to act according to the nonspecific mode of action of baseline toxicity. This QSAR described the effect of most of the chemicals in these guidelines satisfactorily, with the exception of antibiotics, which were more potent than predicted by the baseline toxicity QSAR. The <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> of 10 - 56 guideline chemicals mixed at various fixed concentration ratios (equipotent mixture ratios and ratios of the guideline values) was adequately described by concentration addition model of mixture toxicity. Ten water samples were then analysed and 5 - 64 regulated chemicals were detected (from a target list of over 200 chemicals). These detected chemicals were mixed in the ratios of concentrations detected and their <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> was predicted by concentration addition. Comparing the effect of these designed mixtures with the effect of the water samples, it became evident that less than 1 % of effect could be explained by known chemicals, making it imperative to derive effect-based trigger values. The effect-based water quality trigger value, EBT-EC 50, was calculated from the <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> concentration predicted for concentration-dditive mixture effects of all chemicals in a given guideline divided by the sum of the guideline concentrations for individual components, and dividing by an extrapolation factor that accounts for the number of chemicals contained in the guidelines and for model uncertainties. While this concept was established using the example of Australian recycled water, it can be easily adapted to any other set of water quality guidelines for organic micropollutants. The cytotoxicity based trigger value cannot be used in isolation, it must be applied in conjunction with effect-based trigger values targeting critical specific modes of action such as estrogenicity or photosynthesis inhibition.

RESULTS: On reviewing the low-dose mixture literature, we found good evidence demonstrating significant <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> with combinations of chemicals well below their individual no observable adverse effect levels (NOAELs), both with mixtures composed of similarly and dissimilarly acting agents. CONCLUSIONS: The widely held view that mixtures of dissimilarly acting chemicals are “safe ” at levels below NOAELs is not supported by empirical evidence.

Few studies have simultaneously compared the <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> of water samples with designed reference mixtures comprised of the ratios of analytically detected concentrations in toxicity tests. In the present study, the authors address the effect of herbicides and other chemicals on inhibition of photosynthesis and algal growth rate. The authors tested water samples including secondary treated wastewater effluent, recycled water, drinking water, and storm water in the combined algae assay. The detected chemicals were mixed in the concentration ratios detected, and the biological effects of the water samples were compared with the designed mixtures of individual detected chemicals to quantify the fraction of effect caused by unknown chemicals. The results showed that herbicides dominated the algal toxicity in these environmentally realistic mixtures, and the contribution by the non-herbicides was negligible. A 2 -stage model, which used concentration addition within the groups of herbicides and non-herbicides followed by the model of independent action to predict the <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> of the two groups, could predict the experimental mixture toxicity effectively, but the concentration addition model for herbicides was robust and sufficient for complex mixtures.

Objectives: To study <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> of contaminants on the risk of incident MetS in a prospective fashion. Methods: Our sample consisted of 452 subjects from the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study (50 % women, all aged 70 years) free from the MetS at baseline, being followed for 10 years. At baseline, 30 different environmental contaminants were measured; 6 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 3 organochlorine (OC) pesticides, one dioxin, one polybrominated diphenyl ether (all in plasma), 8 perfluoroalkyl substances (in plasma) and 11 metals (in whole blood). The MetS was defined by the ATPIII/NCEP criteria. Gradient boosted Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs) {{was used to evaluate}} potential synergistic and additive <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> on incident MetS. Results: During 10 -year follow-up, 92 incident cases of the MetS occurred. PCB 126, PCB 170, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and PCB 118 levels were all associated with incident MetS in an additive fashion (OR 1. 73 for a change from 10 th to 90 th percentile (95 % CI 1. 24 - 3. 04) for PCB 126, OR 0. 63 (0. 42 - 0. 78) for PCB 170, OR 1. 44 (1. 09 - 2. 20) for HCB and OR 1. 46 (1. 13 - 2. 43) for PCB 118). No synergistic effects were found. Conclusion: A mixture of environmental contaminants, with PCB 126, PCB 170, HCB and PCB 118 being the most important, showed associations with future development of the MetS in an additive fashion in this prospective study. Thus, <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> of environmental contaminants could {{contribute to the development of}} cardiometabolic derangements...|$|R

Before the optimization gradation of asphalt mixture material, the primary material of asphalt mixture {{gradation curve}} must be determined in the plan. Through the orthogonal experiment method, the full collision combination of three levels and three key factors of asphalt <b>mixture</b> <b>effect,</b> that will be taken into account. Through the 9 groups of grading curve experiment, the expected results of 27 groups in the general experiment will be achieved. Comparative analysis of advantages and disadvantages with {{the properties of the}} mixture road 9 group grading curve corresponding, can get the recommended gradation curve range. Comparing with the normal grading curve primary method, through the orthogonal experiment method in primary SMA asphalt mixture curve can reduce the testing time, reduce material’s artificial waste and environmental pollution...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{presents}} synthesis and characterization of {{high impact polystyrene}} - TiO 2 nanoparticles mixed matrix membranes for separation of carbon dioxide from nitrogen. The solution-casting method was used for preparation of membranes. The nano mixed matrix membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy to ensure the suitable dispersion of nano particles in high impact polystyrene matrix. The effect of TiO 2 nanoparticles loading on membrane performance was investigated. The separation performance of synthesized membranes was investigated in separation of CO 2 from CO 2 /N 2 <b>mixture.</b> <b>Effect</b> of feed pressure and TiO 2 content on separation of CO 2 was studied. The results revealed that increase of feed pressure decreases flux of gases through the mixed matrix membrane. The results also confirmed that the best separation performance can be obtained at TiO 2 nanoparticles loading of 7 wt. %...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} oxidation of several hydrocarbons was studied over noble metal and metal oxide catalysts. A fast empirical method {{was developed to}} determine the minimum operating temperature required to guarantee complete conversion of the hydrocarbon. The influence of the operating parameters such as the inlet concentration and residence time, {{as well as the}} chemical character of the component to be oxidized, have been investigated. The results can be described satisfactorily by a simple isothermal, plug flow reactor model and first-order reaction kinetics. In the case of simultaneous oxidation of different components a significant <b>mixture</b> <b>effect</b> was not observed. The presence of water in the feed did significantly inhibit the oxidation of alkanes. Of the applied catalysts, Pt was the most effective for the combustion of the alkenes, whereas Pd showed a higher activity for the oxidation of alkanes...|$|E
30|$|Assessment factors (AF) are {{commonly}} used in chemical registration or authorization processes, e.g. {{in the context of}} the REACH Regulation (EC) No 1907 / 2006, the Plant Protection Products Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009, or the BPD. They cover a range of uncertainties, such as laboratory to field extrapolation or acute to chronic extrapolation[4] but are not sized to account for <b>mixture</b> <b>effects.</b> Hence a specific mixture assessment factor (MAF) has been discussed in order to safeguard against unwanted <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> from multi-component <b>mixtures</b> of partly unidentified composition[5]. In order to account for this lack of knowledge, the MAF has to incorporate a certain element of conservatism. As the chemical composition of a biocide product that is subject to authorization is known, the MAF is not further considered in the following text.|$|R
40|$|Plant litter {{diversity}} {{effects on}} decomposition rates are frequently reported, {{but with a}} strong bias towards temperate ecosystems. Altered decomposition and nutrient recycling with changing litter diversity may be particularly important in tree species-rich tropical rainforests on nutrient-poor soils. Using 28 different mixtures of leaf litter from 16 Amazonian rainforest tree species, we tested the hypothesis that litter <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> on decomposition increase with increasing functional litter diversity. Litter mixtures and all single litter species were exposed {{in the field for}} 9 months using custom-made microcosms with soil fauna access. In order to test the hypothesis that the long-term presence of tree species contributing to the litter <b>mixtures</b> increases <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> on decomposition, microcosms were installed in a plantation at sites including the respective tree species composition and in a nearby natural forest where these tree species are absent. We found that mixture decomposition deviated from predictions based on single species, with predominantly synergistic effects. Functional litter diversity, defined as either richness, evenness, or divergence based {{on a wide range of}} chemical traits, did not explain the observed litter <b>mixture</b> <b>effects.</b> However, synergistic <b>effects</b> in litter <b>mixtures</b> increased with the long-term presence of tree species contributing to these mixtures as the home field advantage hypothesis assumes. Our data suggest that complementarity effects on mixed litter decomposition may emerge through long-term interactions between aboveground and belowground biota...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Since {{toxicity}} is time dependent, {{short-term toxicity}} tests may overlook <b>mixture</b> <b>effects,</b> because chemical accumulation within an organism takes time. We therefore studied {{the effects of}} cadmium on the toxicokinetics of pyrene and its metabolites in the soil-dwelling collembolan Folsomia candida exposed through Lufa 2. 2 soil. Single pyrene was rapidly taken up and steady state was reached within the 337 -h exposure period. Simultaneous exposure to cadmium significantly decreased the pyrene uptake and elimination rate, resulting in a prolonged half life. Kinetics of the first phase metabolite OHpyrene was also significantly influenced by cadmium. Cadmium increased the hydroxylation rate of pyrene but slowed down its further metabolization, again resulting in a prolonged half life. We showed that pyrene accumulation and metabolization are significantly influenced {{by the presence of}} cadmium. Our results suggest that <b>mixture</b> <b>effects</b> may be dependent on exposure time...|$|R
