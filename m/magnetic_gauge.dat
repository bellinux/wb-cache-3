The liquid is contained in a chamber of strong, non-magnetic material, avoiding the use of glass. The level indicator consists of a number of pivoting magnetic vanes arranged one above the other and placed close to the chamber containing the float. The two faces of the vanes are differently coloured. As the magnet passes up and down behind the vanes it cause them to rotate, displaying one colour for the region containing the liquid and another for the region containing gas. Magnetic gauges are stated in various manufacturers' literature to be most suitable for very high pressure and / or temperature and for aggressive liquids.|$|E
40|$|We present new spherically symmetric, dyonic soliton {{and black}} hole {{solutions}} of the su(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills equations in four-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-time. The gauge field has nontrivial electric and magnetic components and {{is described by}} N- 1 <b>magnetic</b> <b>gauge</b> field functions and N- 1 electric gauge field functions. We explore the phase space of solutions in detail for su(2) and su(3) gauge groups. Combinations of the electric gauge field functions are monotonic and have no zeros; in general the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gauge</b> field functions may have zeros. The phase space of solutions is extremely rich, and we find solutions in which the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gauge</b> field functions have more than fifty zeros. Of particular interest are solutions for which the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gauge</b> field functions have no zeros, which exist when the negative cosmological constant has sufficiently large magnitude.

50|$|When {{selecting}} a <b>magnetic</b> level <b>gauge</b> {{it is important}} {{to take into account the}} strength of the magnetic field. The magnetic field is the heart of the <b>magnetic</b> level <b>gauge</b> - the stronger the field, the more reliable the instrument will function. Some manufacturers rely on a single magnet for their <b>magnetic</b> level <b>gauges</b> which causes the strength of the north field to be identical to, and as weak as, the south field. It is apparent that at the location of the indicators, switches and transmitters, the field would not be as intense. Some manufacturers use a single annular ring magnet, others use a series of single bar magnets in a circular array in their float design. In this design the relative field strength of the north and south poles will be equal to one another and less than that of a dual magnet design. Moreover, the field strength as you travel around the circumference will have high and low spots as you pass between the individual bar magnets.|$|R

40|$|In zero {{magnetic}} field the ground state manifold of a ferromagnetic spin- 1 condensate is SO(3) and exhibits Z_ 2 vortices as topological defects. We investigate the phase ordering dynamics {{of this system}} after being quenched into this ferromagnetic phase from a zero temperature unmagnetized phase.

When the special Kähler manifold is a symmetric space, our solution is completely explicit and the entropy is related to the familiar quartic invariant.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel composite Higgs theory based on con ning supersymmetric QCD. Supersymmetric duality {{plays a key}} role in this construction, with a "fat" Higgs boson emerging as a dual magnetic degree of freedom charged under the dual <b>magnetic</b> <b>gauge</b> group. Due to spontaneous color- avor locking in the infrared, the electroweak gauge symmetry is aligned with the dual <b>magnetic</b> <b>gauge</b> group, allowing large Yukawa couplings between elementary matter elds and the composite Higgs. At the same time, this theory exhibits metastable supersymmetry breaking, leading to low-scale gauge mediation via composite messengers. The Higgs boson is heavier than in minimal supersymmetric theories, due to non-decoupling D-terms and a large F-term quartic coupling. This theory predicts quasi-stable TeV-scale pseudo-modulini, some of which are charged under standard model color, possibly giving rise to long-lived R-hadrons at the LHC. United States.

40|$|Abstract—Non contact {{evaluation}} of the thickness of paint coatings can be attempted by different destructive and nondestructive methods such as cross-section microscopy, gravimetric mass measurement, <b>magnetic</b> <b>gauges,</b> Eddy current, ultrasound or terahertz. Infrared thermography is a nondestructive and non-invasive method that can be envisaged as a useful tool to measure the surface thickness variations by analyzing the temperature response. In this paper, the thermal quadrupole method for two layered samples heated up with a pulsed excitation is firstly used. By analyzing the thermal responses {{as a function of}} thermal properties and thicknesses of both layers, optimal parameters for the excitation source can be identified. Simulations show that a pulsed excitation with duration of ten milliseconds allows obtaining a substrate-independent thermal response. Based on this result, an experimental setup consisting of a near-infrared laser diode and an Infrared camera was next used to evaluate the variation of paint coating thickness between 60 µm and 130 µm on two samples. Results show that the parameters extracted for thermal images are correlated with the estimated thicknesses by the Eddy current methods. The laser pulsed thermography is thus an interesting alternative nondestructive method that can be moreover used for nonconductive substrates.
