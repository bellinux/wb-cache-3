40|$|Agriculture and Climate Change: Challenges and Solutions. According to {{the latest}} report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change is already having a {{significant}} impact on agriculture. Several models highlight the increasingly negative effects of increased temperatures on crop yields and livestock farming in developing countries. These impacts can be caused by negative physiological effects for plants and animals, which result from higher temperatures or the proliferation of pests and diseases caused by the latter. The increased number of extreme weather events, especially floods, and changing precipitation patterns are linked to climate changes. These factors dramatically affect the crop production potential of agricultural land. Populations in the developing world, which are already vulnerable and exposed to food insecurity, are the <b>most</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>affected.</b> In many <b>countries</b> in the southern hemisphere, agriculture actually represents the main source of income for a major proportion of the active population. Combined with increased demographic pressure, climate changes therefore help to exacerbate the pressure on global food systems. In addition, {{it should be noted that}} agriculture also plays a key role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and is therefore at the heart of a variety of complex issues. In light of these facts, it is essential that we make every effort to identify solutions, aimed at adapting to climate changes and alleviating the contribution of certain agricultural practices to the latter, in order to respond to all the challenges that they create. This involves reinforcing research initiatives aimed at understanding and quantifying the problems, while identifying steps that need to be taken in order to limit these problems. It also involves lobbying for appropriate policies to be put into place, based on the results of this research. Last but not least, it involves developing field projects in order to identify and promote appropriate farming practices and create conditions that will help them become more widespread. With this in mind, we welcome the Montpellier Declaration initiative ([URL] which was developed at the Third Global Science Conference on Climate Smart Agriculture (Climate Smart Agriculture 2015) that was held in this city on 16 - 18 March 2015. At this event, over 600 research scientists and 150 stakeholders/policy makers - from 75 countries and 5 continents – confirmed that climate smart agriculture has become a benchmark, which creates synergies and may lead to innovative and global solutions at local, regional and international level. The participants also confirmed that climate smart solutions exist and could become a reality if the conditions and public policies lend themselves to these solutions. We encourage all readers of Tropicultura to learn more about the work completed at this conference, in order to understand issues linked to climate change and identify sources of inspiration, so that we can overcome the constraints that it imposes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTR ACT: Even if an {{effective}} vaccine against Ebola virus disease (EVD) becomes available, the challenges posed by this disease are complex. Certain socioeconomic and cultural {{factors have been}} linked to recent outbreaks of EVD in West Africa. The outbreaks revealed widespread ignorance by laypersons of EVD etiology, mode of transmission, and personal protective measures that can be taken. Lack of trust in the authorities, virus infection during the preparation of “bushmeat ” for human consumption, traditional funerary practices, and relatively free flow of goods and people between regions and across international borders may have facilitated the spread of EVD and hindered outbreak control efforts.

40|$|The {{observations}} {{in this paper}} are not original but stem from two sources. The first is a desk review carried out for DFID Policy Division late last year to identify research gaps in cultural, social, economic and policy analysis of risk and vulnerability {{in the context of}} HIV/AIDS. The second is an appreciative reading of the recent work of Tony Barnett and also Alan Whiteside in their pioneering efforts to understand and contextualise AIDS as a “long wave ” shock (Barnett and Whiteside 2002, Barnett 2004). As the desk review noted, there is a huge and diverse literature on HIV/AIDS relevant to understanding vulnerability. This comes particularly from anthropology and sociology and mainly focuses on micro-level impacts on specific social groups. 1 But there are large gaps in our understanding of the macro-economic and macro-social impacts of HIV/AIDS and a dearth of policy analysis and policy relevant research on the <b>most</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>affected</b> <b>countries.</b> 2 For these countries, both national and international responses have been sparse and weak.

40|$|Real estate {{cycles and}} banking cycles may occur {{independently}} {{but they are}} correlated in a remarkable number of instances ranging over {{a wide variety of}} institutional arrangements, in both advanced industrial nations and emerging economies. During the recent Asian financial crisis, the <b>most</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>affected</b> <b>countries</b> first experienced a collapse in property prices and a weakening of the banking systems before experiencing their exchange rate crises. Countries where banks play a more dominant role in real estate markets and hold a greater percentage of assets are the most severely affected during such a crisis. In this paper, the authors develop an explanation of how real estate cycles and banking crises are related and why they occur. The authors first discuss how real estate prices are determined and why they are so vulnerable to deviations from long-run equilibrium prices, paying special attention {{to the role of the}} banking system in determining prices. Increases in the price of real estate may increase the economic value of bank capital to the extent that banks own real estate. This then increases the value of loans collateralized by real estate and may lead to a decline in the perceived risk of real estate lending. For these reasons, an increase in real estate prices may increase the supply of credit to the real estate industry which is then likely to lead to further increases in real estate prices. The opposite is also true. A decline in the price of real estate will decrease bank capital by reducing the value of the bank's own real estate assets as well as reduce the value of loans collateralized by real estate. This may lead to defaults, thus further reducing capital. A decline in the price of real estate is also likely to increase the perceived risk in real estate lending. All of these factors reduce the supply of credit to the real estate industry. Supervisors and regulators may also react to the resulting weakening of bank capital positions by increasing capital requirements and instituting stricter rules for classifying and provisioning against real estate assets, leading to even further decline in prices and supply of credit to the real estate industry. In order to explain how real estate cycles begin, the authors turn to a model of land prices developed by Mark Carey that details the role of optimists in the process. They then bring in the role of non-financial variables as well as of banks and then turn to the part played by "disaster myopia" [...] the tendency over time to underestimate the probability of low-frequency shocks [...] in determining cycles. Other factors that contribute to cycles are inadequate data and weak analysis by bank managers as well as "perverse incentives" [...] one result of "disaster myopia" that occurs when lenders believe that they can accept higher loan-to-value rations, weaker commitments or guarantees and looser loan covenants without increasing their risk of loss. Using this framework of the interactions between the real estate market and bank behavior, the authors interpret recent examples of real estate booms linked to banking crises in Sweden, the United States, Japan and Thailand. They then discuss measures that can be taken to limit the amplitude of real estate cycles and ways to insulate the banking system from real estate cycles. They believe that the heart of the problem is the structure of the real estate market and that cycles can be avoided by taking measures that counter: The bias towards optimism; Excessive leverage; Disaster myopia; Inadequate data and weak analysis; Perverse incentives. The authors detail their recommendations for avoiding these problems in the future. These include the development of an options market for commercial real estate, greater reliance on equity financing, changes in supervisory policy that allow the identification of vulnerable banks before they become weak banks, better publication of information relevant to the valuation of commercial real estate projects, and refraining from providing full protection to all bank creditors, especially sophisticated creditors such as corporations, banks, and institutional investors. ...|$|E
