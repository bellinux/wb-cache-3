5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the other two thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range}} of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} factor {{that helped the}} All Blacks to success was their {{superior}} fitness. In New Zealand each half was 45 minutes, not 35 like in Britain. As well as that, the All Blacks spent much time on fitness. This enabled them to play with speed <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> their opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{original}} ages was also a problem, as the rate of Kula-Farallon spreading over that time would produce a chain of seamounts <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> observed, and {{too far away from}} the continent to explain the continentally derived sediments. This objection is attenuated somewhat in that the newer ages show a smaller range of ages.|$|E

5|$|Albatrosses live <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> other birds; they delay {{breeding}} {{for longer}} and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest recorded being a Laysan albatross named Wisdom that was ringed in 1956 as a mature adult and hatched another chick in February 2017, making her at least 66 years old. She {{is the oldest}} confirmed wild bird {{as well as the}} oldest banded bird in the world.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E
5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E

5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|This {{new class}} of GRB-like events was first {{discovered}} through the detection of GRB 110328A by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission on 28 March 2011. This event had a gamma-ray duration of about 2 days, <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> even ultra-long GRBs, and was detected in X-rays for many months. It occurred {{at the center of}} a small elliptical galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. There is an ongoing debate as to whether the explosion was the result of stellar collapse or a tidal disruption event accompanied by a relativistic jet, although the latter explanation has become widely favoured.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{establish}} the exact date of Good Friday by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse. This research has not yielded conclusive results, and Good Friday is recorded as being at Passover, which is held at the time of a full moon. Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. In the Western hemisphere, there are few reliable records of eclipses before 800 AD, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period. The first recorded observation of the corona was made in Constantinople in 968 AD.|$|E

5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway {{as part of}} the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided {{that the best way to}} do this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> expected, so instead Wehrmach started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim. They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen Station and then follow Sandgata and Olav Tryggvasons gate, cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up Innherredsveien before reaching the Meråker Line at Lademoen Station. However, by German capitulation on 8 May 1945, construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Level-5 {{collaborated with}} Studio Ghibli {{to produce the}} game's {{animated}} sequences, and the game features graphics and visuals replicating the traditional animation style of Studio Ghibli films. The collaboration began when musician Naoya Fujimaki, who had previously worked with both companies, introduced Level-5 president Akihiro Hino to Studio Ghibli president Toshio Suzuki. At the time, Studio Ghibli had completed work on Ponyo (2008), and the animation team had no ongoing projects, which influenced Suzuki's decision to collaborate with Level-5. Another influencing factor of the collaboration was witnessing Hino's passion for the project. Studio Ghibli approached the production process {{in the same way}} that they would create an animated film. Work on the animation began in July 2008, and took <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the predicted three months.|$|E

5|$|One more {{very convincing}} {{experiment}} from Dubna came in 1966, again {{using the same}} two reactions, which concluded that 254102 indeed had a half-life <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the 3seconds claimed by Berkeley. Later work in 1967 at Berkeley and 1971 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory fully confirmed the discovery of element 102 and clarified earlier observations. In December 1966, the Berkeley group repeated the Dubna experiments and fully confirmed them, and used this data to finally assign correctly the isotopes they had previously synthesized but could not yet identify at the time, and thus claimed to have discovered nobelium in 1958 to 1961.|$|E
5|$|The body is deepest {{in front}} of the two tall and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is about a third larger than the second and {{originates}} over the pelvic fin origins. The second dorsal fin is located midway between the first dorsal and the caudal fin. The broad and triangular pectoral fins have a deep indentation where their leading margins meet the head. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, and the anal fin is absent. The tail is <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the body and ends in a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin; the lower caudal fin lobe is more than half the length of the upper.|$|E
5|$|The forearms {{are dark}} gray. The forefeet are unpigmented and ungual tufts of white hairs {{surround}} the equally unpigmented claws. The animal has long, narrow hindfeet, longer than in T.talamancae, with usually smooth soles (lacking squamae, which {{are present in}} T.talamancae). The three middle digits are <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the outer two. Six pads are present on the sole. The upper surface and {{the sides of the}} hindfeet are white and appear naked, although short, white hairs are present; these hairs are longer in T.talamancae. Ungual tufts of long, white or gray hairs are present around the claws, which are short and lack pigment.|$|E
