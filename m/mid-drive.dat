50|$|Another type of {{electric}} assist motor, {{often referred to}} as the <b>mid-drive</b> system, is increasing in popularity. With this system, the electric motor is not built into the wheel but is usually mounted near (often under) the bottom bracket shell. In more typical configurations, a cog or wheel on the motor drives a belt or chain that engages with a pulley or sprocket fixed to one of the arms of the bicycle's crankset. Thus the propulsion is provided at the pedals rather than at the wheel, being eventually applied to the wheel via the bicycle's standard drive train.|$|E
50|$|Some velomobiles {{have been}} {{converted}} to provide electric assist. Electric assist means that a small battery-operated electric-propulsion system is provided to assist the driver's leg muscle effort. Most electric-assist propulsion motors are of the in-wheel design in the rear wheel, such as geared hub motors (like eZee, Heinzmann, Bafang, BMC, etc.) and direct-drive hub motors (like Crystalyte, BionX, 9Continent, etc.) but <b>mid-drive</b> units (like Sunstar, Cyclone, Ecospeed, etc.) are used as well due to design constraints in velomobile models with one-sided rear wheel mounting like the Quest, Strada and Mango or front wheel drive in the Velayo, or better efficiency by using the multiple speeds of the chain drive or internal geared hubs (e.g. Rohloff 14 speed hub).|$|E
5000|$|The Road Test: As in the {{previous}} two seasons, the final road test takes place in Hamilton, Ontario, with the three finalists taking Andrew on a one-hour drive in a Corvette. Michael is first-up, and his run initially goes well, with Michael driving confidently, following directions and negotiating some confusing intersections. He messes up <b>mid-drive</b> by running two red lights in quick succession (one of which apparently through a confusion of Ontario and British Columbia traffic laws), but otherwise his run goes very smoothly, and he handles the highway drive with no trouble at all. To Andrew's shock, Sly's drive goes even better, and other than excessive shoulder-checking, he doesn't make a single mistake on the drive. However, Sly only half-heartedly promises not to eat or use handheld gadgets while in the car, which causes Andrew to ponder whether he should still be named Canada's Worst Driver Ever. Despite him performing {{the best in the}} two prior challenges, Kevin's run proves to be by far the worst of the three; within the opening minutes of the drive, he turns left from the middle lane, then does it again {{in the middle of a}} busy street, and to Andrew's shock, he tries to deny having done it. He then commits a serious offence by passing a stopped police car without changing lanes (something Cam notes is usually an instant $490 fine), and as the drive continues, he scrapes the Corvette's bumper while turning around, makes several illegal lane changes, runs a red light and then stops in the middle of an intersection. Andrew twice has to prevent Kevin from turning left from the central lane (which would have caused him to collide with a bus and a car, respectively), and after the second such incident, Kevin pulls over, phones Lenny and seems to concede he's Canada's Worst Driver Ever, and suggests he give up driving. Lenny tells him to finish the drive, but Andrew tells Kevin that should he commit any more ticketable offences, the drive will be stopped immediately. Sure enough, Kevin subsequently turns into an oncoming traffic lane and fails to realize this until Andrew points it out, leading to him stopping just yards short of a collision with a car coming from the other direction; this is the final straw for Andrew, who calls a halt to the drive and takes Kevin back to the starting parking lot himself. Kevin becomes completely despondent, snaps at Andrew, and then breaks down in tears when calling Lenny on the phone again. Andrew notes that with Sly's drive being flawless and Michael also having done relatively well on his, Kevin's status as Canada's Worst Driver Ever is now all but assured.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the effect on rower posture of raising the stretchers. Nine male university rowers completed a single 30 -s trial at each of three stretcher heights on an ergometer, at 30 strokes min- 1. The first ten strokes with complete data were averaged and data for four time points during the stroke extracted: catch, <b>mid-drive,</b> finish, and mid-recovery. Ankle angle was shown to increase significantly at all points during the stroke (P< 0. 01) as the stretchers were raised. Knee angle was only significantly increased into a more extended posture at <b>mid-drive</b> (P< 0. 05) and mid-recovery (P< 0. 01) for the higher stretcher positions, hip angle was significantly reduced into a more flexed posture at the catch (P< 0. 05) and at mid-recovery (P< 0. 05), and the trunk was significantly extended at the catch (P< 0. 01), finish (P< 0. 01), and mid-recovery (P< 0. 05) as the stretchers were raised. Our results show that the increase in stretcher height caused the rower's body to rotate posteriorly in the sagittal plane. This we suggest reduced the vertical component of stretcher force, thus achieving a more mechanically effective position, which could have led to the slower rate of fatigue reported previously for the two raised stretcher positions (Caplan & Gardner, 2005). The increased flexion of the hip should not be ignored, however, as this may lead to overstretching of the hip extensors if the stretchers are raised too high. Further research is required {{to determine the extent to}} which the stretchers can be raised in on-water rowing...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [63]- 65) The lower {{lumbar vertebrae}} of rowers {{are subjected to}} high levels of shear and compression at <b>mid-drive</b> during the rowing stroke, and these forces may be partially neutralized by increasing intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). Since IAP fluctuates with ventilation, {{the purpose of this study}} was to compare the IAP response between two breathing patterns, inspiring during the drive and expiring during the drive, to determine if one breathing pattern might increase the IAP at <b>mid-drive</b> more than the other. Ten moderately active volunteers (5 M, 5 F; age: 25. 1 yr ± 2. 9; Ht: 176. 4 cm ± 6. 6; Wt: 73. 6 kg ± 12. 3) with and without rowing experience performed two sets (inspiration and expiration) of five 2 -minute intervals on a Concept II rowing ergometer. The intervals began at a workload of 100 watts (W) and increased to 200 W by increments of 25 W. IAP was measured every. 032 s for 30 s during each interval using a pressure transducer catheter. A position sensor was attached to the seat of the ergometer and interfaced with the data acquisition program so that the IAP responses could be expressed relative to the position of the body during the drive. Statistical analyses were completed using a 2 x 5 (breathing pattern by workload) repeated measures analysis of variance with Tukey or dependent 1 -test follow-ups. There was no interaction between breathing pattern and workload for the dependent variables minimum IAP (IAPmin), maximum IAP (IAPmax) or change in IAP (?IAP) (p>. 05); however, there was a significant interaction for middrive IAP (M-D IAP), with M-D IAP increasing at a greater rate as workload increased while expiring during the drive than inspiring during the drive (p. 05). The data show that expiring during the drive offers more protection to the lower lumbar vertebrae at middrive than inspiring during the drive. M. S. Ed. (Master of Education...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes {{an optimal}} {{design of a}} middle motor {{integrated}} into a <b>mid-drive</b> unit for pedal electric cycles. This middle motor is an axial-flux permanent magnet brushless DC motor with a stator plate. Facing this plate is a rotor plate that acts as an eccentric component of a cycloidal reducer next to the stator. Both the middle motor and cycloidal reducer are easily installed on the same axle of the bike crankset. In the preliminary design, driving requirements are {{used to make the}} middle motor specifications. The numbers of stator slots and magnet poles on the rotor were chosen to achieve the best winding factor, and the winding layout was determined accordingly. A one-dimensional magnetic circuit model of the middle motor was built, and its shape was optimized utilizing a multifunctional optimization system tool. Finally, the resulting design was verified and refined by a finite element analysis. A prototype of the middle motor was fabricated with a stator made of a soft magnetic composite and integrated with a cycloidal reducer. Experimental results show that the motor has a sinusoidal back electromotive force. Additionally, it is easily controlled by sinusoidal currents with acceptable torque and speed curves...|$|E
40|$|The {{etiology}} of exercise-induced rib stress fractures (RSFs) in elite rowers is unclear. The {{purpose of the}} study was to investigate thoracic muscle activity, movement patterns and muscle strength in elite rowers. Electromyographic (EMG) and 2 -D video analysis were performed during ergometer rowing, and isokinetic muscle strength was measured in seven national team rowers with a history of RSF and seven matched controls (C). RSF displayed a higher velocity of the seat in the initial drive phase (RSF: 0. 25 +/- 0. 03, 0. 25 (0. 15 - 0. 33) m/s vs C: 0. 15 +/- 0. 06, 0. 18 (- 0. 11 - 0. 29) m/s P = 0. 028) (Mean +/- SEM, median and range). Further, RSF had greater co-contraction of m. serratus anterior and m. trapezius in the <b>mid-drive</b> phase (RSF: 47. 5 +/- 3. 4, 48. 5 (35. 8 - 60. 2) % EMG signal overlap vs C: 30. 8 +/- 6. 5, 27. 0 (11. 2 - 61. 6) % P = 0. 043). In addition, the RSF subjects showed a lower knee-extension to elbow-flexion strength ratio (RSF: 4. 2 +/- 0. 22, 4. 3 (3. 5 - 5. 1) vs C: 4. 8 +/- 0. 16, 5. 0 (4. 2 - 5. 3) P = 0. 043), indicating stronger arms relative to legs compared with controls. In conclusion, increased thoracic muscle co-contraction, altered movement patterns and reduced leg/arm strength ratio were observed in the RSF subjects, which may all predispose toward an increased risk of RSF...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{predominant}} {{movement patterns}} in cycling are centred around ankle, knee and hip flexion/extension. Importantly, the cycling action also contains lower limb {{movements in the}} frontal (e. g. hip adduction/abduction and knee varus/valgus) and transverse planes (e. g. hip and knee internal/external rotation), with some researchers linking these non-sagittal movements to the relatively high incidence of lower limb overuse injuries in road cycling. Our earlier research has indicated increased variation in tibial rotation variability at the <b>mid-drive</b> phase position during sustained cycling, but the quantification of movement variability using discrete analyses may under, or overestimate the degree of variability present throughout the pedal stroke. Accordingly, {{the purpose of this}} study was to quantify the degree of pelvis and lower limb movement variability during sustained cycling using Normalised Root Mean Square (NoRMS) analyses. Methods: Ten experienced male road cyclists (age 36 ± 3. 6 years, mass 79. 8 ± 5. 8 kg, and height 1. 817 ± 0. 046 m) performed a 60 min cycling test at a workload equivalent to 88 % of onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA). Previous testing has indicated that this workload enabled the participants to maximise their work output during the 60 min. Three-dimensional kinematic data (200 Hz) were recorded using a 9 camera infra-red motion capture system for 20 pedal revolutions during the last minute of each 10 min period. Analyses focused on lower limb and pelvis kinematics, with NoRMS analyses being used from angle-angle data to quantify pedal stroke consistency. Results: Analysis of the angle-angle graphs indicated that the participants increased the amount of posterior pelvic tilt by approximately 3 deg during the latter stages of the test, which caused a corresponding 5 deg increase in hip flexion throughout the pedal stroke. The greatest changes in angle-angle data were in the transverse plane hip, knee and ankle graphs. Significant increases in NoRMS data were also found in transverse plane hip and knee axial rotations during the latter stages of the test. Discussion: Our results indicated that changes in pelvis orientation and non-sagittal hip and knee kinematics movement patterns occur during sustained cycling. The degree of transverse plane movement variability also increases at some joints during a sustained high intensity ride. Our results may help explain the high incidence of lower back and knee injury experienced by well trained and high performance cyclists...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the limited}} supply and {{perishable}} nature of blood products, effective management of blood collection is critical for high quality healthcare delivery. Whole blood is typically collected over a 6 to 8 hour collection window from volunteer donors at sites, e. g., schools, universities, churches, companies, that are a significant distance from the blood products processing facility and then transported from collection site to processing facility by a blood mobile. The length of time between collecting whole blood and processing it into cryoprecipitate ("cryo"), a critical blood product for controlling massive hemorrhaging, cannot take longer than 8 hours (the 8 hour collection to completion constraint), while the collection to completion constraint for other blood products is 24 hours. In {{order to meet the}} collection to completion constraint for cryo, it is often necessary to have a "mid-drive collection"; i. e., for a vehicle other than the blood mobile to pickup and transport, at extra cost, whole blood units collected during early in the collection window to the processing facility. In this dissertation, we develop analytical models to: (1) analyze which collection sites should be designated as cryo collection sites to minimize total collection costs while satisfying the collection to completion constraint and meeting the weekly production target (the non-split case), (2) analyze the impact of changing the current process to allow collection windows to be split into two intervals and then determining which intervals should be designated as cryo collection intervals (the split case), (3) insure that the weekly production target is met with high probability. These problems lead to MDP models with large state and action spaces and constraints to guarantee that the weekly production target is met with high probability. These models are computationally intractable for problems having state and action spaces of realistic cardinality. We consider two approaches to guarantee that the weekly production target is met with high probability: (1) a penalty function approach and (2) a chance constraint approach. For the MDP with penalty function approach, we first relax a constraint that significantly reduces the cardinality of the state space and provides a lower bound on the optimal expected weekly cost of collecting whole blood for cryo while satisfying the collection to completion constraint. We then present an action elimination procedure that coupled with the constraint relaxation leads to a computationally tractable lower bound. We then develop several heuristics that generate sub-optimal policies and provide an analytical description of the difference between the upper and lower bounds {{in order to determine the}} quality of the heuristics. For the multiple decision epoch MDP model with chance constraint approach, we first note by example that a straightforward application of dynamic programming can lead to a sub-optimal policy. We then restrict the model to a single decision epoch. We then use a computationally tractable rolling horizon procedure for policy determination. We also present a simple greedy heuristic (another rolling horizon decision making procedure) based on ranking the collection intervals by <b>mid-drive</b> pickup cost per unit of expected cryo collected, which results in a competitive sub-optimal solution and leads to the development of a practical decision support tool (DST). Using real data from the American Red Cross (ARC), we estimate that this DST reduces total cost by about 30 % for the non-split case and 70 % for the split case, compared to the current practice. Initial implementation of the DST at the ARC Southern regional manufacturing and service center supports our estimates and indicates the potential for significant improvement in current practice. Ph.
