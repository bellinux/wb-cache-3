50|$|Invasive {{infection}} by L. monocytogenes {{causes the}} disease listeriosis. When the infection is not invasive, any illness {{as a consequence}} of infection is termed febrile gastroenteritis. The manifestations of listeriosis include septicemia, <b>meningitis</b> (<b>or</b> <b>meningoencephalitis),</b> encephalitis, corneal ulcer, pneumonia, and intrauterine or cervical infections in pregnant women, which may result in spontaneous abortion (second to third trimester) or stillbirth. Surviving neonates of fetomaternal listeriosis may suffer granulomatosis infantiseptica — pyogenic granulomas distributed over the whole body — and may suffer from physical retardation. Influenza-like symptoms, including persistent fever, usually precede the onset of the aforementioned disorders. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, may precede more serious forms of listeriosis or may be the only symptoms expressed. Gastrointestinal symptoms were epidemiologically associated with use of antacids or cimetidine. The onset time to serious forms of listeriosis is unknown, but may range from a few days to three weeks. The onset time to gastrointestinal symptoms is unknown but probably exceeds 12 hours. An early study suggested that L. monocytogenes is unique among Gram-positive bacteria in that it might possess lipopolysaccharide, which serves as an endotoxin. Later, it was found to not be a true endotoxin. Listeria cell walls consistently contain lipoteichoic acids, in which a glycolipid moiety, such as a galactosyl-glucosyl-diglyceride, is covalently linked to the terminal phosphomonoester of the teichoic acid. This lipid region anchors the polymer chain to the cytoplasmic membrane. These lipoteichoic acids resemble the lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria in both structure and function, being the only amphipathic polymers at the cell surface.|$|E

Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) is a mosquito-borne orthobunyavirus in the California {{serogroup}} {{that can}} cause an acute febrile illness, <b>meningitis,</b> <b>or</b> <b>meningoencephalitis.</b> We describe epidemiologic and clinical features for JCV disease cases occurring in the United States during 2000 – 2013. A case of JCV disease was defined as an acute illness in a person with laboratory evidence of a recent JCV infection. During 2000 – 2013, we identified 31 cases of JCV disease in residents of 13 states. The median age was 48 years (range, 10 – 69) and 21 (68 %) were male. Eleven (35 %) case patients had meningoencephalitis, 6 (19 %) meningitis, 7 (23 %) fever without neurologic involvement, and 7 (23 %) had an unknown clinical syndrome.

40|$|SUMMARY: Tick-borne {{encephalitis}} {{virus is}} an important human pathogen in Europe. The infection usually presents as <b>meningitis,</b> <b>meningoencephalitis,</b> <b>or</b> meningoencephalomyelitis and only rarely as symptoms of isolated myeloradiculitis. We describe the lumbar MR imaging finding in a 48 -year-old man with serologically confirmed tick-borne encephalitis {{in which there was}} enhancement of the ventral surface of the conus and the anterior nerve roots from the T 12 level extending {{along the length of the}} ventral cauda. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is endemic in many parts ofcentral, eastern, and northern Europe, with about 3000 cases reported annually. It is caused by a flavivirus—the tick-borne encephalitis virus, or TBEv—which is transmitted into humans by tick bites. The clinical spectrum of the infection ranges from subclinical infection to meningitis, meningoen-cephalitis, and meningoencephalomyelitis. 1, 2 In about 5 % of cases, the infection presents as myeloradiculitis without obvi-ous symptoms of meningoencephalitis. 3 The diagnosis is made serologically. 1, 2 The MR imaging finding of the brai...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cryptococcosis is a {{systemic}} mycosis usually affecting immunodeficient individuals. In contrast, immunologically competent patients are rarely affected. Dissemination of cryptococcosis usually involves {{the central nervous}} system, manifesting as <b>meningitis</b> <b>or</b> <b>meningoencephalitis.</b> Prostatic lesions are not commonly found. A case of prostate cryptococcal infection is presented and cases of prostatic cryptococcosis in normal and immunocompromised hosts are reviewed.

Prostate histopathologic examination revealed encapsulated yeast-like structures. After 30 days, the patient’s clinical manifestations worsened, with headache, neck stiffness, bradypsychia, vomiting and fever. Direct microscopy of the patient’s urine with China ink preparations showed capsulated yeasts, and positive culture yielded Cryptococcus neoformans.

40|$|Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) {{carries a}} high {{morbidity}} and mortality, however, its diagnosis {{can be difficult}} due to low concentration of bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although increased CSF protein, decreased CSF glucose; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with mononuclear cells predominance are commonly used to diagnose TB infection, they show inconsistent results. Objectives: To analyze the relationship between several characteristics of the CSF and TB meningitis. Methods: This is an observational research, with a cross sectional design, 27 patients with TB <b>meningitis</b> and <b>or</b> <b>meningoencephalitis</b> with Thwaites diagnostic score ≤ 4 obtained from mecidal records. The definitive diagnosis of TB meningitis was made using the Ziehl Neelsen (ZN) staining and or culture TB, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with the target in IS 6110, Ziehl-Neelsen staining (ZN) culture method. Characteristics of CSF including increased CSF protein, decreased CSF glucose, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with mononuclear cells predominance and the CSF abnormalities were evaluated in the laboratory of molecular microbiology of Medical Faculty, Diponegoro University/dr Kariadi General Hospital, Semarang. The statistical analysis used was prevalent ratio (RP). Results: Over 27 patients, 12 (44. 4 %) were diagnosed with definite TB meningitis. Statistical analysis showed that prevalence ratio of the increased levels of protein CSF was 3. 143 (95 % CI: 0. 502 to 19. 692), decreased glucose levels was 1. 750 (95 % CI: 0. 501 to 6. 112), pleocytosis with a predominance of mononuclear cells was 2. 5 (CI 95 % : 1. 238 to 5. 048), whereas the CFS abnormality was RP 2. 2 (95 % CI: 1. 087 to 4. 454).

30|$|Rationale: No interventional study {{tested the}} effect of TTM on outcome of ICU {{patients}} with <b>meningitis</b> <b>or</b> <b>meningoencephalitis.</b> Saxena et al. [136] showed that peak temperature in the first 24  h of ICU admission did not increase the hospital mortality rate in patients with infection of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), whereas it was associated with increased mortality rate in patients with stroke and TBI. Other studies did not report consistent results [137, 138]. Interestingly, in the absence of infection, the outcome was better if the temperature over the first 24  h peaked between 37.5 and 37.9  °C, whereas in case of infection the outcome was better if temperature peaked at 38 – 38.4  °C (UK database) or at 39 – 39.4  °C (NZ/Australian database) [136]. Fever plays a protective role because it inhibits replication of N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae [136] and eases the diagnosis of infection [137]. The use of paracetamol in septic patients can decrease temperature by 0.3  °C, but did not affect mortality or length of ICU stay [139].|$|E
40|$|AbstractNo {{detailed}} data {{exist in the}} literature on the accurate diagnosis of chronic brucellar <b>meningitis</b> <b>or</b> <b>meningoencephalitis.</b> A multicentre retrospective chart review was performed at 19 health centres to determine sensitivities of the diagnostic tests. This study included 177 patients. The mean values of CSF biochemical test results were as follows: CSF protein, 330. 64 ± 493. 28 mg/dL; CSF/ blood-glucose ratio, 0. 35 ± 0. 16; CSF sodium, 140. 61 ± 8. 14 mMt; CSF leucocyte count, 215. 99 ± 306. 87. The sensitivities of the tests were as follows: serum standard tube agglutination (STA), 94 %; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) STA, 78 %; serum Rose Bengal test (RBT), 96 %; CSF RBT, 71 %; automated blood culture, 37 %; automated CSF culture, 25 %; conventional CSF culture, 9 %. The clinician should use every possible means to diagnose chronic neurobrucellosis. The high seropositivitiy in brucellar blood tests must facilitate the use of blood serology. Although STA should be preferred over RBT in CSF in probable neurobrucellosis other than the acute form of the disease, RBT is not as weak as expected. Moreover, automated culture systems should be applied when CSF culture is needed...|$|E
