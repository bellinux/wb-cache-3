40|$|A {{theory is}} derived for the {{determination}} of the masses, radii, and orbital elements of the Pluto/Charon, or similar, system based on the prediction of an image distribution over space and time and its comparison with observation. The comparison may be ultimately through the theory of least squares or the application of a matched filter to the observations as a three-dimensional signal stream at an initial or intermediate state. The theory is an approximation correct to fifth order in the diameters of celestial bodies. The theory of astronomical seeing that is used is based on Kolmogorov turbulence in the long-exposure limit. The images must be photometric. Linear tracking errors that can be removed are preferable to either automatic or <b>manual</b> <b>guiding,</b> in the collection of candidate observations...|$|E
40|$|The Nigerian Construction {{industry}} {{through its}} procurement activities is contributing immensely {{to the economic}} development of the country. Nigeria as a developing nation is still working hard to strengthening the public procurement sector through which public infrastructural facilities are developed. Public Procurement Guidelines are the procedural <b>manual</b> <b>guiding</b> public procurement processes. The guidelines are as provided by the public procurement Act PPA 2007, since then compliance with the guidelines has been facing a lot of obstacles. This paper identified and reviewed three major determinants of compliance with the procurement guidelines to include Familiarity with the procurement guidelines, Fraudulent Practices, and Influencing Projects awards. Thus recommended that, to achieve adequate compliance with the procurement guidelines procurement entities need to create room for awareness through training and workshops. The Bureau of public procurement must also ensure prosecution of procurement offences {{as part of its}} mandate. In addition, the National Council of Public Procurement NCPP be established and allow to play its role thus limiting the influences of project awards at the ministry level and at the procurement entity level as well...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic Day Treatment (TDT) is a {{community-based}} {{mental health}} treatment program regulated and funded by the Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) in the Commonwealth of Virginia. This case study sought to understand how DMAS regulatory changes impacted {{the implementation of the}} TDT program in the Commonwealth between fiscal years 2004 and 2011. In an effort to respond to this question, sources of qualitative and quantitative data were collected including: TDT fee-for-service data, regulations in the Community Mental Health and Rehabilitative Services <b>manual</b> <b>guiding</b> the implementation of the TDT program, and structured interviews with eight key stakeholders who interface with the TDT program. The fee-for-services analysis found that there was a 269 % increase in fee-for-service expenditures between fiscal years 2007 and 2011. The analysis of the regulations found DMAS added language to provide greater clarity to the existing regulators. Some of these changes include the implementation of the PA process with KePRO as well as the VICAP process. Additionally, staff requirements changed and paraprofessionals were no longer able to provide TDT programming. Caseload limits were also set for TDT programming. Four themes emerged through the analysis of the structured interviews. These themes include: 1) fraudulent practices and misuse of TDT services, 2) regulatory oversight, 3) cost containment, and 4) evaluation. Implications focused on the areas of policy, practice, and research by suggesting further research studies focusing on TDT and policy, offering the foundation of a more comprehensive theory focusing on policy implementation, and lastly the researcher provided a logic model for the TDT program in an effort to propel evaluation research forward...|$|E
