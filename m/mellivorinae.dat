50|$|The {{honey badger}} {{is the only}} species of the genus Mellivora. Although in the 1860s it was {{assigned}} to the badger subfamily, the Melinae, it is now generally agreed that it bears very few similarities to the Melinae. It is much more closely related to the marten subfamily, Mustelinae, but furthermore is assigned its own subfamily, <b>Mellivorinae.</b> Differences between <b>Mellivorinae</b> and Melinae include differences in their dentition formulae. Though not in the same subfamily as the wolverines, which are a genus of large-sized and atypical Mustelinae, the honey badger can be regarded as another, analogous, form of outsized weasel or polecat.|$|E
50|$|The American badger is {{a member}} of the Mustelidae, a diverse family of {{carnivorous}} mammals that also includes the weasel, otter, ferret, and wolverine. The American badger belongs to the Taxidiinae, one of three subfamilies of badgers - the other two being the Melinae (9 species, including the Eurasian badger) and the <b>Mellivorinae</b> (honey badger). The American badger's closest relative is the prehistoric Chamitataxus.|$|E
50|$|Badgers are short-legged omnivores in {{the family}} Mustelidae, which also {{includes}} the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), <b>Mellivorinae</b> (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.|$|E
5000|$|The {{honey badger}} (Mellivora capensis), {{also known as}} the ratel ( [...] or [...] ),is the only species in the {{mustelid}} subfamily <b>Mellivorinae</b> and its only genus Mellivora. It is native to Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Despite its name, the honey badger does not closely resemble other badger species; instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to weasels. It is classed as Least Concern rather than a threatened species by the IUCN owing to its extensive range and general environmental adaptations. It is primarily a carnivorous species and has few natural predators because of its thick skin and ferocious defensive abilities.|$|E
50|$|The genus Megalictis {{was first}} {{described}} by W. D. Matthew in 1907, and {{assigned to the}} family Mustelidae. Two similar genera discovered at the same time, Aelurocyon (Peterson, 1907) and Paroligobunis (Peterson, 1910) were identified as synonymous with Megalictis in 1996 though Paroligobunis was re-established as a separate genus in 1998. P. R. Bjork, in 1970, assigned the genus to the subfamily <b>Mellivorinae,</b> whilst J. A. Baskin reassigned it to Oligobuninae in 1998. Three species {{have been identified in}} the genus: M. ferox, M. petersoni, and M. frazieri, whilst two more, Megalictis brevifacies and Megalictis simplicidens, have since been determined to be synonymous with M. ferox. Other synonyms of M. ferox include Aelurocyon brevifacies, Brachypsalis simplicidens and Paroligobunis simplicidens.|$|E
40|$|Calcanea of {{one species}} of the <b>Mellivorinae,</b> four (four genera) of the Melinae, five (three genera) of the Mephitinae and eight (four genera) of the Lutrinae are {{described}} and compared. Members of the <b>Mellivorinae</b> lack or have a minute anterior articular surface; those of the Melinae have a distinct anterior surface, broadly joined to the medial articular surface. Calcanea of the Mephitinae are similar to each other, {{more so than the}} calcanea of members of other subfamilies in the Mustelidae. In the Lutrinae, the trochlear process is often hooked distally...|$|E
40|$|Mustelids (Mustelidae) {{exhibit a}} wide {{morphological}} and ecological diversity, ranging from aquatic to semi arboreal and fossorial forms. It {{is the most}} diversity family in Carnivora, and this has promoted {{a great number of}} taxonomic arrangements for subfamilies, which can range from two to 15 depending on the author. The relatively recent use of molecular data has helped to elucidate the classification of mustelids, and eight subfamilies are currently recognized: Mustelinae, Galictinae, Helictidinae, Martinae, Melinae, <b>Mellivorinae,</b> Taxidiinae and Lutrinae. However, some of these subfamilies have nomenclatural problems, not receiving the oldest available name. The subfamily that includes martens (Martes, Charronia and Pekania), tayra (Eira) and wolverine (Gulo) has received the name of Martinae Wagner, 1841, but the oldest available name is Guloninae Gray, 1825. This problem also occurs for the subfamily that includes the grisons (Galictis), Patagonian weasel (Lyncodon), marbled polecat (Vormela) and striped weasels (Ictonyx and Poecilogale), which are known as Grisoninae Pocock, 1921, but the correct name for this group is Ictonychinae, Pocock, 1921. The subfamily that includes ferret badgers (Melogale) retains the name Helictidinae Gray, 1865, because its validity is not affected when the type-genus of the subfamily becomes a junior synonym of another genus. Furthermore, a list of the extant subfamilies of Mustelidae and their respective synonyms and included genera is provided...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} a concatenated (8492 bp) nuclear-mitochondrial DNA {{data set}} from 44 musteloids (including the first genetic data for Lyncodon patagonicus) with parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods of phylogenetic and biogeographic inference and two Bayesian methods of chronological inference. Here {{we show that}} Musteloidea emerged approximately 32. 4 - 30. 9 million years ago (MYA) in Asia, shortly after the greenhouse-icehouse global climate shift at the Eocene-Oligocene transition. During their Oligocene radiation, which proceeded wholly or mostly in Asia, musteloids diversified into four primary divisions: the Mephitidae lineage separated first, succeeded by Ailuridae and the divergence of the Procyonidae and Mustelidae lineages. Mustelidae arose approximately 16. 1 MYA within the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, and extensively diversified in the Miocene, mostly in Asia. The early offshoots of this radiation largely evolved into badger and marten ecological niches (Taxidiinae, Melinae, <b>Mellivorinae,</b> Guloninae, and Helictidinae), whereas the later divergences have adapted to other niches including those of weasels, polecats, minks, and otters (Mustelinae, Ictonychinae, and Lutrinae). Notably, and contrary to traditional beliefs, the morphological adaptations of badgers, martens, weasels, polecats, and minks each evolved independently more than once within Mustelidae. Ictonychinae (which is most closely related to Lutrinae) arose approximately 9. 5 - 8. 9 MYA, most likely in Asia, where it diverged into the Old World Ictonychini (Vormela, Poecilictis, Ictonyx, and Poecilogale) and New World Lyncodontini (Lyncodon and Galictis) lineages. Ictonychini presumably entered Africa during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (at the Miocene-Pliocene transition), which interposed the origins of this clade (approximately 6. 5 - 6. 0 MYA) and its African Poecilictis-Ictonyx-Poecilogale subclade (approximately 4. 8 - 4. 5 MYA). Lyncodontini originated approximately 2. 9 - 2. 6 MYA at the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition in South America, slightly after {{the emergence of the}} Panamanian land bridge that provided for the Great American Biotic Interchange. As the genera Martes and Ictonyx (as currently circumscribed) are paraphyletic with respect to the genera Gulo and Poecilogale, respectively, we propose that Pekania and Poecilictis be treated as valid genera and that "Martes" pennanti and "Ictonyx" libyca, respectively, be assigned to these genera...|$|E
