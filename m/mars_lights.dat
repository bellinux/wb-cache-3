50|$|<b>Mars</b> <b>lights</b> were {{developed}} by Jerry Kennelly, a Chicago firefighter who realized that oscillating lamps would benefit fire departments and railroads. He performed an operational test with the C&NW railroad in 1936, and <b>Mars</b> <b>Lights</b> began appearing on locomotives in the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mars</b> <b>Lights</b> are signal-safety lights {{used in the}} United States {{and built}} by Mars Signal Light Company for {{railroad}} locomotives and firefighting apparatus. <b>Mars</b> <b>Lights</b> {{used a variety of}} means to cause the light to oscillate vertically, horizontally, or both, to catch the attention of motorists and pedestrians.|$|E
50|$|Many railroads used <b>Mars</b> <b>lights</b> on {{a variety}} of locomotives, both steam and Diesel. <b>Mars</b> <b>Lights</b> are no longer used by railways, having been {{replaced}} by ditch lights, with the exception of some passenger carriers, such as Chicago's Metra. They are still used on fire fighting apparatus, and are available from Tri Lite / Mars, located in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the GS-3, the GS-4 had a dual-{{headlight}} casing (top headlight was a <b>mars</b> <b>light)</b> on {{the silver}} smokebox. Another change was the all-weather cab. It retained the skyline casing atop of the boiler, skirting on the sides, an air horn to supplement the whistle and teardrop classification lights. They carried the orange and red [...] "Daylight" [...] paint scheme.|$|R
5000|$|The GS-5s are {{identical}} in appearance to the GS-4s, {{the only difference}} being the roller bearings that gave the locomotive a smoother ride and added weight. 4458 had roller bearings from the Timken Company and 4459 used SKF brand roller bearings. They had a silver smokebox with a dual-headlight casing (top headlight was a <b>mars</b> <b>light),</b> and an enclosed, all-weather cab. It retained the skyline casing {{on the top of}} the boiler, skirting on the sides, an air horn (for use at speeds due to being louder than the whistle which was rarely if ever used on the main line) and teardrop classification lights. They received the orange and red [...] "Daylight" [...] paint scheme. The GS-5's were designed for high-speed passenger service on Southern Pacific's premier passenger trains, the Coast Daylight, San Joaquin Daylight and Sunset Limited. In later years they were painted black and had their side skirting removed for easier maintenance. The GS-5s were considered the best of the GS series and ended their careers on Southern Pacific's San Joaquin Valley line.|$|R
60|$|The poem {{from which}} we take this stanza is remarkably vigorous, and the only {{consolation}} that we can offer to the timid and the Tories is {{that as long as}} so much strength is employed in blowing the trumpet, the sword, so far as Miss Nesbit is concerned, will probably remain sheathed. Personally, and looking at the matter from a purely artistic point of view, we prefer Miss Nesbit's gentler moments. Her eye for Nature is peculiarly keen. She has always an exquisite sense of colour and sometimes a most delicate ear for music. Many of her poems, such as The Moat House, Absolution, and The Singing of the Magnificat are true works of art, and Vies Manquees is a little gem of song, with its dainty dancing measure, its delicate and wilful fancy and the sharp poignant note of passion that suddenly strikes across it, <b>marring</b> its <b>light</b> laughter and lending its beauty a terrible and tragic meaning.|$|R
50|$|The Los Angeles Fire Department {{required}} <b>Mars</b> <b>lights</b> as {{a standard}} LACoFD warning device until the Federal Sign & Signal BeaconRay was adopted as a replacement.|$|E
5000|$|Tri Lite, Inc. {{announced}} their {{acquisition of the}} Mars Signal Light Company, effective January 23, 1991. Tri Lite still manufactures many of the traditional <b>Mars</b> <b>Lights</b> under the Tri Lite Mars brand. The company has updated the Mars [...] "888" [...] Traffic Breaker with energy-efficient light-emitting diodes replacing the earlier halogen incandescent bulbs.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were many}} models of <b>Mars</b> <b>Lights,</b> which used several methods to {{oscillate}} the beam. Sometimes the bulb and assembly were moved, other times a reflector behind {{the light was}} rotated. The beam was usually oscillated in a triple eight pattern, i.e., the beam would oscillate up and down two or more times for every horizontal sweep, providing a source for the company slogan, [...] "The Light from Mars". The beams came {{in a variety of}} shapes and colors, some locomotives having red and white lights.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{description of}} coloration {{of a live}} specimen (not in alcohol) uses Robert Ridgway's Color Standards and Color Nomenclature (1912). Dorsally Virginia valeriae is benzo brown, deep brownish drab, <b>mars</b> brown, or <b>light</b> brownish drab. The first row of dorsal scales is colored like the adjacent ventrals, which are light vinaceous-fawn, pale vinaceous-fawn, pale grayish vinaceous, or pale vinaceous-pink. The {{top of the head}} is hair brown or like the dorsum, with many dark spots on the plates. The upper labials are ecru-drab or lighter, some with drab-gray spots. There is a small black ring around the eye. The ventral surface of the head is white.|$|R
5000|$|Amtrak {{took over}} {{passenger}} rail operations in 1971, serving Pasadena with trains {{such as the}} Southwest Chief, Las Vegas Limited, and Desert Wind. On January 15, 1994, the final Southwest Chief train arrived in Pasadena. ATSF sold the line between Los Angeles and San Bernardino via Pasadena (known as the [...] "second division"). (Now the Southwest Chief operates over the transcon via Fullerton.) The LACMTA Gold Line still uses the same right-of-way (although different tracks) as the Santa Fe. The old depot is still visible at the Del <b>Mar</b> station. Electrified <b>Light</b> Rail was the preferred alternative to Metrolink or similar style service because the city of Pasadena did not like or want diesel locomotives traversing the city. The construction of the Gold Line also allowed {{the closure of the}} former railroad crossing along Colorado Boulevard which meant that motorists and the Rose Parade would no longer be hindered by trains.|$|R
5000|$|Retro Slashers wrote, [...] "The {{film has}} heart. Sure, it's {{a kind of}} mindless and {{confused}} heart, but the acting is decent and there's a real feeling that the filmmakers were shooting for something".

It's bad to the very core; but if you are in just the right mood and you're an aficionado of cheese then you might get a few kicks out of this fetid stinker". Film Bizarro deemed the film an obnoxious mess that was filled with annoying and stupid characters, awful attempts at comedy, poorly done gore, and a complete lack of originality or successful horror.

50|$|When {{the merger}} officially took effect on January 1, 1983, all former {{reporting}} marks {{were to be}} either removed or patched with SBD initials. Shortly before taking delivery of the L&N specified EMD SD50's, Seaboard adopted a Swis721 type font for reporting marks and numbers, instead of the customized Seaboard Coast Line lettering seen on pre-1983 repaints. To simplify its locomotive roster and meet Chessie System specifications, Seaboard introduced a numbering system that partially became meshed within the Chessie System locomotive fleet, and removed any existing <b>Mars</b> <b>Lights</b> or Gyralights from locomotives. Any new locomotives purchased by Seaboard would be built to meet Chessie specifications; of which only three, EMD SD50, EMD MP15T and GE B36-7, were ordered.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, {{with its}} {{contract}} with Norfolk Southern expired, the 765 appeared at a festival in the Chicago suburb of Franklin Park, Illinois, on Saturday, June 11, and, the following day, lead an excursion train, the Varsity, {{named in honor}} of a Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad train, which connected Chicago and Madison, WI, between the North Glenview Metra station, and Janesville, WI, with a stop in Fox Lake. Later in the month, on June 25 and 26, the 765 was slated to pull its first excursion with Amtrak, the Galesburg Zephyr, over BNSF Railway trackage between Chicago Union Station and Galesburg, Illinois, with a stop at the Naperville Amtrak and Metra station, an event which was cancelled on short notice, apparently due to insufficient ticket sales, however, FWRHS has announced it intends to return to Chicagoland in 2017. It has since been announced that the 765 will be operating at the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad on September 17, 18, 24, and 25, running two trips per day. In September, 765 was renumbered to match her sister 767, also having a Mars light applied. To clarify, the S-2's were not delivered with <b>Mars</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
40|$|Please {{read the}} {{instructions}} completely, and acquaint yourself {{with all the}} drawings. Inventory the parts. Besides the shells, chassis, motor, frame, and power truck, locate the following: side and rear glazing sheets, truck frames, decal sheet, photo-etched sheet, front and rear lenses, and one bag each of wheels, screws, metal parts, plastic parts, and electrical connectors. If you find any part unsatisfactory, or if you damage any part during assembly, please return it directly to FINE N-SCALE. We will repair or replace it at no charge. If you are doing a later version, we have mars light castings and unshrouded truck frames available. Simply write and ask for the <b>mars</b> <b>lights,</b> and return the shrouded trucks to us. We will send the unshrouded replacements at no charge. We suggest using Pacer's PLASTI-ZAP for assembly. Use sparingly, applying it with a sharpened piece of styrene or toothpick. Trial fit parts before assembly, and above all, BE PATIENT! No extraordinary skills are necessary to build this kit, but patience will be your best helper. Motor Assembly. Clip the coupler pocket off the power truck assembly and trim the side frames per the diagram. (Do not trim the sideframes if you are building an unshrouded, 1954 or later version) Trim out the rear mounting holes on the metal side frames. Press the large styrene spacer on the geared end of the motor. Complete the motor assembly per the diagram, making sure the white dot on the motor is up, the traction tire is on the front axle, and the spacers between the frames don't interfere with the gear or motor shaft.

40|$|A {{distinct}} {{feature of}} human evolution is the settlement pattern. It stands testimony to progress, especially, the urban settlement. At present, globalization {{is what has}} drastically {{changed the face of}} our urban settlements. Communication has become easier, competition in the market has increased, employment demand and commute has escalated, not to mention the ever increasing pressure on urban infrastructure. All this has had direct impact on the urban aesthetics and if we stop and observe awhile, we can definitely say the picture is not a pretty one. India is a developing country, gradually making her way to emerge as a Superpower. In the last sixty-odd years, we {{have come a long way}} from telegraph poles to cell phone towers on buildings. Palatial bungalows made way for high vertical housing, densely built. The rivers now resemble a steady flow of toxic fluid with filth on the banks. Tree lined avenues have disappeared with traffic clogged roads in their place. The cityline is not picturesque anymore with unsightly banners and neon <b>lights</b> <b>marring</b> the view.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a modular design {{approach that is}} used in developing several research platforms for space engineering research at York University. We briefly describe three distinct research projects for space science and engineering research: a 6 kg micro-rover under development for the Northern <b>Light</b> <b>mars</b> lander mission, a 50 kg rover built by the York University Rover Team {{to compete in the}} annual University Rover Challenge, and a 1 U CubeSat design for nanosatellite technology development research. All three research projects share a design philosophy to achieve modularity, efficiency, robustness and simplicity by adopting a common embedded hardware configuration using COTS hardware and a simple control topology. An on-board computer board stack based on a PC/ 104 or similar form-factor provides centralized control using an ARM microcontroller. Payloads and application-specific components are added using robust SPI, synchronous serial, and RS- 485 interfaces, with provision made for ethernet and USB connectivity when needed. The software for this system is is based on open-source compilers and operating systems and is also modular in nature, using a portable base station GUI, wireless mesh networking between different systems, and JAUS messaging for flexible component-level communications. The proposed design approach allows sharing of resources while optimizing design features with cost-effective, readily-available commercial components for complex research projects...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar, por meio de estudo espectrofotomÃ©trico, o poder de filtraÃ§Ã£o da radiaÃ§Ã£o ultravioleta A (UVA) e B (UVB) e transmitÃ¢ncia da luz visÃ­vel em lentes incolores de visÃ£o simples. MÃTODOS: AnÃ¡lise espectrofotomÃ©trica (espectrofotÃ´metro modelo Humphrey Lens Analyzer LA 360) de 14 tipos de lentes oftÃ¡lmicas incolores, confeccionadas em {{material}} orgÃ¢nico de diferentes caracterÃ­sticas. Cada tipo de lente foi representado por 20 exemplares, totalizando amostra de 280 lentes estudadas. Posteriormente procedeu-se a anÃ¡lise da curva de transmitÃ¢ncia na faixa do espectro entre 290 e 700 nm. RESULTADOS: Em relaÃ§Ã£o Ã  radiaÃ§Ã£o UVB, todas as lentes estudadas apresentaram transmitÃ¢ncia de 0 a 1 %. Tiveram melhor desempenho (0 % de transmitÃ¢ncia) : Trivex, Rugged Fashion Wear, AO Lite, Hard Resin, Sola <b>Light</b> 1. 56, <b>MAR</b> 1. 56, MAR CR 39, Stylis Crizal, Crizal, AirWear e Orma 15. Quanto Ã  radiaÃ§Ã£o UVA a transmitÃ¢ncia oscilou de 1 a 18 %. Tiveram melhor desempenho (transmitÃ¢ncia de 1 %) : Miolight anti-reflexo 1. 56, Trivex, Miolight Excellence, Rugged Fashion Wear, Sola <b>Light,</b> <b>MAR</b> 1. 56, Stylis Crizal e Air Wear. Nenhuma das lentes estudadas filtrou completamente a radiaÃ§Ã£o UVA. Todas as lentes estudadas apresentaram transmitÃ¢ncia superior a 95 % em relaÃ§Ã£o ao espectro visÃ­vel, havendo variaÃ§Ã£o de 95 a 100 %. CONCLUSÃES: Todas as lentes estudadas apresentaram poder de filtraÃ§Ã£o UVB de 99 a 100 %, UVA de 82 a 99 % e 95 a 100 % de transmitÃ¢ncia da luz visÃ­vel. A presenÃ§a de tais filtros em lentes incolores amplia as possibilidades de prescriÃ§Ã£o deste recurso de proteÃ§Ã£o ocular. PURPOSE: To verify, by spectrophotometric study, the filtration {{power of}} A and B ultraviolet radiation and transmittance of visible light in colorless lenses of simple vision. METHODS: Spectrophotometric analysis (Model Humphrey Lens Analyzer LA 360 spectrophotometer) of 14 types of colorless ophthalmic lenses, made of organic material of different characteristics. Each lens type {{was represented by}} 20 copies, totaling a sample of 280 studied lenses. Later, {{the analysis of the}} transmittance curve in the spectrum range of 290 to 700 nm was performed. RESULTS: In relation to UVB radiation, all of the studied lenses presented transmittance from 0 to 1 %. The ones that had a better performance (0 % transmittance) were: Trivex, Rugged Fashion Wear, AO Lite, Hard Resin, Sola <b>Light</b> 1. 56, <b>MAR</b> 1. 56, MAR CR 39, Stylis Crizal, Crizal, Air Wear, Orma 15. As for UVA rays, the transmittance oscillated from 1 to 18 %. The ones that had a better performance (1 % transmittance) were: Miolight Anti Reflex 1. 56, Trivex, Miolight Excellence, Rugged Fashion Wear, Sola <b>Light,</b> <b>MAR</b> 1. 56, Stylis Crizal e Air Wear. None of studied lenses completely filtered UVA radiation. All of the studied lenses presented transmittance over 95 % in relation to the visible spectrum, with a variation from 95 to 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: The studied colorless lenses present a real capacity of filtration of UV radiation, especially regarding the UVB spectrum, which is favorable since this is the main portion of the spectrum related to ocular damages. All of the studied lenses presented UVB filtration power from 99 to 100 %, UVA from 82 to 99 % and 95 to 100 % of transmittance of visible light. The presence of such filters in colorless lenses increases the possibilities of prescription of this resource of ocular protection...|$|R
60|$|Imagine a room {{two hundred}} {{feet long and}} proportionably broad. Its floor is mosaic, wrought into the loveliest patterns. Its sides are {{decorated}} with immense pillars of variegated marble, the recesses formed by which are occupied by statues, all arranged in exquisite variety of attitude, so as {{to appear to be}} offering to whoever approaches them the rare flowers which it is the duty of the attendants to place in their hands. The ceiling is painted in fresco, in patterns and colours harmonising with those on the mosaic floor. The cornices are of silver, and decorated with mottoes from the amatory poets of the day, the letters of which are formed by precious stones. In {{the middle of the room}} is a fountain throwing up streams of perfumed water, and surrounded by golden aviaries containing birds of all sizes and nations. Three large windows, placed at the eastern extremity of the apartment, look out upon the Adriatic, but are covered at this hour, from the outside, with silk curtains of a delicate green shade, which cast a soft, luxurious light over every object, but are so thinly woven and so skilfully arranged that the slightest breath of air which moves without finds its way immediately to the languid occupants of the Court waiting-room. The number of these individuals amounts to about fifty or sixty persons. By far the larger half of the assemblage are women. Their black hair tastefully braided into various forms, and adorned with flowers or precious stones, contrasts elegantly with the brilliant whiteness of the robes in which they are for the most part clothed. Some of them are occupied in listlessly watching the movements of the birds in the aviaries; others hold a languid and whispered conversation with such of the courtiers as happen to be placed near them. The men exhibit in their dresses a greater variety of colour, and in their occupations a greater fertility of resource, than the women. Their garments, of the lightest rose, violet, or yellow tints, diversify fantastically the monotonous white robes of their gentle companions. Of their employments, the most conspicuous are playing on the lute, gaming with dice, teasing their lapdogs, and insulting their parasites. Whatever their occupation, it is performed with little attention, and less enthusiasm. Some recline on their couches with closed eyes, as if the heat made the labour of using their organs of vision too much for them; others, in the midst of a conversation, suddenly leave a sentence unfinished, apparently incapacitated by lassitude from giving expression to the simplest ideas. Every sight in the apartment that attracts the eye, every sound that gains the ear, expresses a luxurious repose. No brilliant <b>light</b> <b>mars</b> the pervading softness of the atmosphere; no violent colour materialises the light, ethereal hues of the dresses; no sudden noises interrupt the fitful and plaintive notes of the lute, jar with the soft twittering of the birds in the aviaries, or drown the still, regular melody of the ladies' voices. All objects, animate and inanimate, are in harmony with each other. It is a scene of spiritualised indolence--a picture of dreamy beatitude in the inmost sanctuary of unruffled repose.|$|R
