The unemployment rate increased from a low of 1.7% in June 2000 to a peak of 4.4% in December 2009. The unemployment rate decreased to 3.2% in 2014 without further decrease in 2015 and 2016. Population growth from net immigration is quite high, at 0.52% of population in 2004. The foreign citizen population was 21.8% in 2004, about the same as in Australia. GDP per hour worked is the world's 16th highest, at 49.46 international dollars in 2012.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the balls}} {{have not had}} their {{discovery}} site recorded and most are found {{as a result of}} agricultural activity.

25|$|The first notable, and {{historically}} important, book credited to a Bermudian was The History of Mary Prince, a slave narrative by Mary Prince.

Ernest Graham Ingham, an expatriate author, published his books {{at the turn of the}} 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider <b>market</b> <b>than</b> Bermuda.

25|$|Branyan {{rejected}} a one-year {{offer from the}} Mariners on November 10. He stated {{that the reason for}} the decline was because he wanted a contract that lasted for more than one year, possibly a two or three-year contract. Branyan also stated that he still wanted to return to Seattle, but would rather test the free agent <b>market</b> <b>than</b> settle for anything less than a two-year contract. On January 7, 2010, the Seattle Mariners traded infielder Bill Hall for first baseman Casey Kotchman. For Branyan, this meant it was unlikely the Mariners would offer him a new contract as Kotchman would be the likely candidate for the starting job at first base, vacated by Branyan. On February 2, 2010, ESPN.com reported that the Florida Marlins had offered a one-year contract to Branyan. On February 5, a conflicting report stated that the Marlins had not offered Branyan a contract. On February 9, Foxsports.com reported that Branyan has drawn interest from both the Cleveland Indians, and the Toronto Blue Jays. Joe Frisaro, writer for MLB.com, reported on February 13, that the Marlins were not interested in signing Branyan. It was reported by Foxsports.com on February 16, that the Tampa Bay Rays, the Boston Red Sox, and the Cleveland Indians were interested in signing Branyan. That day, the Indians offered Branyan a one-year major league contract, according to MLB.com. On February 17, it was reported by Foxsports.com that the Red Sox were no longer interested in Branyan.|$|E
25|$|Attempts at border-blasting were {{somewhat}} more common {{on the other}} side of the border, where smaller markets in the United States could find lucrative larger markets in Canada within their broadcast range. WIVB-TV, prior to the digital television transition, could be seen as a U.S. border blaster into Canada (as Western New York is a smaller <b>market</b> <b>than</b> Southern Ontario, which boasts the major world city of Toronto); it operated with 100,000 watts of power on the VHF low band (channel 4), even after the Federal Communications Commission reduced the maximum allowed power for that band to 80,000 watts. (WIVB did not make significant attempts to reach the Canadian market, although rival station WKBW-TV did.) Another famous U.S.-based border blaster into Canada was KCND-TV in Pembina, North Dakota; Pembina was a small border town of less than 1,000 residents, which normally would be far too small of a market to support a television station, but spent its fifteen-year existence targeting Winnipeg, a much larger city sixty miles north of Pembina. Likewise, the small market of Burlington, Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York found it could reach a larger audience in Montreal. Canadian regulators put in simultaneous substitution requirements to prevent losing revenue to these American border-blasters (this forced KCND's owners to sell the station to Canadian interests, who transformed the station into modern-day Winnipeg, Manitoba-based CKND-TV; Burlington station WFFF-TV entered into a famous cross-border scheduling feud over the simsub problems, while WKBW competed mainly by focusing on its unique brand of local news, which could not be simsubbed).|$|E
500|$|The studio New Line Cinema {{released}} Surf Ninjas {{two weeks}} earlier than its commercial release date in Evansville, Indiana and Lubbock, Texas {{as part of a}} test of regional markets. The early release marked {{the first time that a}} major film was released in Evansville before its national opening without any local ties. The president of theatrical marketing at New Line, Chris Pula, selected Evansville for its family-oriented audiences. Pula explained: [...] "Evansville is traditionally a strong family market. Also, we have a strong relationship with the exhibitors in that area". The president said that the studio was testing the film in a larger <b>market</b> <b>than</b> usual due to its uncertainty about the film's reception, and that the studio would measure its marketing success with ticket receipts.|$|E

500|$|The {{combat and}} action {{elements}} of Nier {{were inspired by}} the God of War series of games, which both Taro and Saito enjoyed. While the games had not been as popular in Japan as in North America, the two felt {{that the idea of}} having boss fights with different combat styles than the regular battles was an idea that would appeal to players in both regions. The changing styles, as well as the occasional changes in camera angle and movement, were meant to [...] "accentuate [...] gap between real, modern scenery and the fantasy world" [...] as a tie-in to the game's story. The game was meant to appeal to older players; it was intended as an action-RPG for an older <b>market</b> <b>than</b> Square Enix's action-RPG series Kingdom Hearts. This influenced the decision to have a main character in his 30s, as well as more blood and swearing than typical in a Square Enix RPG. The fusion of different gameplay styles was included as a homage to earlier gameplay styles and genres.|$|E
