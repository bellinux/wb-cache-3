500|$|In an {{interview}} with Locus, Clarke explains why and how she integrated the theme of [...] "Englishness" [...] into Jonathan Strange: [...] "I wanted to explore my ideas of the fantastic, {{as well as my}} ideas of England and my attachment to English landscape....Sometimes it feels to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we don't have a fable of England, of Britain, something strong and idealized and romantic. I was picking up on things like Chesterton and Conan Doyle, and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) of what it was to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place". In particular, [...] "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible {{about the rest of the}} world", which connects Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.|$|E
500|$|... "What'd I Say" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists in many {{different}} styles. Elvis Presley used the song in a large dance scene in his 1964 film Viva Las Vegas and released it as a single with the title song on the B-side. It became a gold record. Cliff Richard, Eric Clapton with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, the Big Three, Eddie Cochran, Bobby Darin, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Nancy Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Trini Lopez, Roy Orbison, Bo Diddley, Johnny Cash and June Carter, Rare Earth and The Ronettes all put their own style on the song. [...] Checkmates, Ltd. released {{a version of the}} song as part of a medley on their 1967 debut album, Live! At Caesar's Palace. [...] Jerry Lee Lewis found particular success with his rendition in 1961, which peaked at number 30 and spent eight weeks on the charts. Charles noticed, later writing [...] "I saw that many of the stations which had banned the tune started playing it when it was covered by white artists. That seemed strange to <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> white sex was cleaner than black sex. But once they began playing the white version, they lifted the ban and also played the original." [...] In 2001 the italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari sampled part of the melody for his song Porca l'oca, included in the album Shake.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Swedish actor Lars Ekborg, outside Sweden most {{known for}} his part in Ingmar Bergman's [...] "Summer with Monika" [...] made an album called [...] "I Tom Lehrers vackra värld" [...] ("In the {{beautiful}} world of Tom Lehrer"), with 12 of Lehrer's songs interpreted in Swedish. Lehrer {{wrote in a letter to}} the producer Per–Anders Boquist that [...] "not knowing any Swedish, I am obviously not equipped to judge, but it sounds to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Mr Ekborg is perfect for the songs", along with further compliments to pianist Leif Asp for unexpected additional flourishes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good, good! Oh, you so clever lady!" [...] said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, as he stooped {{and kissed}} her hand. A moment later he said to <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> calmly <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we had been having a sick room consultation, [...] "Seventy-two only, and in all this excitement. I have hope." ...|$|R
60|$|Surprised, and {{a little}} uncomfortable at this {{evidence}} of intuition, I started to protest. It seemed to <b>me</b> then <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I had always wanted her.|$|R
2500|$|There is a {{fish that}} is still unmentioned, which it is {{scarcely}} advisable to speak about on account of its size, because it will seem to most people incredible. There are only a very few who can speak upon it clearly, because it is seldom near land nor appears where it may be seen by fishermen, and I suppose {{there are not many}} of this sort of fish in the sea. Most often in our tongue we call it hafgufa ("kraken" [...] in e.g. Laurence M. Larson's translation). Nor can I conclusively speak about its length in ells, because the times he has shown before men, he has appeared more like land than like a fish. Neither have I heard that one had been caught or found dead; and it seems to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there must be no more than two in the oceans, and I deem that each is unable to reproduce itself, for I believe that they are always the same ones. Then too, neither would it do for other fish if the hafgufa were of such a number as other whales, on account of their vastness, and how much subsistence that they need. It {{is said to be the}} nature of these fish that when one shall desire to eat, then it stretches up its neck with a great belching, and following this belching comes forth much food, so that all kinds of fish that are near to hand will come to present location, then will gather together, both small and large, believing they shall obtain their food and good eating; but this great fish lets its mouth stand open the while, and the gap is no less wide than that of a great sound or bight, And nor the fish avoid running together there in their great numbers. But as soon as its stomach and mouth is full, then it locks together its jaws and has the fish all caught and enclosed, that before greedily came there looking for food.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not alarmed, exactly," [...] {{said the}} troop-horse, [...] "but it made <b>me</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I had hornets where my saddle ought to be. Don't begin again." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a query in her voice, and {{she faced}} <b>me</b> accusingly, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I {{were guilty of}} the deed, {{or at least a}} party to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were there}} three nights last week. What's more, {{you tried to}} draw your next month's wages. That struck <b>me</b> <b>as</b> significant, <b>though</b> I'd {{fortunately}} provided against it." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> in reproach at the levity of my question.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> in surprise. Her eyes {{were like the}} eyes of a child.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> asking for {{confirmation}} of her views. I shook my head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was frightened}} before. Now----You make <b>me</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> someone {{had put the}} wheel of a motor car in my hand, started it and told me to steer...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anderson, can {{you tell}} us how many tons of steel rails they turn out at Liege every week? Sir Thomas asks <b>me,</b> just <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were the {{simplest}} question in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He lifted <b>me</b> up <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I {{had been}} a feather," [...] responded the girl. [...] "He just put his arm round my waist and had me on my feet before I knew where I was." ...|$|R
60|$|He watched <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{reading my}} thoughts. That {{he was indeed}} doing so I very quickly discovered.|$|E
60|$|The two women, who {{had risen}} from their knees, stared at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they saw a ghost.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned to}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> in protest, but my face gave her no encouragement. She rose wearily to her feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure," [...] said Mr. Washington. He studied <b>me</b> awhile <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{weighing}} my judgment, {{and went}} on: [...] "Needless to say, Richard, {{that such a}} service, if it comes, will not be that of his Majesty." ...|$|R
60|$|From then on {{his manner}} toward <b>me</b> changed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{he feared that}} he had been {{surprised}} into divulging his great secret, and I read suspicion and fear in his looks and thoughts, though his words were still fair.|$|R
6000|$|Sophia Antonovna got up {{and wished}} <b>me</b> good-bye, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she had not heard a word of my impious hope; but, in the very doorway, where I {{attended}} her, she turned round for an instant, and declared in a firm voice-- ...|$|R
60|$|No one moved. Instead, {{they stood}} in tense silence with their eyes {{fastened}} upon <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> waiting for a signal to attack.|$|E
60|$|Fanny, {{it looks}} to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we'd bitten off as big {{a piece of cake}} as we can chew with any comfort.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Greene's eyes, {{when she}} had done being hysterical, were terrible, and Sophonisba looked at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I were a convicted thief.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am getting}} on," [...] she answered, [...] "very well indeed. The Editor is {{beginning}} to say very nice things to me, and already the men treat <b>me</b> just <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I were a comrade! It is so nice of them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do not ask}} you," [...] he said, [...] "what {{country you}} represent. I {{think that it is}} not necessary. You have come to <b>me</b> rather <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I were a dictator. There are others besides myself with whom {{influence}} rests." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{shook hands}} with me long and tenderly, beaming on <b>me</b> the while <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{he had found a}} brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Falling in {{love and}} dogging my footsteps," [...] said Rosa, with relish, [...] "and {{standing}} there looking at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> you could eat me." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{yet such}} was the agony of my fear, {{that it seemed to}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I only crept along the ground like a tortoise.|$|E
60|$|She {{scarcely}} justified {{her last}} assertion, for {{her eyes were}} full of wonder, and she drew a little away from <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> in fear.|$|E
5000|$|I didn't {{know what}} to say, but I knew there was trouble coming. As Elvis held my arm, I could feel his hand shaking. It made <b>me</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> mine was shaking, too. And {{that was the last}} time I saw him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] she answered, [...] "and yet I {{have told}} you before how I feel about {{arriving}} in England. There seems something unfriendly in the very atmosphere, something which depresses me, which makes <b>me</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there were evil times coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh but {{the water}} loves me and folds me, Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks <b>me</b> <b>as</b> [...] <b>though</b> it were living blood, Blood of a heaving woman who holds me, Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely [...] good.|$|R
