40|$|INTRODUCTION In case of {{integrating}} free-space optical systems, surface mounting techniques are preferable for fixing non-transparent {{devices such as}} surface emitting LDs and reflection-type SLMs, while transparent devices such as transparent-type SLMs and isolators must be inserted into optical paths. Therefore, it is required to develop optical <b>mother</b> <b>boards</b> for integrating free-space optical systems, which are suitable for both non-transparent and transparent devices. It is considered that "Optical bus interconnection system (OBIS) [1, 2]", an optical <b>mother</b> <b>board</b> using Selfoc microlenses (SMLs), {{is one of the}} promising solutions. 2. PRINCIPLES Figure 1 shows the basic concept of OBIS. An optical <b>mother</b> <b>board</b> owning many optical I/Os on a glass substrate {{as well as in the}} substrate is composed of cascade arrays of SMLs and prisms. All the I/Os are basically conjugated each other, and as the result, two dimensional information generated at one of the I/Os is transferred into the othe...|$|R
