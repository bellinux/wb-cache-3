In the first mode, a wideband PA delivers a <b>medium</b> <b>output</b> power. This operational mode is particularly appropriate for ultra-wideband or multi-standard radio communication. In the second mode, a high power amplifier is turned on in order to deliver a high power signal within a sub-band for enhanced radar operation. This second mode allows both amplifiers to operate simultaneously {{in order to provide}} continuous service in sidebands. To demonstrate this concept, a network integrating a wideband <b>medium</b> <b>output</b> power PA and a narrowband high power PA is proposed. Both PA are based on low cost SiGe technology and optimized for maximum output power and Power Added Efficiency (PAE) in their operating frequency range. Simulated and measured results of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) demonstrator validate the concept. The proposed sub-system would be of a great interest for multifunctional radar and radio communication systems...|$|E

40|$|The rat {{nucleus accumbens}} {{contains}} acetylcholine-releasing interneurons, presumed {{to play a}} regulatory role in the electrical activity of <b>medium</b> spiny <b>output</b> neurons. In order to examine this issue in detail, we made electrophysiological recordings in rat nucleus accumbens slices. These experiments showed that γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition of the output neurons might be facilitated by activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, {{in addition to being}} suppressed via activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In contrast, glutamatergic excitation of output neurons appeared to be inhibited by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and to be insensitive to activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The spontaneous firing frequency of cholinergic neurons appeared to be under control of both a muscarinic and a nicotinic pathway in a bi-directional manner. Finally, we made paired recordings in which the functional connection between cholinergic neurons and output neurons was monitored. Driving the cholinergic neurons at physiological firing frequencies stimulated γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition of the output neurons, via activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The onset of this effect was slow and lacked a fixed delay. These data indicate that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in rat nucleus accumbens may mediate the facilitation of γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition of <b>medium</b> spiny <b>output</b> neurons.

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the possibility}} of few-cycle short bipolar optical pulse compression and their transformation to unipolar pulses due to coherent interaction with resonance absorbing medium. It is shown that single-cycle pulse compression occurs when each half-wave starts to behave as an independent unipolar soliton. These solitons are attracted to each other under certain conditions, {{that leads to the}} emergence of single-cycle pulse of shorter duration. Numerical simulations revealed 3 - 5 times reduction of the pulse duration. The substantial absence of light loss in this scheme gives the possibility to create a multistage passive system of three resonance absorbers and results in a 125 -time reduction of the pulse duration. Generation of unipolar pulses occurs when two powerful extremely short bipolar pulses propagate and collide in a dense resonant medium. In this case, as shown by numerical calculations, the mutual influence of oncoming solitons leads to the fact that some part of them is destroyed and another part is not. A high power unipolar soliton and low intensity bipolar optical ringing are observed in the <b>medium</b> <b>output...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{a plethora}} of {{applications}} has emerged that {{can take advantage of}} the mm – wave frequency band characteristics, i. e. high bandwidth, small form factor etc. Applications at mm-wave frequencies include smart sensors, single chip phased-arrays etc. For many years, III-V technologies were the main driving technologies for circuits operating at high frequencies. However, recent advances in silicon processes have enabled the use of BiCMOS and CMOS technologies as enablers for circuits and systems operating at mm-wave and sub-mm wave frequencies, i. e. frequencies above 100 GHz. Hence, high frequency and baseband electronics can be integrated in a single chip, thus reducing cost dramatically. The ultimate goal is to have silicon circuits operation at Terahertz frequencies. The need for power generation at high frequencies is fundamental for the successful implementation of any application. There is a variety of circuits providing power at frequencies below 100 GHz, namely oscillators and power amplifiers. Furthermore, lasers and other optoelectronic devices are capable of providing power above 10 THz. Hence, there is a gap in power generation between 100 GHz and THz that has to be filled in order for the applications to be accommodated. This thesis constitutes an effort towards the direction of understanding the challenges and limitation of power generation at frequencies above 100 GHz. Specifically active and passive device limitations are addressed and guidelines are given in order for the best performance possible to be achieved. The acquired knowledge is applied in the design of a <b>medium</b> <b>output</b> power PA at 135 GHz. Specifically, the PA achieves an - 1 dB compression point output power of 5 dBm and a saturated output power of 8 dBm along with a power gain of 17 dB.

This report provides results of the first phase (Phase I) of a study in which the primary objective is to measure emissions of organic pollutants and particulate matter from a selected set of office equipment typically used in residential and office environments. The specific aims of the overall research effort are: (1) use screening-level measurements to identify and quantify the concentrations of air pollutants of interest emitted by major categories of distributed office equipment in a controlled environment; (2) quantify the emissions of air pollutants from generally representative, individual machines within each of the major categories in a controlled chamber environment using well defined protocols; (3) characterize the effects of ageing and use on emissions for individual machines spanning several categories; (4) evaluate the importance of operational factors that can be manipulated to reduce pollutant emissions from office machines; and (5) explore the potential relationship between energy consumption and pollutant emissions for machines performing equivalent tasks. The study includes desktop computers (CPU units), computer monitors, and three categories of desktop printing devices. The printer categories are: (1) printers and multipurpose devices using color inkjet technology; (2) low- to <b>medium</b> <b>output</b> printers and multipurpose devices employing monochrome or color laser technology; and (3) high-output monochrome and color laser printers.

In addition, these screening level measurements indicate the potential relative importance of different categories of office equipment with respect to human exposures. The more detailed studies of the next phase of research (Phase II) are meant to characterize changes in emissions with time and may identify factors that can be modified to reduce emissions. These measurements may identify 'win-win' situations in which low energy consumption machines have lower pollutant emissions. This information will be used to compare machines to determine if some are substantially better than their peers with respect to their emissions of pollutants...|$|E
