40|$|A {{continuous}} top-k query retrieves the k most preferred {{objects in}} a data stream {{according to a}} given preference function. These queries are important for {{a broad spectrum of}} applications ranging from web-based advertising to financial analysis. In various streaming applications, a large number of such continuous top-k queries need to be executed simultaneously against a common popular input stream. To efficiently handle such top-k query workload, we present a comprehensive framework, called <b>MTopS.</b> Within this <b>MTopS</b> framework, several computational components work collaboratively to first analyze the commonalities across the workload; organize the workload for maximized sharing opportunities; execute the workload queries simultaneously in a shared manner; and output query results whenever any input query requires. In particular, <b>MTopS</b> supports two proposed algorithms, MTopBand and MTopList, which both incrementally maintain the top-k objects over time for multiple queries. As the foundation, we first identify the minimal object set from the data stream that is both necessary and sufficient for accurately answering all top-k queries in the workload. Then, the MTopBand algorithm is presented to incrementally maintain such minimum object set and eliminate the need for any recomputation from scratch. To further optimize MTop-Band, we design the second algorithm, MTopList which organizes the progressive top-k results of workload queries in a compact structure. MTopList is shown to be memory optimal and also more efficient in terms of CPU time usage than MTopBand. Our experimental study, using real data streams from domains of stock trades and moving object monitoring, demonstrates that both the efficiency and scalability of our proposed techniques are clearly superior to the state-of-the-art solutions...|$|E

(2) The PCPT data provide additional support for the use of finasteride in the management of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) /benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

The concept of BPH as a progressive disease helps to adopt new ap- proaches to patient evaluation and treatment. The disease progression, with respect to the risk of bladder function complications and alterations, to the progression of symptoms, and to the deterioration of the quality of life, leads to new ways of treating patients through a preventive as well as a symptomatic approach, thanks also to the identification of some pa- rameters associated with the risk of BPH progression, i. e. the prostate volume and the serum PSA. Furthermore, the concept of progression helps the clinician to identify different classes of BPH patients with different indications of medical treatment.

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted {{based on the results}} of a MEDLINE(R) search concentrating on the years 1999 - 2003. In combination with expert opinions recommendations were made on the usefulness of diagnostic tests, therapeutic options and follow-up. Results: During initial assessment the following tests are recommended: medical history, physical examination including digital-rectal examination, International Prostate Symptom Score, urinalysis, serum creatinine and prostate specific antigen measurement, uroflowmetry and post-void residual volume. All other tests are optional or not recommended. Aim of treatment is to improve LUTS and quality of life and to prevent severe BPE-related complications. Development of a 5 alpha-reductase type I and II inhibitor and the data of the <b>MTOPS</b> trial providing scientific evidence for a combination therapy were the most significant innovations since the first version.

40|$|Introduction: There is {{emerging}} evidence that prostatic inflammation {{may contribute to}} prostate growth either in terms of hyperplastic (BPH) or neoplastic (PC) changes. Inflammation is thought to incite carcinogenesis by causing cell and genome damage, promoting cellular turnover. Methods: We reviewed our personal experience and the international recent literature on the clinical data supporting a role of inflammation on BPH and PC growth and progression. Results: BPH: Among those patients with self-reported prostatitis, 57 % {{had a history of}} BPH. <b>MTOPS</b> study showed that men with inflammation had a significantly higher risk of BPH progression and acute urinary retention. We showed that the use of a COX- 2 inhibitor in combination with a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor could increase the apoptotic index in BPH tissue. Prostate cancer: A PCR-based analysis of bacterial colonization in PC specimens and normal prostate tissue showed highly suggestive correlation of bacterial colonization and chronic inflammation with a diagnosis of PC. Evidence from genetic studies support the hypothesis that prostate inflammation may be a cause of prostate cancer. De Matzo proposed that proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) is a precursor to PIN and cancer.

40|$|Infravesical {{obstruction}} impairs bladder function, and alpha(1) -adrenoceptor (AR) antagonists can relieve such dysfunction in {{part due}} to their moderate deobstructing effects. Moreover, alpha(1) -AR antagonists may also have beneficial effects on bladder function via mechanisms independent from those regulating bladder outlet resistance. Such beneficial effects have repeatedly been reported from various animal models of bladder outlet obstruction, and preliminary data indicate that this may perhaps also occur in lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) patients. The contribution of such effects on the bladder in the long-term treatment of LUTS/BPH remains to be assessed. The recently completed Medical Therapy Of Prostatic Symptoms (<b>MTOPS)</b> study has demonstrated that alpha(1) -AR antagonists have beneficial effects on the progression of LUTS/BPH which are quantitatively similar to but qualitatively different from those of 5 alpha-reductase inhibition. Due to this differential mode of action, long-term combination treatment was significantly more effective than either treatment alone. Since combination therapy is at least associated with the side effects of both the alpha(1) -AR antagonist and 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, great care should be taken to identify patients at high risk in whom the benefits of combination treatment outweigh its risk. Use of an alpha(1) -AR antagonist with very high tolerability may facilitate the use of combination treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Being readily {{available}} in most of 802. 11 radios, multirate capability appears to be useful as WiFi networks are getting more prevalent and crowded. More specifically, {{it would be helpful}} in high-density scenarios because internode distance is short enough to employ high data rates. However, communication at high data rates mandates a large number of hops for a given node pair in a multihop network and thus, can easily be depreciated as per-hop overhead at several layers of network protocol is aggregated over the increased number of hops. This paper presents a novel multihop, multirate adaptation mechanism, called multihop transmission opportunity (<b>MTOP),</b> that allows a frame to be forwarded a number of hops consecutively to minimize the MAC-layer overhead between hops. This seemingly collision-prone nonstop forwarding is proved to be safe via analysis and USRP/GNU Radio-based experiment in this paper. The idea of <b>MTOP</b> is in clear contrast to the conventional opportunistic transmission mechanism, known as TXOP, where a node transmits multiple frames back-to-back when it gets an opportunity in a single-hop WLAN.

The measurement of the t-tbar production cross section includes analyses from 9 top decay channels: dilepton (t-tbar [...] > e+mu, e+e, and mu+mu), electron and neutrino (t-tbar [...] > e+nu), single leptons (t-tbar [...] > e + jets, t-tbar [...] > mu + jets) with and without b tagging, and all-jets (t-tbar [...] > 6 jets). We measure the t-tbar production cross section to be 5. 9 +/- 1. 7 pb at <b>m(top)</b> = 172. 1 GeV/c** 2. Combining the D 0 and the CDF measurements of the top quark mass and combining their t-tbar cross sections, in both cases taking into account error correlations, yields unofficially sigma(t-tbar) = 6. 7 +/- 1. 3 pb at an averaged top quark mass of <b>m(top)</b> = 173. 8 +/- 5. 2 GeV/c** 2. Preliminary results on a search for charged Higgs production in top events, t [...] > Higgs + b, are presented. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
