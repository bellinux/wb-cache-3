Some nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary <b>market</b> <b>sensitivity</b> without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{its support}} in {{mainstream}} economic circles, its {{success has been}} increasingly challenged over recent years due to {{a growing number of}} examples in which it has not yielded the expected results. EOI increases <b>market</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to exogenous factors, and is partially responsible for the damage done by the 1997 Asian financial crisis to the economies of countries who used export-oriented industrialization. It is also criticized for its lack of product diversity as economies pursue their comparative advantage, which makes such economies potentially unstable if demand for their specialization falls. This is something which occurred during the financial crisis of 2007-08 and subsequent global recession. Similarly, localized disasters can cause worldwide shortages of the products that countries specialize in. For example, in 2010, flooding in Thailand led to a shortage of hard drives.|$|E

Importantly, the time variation in the market's sensitivity to information is at least as relevant in explaining the persistence of volatility as the rate of information arrival itself.

The selected firms were collected from those with existing two-consecutive positive P/E and P/BV ratios and by excluding financial and holding firms. There were five independent variables for the proposed study of this paper including P/E, P/B, market size, <b>market</b> <b>sensitivity</b> beta (β) and market liquidity. In each year, we first sort firms in non-decreasing order and setup four set of portfolios with equal firms. Therefore, the first portfolio with the lowest P/E ratio is called value portfolio and the last one with the highest P/E ratio is called growth portfolio. This process was repeated based on P/BV ratio to determine value and growth portfolios, accordingly. The study investigated the characteristics of two portfolios based on firm size, β and liquidity.

We find effects in both kinds of risk, indicating that rating agencies provide information to the market. Rating actions that imply an improvement in credit quality cause lower systematic and unsystematic risk. Conversely, ratings announcements that imply credit quality deterioration cause a rebalance in both types of risk, with higher beta risk being joined with lower diversifiable risk.

40|$|Many {{hedge funds}} attempt to achieve high returns by {{employing}} leverage. However, {{it is difficult}} to track the degree of leverage used by hedge funds over time because detailed timely information about their positions in asset markets is generally unavailable. This paper discusses how to combine shrinkage variable selection methods with dynamic regression to compute and track hedge fund leverage on a time-varying basis. We argue that our methodology measures leverage as well as hedge fund sensitivity to markets arising from other sources. Our approach employs the lasso variable selection method to select the independent variables in equations of hedge fund excess returns. With the independent variables selected by the lasso method, a state space model generates the parameter estimates dynamically. The hedge fund <b>market</b> <b>sensitivity</b> indicator is the average of the absolute values of the parameters in the excess return equations. Our indicator peaks {{at the time of the}} Long Term Capital Management meltdown in 1998 and again at a critical time in the 2008 financial crisis. In the absence of direct information from hedge fund balance sheets, our approach could serve as an important tool for monitoring <b>market</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and financial distress in the hedge fund industry...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} factors driving the widely-noted {{persistence}} in asset return volatility using a unique dataset on global euro-dollar exchange rate trading. We propose a new simple empirical specification of volatility, {{based on the}} Kyle-model, which links volatility to the information flow, measured as the order flow in the market, and the price sensitivity to that information. Through the use of high-frequency data, {{we are able to}} estimate the time-varying <b>market</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to information, and movements in volatility can therefore be directly related to movements in two observable variables, the order flow and the <b>market</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The empirical results are very strong and show that the model is able to explain almost all of the long-run variation in volatility. Our results also show that the variation over time of the market's sensitivity to information plays at least as important a role in explaining the persistence of volatility as does the rate of information arrival itself. The econometric analysis is conducted using novel estimation techniques which explicitly take into account the persistent nature of the variables and allow us to properly test for long-run relationships in the data.

40|$|Break-even cost" for {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{technology is}} defined as the point where the cost of PV-generated electricity equals the cost of electricity purchased from the grid. Break-even cost is expressed in $/W of an installed system. Achieving break-even cost is a function of many variables. Consequently, break-even costs vary by location and time for a country, such as the United States, with a diverse set of resources, electricity prices, and other variables. In this presentation, we introduce an analysis of PV break-even costs for residential customers in the United States, including an evaluation of some of the key drivers of PV breakeven both regionally and over time.

40|$|This paper aims at {{identifying}} the main solutions that Italian fashion companies adopt {{in order to}} increase their “market sensitivity” and, thus, to improve the effectiveness of their supply chains. In the last years, fashion companies have experienced an increased level of time-based competition, which has determined the growth of the fast-fashion segment and of new players that are able to quickly bring to the market new products. In Italy, this evolution has determined the rise of new brands, launched by small-to-medium sized enterprises, which have a strong <b>market</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and, at the same time, can enjoy a highly responsive production system, thanks to {{the fact that most of}} them are located in industrial districts. In recent years, also traditional, large Italian fashion companies have started proposing items targeted to the fast fashion segment. The supply chains of both typologies of companies have to be agile, but we assume that their <b>market</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is achieved through different levers. In this paper, we analyze four cases, two for each typology (small-to-medium Italian fashion companies and large ones), so as to understand whether relevant differences exist between the way in which such companies achieve their “market sensitivity”. This analysis demonstrates that while large companies are investing in the adoption of up-to-date technologies and best practices, small-to-medium sized ones leverage their knowledge of the industry and the intuition of their employees in order to interpret market trend and to plan their product offering accordingly...|$|E

40|$|Japanese {{banks are}} {{promising}} sources of capital {{for developing countries}} wishing to finance a balance of payments gap. This paper shows that Japanese banks are highly capitalized in terms of market value; much of their capital is"hidden capital,"the divergence between accounting and stock market estimates. The authors developed a method for testing hypotheses about two types of hidden capital: the misvaluation of on-balance-sheet items and intangible values that the General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAPP) currently designates to be unbookable off-balance-sheet items. They construct a model that explains changes in both types of capital functions of holding-period returns earned in Japan on stocks, bonds, yen, and real estate. They apply the model to annual data for 1975 - 89 and a four-class size/charter participation of the Japanese banking system. For each type of hidden capital and each class of bank, the model develops estimates of the stock market, interest rate, foreign exchange, and real estate sensitivities of returns to bank stockholders. Only the stock <b>market</b> <b>sensitivities</b> prove significant, at 5 percent. Time-series regressions show that the large Japanese banks have developed stock market betas over two and {{that the value of}} the bank's beta has come to increase with measures of its size and accounting leverage.
