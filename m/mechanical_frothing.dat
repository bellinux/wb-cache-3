40|$|The {{fabrication}} of complex-shaped ceramic parts {{in large quantities}} has been limited to the conventional ceramic conventional forming processes, such as injection molding, slip casting. Gelcasting is a novel forming method for making complex-shaped ceramic bodies. In this process, a ceramic powder slurry is prepared with a water-based monomer solution and then polymerized in situ after casting into a mold, producing a macromolecular network to hold the ceramic particles. The dried body {{in the presence of}} a cross-linked polymer network is rather strong and can be machined so as to obtain more complex shaped products. Porous ceramics, which have high potential for applications related to the environmental and energetic, are also fabricated by gelcasting. Foams can be produced by <b>mechanical</b> <b>frothing</b> in an N 2 controlling system. The incorporation of porosity in ceramic microstructures with tailored pore size and its attribute controlled in many possible ways. In this paper, a principle of gelcasting process and applications of porous ceramics fabricated by gelcasting are introduced...|$|E
40|$|Amphiphilic {{molecules}} of anionic sodium dodecul sulfate (SDS) {{were used to}} modify the hydrophobicity of cationic gibbsite platelets in aqueous foams prepared by <b>mechanical</b> <b>frothing.</b> Contact-angle (theta) measurements revealed that the originally hydrophilic particles with an apparent theta of similar to 30 degrees become partially hydrophobic, theta > 50 degrees, as the SDS concentration increased above similar to 1 mM. Stable foams with up to 20 h duration were rendered with the preferential adsorption of the partially hydrophobized platelet particles (SDS >= 2. 9 mM, solids concentration of 10 vol. %) at the water air interface so that coalescence and disproportionation (i. e., Ostwald ripening) of the air-in-water (a/w) bubbles are suppressed. Macroporous alumina foams consisting of both open and closed pore structure, a mean cell diameter of about 300 mu m, a sharp cell wall, and a relative porosity of 90 % were produced by firing the dried gibbsite foams to 1500 C in air atmosphere.

40|$|AbstractMacroporous {{polymeric}} monoliths {{were prepared}} using, as main raw material, mixtures of hydrolysable and condensed tannins and Kraft black liquor from pulp industry. The process consists of <b>mechanical</b> <b>frothing</b> of aqueous solutions constituted with the different polyphenols, a hardener, {{and in the}} presence of a surfactant that maintains the foam stable before curing. The aim of this work was to study the contribution in the formulations of Kraft black liquor on physical properties for the foams. This objective was justified by the significantly lower cost of black liquor as compared with that of tannins. The target application is the thermal and sound insulation in the building industry. The materials obtained were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy, mercury porosimetry and mechanical, thermal and acoustical measurements. Solid, self-standing foams with an average porosity of 90 % and an average cell diameter between 170 and 329 μm were obtained. The measured values of compression modulus ranged from 1. 8 up to 21. 6 MPa and the thermal conductivity was around 40 mW·K− 1 m− 1. The materials showed also good sound absorption characteristics at medium frequencies with coefficients of 0. 5 (500 Hz) and 0. 8 (1000 Hz) and at high frequencies with coefficients of 0. 7 (2000 Hz) and 0. 8 (4000 Hz) ...|$|E
40|$|Corn starch and agar {{were used}} {{independently}} as a water-uptake binder {{in combination with}} anionic sodium dodecul sulfate (SDS) which modifies the hydrophobicity of cationic gibbsite platelets for preparation of air-in-water (a/w) gibbsite foams via a simple <b>mechanical</b> <b>frothing.</b> Contact-angle (θ) measurements revealed that the apparent θ decreased from partially hydrophobic (θ ∼ 62 °) to more hydrophilic (θ ∼ 47 °) when the corn starch was first added, leading to foams with a reduced stability. As the concentration of corn starch reached above ∼ 8 vol. %, θ returned back to greater than 60 °, rendering then a stable foam. On the other hand, θ was found to decrease from 57 ° to 50 ° when the agar concentration increased above a mere 0. 16 vol. %. This {{gave rise to a}} pronounced drainage and coalescence of the foam, and a further increase of the agar concentration only led to a quick disappearance of the a/w bubbles. By tailoring the binder concentration, macroporous gibbsite foams were produced from the air- or freeze-dried wet foams, which typically consisted of packing void cells over a cell-size distribution of 50 – 400 μm, a porosity ranging from 77 % to 86 %, and a three-point (green) rupture strength of up to 240 kPa...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the production of}} two types of hierarchical macroporous polymers using the emulsion templating technique. The first are those with a hierarchy of macroporous, defined as the efficient packing of pores with multi-modal pore size distributions. The second are macroporous polymers containing a hierarchical particulate network, defined by an interconnected particle network within the polymer matrix. In {{the first section of}} the thesis, macroporous hierarchy was achieved using 3 different methods. In the first method, the properties of surfactant stabilised high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) were optimised by varying selected emulsification parameters such as the surfactant concentration and stirring rate. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was subsequently used to qualitatively compare and validate the effect of pore hierarchy on the Young’s modulus of macroporous polymers. It was believed that the hierarchical arrangement of macropores facilitated the load transfer during compression, which improved its mechanical properties. The second method involved the use of a mixed surfactant and particle emulsifier system to prepare w/o HIPEs. The mixture of surfactants and particles in the emulsion produced synergistic effects which resulted in a hierarchical macroporous arrangement after polymerisation. The hierarchical porous materials prepared using this method showed high gas permeabilities while maintaining high crush strengths and Young’s moduli compared to ‘conventional’ poly(merised) HIPEs. The improvement in mechanical strength despite the high interconnectivity was attributed to the efficient packing of macropores in a hierarchical configuration. The third approach was to mechanically-froth viscous air in w/o emulsion templates. A bio-based monomer, acrylated epoxidised soyabean oil (AESO) was chosen as a component of the continuous phase of the emulsion for its high viscosity and ability to trap air bubbles during <b>mechanical</b> <b>frothing.</b> Medium Internal Phase Emulsions (MIPEs) containing varying concentrations of AESO were mechanically frothed to incorporate air bubbles, prior to polymerisation. This was found to generate a multi-modal distribution of droplets and air bubbles which polymerised into hierarchical foams with high porosities of up to 81...|$|E
