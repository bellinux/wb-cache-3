5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may {{have been at the}} top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon radically changed this picture. By measuring Charon's orbital period, astronomers could accurately calculate Pluto's mass for the first time, which they found to be <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> expected. Pluto's mass was roughly one twenty-fifth of Mercury's, making it by far the smallest planet, smaller even than the Earth's Moon, although it was still over ten times as massive as the largest asteroid, Ceres.|$|E

5|$|The ionic radii of the {{alkali metals}} are <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> their atomic radii. This {{is because the}} {{outermost}} electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the effective nuclear charge has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.|$|E

A northeastern salient bastion, <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> the eastern and western bastions, was also built. Masonry from the fifth phase was reused for the reconstruction along with new gypsum, limestone and other materials. The seventh and eighth phases both consisted of heightening al-Rahba's western external walls.|$|E
5|$|The second mode of {{speciation}} is peripatric speciation, {{which occurs}} when small populations of organisms become isolated {{in a new}} environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> the parental population. Here, the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} a Milankovitch cycle {{in the range of}} 100,000 years, related to Earth's orbital eccentricity, its {{contribution}} to variation in insolation is <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> those of precession and obliquity. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the periodicity of ice ages at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.|$|E

5|$|Adilabad, a fort {{of modest}} size, {{built on the}} hills {{to the south of}} Tughlaqabad was {{provided}} with protective massive ramparts on its boundary around the city of Jahanpanah. The fort was <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor fort, Tughlaqabad fort, but of similar design. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in its evaluation of the status of the fort for conservation has recorded that two gates, one with barbicans between two bastions on the south-east and another on the south-west. Inside, it, separated by a bailey, is a citadel consisting of walls, bastions and gates within which lay the palaces.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|Bedford Castle was {{probably}} built after 1100 by Henry I {{in the town}} of Bedford, overlooking the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, and many of the older Anglo-Saxon streets had to be destroyed and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent mark in the formal grid system. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design and {{was probably}} <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> the later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.|$|E

5|$|Ferugliotherium was <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> the sudamericids Gondwanatherium and Sudamerica, and {{its body}} mass is {{estimated}} to have been about 70g (2.5oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, Ferugliotherium has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction of wear on the teeth indicates that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.|$|E

The Mercury transit occurred as predicted and was observed by Johann Baptist Cysat in Innsbruck, Johannes Remus Quietanus in Rouffach and Pierre Gassendi in Paris, vindicating the Keplerian approach. But their observations threw into question previous theories about the Solar System as Mercury was shown to be <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> expected.|$|E
