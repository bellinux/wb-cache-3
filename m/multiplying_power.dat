40|$|Endogenous uveitis is an {{important}} cause of blindness in young adults. The need for a comprehensive search for an aetiological 'antigen ' is stressed. A source of adjuvant, disturbance in host immunology and any associated syn-dromes are also sought. Treatment then involves elimina-tion of 'antigen', suppression of host hypersensitivity and the enhanced vascular permeability, and improvement of host resistance. The value of antihistamine and anti-serotonin drugs in successful treatment is emphasised. S. Afr. med. l., 50, 286 (1976). Endogenous uveitis is {{a major cause of}} blindness and is particularly important because it affects mainly young adults. The average case can be treated empirically with steroids and atropine and a broad-spectrum antibiotic with good immediate effect. However, the patient so treated in whom the disorder recurs, will not do so well, and the chances of establishing an aetiology are then much smaller. In this article we present a rational scheme of management for uveitis. APPROACH AND METHODS Our approach is to identify the cause, or the combination of factors, responsible for the uveitis. This is not always possible, but by using a variety of clinical, biochemical and bacteriological investigations, and by interpreting these in the light of standard immunological theory, we are able to investigate and treat endogenous uveitis in a rational manner. We do a complete examination of the patient at a special uveitis clinic. Our approach is based on the general proposition that the le!lion of endogenous uveitis is caused by an 'antigen ' which may range from hapten, virus, fungus, protozoon through to the patient's bodily constituents. In addition, the patient's immuno-logical response is influenced by adjuvants and various general diseases. These factors can be conveniently summa-rised by the equation: antigen dose x <b>multiplying</b> <b>power</b> x host hypersensitivity size of lesion = [...] body resistanc...|$|E
40|$|Dams {{are among}} the obvious {{efforts to improve the}} {{economic}} situation in a developing country. They aim at using locally available natural resources. At present they {{are among the}} most popular means for promoting socio-economic development. A significant number of these programmes have been undertaken in Africa during the past two decades, and it is to be expected that many more will follow in due course. Dams are anything but natural. They do not fit into the old balance which nature established between climate and environment. Man responded to this ecological situation by creating systems of food production, by rigidly adhering to their routine, by constructing shelter fitting the needs of his household, and by developing customs and rules to guide his daily life. These conditions of human living, also called subsistence economy, still prevail in many parts of Africa, and we usuallY consider them as belonging to a traditional life-style. But technological progress tends increasingly to disrupt the old ways of life by promising a different and· brighter future. Obstructing the natural flow of rivers on a previously unprecedented scale, and subjugating them to the strivings of man is just one of them. For growing food where this was formerly scarce, and for <b>multiplying</b> <b>power</b> which formerly depended on man's muscles only, this procedure is very efficient. As, however, only the sun rises for nothing. such gigantic efforts have to be paid somehow in gigantic currency. A dam creates a crisis situation in a given ecological setting. It does more than throwing up another physical gradient. It creates a new environment not only for flora and fauna, but also for man. Especially the history of the great seas-connecting canals is full of calamities following such interventions. Of the more recent history of numerous larger and smaller dams it can be confidently stated that every one was followed by undesirable or unforeseen effects. In recent years the attention for those effects has rapidly grown, and is still expressing itself in relevant documentation. Water and development in Africa are items very different from those in temperate climates. They have much more to do with health and wellbeing of the people involved. Those people are far less prepared for the implications than in economically advanced societies. That means that much more attention and efforts should be spent on planning, monitoring and evaluating the health effects at the introduction of dams and irrigation. The author himself was confronted with the consequences of dam construction on two different occasions. First, at Yelwa (Northern Nigeria) when he was a local doctor near the newly created lake behind Kainji Dam. Second, as a lecturer in Community Health at the University of Nairobi (Kenya). At that time the Kamburu Dam was already well underway in construction. The necessity to look into future health problems of the people concerned came as an afterthought, for which provisions had not been made. Only "modest" means were made available to Professor Odingo, {{who was in charge of}} the project. This lead to a pluridisciplinary ecological survey in 1974, followed by a repetition in 1977. Later on, in discussions with experts of WHO, FAO, UNDP and the World Bank the absence of more comprehensive documentation was often deplored.

40|$|Abstract — Today every circuit has to {{face the}} power {{consumption}} issue for both portable devices aiming at large Battery life and high end circuits avoiding cooling packages and reliability issues those are too complex. It is generally accepted that during logic synthesis power tracks well with area. This means that a larger design will generally consume more power. In this paper a low power low area architecture for the shift and add multiplier is proposed. For getting the low power low area architecture, the modifications made to the conventional architecture consist of the reduction in switching activities of the major blocks of the Multiplier, which includes the reduction in switching activity of the adder and counter. This architecture avoids the shifting of the multiplier register. The simulation result for 16 bit multipliers shows that the proposed low power architecture lowers the total power consumption by 40. 15 % {{when compared to the}} conventional architecture. Also the reduction in power consumption increases with the increase in bit width.
