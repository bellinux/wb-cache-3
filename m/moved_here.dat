5|$|The house {{expanded}} in several phases. In 1861, before the Del Valle family <b>moved</b> <b>here</b> permanently, they added three additional rooms {{as well as}} a free-standing cocina (kitchen). This was to keep fire away from the main building, as well as to keep it cooler. A basement was dug out as the foundation of the new rooms. In the 1870s, another wing was added perpendicular to the 1861 addition. Finally, some time after 1895, one more room was added to the new wing, {{as well as a}} breezeway to the kitchen, completing the current shape.

It {{takes the form of}} a four-storey harled tower house, with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement, the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate. The present approach to the gate is by a stone stair, replacing an earlier drawbridge. The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a private suite. The dormer windows at the top are capped by the pediments from the 1725 house (see below), and bear the date, the Campbell arms, and the initials AEC and DLC, for Aeneas Campbell, 11th Captain, and his wife Dame Lilias. The pediments were <b>moved</b> <b>here</b> during the 1903 restoration works.|$|E
