The required data has been obtained by filling out anonymous questiounnaires composed of 10 questions. There are 65 <b>mass</b> <b>caterers</b> in the district of Komárno, from which 51 facilities were willing to fill out the required questionnaries. The respondents included persons operating restaurants, school canteens, fast foods, and canteens of nursery houses. The acquired information from questionnaries were summed up in two charts. The work also contains posibilities of gastronomic waste utilization for biogas production, while the main focus is upon the production of biogas from gastronomic waste in combination with waste water with high organic content...|$|E
40|$|European Regulation (EC) No 1924 / 2006 {{applies to}} all types of {{pre-packed}} foods for the final consumer, including food intended to supply hospitals, canteens and similar <b>mass</b> <b>caterers,</b> bearing nutrition and health claims. Commercial communications (labelling, presentation or advertising of foods), trade names and other brand names which may be construed as nutrition or health claims are covered by the Regulation. Since the date it was brought into force (1 st July 2007), all nutrition and health claims for food products must be authorised prior to the marketing of the products, either {{by means of a}} nominative evaluation procedure or a generic evaluation. In light of the provisions of the new Regulation and the transitional measures in effect, what is the future of lipid ‘health communication’ and more particularly of marine lipid communication? For certain lipids of marine origin (e. g., EPA, DHA, etc.) play an unquestionable nutritional – not to say health – role in the human diet, a fact which is widely accepted by the scientific community...|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU), {{within the}} renewal {{plan of the}} Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Market Organization, with the Cape IV of Reg. (EU) n. 1379 / 2013 have {{introduced}} new requirements for the labelling of fisheries and aquaculture products. These, {{as well as providing}} consumers with more complete information, integrate the provisions of Reg. (EU) n. 1169 / 2011 and acts as a tool to prevent frauds and illegal fishing. In this work the new seafood labelling provisions were evaluated, starting from the analysis of the art. 35 of the Chapter IV and comparing it with the previous EU dispositions (Reg. (EC) no. 104 / 2000 and no. 2065 / 2001). The exclusion of prepared and processed products and aquatic invertebrates from the application of the mandatory seafood labelling provisions {{and the role of the}} <b>mass</b> <b>caterer</b> operators with respect to the labelling requirements were identified as the two major shortcomings that still need to be better addressed by the legislator. Overall, what emerged from this work is that, if on the one hand the European legislation on seafood labelling has achieved important goals, evolving and improving itself, on the other it is still controversial and plagued by the same problems as 15 years ago. Therefore, the authors suggest that the regulation is modified at least extending its scope to all products and to at all stages of the fishery logistic chai...|$|R
