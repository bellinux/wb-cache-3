5|$|Anarky is {{a fictional}} character, {{appearing}} in comic books published by DC Comics. Co-created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, he {{first appeared in}} Detective Comics No. 608 (November 1989), as an adversary of Batman. Introduced as Lonnie Machin, a child prodigy with knowledge of radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the philosophy of anarchism, primarily espouses anti-statism; however, multiple social issues have been addressed through the character, including environmentalism, antimilitarism, economic inequality, and political corruption. Inspired by <b>multiple</b> <b>sources,</b> early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration {{for the creation of}} the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in anti-authoritarian philosophy and politics. However, when Grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of Neo-Tech, developed by Frank R. Wallace, he shifted the focus of Anarky from a vehicle for socialist and populist philosophy, to rationalist, atheist, and free market thinking.|$|E

According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York, 90,800 kilos (200,000 pounds) was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated 58,100 kilos (128,000 pounds) of copper.|$|E
5|$|Fatalities {{associated}} with Myrmecia stings are well known, {{and have been}} attested to by <b>multiple</b> <b>sources.</b> In 1931 two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings, possibly from M. pilosula or M. pyriformis. Another fatality was reported in 1963 in Tasmania. Between 1980 and 2000, there were six recorded deaths, five in Tasmania and one in New South Wales. Four of these deaths were due to M. pilosula, while the remaining two died from a M. pyriformis sting. Half of the victims had known ant-sting allergies, but {{only one of the}} victims was carrying adrenaline before being stung. Most victims died within 20 minutes of being stung, but one of the victims died in just five minutes from a M. pyriformis sting. No death has been officially recorded since 2003, but M. pilosula may have been {{responsible for the death of}} a man from Bunbury in 2011. Prior to the establishment of a desensitisation program, Myrmecia stings caused one fatality every four years.|$|E
5|$|The rebels had <b>multiple</b> <b>sources</b> for arms, but did {{not possess}} heavy weaponry, with the {{exception}} of two artillery pieces. Sources for weapons included the Turkish forces in southern Anatolia, Bedouin tribes who either sold or smuggled Mauser rifles to the rebels that the Germans had distributed to the tribes during World War I, weapon stockpiles left behind by Ottoman troops fleeing Syria during the British-Arab offensive in 1918, and raids against French arms warehouses. The rebels' arsenal largely consisted of German Mauser rifles, revolvers, shotguns, and Turkish five-shooters, as well as sabres and daggers. According to Khoury, the rebels also possessed twelve light machine guns. Following the destruction of the Arab government in July 1920, the Turks became the main arms suppliers of the rebels. The rebels distinguished the Turkish armed movement in Anatolia from the Ottomans, who the rebels viewed negatively, by stressing the role of Turkish general Mustafa Kemal, who was viewed as the quintessential guerrilla leader in the struggle against French occupation.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} an {{increased interest in}} transfer learning. Despite the vast amount of research performed in this field, there are remaining challenges in applying the knowledge learnt from <b>multiple</b> <b>source</b> domains to a target domain. First, data from <b>multiple</b> <b>source</b> domains can be semantically related, but have different distributions. It {{is not clear how}} to exploit the distribution differences among <b>multiple</b> <b>source</b> domains to boost the learning performance in a target domain. Second, many real-world applications demand this transfer learning to be performed in a distributed manner. To meet these challenges, we propose a consensus regularization framework for transfer learning from <b>multiple</b> <b>source</b> domains to a target domain. In this framework, a local classifier is trained by considering both local data available in a source domain and the prediction consensus with the classifiers from other source domains. In addition, the training algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner, in which all the source-domains are treated as slave nodes and the target domain is used as the master node. To combine the training results from <b>multiple</b> <b>source</b> domains, it only needs share some statistical data rather than the full contents of their labeled data. This can modestly relieve the privacy concerns and avoid the need to upload all data to a central location. Finally, our experimental results show the effectiveness of our consensus regularizatio...|$|R

5|$|The {{world of}} Human Revolution was {{designed}} to parallel the Greek myth of Icarus; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew {{too close to the}} sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place at a crucial tipping point, the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology and its effect on human society also tied into the game's visual themes. The development team used <b>multiple</b> <b>sources</b> as references while creating the world and scenario. The Children of Men was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, Bioshock gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series Rome showed how powerful people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the X-Men franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels Deception Point, The Firm, and Frank Herbert's Dune saga as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the Grand Theft Auto and Mass Effect franchises. DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided social class system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in Deus Ex, such as exploring a culture of fear; the workings of a surveillance state; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in Human Revolution. To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Purchasers {{frequently}} {{face the}} choice of buying goods or services from one or from more suppliers. In this paper we review the reasons why {{one or the other}} alternative is preferred. Then we analyze these reasons {{in the context of the}} shifting goals of public procurement as given by Erridge and McIlroy (2002). It is argued that the more recent and further reaching goals of public procurement will lead to more cases of <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> in public procurement. Finally we explore the use of multiple lots in public procurement against the background of the discussion on multiple goals and <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing.</b> We conclude that multiple lots and <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> should be combined to achieve the goals of public procurement...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} primary {{cross-industry}} survey data collected in an emerging market, namely Turkey, {{in order to}} examine and interpret the perceptions of professionals on procurement risk hedging and management. In this process, we employ ordered logit models in order to decipher the likelihood of an operational hedging strategy, i. e., <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing,</b> and a financial hedging strategy, i. e., using financial derivatives, and their main drivers. We show that the likelihood of hedging via <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> and financial derivatives are associated with drivers such as supplier and commodity market characteristics, managerial perceptions regarding the historical operational risk events and supply contract parameters. We also show that the impact of these drivers is intimately different on <b>multiple</b> <b>sourcing</b> and financial derivatives...|$|R
