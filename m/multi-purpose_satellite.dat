40|$|Sea ice {{motion and}} {{deformation}} {{have generally been}} measured using low-resolution passive microwave or mid-resolution radar remote sensing datasets of daily (or few days) intervals to monitor long-term trends over a wide polar area. This feasibility study presents an application of high-resolution optical images from operational satellites, which have become more available in polar regions, for sea ice motion and deformation measurements. The sea ice motion, i. e., Lagrangian vector, is measured by using a maximum cross-correlation (MCC) technique and multi-temporal high-resolution images acquired on 14 – 15 August 2014 from multiple spaceborne sensors on board Korea <b>Multi-Purpose</b> <b>Satellites</b> (KOMPSATs) with short acquisition time intervals. The sea ice motion extracted from the six image pairs of the spatial resolutions were resampled to 4 m and 15 m yields with vector length measurements of 57. 7 m {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) and − 11. 4 m bias and 60. 7 m RMSE and − 13. 5 m bias, respectively, compared with buoy location records. The errors from both resolutions indicate more accurate measurements than from conventional sea ice motion datasets from passive microwave and radar data in ice and water mixed surface conditions. In the results of sea ice deformation caused by interaction of individual ice floes, while free drift patterns of ice floes were delineated from the 4 m spatial resolution images, the deformation was less revealing in the 15 m spatial resolution image pairs due to emphasized discretization uncertainty from coarser pixel sizes. The results demonstrate that using multi-temporal high-resolution optical satellite images enabled precise image block matching in the melting season, thus this approach could be used for expanding sea ice motion and deformation dataset, with an advantage of frequent image acquisition capability in multiple areas by means of many operational satellites...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The KOrea <b>Multi-Purpose</b> <b>SATellite</b> (KOMPSAT) {{series has}} been {{developed}} {{in accordance with the}} national space development program in Korea. The standard images of optical data on the KOMPSAT are level 1 R and 1 G which are radiometrically and geometrically corrected, respectively. However, the standard images have some limitations in many applications. For example, in order to conduct the rapid mapping for natural disaster like flood, level 2 products such as an ortho image and a mosaic image are necessary. Unlike the past, many ground stations for satellite operation are using an automatic image processing system for generating high level products. In this study, the Value-Added Processing Sysem (VAPS) was established as the post-processing system of KOMPSAT image. Meanwhile, we developed the Value-Added Management System (VAMS) for managing the output of the VAPS. The performance of VAPS was tested using various datasets.

Since the estimation of the original image from a noisy input is an ill-posed problem, a simple noise removal algorithm cannot preserve the radiometric integrity of satellite data. To solve these problems, we present a novel method to correct VHR data acquired by a push-broom-type sensor by combining wavelet-Fourier and multiscale non-local means (NLM) filters. After the wavelet-Fourier filter separates the stripe noise from the mixed noise in the wavelet low- and selected high-frequency sub-bands, random noise is removed using the multiscale NLM filter in both low- and high-frequency sub-bands without loss of image detail. The performance of the proposed method is compared to various existing methods {{on a set of}} push-broom-type sensor data acquired by Korean <b>Multi-Purpose</b> <b>Satellite</b> 3 (KOMPSAT- 3) with severe stripe and random noise, and the results of the proposed method show significantly improved enhancement results over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative assessments...|$|E

GEMS will measure backscattered UV radiances covering the 300 – 500 nm wavelength range with a spectral resolution of 0. 6 nm. The main objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate ozone profiles and stratospheric column ozone amounts retrieved from simulated GEMS measurements. Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level 1 B radiances, which have the spectral range 270 – 500 nm at spectral resolution of 0. 42 – 0. 63 nm, are used to simulate the GEMS radiances. An optimal estimation-based ozone profile algorithm is used to retrieve ozone profiles from simulated GEMS radiances. Firstly, we compare the retrieval characteristics (including averaging kernels, degrees of freedom for signal, and retrieval error) derived from the 270 – 330 nm (OMI) and 300 – 330 nm (GEMS) wavelength ranges. This comparison shows that the effect of not using measurements below 300 nm on retrieval characteristics in the troposphere is insignificant. However, the stratospheric ozone information in terms of DFS decreases greatly from OMI to GEMS, by a factor of &sim; 2. The number of the independent pieces of information available from GEMS measurements is estimated to 3 on average in the stratosphere, with associated retrieval errors of ~ 1 % in stratospheric column ozone. The difference between OMI and GEMS retrieval characteristics is apparent for retrieving ozone layers above ~ 20 km, with a reduction in the sensitivity and an increase in the retrieval errors for GEMS. We further investigate whether GEMS can resolve the stratospheric ozone variation observed from high vertical resolution Earth Observing System (EOS) Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). The differences in stratospheric ozone profiles between GEMS and MLS are comparable to those between OMI and MLS below ~ 3 hPa (~ 40 km), except with slightly larger biases and larger standard deviations by up to 5 %. At pressure altitudes above ~ 3 hPa, GEMS retrievals show strong influence of a priori and large differences with MLS, which, however, can be sufficiently improved by using better a priori information. The GEMS-MLS differences show negative biases of less than 4 % for stratospheric column ozone, with standard deviations of 1 – 3 %, while OMI retrievals show similar agreements with MLS except for 1 % smaller biases at middle and high latitudes. Based on the comparisons, we conclude that GEMS will measure tropospheric ozone and stratospheric ozone columns with accuracy comparable to that of OMI and ozone profiles with slightly worse performance than that of OMI below ~ 3 hPa...|$|E
