500|$|With {{the rise}} of media {{watchdog}} groups, such as the conservative Media Research Center (MRC), Jennings came under increasing scrutiny for what some observers deemed a liberal bias. The anchor drew fire from conservatives, such as the MRC and Cal Thomas, for his November 14, 1994, remarks on ABC Radio, in which he analyzed {{the results of the}} 1994 U.S. midterm elections. [...] "Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any two-year-old and they can tell you about those temper tantrums: the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming," [...] said Jennings. [...] "Imagine a nation full of uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum last week....Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old." [...] A July 1995 documentary, Peter Jennings Reporting: Hiroshima: Why the Bomb Was Dropped, which aired a week before the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, also drew scorn from conservatives and some television critics, who called the program a revisionist look at the decision to drop the bomb. Some viewers of the documentary <b>mailed</b> <b>bus</b> fares to Jennings, telling him to return to Canada.|$|R

50|$|As women {{entered the}} {{workforce}} in larger numbers since the 1960s, occupations have become segregated {{based on the}} amount femininity or masculinity presupposed {{to be associated with}} each occupation. Census data suggests that while some occupations have become more gender integrated (<b>mail</b> carriers, bartenders, <b>bus</b> drivers, and real estate agents), occupations including teachers, nurses, secretaries, and librarians have become female-dominated while occupations including architects, electrical engineers, and airplane pilots remain predominately male in composition. Based on the census data, women occupy the service sector jobs at higher rates than men. Women’s overrepresentation in service sector jobs, as opposed to jobs that require managerial work acts as a reinforcement of women and men into traditional gender roles that causes gender inequality.|$|R
50|$|As the {{original}} common law driving rule preceding statutized traffic law, {{it is an}} ever important foundational rule in today's complex driving environment. Because there are now protected classes of roadway users-such as a school <b>bus,</b> <b>mail</b> carrier, emergency vehicle, horse-drawn vehicle, agricultural machinery, street sweeper, cyclist, and pedestrian-as well as natural hazards which may occupy or obstruct the roadway beyond the edge of visibility, negligence may not depend ex post facto on what a driver happened to hit, could not have known, but had a concurrent duty to avoid. Furthermore, modern knowledge of human factors has revealed physiological limitations-such as the subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT)-which may make it difficult, and in some circumstance impossible, for other drivers to always comply with right-of-way statutes by staying clear of roadway.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Amongst {{the many}} {{problems}} in logistics, {{there is the}} Capacitated Vehicle Rout-ing Problem – CVRP. This problem is present in many daily activities such as garbage collection, <b>mail</b> delivery, school <b>bus</b> transportation. CVRP includes not only the opti-mization of a path, {{but many of them}} simultaneously, since a fleet of evenly-capacitated vehicles have to deliver goods to geographically-distributed customers with variable de-mand, travelling the least distance as possible. This paper presents the first results of an ongoing project, related to the implementation of an Ant Colony Algorithm for the CVRP. This heuristic method is inspired in the behavior of real ants in the search for food. We devised a two-level optimization scheme so as to accomplish both global and local optimization. We applied the system to several benchmark instances of CVRP and the results obtained so far were very promising. Further work will include more tests to find optimized running parameters as well as experiments with other instances...|$|R
5000|$|Broadcast 29 July 2007, {{the first}} {{programme}} looks at Scotland's North West Highlands. Rhys Jones begins his exploration in Sutherland, only marginally more populated than the Sahara, and originally occupied by Viking settlers. He spends {{the night in}} village of Tongue, prior to a snowy ascent of Ben Hope the next day. Ben Hope is a Munro, a mountain over 3,000 feet in height (of which there are 284), named after Scottish mountaineer Hugh Munro. It is a popular hobby to attempt to climb them all and there are over 3,500 [...] "Munro-baggers" [...] who have done so. Rhys Jones then visits the nearby village of Skerra, and hitches a lift via the Royal <b>Mail's</b> post <b>bus.</b> He arrives at Loch Naver, a barren area that was once occupied but was emptied during the Highland Clearances, after which an estimated 150,000 people had been forcibly removed from their homes. However, there are still around 17,500 crofters, {{most of whom are}} tenants of landowners. Rhys Jones visits one who led the formation of a trust that eventually enabled 100 crofters to buy back 21000 acre of land. Suilven is the next peak to be climbed, but because of its remote location, Rhys Jones rests overnight in a bothy beforehand. The presenter then travels to the Isle of Skye, where he participates in a Céilidh before investigating the Cuillin, which have been put up for sale by their owner, the Clan MacLeod. Finally, Rhys Jones ascends Bruach na Frìthe, one of the principal summits on the Black Cuillin ridge.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) is a {{well-known}} NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem where, given an undirected graph, {{the objective is to}} find a minimum cost set of tours servicing a subset of required edges under vehicle capacity constraints. There are numerous applications for the CARP, such as street sweeping, garbage collection, <b>mail</b> delivery, school <b>bus</b> routing, and meter reading. A Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) with Path-Relinking (PR) is proposed and compared with other successful CARP metaheuristics. Some features of this GRASP with PR are (i) reactive parameter tuning, where the parameter value is stochastically selected biased in favor of those values which historically produced the best solutions in average; (ii) a statistical filter, which discard initial solutions if they are unlikely to improve the incumbent best solution; (iii) infeasible local search, where high-quality solutions, though infeasible, are used to explore the feasible/infeasible boundaries of the solution space; (iv) evolutionary PR, a recent trend where the pool of elite solutions is progressively improved by successive relinking of pairs of elite solutions. Computational tests were conducted using a set of 81 instances, and results reveal that the GRASP is very competitive, achieving the best overall deviation from lower bounds and the highest number of best solutions found...|$|R
40|$|The Undirected Capacitated Arc Routing Problem is a {{classical}} arc routing problem arising in practical situations (road maintenance, garbage collection, <b>mail</b> delivery, school <b>bus</b> routing, etc.) {{with the aim}} of minimizing the total transportation cost of a set of routes that service a set of required edges under capacity constraints. Most of logistic companies are interested in minimizing not only the total transportation cost, they also are focused in managing the deliveries on the edges, {{in such a way that}} the duration of the longest trip does not exceed an upper time limit, to take into account the working day duration of the drivers. Moreover, all the demands of the required edges are satisfied by considering a limited number of vehicles at the depot. In this paper, the Multi-objective Undirected Capacitated Arc Routing Problem where different and competitive objectives are taken into account simultaneously, is defined and studied. Three objectives are considered in order to: minimize the total transportation cost, the longest route (makespan) and the number of vehicle used to service all the required edges (i. e., the total number of routes). To find a set of solutions belonging to the optimal pareto front, an optimization-based heuristic procedure is proposed and its performance is evaluated on a set of benchmark instances...|$|R
40|$|The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a {{generalization}} of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) {{and is also}} one of the most challenging tasks in the area of combinatorial optimization. In the VRP we are given p vehicles and an undirected complete graph G = (V,E) where edge weights satisfying the triangle inequality. The objective is to find a separate tour for each vehicle while minimizing the total cost of the tours. In the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), each vehicle has a limited capacity k, and it is required that the vehicle should never exceed its capacity at any point of the tours. In this thesis we present approximation algorithms for the CVRP. The CVRP, in fact, represents a large class of TSP-like problems. We consider approximation algorithms for three variants of the CVRP, namely the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickups and Deliveries (CVRPPD), variants of the Cycle Covering Problem (CCP), and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Multi-Depots. Many practical applications, such as <b>mail</b> delivery and <b>bus</b> routing, can be modeled by the CVRPPD. In this class of problems, we focus on the k-delivery Traveling Salesman Problem, the Capacitated Dial-a-Ride Problem, and the Black and White Traveling Salesman Problem (BWTSP). We propose a rule to improve the approximation ratios for the first two problems. We also give a constant factor matching based approximation algorithm for the BWTSP. In the second part of the thesis we investigate some NP-hard variants of the CCP. These variants consider two additional constraints. One constraint is on the number of vertices in each cycle, and the other is on the number of cycles appearing in a cycle cover. We present constant factor approximation algorithms for these problems. Different from the default settings of the CVRP, where only a central depot is involved, in the CVRP with Multi-Depots and Multi-Vehicles, the vehicles may start from different depots. In this category we study a model of the Multi-Depot Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MDCVRP) and the Multi-Vehicle Scheduling Problem (MVSP). We propose a dynamic programming based method to design approximation algorithms for these problems...|$|R
