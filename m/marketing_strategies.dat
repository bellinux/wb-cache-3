5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern <b>marketing</b> <b>strategies</b> to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E

Growing out of the Somali people's rich storytelling tradition, the first few feature-length Somali films and cinematic festivals emerged in the early 1960s, immediately after independence. Following {{the creation of the}} Somali Film Agency (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as riwaayado were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry. Epic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of video technology and national television networks. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, <b>marketing</b> <b>strategies</b> and production techniques.|$|E
5|$|The family symbol in {{advertising}} may be observable before the industrial revolution, {{but it was}} not until after the industrial revolution that advertising boomed and the use of family images {{in advertising}} became prevalent. The industrial revolution changed advertising from informative flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world. After the industrial revolution, large companies emerged as mass-producers, products became branded, and customers began establishing brand loyalties. Thus, persuading customers to purchase one brand rather than another became vital to advertising. An advertisement was responsible for making products and services salient in order to earn consumer attention in competitive industrial markets. During this period, not only did the immensity of the advertising industry drastically change, but so did its <b>marketing</b> <b>strategies</b> as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience. This change from largely informative to largely persuasive strategies and from general to specific audiences explains the increase in presence and usage of symbols, representations, and stereotypes in advertising—including those of the family.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} was to address the issues {{involved}} in <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation, implementation and company performance by developing a framework for the marketing of insurance services in Jordan. In order to achieve this aim the research developed a comprehensive framework involving three parts; <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation components, <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation, and company performance. The research population included all the insurance companies that were operating in the Jordanian market. The research design was mainly quantitative with some qualitative data included to support and expand upon the research findings. The research methodology included designing a comprehensive self-completion questionnaire, as well as, conducting a number of in-depth interviews with managers in the insurance companies in Jordan. The most important finding {{to come out of}} the research was that <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation and implementation are not separate parts, but rather they should be incorporated in one process for a company to achieve success in the marketplace. The classic framework of <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy,</b> which is concerned with the traditional elements of the marketing mix framework, is inadequate for the marketing of insurance services. The <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components for the marketing of insurance services were eight, these are the seven Ps of the services marketing mix framework, and service quality. These elements were found to have a positive and significant effect on the insurance companies' performance measured by financial and non-financial (marketplace and customer) criteria. The effect of the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components was found to have varied according to the insurance companies' performance criteria measured by financial and, non-financial (marketplace and customer based) criteria. The <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation variables were found to have affected the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies' performance measured by financial and non-financial (marketplace and customer based) criteria. Generally speaking, the effect of <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation variables on the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance measured by customer based measures was found to be greater than their effect on the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance measured by financial and marketplace performance criteria. Company marketing assets and capabilities, and company marketing experience were found to be the master variables of <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation that moderated the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance, measured by financial and non-financial (marketplace and customer based) criteria. This is evidenced when these two variables have systematically changed all the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies' performance. <b>Marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> consensus, <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> resource commitment, <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> cross-functional integration, <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> communication activities quality were found to have a higher effect on the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance measured by customer based criteria, rather than the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance measured by financial and marketplace performance criteria. The research found that the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation variables hold strategic implications for the insurance companies' performance because they affect their performance especially those criteria that deal with the customers e. g., customer satisfaction. The rationale is that the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation variables are concerned with activities that are dealing with the customer on a daily basis.
