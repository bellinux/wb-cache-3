40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new {{software}} tool that has been developed, the purpose of which is to help novices learn programming. The tool supports what is know as the “completion ” method of learning to program. It begins by discussing the difficulties that students face when learning to program and the use of part-complete solutions as a teaching and learning method. CORT has been developed to support this use of part-complete solutions and its features are outlined. When used by a student, a part-complete solution to a given programming problem is displayed in one window and possible lines of code that can be used to complete the solution are displayed within another window. The lines can easily be <b>moved</b> <b>between</b> the <b>windows</b> in order to complete the solution, the solution then being transferred to the target programming environment for testing purposes. Preliminary feedback from students indicates that CORT is easy to use and perceived to be helping them in their learning of programming. Three different methods of using CORT have been identified and these will be the subject of future research...|$|R

To {{research}} the seismic performance and failure mode of longitudinal independent brick masonry wall between or not <b>between</b> <b>windows</b> with setting central reinforced concrete constructional columns under the lateral function and vertical load, this paper used ABAQUS {{finite element analysis}} software to model the walls between or not <b>between</b> <b>windows</b> and be in stress analysis, obtaining the reaction force- displacement curve of loading location and the maximum horizontal displacement {{at the top of}} wall. Calculate and compare the shear strength and flexural capacity of walls. The results show that the brick masonry wall <b>between</b> <b>windows</b> with central constructional columns occurred shear failure, but the wall without windows occurred flexural failure. And compared with the wall <b>between</b> <b>windows,</b> the ductility increased, the shear capacity reduced and the seismic performance improved.

Since automated recognition of structure elements is the basis by which these methods achieve automatic detection, this study proposes a method to recognize the wall <b>between</b> <b>windows</b> from a single image automatically. It begins from detection of line segments with further selection and linking to obtain longer line segments. The color features of {{the two sides of}} each long line segment are employed to pick out line segments as candidate window edges and then label them. Finally, the images are segmented into several subimages, window regions are located, and then the wall <b>between</b> the <b>windows</b> is located. Real images are tested to verify the method.
