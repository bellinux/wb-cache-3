30|$|Technology {{platform}} of the European Union (EU) enterprise provided a 2025 vision of strategic research priorities for organic researches. Bio-effectors cover the eco-functional intensification principles of increasing agricultural productivity by improving existing natural processes [7]. EU regulation No. 834 authorized {{the use of}} plant derived materials, products, and by-products of plant origin (such as oilseed cake meal, cocoa husks, and <b>malt</b> <b>culms)</b> for fertilizers in organic agriculture [8]. Moreover, lack of wide-range fertilizer options and authorized compounds like biopesticides in organic agriculture are the main driving force of this research. In fact, the available commercial fertilizers in organic farming are not comparable for their efficiency, solubility, and prices with those in conventional farming.|$|E

The culms are normally removed in {{a process known as}} [...] "deculming" [...] after kilning when producing barley malt, but form {{an important part of the}} product when making sorghum or millet <b>malt.</b> These <b>culms</b> are very nutritious and are sold off as animal feed.|$|R
