5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its {{ring system}} and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator,</b> these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclination}} {{is given}} by an angle that can assume values between -90° (up) to 90° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator.</b> It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a dip circle.|$|E
30|$|Daytime GHz {{scintillation}} in {{the vicinity}} of the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator</b> shows seasonal dependence.|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{features that}} might {{exist in the}} terrestrial paleoionosphere, if the geomagnetic field were to assume a quadrupole form during a polarity reversal are discussed. Complicated phenomena {{would be expected to}} occur at <b>magnetic</b> <b>equators</b> and magnetospherically-driven plasma convection might occur at latitudes where the magnetic field is steeply inclined. The influence of magnetic field strength on ionospheric structure is considered in general terms...|$|R
30|$|During our TESD explanation, {{we tested}} only {{one group of}} input {{parameters}} defined by Formula (11). Various tectonic regions, however, have various parameters. For example, regions near magnetic poles have a larger ambient field BMz, and those near the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equators</b> have a smaller BMz. In this situation, the magnetic anomaly and its gradient will change in proportional to BMz. The anomaly changes in proportional to the magnetic susceptibility also. Therefore, we {{were more interested in}} changes in the Curie depth and in the side length.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E
5|$|The dipole {{component}} of the magnetic field at the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> of Neptune is about 14microteslas (0.14G). The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2T·m3 (14μT·R'N3, where R'N is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune {{may be the result}} of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.|$|E
5|$|The solar {{magnetic}} field extends {{well beyond the}} Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's {{magnetic field}} into space, forming {{what is called the}} interplanetary magnetic field. In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities {{on either side of the}} solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator,</b> a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral. The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50–400μT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5nT, about a hundredtimes greater. The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.|$|E
30|$|Third, daytime GHz {{scintillation}} decreases drastically {{very close}} to the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator.</b> That is, scintillations at the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator</b> have predominantly S 4 indices lower than 0.4 (as shown as a blue dot in Fig.  5), whereas the scintillations at UKM exceed S 4 [*]=[*] 0.4. This difference is shown in the comparison plot (Fig.  2). This finding is also evident in the diurnal and seasonal plots (Figs.  3 and 4). In other words, scintillation occurrence appears to be more frequent and stronger at UKM than at Langkawi. This result suggests latitudinal dependence of daytime scintillation.|$|R
40|$|From {{geomagnetic}} field observations of CHAMP during 2001 – 2009 we extracted characteristic signatures of inter-hemispheric field-aligned currents (IHFACs) in the equatorial ionosphere. The {{results are in}} general agreement with previous observations. Nighttime IHFACs are negligibly small. Solstitial IHFACs flow from the summer to winter (from winter to summer) hemisphere at dawn (around noon). Duskside IHFACs flow southbound irrespective of season. We have also found some new IHFAC properties, {{which may have been}} predicted by theories, but are not yet given observational support. IHFACs clearly exhibit a longitude dependence, which is modulated by the South Atlantic Anomaly, the offset between geographic and <b>magnetic</b> <b>equators,</b> and tidal waves. IHFACs show little dependence on the solar cycle. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the IHFAC modulation by non-migrating tides...|$|R
30|$|Second, from Figs.  6 and 7, which {{correspond}} {{to the location of}} moderate and strong daytime scintillation, respectively, it is revealed that the moderate and strong daytime GHz scintillations {{in the vicinity of the}} dip equator tend to occur away from the dip equator. In other words, the intensity of scintillations increases with distance from the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator</b> because of the presence of large-scale irregularities embedded in the Esb layer.|$|R
25|$|Within {{approximately}} ± 20 {{degrees of}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator,</b> is the equatorial anomaly. It is {{the occurrence of}} a trough in the ionization in the F2 layer at the equator and crests at about 17 degrees in magnetic latitude. The Earth's magnetic field lines are horizontal at the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator.</b> Solar heating and tidal oscillations in the lower ionosphere move plasma up and across the magnetic field lines. This sets up a sheet of electric current in the E region which, with the horizontal magnetic field, forces ionization up into the F layer, concentrating at ± 20 degrees from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator.</b> This phenomenon {{is known as the}} equatorial fountain.|$|E
25|$|Mercury's density {{implies a}} solid iron-rich core that {{accounts}} for about 60% of its volume (75% of its radius). Mercury's <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> is shifted nearly 20% of the planet's radius towards the north, the largest ratio of all planets. This shift lends to there being one or more iron-rich molten layers surrounding the core producing a dynamo effect {{similar to that of}} Earth. Additionally, the offset magnetic dipole may result in uneven surface weathering by the solar wind, knocking more surface particles up into the southern exosphere and transporting them for deposit in the north. Scientists are gathering telemetry to determine if such is the case.|$|E
500|$|The Bangui Magnetic Anomaly, {{one of the}} earth’s largest crustal {{anomalies}} and {{the largest}} in Africa, has its centre in Bangui." [...] It {{takes the form of}} a huge ellipse of [...] x , with its central point at 6 degrees north and 18 degrees east. It consists of three parts or segments, which comprise the northern, the southern and the central anomalies. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> passes through the feature's centre. Although it is well documented, the feature's origins are not fully understood.|$|E
50|$|EEJ {{studies from}} {{satellite}} data were initiated {{with the arrival}} of data from the POGO (Polar Orbiting Geophysical Observatories) series of satellite (1967-1970). The characteristic signature of the EEJ is a sharp negative V-shaped curve in the H field, attaining its minimum within 0.5° of the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator.</b> The <b>magnetic</b> data from satellite missions like Ørsted (1999-present) and CHAMP (2000-present) have vastly improved our knowledge of the EEJ.|$|R
40|$|Simulations {{with the}} NCAR Thermosphere - Ionosphere - Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) {{have been carried}} out to {{understand}} the cause of strong thermospheric zonal wind at the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator.</b> The simulations show that the zonal winds blow strongly at the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator</b> instead of at the geographic equator due to the latitude structure of ion drag. The fast winds at the dip equator are seen throughout the altitude between 280 km and 600 km, and the wind above 400 km is mainly accelerated via viscosity. A test simulation without viscosity verifies that the extension of the fast equatorial wind to heights above 400 km is maintained by viscous coupling with the winds at lower altitudes, in spite of there being an ion-drag maximum instead of relative minimum at the dip equator at high altitudes. Basically, viscosity is not so large compared to the pressure gradient and ion drag, but dynamics causes the pressure gradient and ion drag approximately to balance, and viscosity becomes important. The simulation results are consistent with the observations by the DE- 2 and CHAMP satellites. Therefore we suggest that the zonal wind velocity in the low latitude region is controlled by ion drag and viscosity...|$|R
30|$|On the nightside, the EIA {{developed}} at 21.4 – 22.1  UT. The VTEC within the crests of the EIA ~ 2.5 times exceeded the quiet-time levels, whereas the VTEC decreased over the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator.</b> Such behavior indicates storm-time reinforcement of the EIA, {{also known as}} super-fountain effect (e.g., Tsurutani et al. 2008; Astafyeva 2009). In the Ne, this storm-time effect is smaller than in VTEC, but also very well pronounced. In both VTEC and Ne, we observe a hemispheric asymmetry, as the northern EIA crest is better developed than the southern one.|$|R
500|$|One way {{to define}} a pole is as {{a point where the}} {{magnetic}} field is vertical. This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90° (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and -90° (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe. They can migrate rapidly: movements of up to [...] per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the Boothia Peninsula in 1831 to [...] from Resolute Bay in 2001. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).|$|E
500|$|While Earth's {{magnetic}} field is roughly teardrop-shaped, Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and [...] "wobbles" [...] periodically about its axis. The {{main reasons for}} this disk-like configuration are the centrifugal force from the co-rotating plasma and thermal pressure of hot plasma, both of which act to stretch Jupiter's {{magnetic field}} lines, forming a flattened pancake-like structure, known as the magnetodisk, at the distances greater than 20RJ from the planet. The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane, approximately near the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator.</b> The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it. The load of plasma from Io greatly expands {{the size of the}} Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind. In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the subsolar point would be no more than 42RJ, whereas it is actually 75RJ on average.|$|E
2500|$|The {{worldwide}} solar-driven wind {{results in}} the so-called Sq (solar quiet) current system in the E region of the Earth's ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) ( [...] altitude). Resulting from this current is an electrostatic field directed west–east (dawn–dusk) in the equatorial day side of the ionosphere. At the magnetic dip equator, where the geomagnetic field is horizontal, this electric field results in an enhanced eastward current flow within ± 3 degrees of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator,</b> known as the equatorial electrojet.|$|E
30|$|A diffuse and non-blanketing Es trace {{commonly}} {{observed on}} daytime ionograms as {{a scattering of}} the radio signal that covers most of the frequency scale {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator</b> is known as q-type Es, or Esq (Knecht and Mcduffie 1962). The Esq traces on ionograms are associated with the Equatorial Electrojet Current (EEJ) plasma instabilities (Forbes 1981), mainly the gradient drift instability (Type II irregularities) driven by the vertical polarization electric field produced by a Hall current as well as by the vertical density gradient (Chandra and Rastogi 1975; Reddy and Devasia 1973).|$|R
50|$|The {{equatorial}} {{segment is}} the last phase of the break-up, but, because it {{is located on the}} <b>Equator,</b> <b>magnetic</b> anomalies cannot be used for dating. Various estimates date the propagation of sea-floor spreading in this segment to the period 120-96 Ma. This final stage, nevertheless, coincided with or resulted in the end of continental extension in Africa.|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that models of the global {{geomagnetic}} field constructed from only measurements of the field intensity suffer from large errors arising from the Backus or perpendicular error effect. Knowledge of the location of the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator</b> is in principal sufficient to eliminate this error. We investigate constraining the location of the dip equator using observations of the equatorial electrojet in intensity measurements made from the CHAMP satellite. While the models generated are inferior compared with models obtained from oriented three-component vector data, they may be of sufficient quality to allow construction of future global geomagnetic reference models in the absence of vector data.|$|R
6000|$|... 98. All {{care was}} taken to render these results {{independent}} of the earth's magnetism, or of the mutual magnetism of the magnet and galvanometer needles. The contacts {{were made in the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> of the plate, and at other parts; the plate was placed horizontally, and the poles vertically; and other precautions were taken. But the absence of any interference of the kind referred to, was readily shown by the want of all effect when the disc was removed from the poles, or the poles from the disc; every other circumstance remaining the same.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Benjy, {{the famous}} Arctic discoverer, Sir James Ross, in 1832, {{discovered}} that the northern magnetic pole was situated in the island of Boothia Felix, in latitude 70 degrees 5 seconds and longitude 96 degrees 46 seconds West. It was discovered {{by means of an}} instrument called the dipping needle, which is just a magnetised needle made for dipping perpendicularly instead of going round horizontally like the mariner's compass. A graduated arc is fitted to it so that the amount of dip at any place on the earth's surface can be ascertained. At the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> there is no dip at all, because the needle being equally distant from the north and south magnetic poles, remains horizontal. As you travel north the needle dips more and more until it reaches the region of the north magnetic pole when it is almost perpendicular--pointing straight down.|$|E
50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> is an {{imaginary}} line {{around the planet}} that connects all the points where a magnetic needle, when freely suspended, is horizontal. It is scientifically important because the <b>magnetic</b> <b>equator</b> is all where the Equatorial Electrojet exists - a stream of electrons whizzing across the sky, about 110-120 km above the Earth’s surface.|$|E
30|$|The {{properties}} of ESF patches {{found in the}} bottomside of the equatorial F layer, presented below, have been compiled from (1) bistatic radio propagation experiments, in which both the Doppler shift and spread in a continuous-wave (CW) signal were measured; (2) transequatorial propagation (TEP) experiments, in which the delay and azimuthal angle-of-arrival of pulsed transmissions were measured; and (3) ionograms, which were recorded at a station near the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator.</b> We show that, regardless of the method of measurement, ESF patches appear sequentially, starting {{around the end of}} the post-sunset rise (PSSR) of the F layer, and each patch displays an east-west (EW) asymmetry.|$|R

The value of B at the lower boundary of the inner zone of trapped radiation is a monotonically increasing function of magnetic dip latitude; such data from all available geographic locations are well represented by a single curve...|$|R
40|$|Changes of {{the neutral}} {{line on the}} source surface (analogous to the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator</b> of the earth) during the period between 1976 and 1983 are {{examined}} {{on the basis of}} the Stanford solar magnetic field data. Instead of the standard Mercator-like projection, the neutral line is shown on a spherical surface for 16 selected Carrington rotations. In spite of great complexity of the field variations, this presentation depicts clearly a fairly systematic rotational reversal of the dipolar field on the source surface during the sunspot maximum years. It is suggested that this solar situation is somewhat analogous to the planet earth in the sense that the core surface and the earth's surface may correspond to the photosphere and the source surface, respectively...|$|R

Examples of theoretical considerations on the EEJ and plasma irregularities, such as the characteristic of these irregularities to be aligned with the magnetic field, and backscattered echoes obtained by radio soundings which occur only for radiation propagating nearly perpendicular (within about 1 °) to the magnetic field, have been discussed by Fejer and Kelley (1980), Forbes (1981) and Kudeki et al. (1985). Experimental investigations of the equatorial plasma irregularities using VHF coherent and incoherent scatter radars were also carried out over Jicamarca by Cohen (1967), Fejer et al.

Ground-based measurements of scintillation were analyzed together with those of amplitude scintillation from Global Navigation and Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) observations. Ground-based scintillation observations showed that strong amplitude scintillation with the S 4 index exceeding 0. 6 was frequently observed at UKM, but not at Langkawi, which is located closer to the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator.</b> The results obtained from GNSS RO measurements revealed that daytime GHz scintillations observed at the two equatorial stations, UKM and Langkawi, were likely associated with blanketing sporadic (Esb) ...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we use an {{approach}} that is applied to {{and based on the}} general theory for computing the geomagnetic and geoelectric fields at the Earth’s surface due to an electrojet or ring current in the magnetosphere above a layered Earth (Häkkinen and Pirjola 1986). The main purpose is to show that the inversion method, successfully used for artificial single frequency data by De Villiers and Cilliers (2014), also works for measured geomagnetic data. In this paper, the inversion method (Eq.  7) is applied to each frequency of the Fourier transform of the measured geomagnetic data. Here only the strength of the current is determined, while the assumed height of the equatorial electrojet is fixed as 100  km, turning the inversion from a nonlinear into a linear optimisation problem. The origin of the equatorial electrojet position is taken to be at the <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>equator.</b>|$|R
