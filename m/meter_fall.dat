5|$|Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. Using a special game controller, players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes {{in time with the}} music increases the player's score and builds up the performance meter, while missing notes will cause the meter to drop. Should the <b>meter</b> <b>fall</b> below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to the player's score multiplier by one, up to a maximum of four times the original multiplier. Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current multiplier (up to 8x).|$|E
25|$|On May 16, 1562, Adham Khan, Akbar's {{general and}} foster brother, was defenestrated twice for murdering a rival general, Ataga Khan, {{who had been}} {{recently}} promoted by Akbar. Akbar was woken up in the tumult after the murder. He struck Adham Khan down personally with his fist and immediately ordered his defenestration by royal order.

Akbar, in a rare act of cruelty probably exacerbated by his anger at the loss of his favorite general, ordered his defenestration a second time, killing him. Adham Khan had wrongly counted on the influence of his mother and Akbar's wet nurse, Maham Anga, to save him as she was almost an unofficial regent in the days of Akbar's youth. Akbar personally informed Maham Anga of her son's death, to which she famously commented, 'You have done well.' She died 40 days later of acute depression.|$|E

50|$|Unlike most {{climbing}} equipment, dynamic ropes do {{not have}} a rated tensile breaking strength. Instead, the strength of a rope is tested by the number of standard test falls a rope can sustain before breaking. The test falls use an 80 kg weight for single ropes (55 kg for half ropes), and a fall factor of 1.7 (4 <b>meter</b> <b>fall</b> on 2.3 meters of rope). This tests simulates a very hard fall that would rarely occur. When climbing, it is possible to produce a fall factor as high as 2, however, real-world climbing situations include additional shock absorbing elements which are not included in the test standard, such as the body of both the climber and belayer, elasticity of their harnesses and anchor materials, and friction between the rope and the belay device, and any protection pieces. Single ropes must sustain at least 5 such falls before breaking, and a rope that can sustain more than 9 falls is considered a 'multifall' rope. In practice, climbing ropes rarely if ever break due to a fall alone- all documented rope failures involve the rope being cut or damaged, for example by abrasion against a sharp rock edge. Ropes are especially vulnerable to being cut while they are weighted with the body of the climber, and moving over a sharp edge (for example if a following climber is resting his weight on the rope, or using the rope for assistance, while swinging or traversing under a roof, while being belayed from above). In general, thicker ropes will be stronger and more durable, and have a higher fall rating.|$|E

40|$|Oxygen {{consumption}} {{rates of}} mixed macrozooplankton from {{the vicinity of}} a deep sea hydro-thermal vent system were measured with a three-chambered slurp-gun respirometer manipulated by the submersible Alvin at one vent station, clam acres (2, 615 -m depth), on the axis of the East Pacific Rise at 2 1 ”N. Diffuse warm-water effluents (125 °C) along crevices between pillow lava formations were densely populated with epibenthic megafauna. In sharp contrast, the surrounding nonvent area had similar physical features but few visible fauna. Four plankton collections {{were made in the}} vent area and two in the nonvent area on two separate dives. Vent and nonvent plankton were dominated, numerically and gravimetrically, by a Calanoid copepod, Isaacsicalanus paucisetus. Abundance and biomass of the mixed plankton were highest over the vent area and decreased by as much as two orders of magnitude over the nonvent area. Although weight-specific oxygen consumption rates of plankton from the vent and nonvent areas, measured at the same ambient temperature (1. 6 ”C) were of similar magnitude (1. 68 - 4. 26 ~ 1 O 2 mg-l dry wt d-l), both were one to two orders of magnitude lower than published rates for surface-water mixed plankton. Oxygen consumption rates per cubic meter ranged from 564. 5 ~ 1 0, m- 3 d-l at one vent site to 4. 3 over the nonvent area.

Subclavian artery injury appears early after trauma, and arterial rupture may cause life-treatening haemorrages, pseudo-aneurysm formation and compression of brachial plexus. These clinical eveniences must be carefully worked out by accurate physical examination of the upper limb: skin color, temperature, sensation as well as radial pulse and hand motility represent the key points of physical examination in this setting. The presence of large hematomas and pulsatile palpable mass in supraclavicular region should raise the suspicion of serious vascular injury.
