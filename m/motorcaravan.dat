5000|$|SEA Group (Italian - Societa' Europea Autocaravan; {{pronounced}} [...] "sayer") is an Italian headquartered <b>motorcaravan</b> manufacturer, {{based in}} Trivolzio, Lombardy.|$|E
50|$|The Bedford Dormobile is a 1960s-era campervan (<b>motorcaravan,</b> motorhome) conversion, {{based on}} the Bedford CA van, and {{subsequently}} on the Bedford CF. It was manufactured in Folkestone in Kent, southern England, by Martin Walter.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 2000, {{the group}} employs 650 people across 11 locations, and {{produces}} 13,000 units per annum. It {{is the third}} largest manufacturer of <b>motorcaravans</b> in Europe, and has regional offices based in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom.|$|R
25|$|Early Volkswagen split-windshield Kombis {{were built}} between 1950 and 1967. Production of Volkswagen camper {{variants}} continued to 2003, and {{was based on}} the Kombi, then the Vanagon, then the LT Mk 1, then the Transporter. Other coachbuilders, including Dormobile, ASI/Riviera, Holdsworth, Danbury <b>Motorcaravans,</b> and VW Sun-Dial, also built campers based on the Transporter.|$|R
50|$|During the mid-1960s, Dornier Flugzeugwerke and Hymer {{developed}} the Dornier Delta II, a {{development of the}} earlier Zündapp Janus. The vehicle could carry up to six passengers and offered two sleeping places for camping, but was never developed beyond the prototype stage. However, from 1971, serial production of <b>motorcaravans</b> started under the Hymer brand.|$|R
50|$|Like most British based <b>motorcaravan</b> manufacturers, its {{vehicles}} {{are based on}} van chassis supplied by major motor manufacturers, including the Peugeot Boxer, Volkswagen LT and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter; the Ford Transit based conversions were dropped in 2010. The Service Centre is based in Willersey, near Broadway, Worcestershire, formerly managed by last family member involved with the business, Charles Trevelyan.|$|E
40|$|This patent {{describes}} a portable bicycle stand whose novelty {{lies in its}} flexible-wall construction, enabling it to accommodate {{a wide range of}} bicycle types and sizes. The design solution draws on observational research with users at a holiday park and is particularly suited to families. Thompson identified the problem, Watson focused on the form and aesthetics, Lievesley proposed using recycled materials and introduced the use of flexible walls to accommodate multiple wheel-sizes. It builds directly on Lievesley’s work on the innovative application of plastics evident in his previously patented or registered designs for street-furniture and traffic products (see previous RAE 2001 submissions: European Patent EP 0863091 ‘Fire-retardant enclosure’ and UK Registered Design No. 2045078 ‘Pedal Operated Waste Bin’). The bicycle stand effectively exploits the material characteristics of compression moulded recycled plastic utilising Lievesley’s previous IP developed in UK Patent No. GB 2294488, ‘Adjustable feet for a post-and-rail barrier assembly’. The flexible wall construction replaces what might otherwise have been moving parts, thereby eliminating the need for users to bend down to the stand when engaging their bicycle. The stand was launched to market in 2002 and featured in National periodicals in the Camping and Caravanning sector as well as the cycling trade press (Cycling Plus - June 2002, Which <b>Motorcaravan</b> - June 2002, Camping And Caravaning – May 2002, Caravan - October 2002, Caravan Mart - June 2002) as well as regional press. The product website has been cited on a number of international sites listing products for cyclists: [URL] Netherlands [URL] Korea [URL] Belgium The bicycle stand was co-developed with the manufacturing company, ALM Products. Lievesley’s contribution to the project was funded through a £ 99 k Department of Trade and Industry funded ‘Knowledge Transfer Partnership’ programme. Lievesley was actively involved in managing all elements of the product development programme from conception to manufacture...|$|E
40|$|International audienceQuality Management Systems (QMS), {{can be a}} {{strategic}} tool in order to rationalize and improve administrative and industrial management because it allows – in a logic of continuous improvement – to identify a set of quality pointers able to monitor the processes. Recent renewals of QMS have involved a redefinition of pointers system, through the restyling of the existing procedures {{and the introduction of}} new processes, having the goal to guarantee an effective control of the processes and therefore to turn out the best one in terms of satisfaction of user's requirement [...] The aim of this work is to develop and apply a QMS methodology able to point out a set of pointers finalized to measure objectively the obtained improvements or to define the lacks of a certain production system, considering those particular production systems in which personalization of the product is very emphasized. The methodology has been applied to the production process of a SME producing <b>motorcaravans</b> and motorhomes, characterized by a high level of product personalization, that often makes it to become a single-type production. The improvements obtained through the implementation of our approach has been mainly related to a decreasing of non conformities (NC) in production of new types up to 25 % and, as a further result, the QMS implemented with our approach has given the same performance with new products introduction and at the change of the production types...|$|R
