40|$|Purpose – This paper {{analyzes}} consumers’ {{attitudes and}} behaviors towards online piracy and their willingness to try subscription-based <b>music</b> <b>services.</b> The objective is to develop and test an attitude-intention model which includes ethical considerations in consumers’ decision making process regarding music consumption. Design/methodology/approach – The study analyzes 505 consumer questionnaires using a structural equations model. Findings – Attitude toward online piracy is positively determined by economic and hedonic benefits and negatively by moral judgment. A favorable attitude toward online piracy, in turn, negatively influences consumers’ willingness to try subscription-based <b>music</b> <b>services,</b> which is also directly determined by their interest and involvement with the services themselves. Research limitations/implications – The limitations of the paper are linked mainly to the adapted scales, {{to the analysis of}} just two subscription-based <b>music</b> <b>services</b> (Napster and Spotify) and to the fact that all respondents came from one country. Practical implications – The results call for a greater commitment by music industry actors to educate consumers about the consequences and implications of online music piracy, while also stressing the value added and hedonic benefits offered by subscription-based <b>music</b> <b>services.</b> Originality/value – This paper is the first to focus on consumers’ propensity toward online piracy and their willingness to try subscription-based <b>music</b> <b>services</b> as a possible alternative to the phenomenon, through the development and test of an attitude-intention model that includes ethical considerations...|$|R
