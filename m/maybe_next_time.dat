5000|$|Another homage-by-genre-twist {{novel is}} Christabel, {{inspired}} by the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem of the same name. Written initially under the pen name Laura Adams, Kallmaker dedicated the novel to Jeannette Howard Foster for her examination of the lesbian subtext, moving her to retell the story with the women triumphant. Her ability to push the boundaries of genre fiction while maintaining her popularity is epitomized by <b>Maybe</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Time,</b> [...] "an engrossing, compelling story of redemption, healing and surviving," [...] which won a Lambda Literary Award.|$|E
50|$|Her novels {{include the}} Golden Crown Literary Society and Lambda Literary Foundation award-winning 18th & Castro, In Deep Waters 1/2, Just Like That, The Kiss that Counted, <b>Maybe</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Time,</b> and Sugar.

After Naiad Press closed in 2003, she moved the remainder of her lesbian romance titles to Bella. In 2008, she joined Bella Books as the press's first Editorial Director, and retired from that position in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Allal", {{the obvious}} uncanny {{element in the}} story is that Allal {{switches}} bodies with the snake. One minute Allal is lying on the floor with the snake on his shoulder and chest and the next, he wakes up in the snake's body, lying next to his human form. Although this seems far-fetched, it puts an idea in the reader's head. It gives them a bizarre perspective and introduces the question [...] "what if this happened?" [...] Would they dare try to copy such a feat? <b>Maybe</b> the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> they see a snake they will hesitate - not get too close or look too deeply into its eyes for the fear of waking up a snake.

Maher {{also said that}} the composition is confusing, because the song talks about [...] "ended right", but the performers seem sad and regretful. The critic concludes commenting: [...] "The beat also falls short, with a generic melody that reminds us of a cheesy lovesick late ’90s song with some synth thrown in there for good measure.

50|$|One amusing moment {{occurred}} on April 24 while playing the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. With one {{out in the}} third inning, right fielder Larry Walker caught a Mike Piazza fly ball and innocently handed it to young fan, six year old Sebastian Napier, thinking {{it was the third}} out of the inning. He noticed that José Offerman, already on base, was running at full speed. Walker managed to retrieve the ball from Napier, and held Offerman to third base. Embarrassed, Walker remarked that he “told the little kid that <b>maybe</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> I’ll give him a ball when there are three outs instead of two.

However, the singer said during her Adele Live 2016 concert tour at Los Angeles that although she had been offered to perform by the NFL, she had declined the offer. The singer added: [...] "First of all, I'm not doing the Super Bowl... I mean, come on, that show is not about music. And I don't really... I can't dance or anything like that.

5000|$|The word [...] "next" [...] is important: [...] "Maybe next year" [...] {{as opposed}} to [...] "this year". means, [...] "All right, I've screwed it up this year. <b>Maybe</b> <b>next</b> year I'll do {{something}} right in my life."

Soon Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) notice the fire and Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) calls the fire brigade. Dev breaks the window with the curtain rail, attracting the attention of people below. Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) and Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) come to the rescue. Dev is released by Ciaran while Charlie rescues Sunita just before the shop explodes. Maya is quite shocked when Dev and Sunita are rescued as she is watching from her car {{at the other end of}} the street and then tries running Dev and Sunita over but misses when Charlie and Ciaran pull them out of the way. She crashes into a wall but gets up and starts the car again, reversing it out to try again but a truck crashes into the back and smashes her into another wall. Maya is alive and goes to the same hospital as Sunita but when Sunita finds out, she leaves immediately as she is worried about her safety until Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay) tells her that Maya is on life support and her hospital room is under police guard. After coming out of intensive care, Maya is remanded in custody to await trial.|$|E
5000|$|Upon its release, T.I. vs. T.I.P. {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. It holds {{a score of}} 61 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews from critics. AllMusic writer Andy Kellman gave the album a 3 out of 5 stars stating [...] "the MC constructs an entire album around the penthouse and pavement concept, dividing the program into three acts: T.I.P. (seven tracks), T.I. (seven tracks), and T.I. vs T.I.P. (four tracks). This is also signified in the album's outer sleeve and booklet photos. After the sustained greatness through Trap Muzik, Urban Legend, and King, a fall-off of some degree had to be expected -- especially after reaching the top after a steady climb -- and that's exactly what happens. Though he undeniably {{remains one of the}} top MCs, T.I. tends to either reheat familiar material with less fire or tread dangerously close to unrelatable Kingdom Come-like [...] "Look at who's obnoxiously shedding his underdog status!" [...] routines (as on [...] "My Swag"). The productions similarly do not match up to past successes, and even some of obvious choices for singles fall short of past tracks that were never thought to be released as singles. The album is generally enjoyable, and it's doubtful T.I. has to worry about being dethroned within the near future." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club stated [...] "T.I.'s honey-dripping Southern drawl and outlaw swagger is irresistible in bite-sized doses, but it isn't enough to sustain an entire album. This holds true for his ambitious yet muddled new project, T.I. Vs. T.I.P, a three-act concept album that clocks in at just over 73 minutes. Sonically, the album has a frantic, indistinct busyness that all too often passes for excitement and momentum. The album's first third concentrates on T.I.P., the second on T.I., and the third on an epic battle between the rapper and his flamboyant alter ego. T.I.P. is ostensibly T.I.'s belligerent, untamed id, but in a blind taste test, nine out of 10 hip-hop heads would have difficulty telling them apart. In the grand hustling tradition of half-assed concept albums, Vs. boasts an overarching premise that's fuzzy to the point of meaninglessness until the climactic final confrontation. On Vs., one of the South's hottest rappers declares war with his dark side. <b>Maybe</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> he'll finally wage combat with a more worthwhile adversary, like bloated album lengths or the homogenizing effects of major-label politics." ...|$|E
