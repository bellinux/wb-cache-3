50|$|Magnetic filters use a {{permanent}} magnet or an electromagnet to capture ferromagnetic particles. An advantage of magnetic filtration is that maintaining the filter simply requires cleaning the particles {{from the surface}} of the magnet. Automatic transmissions in vehicles frequently have a magnet in the fluid pan to sequester magnetic particles and prolong the life of the media-type fluid filter. Some companies are manufacturing magnets that attach to the outside of an oil filter or <b>magnetic</b> <b>drain</b> <b>plugs</b> -- first invented and offered for cars and motorcycles in the mid-1930s -- to aid in capturing these metallic particles, though there is ongoing debate as to the effectiveness of such devices.|$|R

50|$|In {{preparation}} for freezing temperatures, an in-ground swimming pool's pipes must be emptied. An above-ground pool {{should also be}} closed, so that ice does not drag down the pool wall, collapsing its structure. The plumbing is sealed with air, typically with rubber plugs, to prevent cracking from freezing water. The pool is typically covered to prevent leaves and other debris from falling in. The cover {{is attached to the}} pool typically using a stretch cord, similar to a bungee cord and hooks fitted into the pool surround. The skimmer is closed off or a floating device is placed into it to prevent it from completely freezing and cracking. Floating objects such as life rings or basketballs can be placed in the pool to avoid its freezing under the cover. Sand or DE filters must be backwashed, with the main <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> removed and all water <b>drained</b> out. <b>Drain</b> <b>plugs</b> on the pool filter are removed after the filter has been cleaned.

50|$|Mars 2M No.522 was {{launched}} at 10:33:00 UTC on 2 April 1969 atop a Proton-K 8K78K carrier rocket with a Blok D upper stage, flying from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/24. One {{of the first}} stage engines caught fire almost immediately at liftoff. The remaining engines managed to compensate for about 30 seconds of flight, but the thrust section fire eventually resulted in loss of control. The Proton pitched over and began flying horizontally before ground controllers sent a manual shutoff command. The vehicle nosedived into the ground just outside the launch complex 41 seconds after launch.

40|$|Restoration {{works are}} carried out to {{alleviate}} human impacts and improve habitats within ecosystems. However, human impacts may also create new (anthropogenic) habitat for species to exploit. A dilemma arises when proposed restoration works would remove anthropogenic habitat and the assemblages it supports. Sediment input into the Glenelg River has formed tributary junction plug wetlands at confluences. Sand slug removal is proposed as part of river rehabilitation, but would also <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> wetlands. We sampled four plug wetland, four river run and three river pool sites to determine whether plug wetlands influence water quality {{and add to the}} biodiversity of macroinvertebrates in the Glenelg River. Water quality and macroinvertebrate diversity were similar in plug wetlands, river runs and river pools. Assemblages were distinct among all sites, regardless of type, so there was no characteristic â€˜plug-wetland faunaâ€™. Therefore, although removal of plug wetlands would not cause a dramatic loss of invertebrate biodiversity, it would destroy anthropogenic habitat that supports a similar range of species to natural habitats in a river subject to multiple degrading processes. Gains from rehabilitation should be weighed against the value of anthropogenic habitat and the extent of similar habitat lost elsewhere in the ecosystem. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the evaluation of}} some configurations of pavement subsurface drainage systems, including the conventional edgedrain system, and two centerline configurations, at 2 -foot and 4 -foot depths. Testing of these configurations took place on a newly constructed eight-mile section of Nobles County CSAH 35 near Worthington. Drained roadway sections were 500 feet long for each drainage treatment. Each of the treatments was replicated six times, with the outflow for each replication outlet through a tipping-bucket flow monitoring system.

The subject was later popularized in a famous 1962 article in the journal Nature, which described an experiment in which all other forces to the system were removed by filling a [...] tank with [...] of water and allowing it to settle for 24 hours (to allow any movement due to filling the tank to die away), in a room where the temperature had stabilized. The <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> was then very slowly removed, and tiny pieces of floating wood were used to observe rotation. During the first 12 to 15 minutes, no rotation was observed. Then, a vortex appeared and consistently began to rotate in an anticlockwise direction (the experiment was performed in Boston, Massachusetts, in the Northern Hemisphere). This was repeated and the results averaged to make sure the effect was real. The report noted that the vortex rotated, [...] "about 30,000 times faster than the effective rotation of the Earth in 42Â° North (the experiment's location)". This shows that the small initial rotation due to the Earth is amplified by gravitational draining and conservation of angular momentum to become a rapid vortex and may be observed under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.|$|R
50|$|The longship's narrow deep keel {{provided}} strength {{beneath the}} waterline. A typical size keel of a longer ship was 100 x 300 mm amidships, tapering in width at {{the bow and}} stern. Sometimes there was a false outer keel to take the wear while being dragged up a beach. These large timbers were shaped with both adze and broadaxe. At the bow the cut water was especially strong, as longboats sailed in ice strewn water in spring. Hulls up to 560 cm wide gave stability, making the longship less likely to tip when sailed. The greater beam provided more moment of leverage by placing the crew or any other mobile weight on the windward side. Oceangoing longships had higher topsides about a 1 m high to keep out water. Higher topsides were supported with knees with the long axis fastened {{to the top of}} the crossbeams. The hull was waterproofed with animal hair, wool, hemp or moss drenched in pine tar. The ships would be tarred in the autumn and then left in a boathouse over the winter to allow time for the tar to dry. To keep the sea out, wooden disks were put into the oar holes.

The TPI 350 motor was visually distinguishable from the TPI 305, as the bumper cover decal had [...] "5.7L" [...] added to the [...] "Tuned Port Injection" [...] decal. It can also be determined by checking the VIN (8th character, F=305, 8=350). The 305 TPI equipped with automatic transmission came with 190 hp, while the Manual 305 TPI got a [...] rating. The 350 L98 gave a boost to 225 hp @ 4400 and 330ftlb @ 2800. All V8 engines received hydraulic roller lifters and new valve cover/head design. Valve covers featured new sealing and center bolts in the valve covers. Heads featured new raised lip for improved valve cover sealing and the two center intake bolts were changed from 90-degree orientation to 72 degrees. G92 and L98 cars got the Borg-Warner HD 7.75 in four pinion rear end, produced for GM's Holden of Australia (Firebird WS6 cars went to this unit in 1986).
