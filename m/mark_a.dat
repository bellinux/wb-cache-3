5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to <b>mark</b> <b>a</b> territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E

Kate then discovers that he is seeing yet another woman, whom she at first believes to be Carly, but they both discover that Mark is seeing a third woman: Amber.|$|E

5|$|Hardenbergh's {{design was}} {{described}} as employing both Gothic elements and classical forms that preceded the extreme eclecticism that was to <b>mark</b> <b>a</b> later Victorian Gothic Revival period. The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of red brick, but the final execution was mostly in sandstone quarried in Connecticut, with some examples of stone from Newark. Geology Hall, built {{on the south side}} of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now Alexander Johnston Hall) that housed the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School) the year before. The third project, Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873), was designed to complement the simple Gothic Revival style of Geology Hall and was erected on the north side of Old Queens.|$|E

5|$|Lifesong is {{the second}} studio album by American Christian rock band Casting Crowns, {{released}} on August 30, 2005 by Beach Street Records and Reunion Records. Produced by <b>Mark</b> <b>A.</b> Miller, Lifesong was the follow-up to the band's self-titled debut album. Although the unexpected success of the first album led to tremendous demand for new music from Casting Crowns, lead vocalist Mark Hall was advised by Steven Curtis Chapman (a co-producer of the debut album) and Mac Powell {{not to worry about}} commercial expectations. Lifesong, which has a pop rock and adult contemporary sound, focuses on challenging believers and indicting piousness and hypocrisy in the Christian church. Worship themes are also prominent in the album.|$|E
50|$|The album <b>marked</b> <b>a</b> stylistic shift for the band, from Yugoslav pop-rock to 70s-inspired hard rock, {{with some}} folk influence, {{although}} the album still had pop songs on it.

5|$|Peace on Earth is {{the first}} Christmas album by American Christian rock band Casting Crowns. Produced by Mark Hall and <b>Mark</b> <b>A.</b> Miller, it was {{released}} on October 7, 2008. Intended by Hall {{to bring out the}} worshipful aspect of Christmas, the album does not have songs relating to secular Christmas traditions, instead featuring a mix of traditional Christmas carols and original songs. As co-producer, Hall attempted to differentiate the album from their previous ones by attempting to use creative ideas they had not tried before, and he also wanted to utilize the band's female members in a broader and more visible role on the album.|$|E
5|$|The Altar and the Door was {{produced}} by <b>Mark</b> <b>A.</b> Miller. Most of the recording {{and all of the}} mixing for the album was done by Sam Hewitt at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee and My Refuge Studio in McDonough, Georgia; additional recording was done by Michael Hewitt and Dale Oliver at those same locations. The strings on The Altar and the Door were arranged by Bernie Herms and recorded by Bill Whittington and Steve Beers at The Sound Kitchen in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was mastered by Richard Dodd.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} AMNHFARB6810, the best-preserved skull of Plateosaurus {{that has been}} taken apart during {{preparation}} and is thus available as separate bones, was described anew in 2011. The authors of that publication, palaeontologists Albert Prieto-Márquez and <b>Mark</b> <b>A.</b> Norell, refer the skull to P.erlenbergensis, a species erected in 1905 by Friedrich von Huene. If the P.erlenbergensis holotype is diagnostic (i.e., has enough characters to be distinct from other material), it is the correct name for the material assigned to P.longiceps Jaekel, 1913. However, according to the last detailed study of the holotype material of P.engelhardti by Markus Moser, P.erlenbergensis is a junior synonym of P.engelhardti.|$|E

5|$|Thrive (stylized as THRIVE) is {{the sixth}} studio album by American {{contemporary}} Christian music band Casting Crowns. Released on January 28, 2014 through Beach Street and Reunion Records, {{the album was}} produced by <b>Mark</b> <b>A.</b> Miller. Musically, the album, whose concept was inspired by Psalms 1 from the Bible, has a rock and contemporary Christian sound with influences from folk and bluegrass. The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics for its lyrics and musical diversity, but some critics felt that some songs were too similar {{to the work of}} other artists or to their own previous work.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's {{works have}} not been {{completely}} neglected in recent years. The Herries stories have seldom been out of print, and in 2014 WorldCat listed a dozen recent reissues of Walpole's works, including The Wooden Horse, The Dark Forest, The Secret City, Jeremy, and The Cathedral. In 2011 the BBC broadcast a reappraisal of Walpole, The Walpole Chronicle, presented by Eric Robson. In 2013 a new stage version of Rogue Herries was presented by the Theatre by the Lake company in Walpole's adopted home of Keswick. The BBC speculated that this could <b>mark</b> <b>a</b> revival in interest in his works.|$|E
5|$|Xerxes {{retreated to}} Asia {{with much of}} his army, leaving Mardonius to {{complete}} the conquest of Greece. However, the following year, {{the remainder of the}} Persian army was decisively beaten at the Battle of Plataea and the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. The Persians made no further attempts to conquer the Greek mainland. These battles of Salamis and Plataea thus <b>mark</b> <b>a</b> turning point {{in the course of the}} Greco-Persian wars as a whole; from then onward, the Greek poleis would take the offensive. A number of historians believe that a Persian victory would have hamstrung the development of Ancient Greece, and by extension western civilization, and this has led them to argue that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history.|$|E

The film earned $158.5million in its first four-day period, surpassing the previous four-day record held by The Matrix Reloaded ($134.3million), and joining Spider-Man, The Matrix Reloaded and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as one the only films to make $100million in three days. In eight days, it reached the $200million <b>mark</b> (<b>a</b> record tied with Spider-Man 2) and by its 17th day, the film had passed $300million (surpassing the record of 18 days of Shrek 2). It was eventually the third-fastest film (after Shrek 2 and Spider-Man) to reach $350 million.|$|E

He has since held posts as assistant coach at Dartmouth, Director of Men's Basketball Operations at Bradley University, and head coach of West Virginia Wesleyan College before his current role at Le Moyne.|$|E
5|$|Discus {{is one of}} {{the events}} where the athlete has to throw a heavy disc in the attempt to <b>mark</b> <b>a</b> farther {{distance}} than their competitors. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2kg (4.4pounds) in weight and 22cm (8inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928., although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Frantisek Janda-Suk. He invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus.|$|E
