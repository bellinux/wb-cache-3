The Zimbabwean economy, being too frail and small to pay the interest which would come with a seigniorage contract, the country chose instead to implement a multi-currency environment based on the US dollar. However, this arrangement has meant a shortage of small change in coins.|$|E
50|$|As an {{economist}} at the OECD, Thorgeirsson was the co-author of several Economic Surveys for Finland and Norway, respectively, wherein he developed fiscal and monetary policy advice for these countries. In his capacity as chief economist for the Federation of Icelandic Industries in 2001-2004, Thorgeirsson was a participant in the debate in Iceland concerning membership in the European Union. During this time Thorgeirsson emphasised the advantages of the euro while warning about potential problems with the króna especially if monetary policy became restrictive. He advised the examination of other ways to adopt the euro if EU membership was a sticking point. He said the challenge for economic policy with a single European currency was overstated due to normal adjustment in a market economy. He warned against calls for a <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> and advised of the benefits of the euro for financial stability. He presented an estimate of the potential benefit of EU membership for Iceland and suggested that small states benefited more from EU membership. In 2003, while calling for restraint in fiscal policy, bank lending and private sector decisions, Thorgeirsson warned of an exchange rate rise and subsequent collapse of the króna following the expected high interest rate policy path of the Central Bank during a FDI-led boom. At the same time, he suggested a moderate monetary policy path be considered (where domestic interest rates do not devitate too much from international rates). In May 2004, the central bank began to raise its policy interest rates from 5.3%, and by December 2007 it stood at 13.75%. Over this period, significant inflows of foreign capital took place, the exchange rate appreciated, bank lending surged and debt levels rose. The Icelandic króna and the oversized banking system collapsed in the Autumn of 2008 when global financial markets seized up. While serving as Director-General in the Ministry of Finance, Thorgeirsson suggested that the efficacy of fiscal policy was underrated in the upswing while that of monetary policy was overrated. More recently, while at the Central Bank,he has written about institutional reform in financial surveillance, with a focus on macroprudential policy. He has also performed research into the policy responses to the Icelandic banking collapse, finding that the government selected the optimal path to emerge from the crisis.|$|E

5000|$|Bulawayo {{has long}} been known as the {{industrial}} hub of Zimbabwe. It has a large manufacturing presence, and large industries such as Merlin Textiles, Zimbabwe Engineering Company (Zeco), Hubert Davies, Radar Metal Industries, National Blankets, G & D Shoes, Merlin, Tregers Group, Stewarts & Lloyds, Hunyani Holdings, and Cold Storage Commission. However, some of these companies have either moved operations to Harare or no longer exist altogether which has crippled Bulawayo's economy. The industries are deserted and the infrastructure has since been left to deteriorate, further deterring investors from operating in the city. The reason for the city's de-industrialization has been heralded to be the lack of infrastructure to support the size of the city and its operations and an unreliable source of water and the collapse of the rail infrastructure which was a core reason of placing industry in Bulawayo to begin with. Many locals argue that it is because of marginalisation they experience against the government due to cultural differences between the Shona in Harare and the Ndebele Proper in Bulawayo because the National railways of Zimbabwe (Headquarters Bulawayo) is a government parastatal and as such should have been thriving {{had it not been for}} embezzlement of allocated funds by company executives who are believed to be Shona. The water issue is not new and had brought about the [...] "help a thirsty Matabele" [...] initiative of the 1970s and the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project which would put an end to the water issue in Matabeleland was drafted; however, this project was put on hold soon after independence. These allegations have all been labelled hogwash by the relevant authorities; however, they have only fueled the secessionist initiative into a general opinion. Before the collapse of Zimbabwe's rail infrastructure, Bulawayo was an important transport hub, providing rail links between Botswana, South Africa and Zambia and promoting the city's development as a major industrial centre. The city still contains most of what remains of Zimbabwe's heavy industry and food processing capability including a Thermal Power Station which resumed operations in February 2011 after a capitalisation deal with the Government of Botswana where Bulawayo would supply 45 Megawatts in three years. Like many parts of the country, Bulawayo has for the past ten years seen a huge drop in service delivery and an increase in unemployment due to the number of resignations of people seeking better prospects across the border. Many people resorted to farming, mining and the black market for sustenance, while others depended on the little foreign currency that would be sent by family in other countries. However, with the introduction of the <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> in 2009, a new approach is seen by investors in the city who admire the already-available infrastructure and the huge workforce and Bulawayo as great prospects for the future and is set to once again contribute greatly to the economy of Zimbabwe. The city is served by Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport which has been expanded a number of times to cope with the influx of visitors into the region. The Edgars clothing stores are headquartered in Bulawayo. The Rovos rail run luxury train, Pride of Africa makes a stop in Bulawayo for pick up and dropping off passengers. Bulawayo is situated along the Trans-African Highway network important trade route of Cairo - Cape Town Highway. Most of the city's industries are privately owned, especially in the transport sector.|$|E

The introduction of the <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system,</b> which entails the use of various foreign currencies to transact, resulted in the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) adopting the United States dollar (USD) as its main currency. The researchers investigated the weak form efficiency of the ZSE after introduction of the <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> by testing if it is possible to create an excess return by the use of technical trading rules. According to the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) and the random walk theory, in an efficient market it is not possible to predict the future stock prices by analysing historical stock prices. The profitability of technical analysis and technical trading rules has been researched and debated extensively, but researchers are yet to reach a consensus.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of dollarization on business in Zimbabwe focusing on economic indicators such as inflation rate, GDP, employment and ease of doing business during the period 2009 - 2015. Zimbabwe experienced a very difficult economic phase characterised by hyperinflation, negative economic growth, unavailability of basic commodities and negative economic growth rates during the period 1998 - 2008. In 2009 the country adopted a <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> whereby the Zimbabwean dollar was in circulation alongside various other currencies, with the United States Dollar and the South African Rand being the dominant ones. There has been general speculation that Zimbabwe’s economic problems are due to dollarization. Through analysing data from interviews and secondary sources, the research established that dollarization brought about stability in the economy, arrested inflation, and caused a marginal increase in GDP. However, the response of the employment rate was independent of the dollarization and may be attributed to other factors such as Economic Structural Adjustment Programme (ESAP) in 1992, the global economic crisis in 2008 and the absence of reliable data...|$|E

Growth in economic activity would increase the size, scale, and scope of payment transactions. Enabling the scale and scope of payments would in turn increase economic activity. This would also require national payment systems to be regionalized and operate with cross-border and multi-currency capabilities. As existing regional payment arrangements have illustrated how they can be successfully established, ASEAN can itself leverage on its current cooperative forums in creating a more regionalized payment system. In doing so, it faces the following challenges. First, promoting the use of cashless payments would require increased private sector involvement in improving accessibility to basic payment infrastructure, increasing their interoperability, and creating a competitive cross-border retail payment scheme. Second, creating cross-border and <b>multi-currency</b> payment <b>systems</b> could possibly proceed with the interlinking of existing real-time gross settlement systems within the region, and later enlarged, but this would need to be supportive of the broader goals of sequencing financial services liberalization.

40|$|The {{extension}} of floating exchange-rate regimes and going {{change in the}} global nature of business are the {{two of the most}} critical factors that constitute business risk today. Australian firms engaging in international business have to manage the adverse consequences of exchange rate movements because firms may confront greater business risk that arises from, among other factors, the volatility of the Australian dollar since floating in 1983, the nature of the Australian products sold overseas, and the increase in international operations of the firm. Recent corporate crashes, indeed, demonstrate the urgency for managing foreign exchange exposure as part of providing adequate corporate governance. Against this background, this study aims to examine how Australian firms with significant foreign exchange exposure respond to such business environments. Specifically, this study is aimed at identifying and assessing the firms 2 ̆ 7 practices on the management of foreign exchange exposure. This study also goes beyond a descriptive nature by investigating the potential association between firm-specific characteristic variables that may contribute to the efficacy of such practices and management practice variables. The selected firms in the study comprise large Australian firms covering major industries, both foreign and domestic owned, based in New South Wales with annual sales equal to and greater than 10 million AUD and those with significant foreign exchange exposure. Data was gathered from Dun 2 ̆ 6 Bradstreet (D 2 ̆ 6 B). From 25, 580 Australian firms compiled by the database at June 2002, 9646 firms were based in New South Wales. From this number, 299 firms were selected for sample. A mailed questionnaire was sent to the selected firms and 20. 4 percent were found to be useable for analysis. The first part of analysis is essentially descriptive concerning the Australian firms 2 ̆ 7 practices on foreign exchange exposure management. The description covers issues that are classified into exposure identification, policy adoption, and the techniques used in foreign exchange exposure management. Three types of foreign exchange exposures, translation, transaction, and economic exposures have been recognized by Australian firms of which transaction exposure is the most important form. Most of the surveyed firms identified that foreign sales and purchases were the major source of transaction exposure while forecasts based on 2 ̆ 7 orders 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 cash-bycurrency 2 ̆ 7 were the principle techniques used for identification. An analysis on translation exposure revealed that the majority of participating firms do not manage this exposure because it is perceived as either not real or it is primarily addressed only at headquarters. A particular analysis on economic exposure showed that many Australian firms recognized this exposure type although only few firms managed it. This indicates an increase in the awareness of this type of exposure. The analysis also described major aspects of foreign exchange exposure management policy. Most of the participating firms stated that 2 ̆ 7 the volatility of the foreign exchange of currency with which they are dealing 2 ̆ 7 is the major factor driving the firms 2 ̆ 7 foreign exchange exposure management. In terms of objectives, Australian firms tend to be more conservative and a passive policy is shown to be most popular. A particular analysis on forecasting policy also revealed that most firms undertake formal foreign exchange forecasts which are mostly supplied by banks in particular forms, namely, 2 ̆ 7 indication of expected direction of movement 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 point estimate of the expected rate at given future date 2 ̆ 7. As with previous studies, it is also reaffirmed that Australian firms have a high degree of centralization. Finally, the use of internal and external techniques in this study showed that the most two popular internal techniques are 2 ̆ 7 netting 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 a <b>multi-currency</b> billing <b>system</b> 2 ̆ 7. This study also found that there are a large number of firms that do not use any internal techniques due to insufficient information technology skills. With respect to the external techniques, forward contract is the most popular technique used. The analysis in this study is then carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the firms 2 ̆ 7 practices on foreign exchange exposure management. In general, this study suggests ineffective practices found in many exposure-management elements. In terms of identification, economic exposure is the only exposure that has not been properly identified and it appears to be properly managed by only a few firms. With respect to policy adoption, most Australian firms have a conservative attitude in their foreign exchange exposure management, which is reflected in their preference for a passive policy. Implementing a passive policy, particularly for firms with transaction exposure as their major type, is ineffective because most of the surveyed firms have sufficient forecasting components and a higher degree of centralization. In terms of techniques used, it appears that forward contracts are used as an implementation of passive policy although the use of the forward contracts in this way is arguably ineffective. This is because most Australian firms have employed a sufficient forecasting policy concentrating on currencies they are dealing with in the form of either 2 ̆ 7 an indication of expected direction of movement 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 point of estimate at a given future date 2 ̆ 7. By having this forecasting information, it is possible to save costs by adopting a more active policy. Finally, there are firm-specific factors that apparently contribute to the firms 2 ̆ 7 practices on foreign exchange exposure management. Chi-squared tests for independence are used to investigate the association between firm-specific variables (firm size, the degree of foreign involvement, and ownership) and management practice variables (the adoption of either an active or passive policy, the degree of centralization and the techniques used). Although, there is no conclusive result, it appears that larger firms use more varied techniques than smaller firms because firm size implies greater resources that are available to cover the costs and potentially have a greater access to expertise. The degree of foreign involvement was found to be the only significant variable associated with the adoption of either an active or passive policy. This also suggests a more conservative attitude amongst firms. The degree of centralization is also another management practice variable found to be the only variable that has a significant association with ownership. It appears that foreign-owned firms need head office approval for foreign borrowing or lending of funds, conducting business involving foreign currencies, and entering into the foreign exchange markets for hedging purposes. Finally, there is a significant association between the degree of centralization and the adoption of either an active or passive policy. This provides a better result than previous studies that suggest an active policy when centralization is implemented. However, it has been found here that Australian firms tend to adopt a passive policy, even though a higher degree of centralization is implemented...|$|R

After the current financial crisis, the defect of one currency dominance has been exposed and the <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> is expected to be established to diversify the foreign exchange reserve holdings. Given that China overtook Japan and became the world’s second largest economy in 2010 and its significant role in global trade, its currency the renminbi (RMB) emerges as a potential international currency. Because of benefits being an international currency, this promotion is desirable in China. Efforts have been made especially in the offshore market Hong Kong in recent years. However, there are also risks lying ahead as the financial system in China is still defective. The process of internationalising the RMB mainly depends on the pace of liberalising its capital account and releasing restrictions on its domestic financial market, which is determined by authorities’ consideration associated with benefits and risks.

The study set out to analyse the determinants of private investment post {{the introduction of the}} <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> in Zimbabwe (2009 - 2011). This was prompted by the sluggish growth in private investment thereby crippling the economy?s growth on the large. Variables identified for the study include political risk, GDP, national savings, inflation, interest rates, public investment, trade terms and debt servicing. To enhance the analysis, the study assumed correlation analysis and multiple regression in an effort to examine how private investment related to each identified variable as well as the net effect of each variable on private investment. Though most results from correlation analysis are contrary to the research?s expectations, treating the variables for co and multicollinearity gave theory aligned results in regression analysis. The study, though not out rightly disregarding correlation results identifies political risk, interest rate, GDP, debt servicing and trade terms as key determinants of private investment over the study period. Key though is the realisation that, statistical significance of results is independent of the practicality of economic principles.

40|$|In November 2008 the G 20 {{became the}} premier forum for {{international}} {{economic and financial}} affairs. As a result, the international monetary system has come to reflect {{the transformation of the}} global economy brought about by China’s emergence as the second largest economy and major exporter, and by the related limits of international governance, especially of the so-called Bretton Woods institutions. This article argues that Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People’s Bank of China, started an international debate about the shortfalls of the international monetary system in March 2009, after which China pursued the internationalization of its own currency, the renminbi, to turn it into one of the key international currencies. To this purpose, China has put together a policy framework that facilitates the international use of the renminbi without opening domestic capital markets — a requisite for a fully convertible international currency. This article discusses the renminbi’s trajectory {{over the last five years}} and suggests that it has become more regionalized rather than internationalized. It also discusses the challenges that Chinese authorities experience as they try to put the renminbi in the pockets of foreign investors and at the same time maintain control — “managed convertibility” — of capital flows in and out of the domestic market. The article concludes that the decision to include the renminbi in the International Monetary Fund’s basket for its special drawing rights reflects expectations that the international monetary system will shift from a dollar-dominated to a <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system.</b> However, this will take several years; in the meantime, international governance will continue to reflect the influences of the issuers of the key international currencies...|$|E
40|$|M. A. This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} how poor households struggled to keep children {{in the school system}} during a protracted political and socio-economic crisis in post- 2000 Zimbabwe. The setting of the research is Nyamande village in Murewa District, Zimbabwe. Fieldwork was conducted between May 2010 and July 2010, at a time that many believe to be past the peak of Zimbabwe’s crisis in 2008. In-depth interviews and observations were used to collect qualitative data from families and households in Nyamande village. My findings revealed that even when such households did not get surplus produce, they still sold what they had in order to obtain income to fund their children’s schooling. Households supplemented their farm produce with off-farm activities such as casual labour on plots, informal trading and sale of assets. Child labour was also employed as a means of supplementing family income in order to meet schooling requirements through activities such as casual labour on farms and roadside selling of produce. The introduction of the <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> or dollarisation (as it was commonly known) in April 2009 improved the conditions in Zimbabwe to some extent; however complexities experienced in Nyamande village included access to the US dollar and Rand currencies. These challenges led to the re-emergence of the barter or exchange system during and after dollarisation as most households adopted this as a strategy to provide for their children’s schooling. Although households displayed various forms of resilience in their efforts to keep children in school, interventions regarding the viability and sustainability of some of these strategies should be considered. Various stakeholders including government, private sector and non-government organisations need to play an active role in uplifting rural communities in promoting children’s schooling...|$|E

Most people are earning below the Poverty Datum Line (PDL) and this makes the decision making even more difficult on what to buy with their limited incomes. This is compounded by the use of <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> which is dominated by the use of the US dollar and SA rand. This study is an investigation into the decision making styles among female students in tertiary institutions in Bulawayo, in their process of what products and services to buy. Consumer Style Inventory (CSI) Model suggested by Sproles and Kendall, (1986) has been used to find out the characteristics of these styles among the tertiary female students in Bulawayo. A survey design was adopted in form of a structured questionnaire, which was used to collect data from a sample of 100 female students. The study reveals the following consumer decision making styles among female tertiary students: Confused by over choice, Novelty and fashion consciousness, Brand consciousness and prices equals quality, Perfectionism and high quality consciousness, Habitual and brand loyalty orientation, and Recreational and hedonistic. However the study did not confirm Price Consciousness and value for money and Impulsiveness and carelessness. Also the study reveals that consumer decision making styles are affected by the sudden increase range of products, and increased in retail shops especially the proliferation of Chinese shops. Analysis took the form of computation of means and frequency distributions. The study recommends that manufacturers should try to brand their goods if they are targeting this group...|$|E

From the perspective of its redistribution, we distinguish three basic means of power: The ownership of material and immaterial properties, the kind of organisation and the values according to which properties and their organisation are handled. This framework permits us to identify crucial power structures in less industrialised and industrial countries and within the financial, real productive, political and social subsystems of the society and allows us to sketch strategies for re{{distribution of}} societal power: Industrial countries have to reduce their real and financial capital inputs in favour of higher human capital investments and increase their direct investments in less industrialised countries, supported by a Global Marshall Plan. Less industrialised countries need to enhance both their industrial and alternative sectors, establish more democratic structures and human-centered educational systems. By these cooperative strategies the costs of former colonialism can be partly refunded. The main obstacle for such global cooperation is the global financial system, which has to be decentralised towards a <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system,</b> including regional currencies and barter. In the real productive sector, financial governance and capital-oriented hierarchies should be markedly reduced, which will increase creativity and productivity of work, underpinned by an enlarged human-centered education. Redistributing the prevailing power of the financial and productive sector rests considerably on democratic governance, which has to include increasing informal and legitimate interests and prevent plutocratic tendencies. For this, an economic democracy should be evolved where each individual not only has a vote, but also a guaranteed minimum income. Individual security, welfare and well-being are the foundations for higher creativity and productivity and ensure for each individual more freedom to organise themselves according to their own values. Extending the increasing individual social power to a large population creates social capital, which will accelerate the transition into a human-centered societal development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of monetary policy on the general price level in Zimbabwe during periods of hyperinflation and dollarisation. The {{first part of the}} analysis covers the period January 2006 to July 2008 when the country experienced high inflation and ultimately hyperinflation. The second part covers the period 2009 to 2012, when the country adopted the <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> and became fully dollarised. In terms of motivation, the study firstly sought to empirically examine the factors that led to hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, paying particular attention to {{the influence of}} monetary policy. Secondly, the thesis sought to determine the major factors that influenced price formation in a dollarised Zimbabwean economy; a completely new macro-economic environment. A significant development in this new macro-economic environment was the loss of monetary policy autonomy of the central bank, which also contributed to the relevance of the study. This thesis makes two contributions. The first contribution is the finding that hyperinflation in Zimbabwe was caused by expansionary monetary policy {{as a result of the}} activities of an unrestrained and unaccountable central bank. The second contribution was the empirical finding that in the fully dollarised economy inflation is largely determined by external factors. This implies that the domestic economy has no control over domestic inflation developments and as such, Zimbabwean authorities should formulate appropriate economic policies to respond to the impact of external shocks on domestic price formation when the need arises. The role of monetary policy in Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation episode is assessed using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and the Error Correction Model (ECM) approaches with monthly data from January 2006 to July 2008. The impact of monetary policy on hyperinflation is captured by the coefficient of broad money supply and the interest rate. Results indicate that hyperinflation was caused by expansionary monetary policy, the exchange rate premium and inflation expectations for both the short and long term. Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation episode which peaked during the period 2007 to 2008 brings to the fore the importance of ensuring that the central bank is independent in executing its mandate of influencing the monetary policy process in a manner that ensures price stability. The ARDL and ECM approaches are also used to explore the dynamics of inflation in the dollarised Zimbabwean economy, with monthly data from January 2009 to December 2012. The main drivers of inflation under the <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> were found to be the United States of America dollar/South African rand exchange rate, international oil prices, inflation expectations and the South African inflation rate. The findings contrast with the hyperinflationary era, where empirical studies have cited excessive money supply growth as the major driver of inflation dynamics in Zimbabwe. The results also suggest a higher exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices, consistent with empirical literature which postulates that inflation in dollarised economies is largely explained by movements in the exchange rate of major trading partners and international prices. The policy implication from the analysis is the need for policy makers to aggressively promote policies that ensure increased productivity of the economy. An improvement in productivity would influence the relative prices of tradable and non-tradable goods and ultimately the general price level in the economy. The study also quantified the independence of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) using the Mathew (2006), “new index for institutional quality” and the results showed that the RBZ is not an independent central bank. The central bank is found to have a low index of central bank independence (CBI), against a high level of inflation. While this relationship does not imply causality it can be inferred that the lack of independence of the RBZ could have influenced inflation dynamics in Zimbabwe. Only a subordinated central bank can be compelled to engage in inflationary deficit financing and also fund quasi-fiscal activities. The provisions of the RBZ Act [Chapter 22 : 15] in their current form make the central bank an appendage of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and this has, to a large extent, resulted in conflict between the political goals of government and the central bank’s primary objective of achieving price stability. In the event that Zimbabwe reintroduces its own currency in future, the achievement of the primary goal of price stability by the central bank will only be realised if the apex bank is given more autonomy...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{marketing}} {{also referred}} to as traditional marketing, has been criticised for trying to appeal to everyone, without necessarily providing for customers’ needs and wants. Therefore, the traditional marketing mix has been deemed ineffectual in a highly competitive and ever-changing business world, especially in the banking sector. Changes in the marketing environment have {{led to the development of}} new concepts such as relationship marketing. The fundamental concept of relationship marketing involves maximising the longterm benefits for the bank and the customer, resulting in a series of transactions, which allow a long-term relationship to be established and maintained. In short, it is a marketing concept that revolves around building and maintaining a long-term link or bond with one’s customers. The Zimbabwean banking sector has been affected by the country`s political and economic turmoil over the past decade. The collapse of the economy has affected the banking sector and its relationship with clients. During the economic crisis, Zimbabwean banks were unable to meet the basic international requirements of the Basel Accord, and as such, no profits were made. Borrowers had problems repaying existing loans; and banks also became reluctant to lend more, as a liquidity problem in the financial system was prominent. In 2009, a new government was formed which introduced the <b>multi-currency</b> <b>system</b> and the economy went on a recovery path. Given the nature of the economy of Zimbabwe, relationship marketing becomes an indispensible marketing tool that banks can use. The main purpose of the research was to investigate the relevance of relationship marketing on the sustainability of Zimbabwean banks. Five independent variables (customer relations, product attributes, promotion and service delivery and information technology) were identified and were tested against one dependent variable (sustainability of banks). A positivist research paradigm approach was used to conduct the research. The approach uses the quantitative method of research to establish causal relationships. Null (Ho) and alternative hypotheses (Ha) were formulated in x order to test the relationship between variables. A five point Likert scale questionnaire was developed and administered in five major commercial banks in Harare, Zimbabwe namey; Banc ABC, Barclays bank, Commercial Banks of Zimbabwe, Stanbic Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. The five major banks were selected in terms of market capitalisation as well as total deposit share among other things. The empirical results revealed that five of the independent variables positively correlated with the dependent variable implying that they all have an impact on bank sustainability. However, the current situation (2011) in Zimbabwe shows that only two independent variables (product variables and service delivery) have any impact on bank sustainability. In other words, there was a relationship between product attributes and sustainability of banks. Additionally, there was a relationship between service delivery and sustainability of Zimbabwean banks. Conclusions sited that product attributes and service delivery, as variables of relationship marketing, if implemented desirably could salvage the lost confidence and contribute to bank sustainability in Zimbabwe. Therefore, recommendations given by the researcher extensively focused on the two variables that have a relationship with Zimbabwean banks’ sustainability; briefly on the three variables (customer relations, promotion and information technology) that had no relationshi...|$|E
