25|$|As part of {{the project}} to limit the powers of government, various liberal theorists such as James Madison and the Baron de Montesquieu {{conceived}} the notion of separation of powers, a system designed to equally distribute governmental authority among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Governments had to realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and revolution, if needed. Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support limited constitutional government while also advocating for state services and provisions to ensure equal rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees of individual rights are irrelevant when individuals lack the <b>material</b> <b>means</b> to benefit from those rights and call for a greater role for government in the administration of economic affairs.|$|E

25|$|For those reasons, law {{enforcement}} now attempts to apprehend suspected cybercriminals with their computers on and in use, all accounts {{both on the}} computer and online open and logged in, thus easily searchable. If they do not succeed in seizing the computer in that condition, there are some methods available to bypass password protection, but these may take more time than police have available. Nor may it be legally possible to compel the suspect to relinquish his or her password—in the United States, where many computer-crime investigations take place, courts have distinguished between forcing a suspect to use <b>material</b> <b>means</b> of protecting data such as a thumbprint, retinal scan or key {{as opposed to a}} password or passcode, which is purely the product of the suspect's mental processes and is thus protected from compelled disclosure by the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Veblen {{generalized}} {{the conflict}} between businessmen and engineers by saying that human society would always involve conflict between existing norms with vested interests and new norms developed out of an innate human tendency to manipulate and learn about the physical {{world in which we}} exist. He also generalized his model to include his theory of instincts, processes of evolution as absorbed from Sumner, as enhanced by his own reading of evolutionary science, and pragmatic philosophy first learned from Peirce. The instinct of idle curiosity led humans to manipulate nature in new ways and this led to changes in what he called the <b>material</b> <b>means</b> of life. Because, as per the pragmatists, our ideas about the world are a human construct rather than mirrors of reality, changing ways of manipulating nature lead to changing constructs and to changing notions of truth and authority as well as patterns of behavior (institutions). Societies and economies evolve as a consequence, but do so via a process of conflict between vested interests and older forms and the new. Veblen never wrote with any confidence that the new ways were better ways, but he was sure in the last three decades of his life that the American economy could, in the absence of vested interests, have produced more for more people. In the years just after World War I he looked to engineers to make the American economy more efficient.|$|E

The production team had twelve days to shoot each episode, which director Douglas Mackinnon says {{was the biggest}} challenge of the project. The required amount of material was shot {{for most of the}} episodes. However, an extra twenty minutes of material was filmed for episode six. Director Matt Lipsey recalls that the team struggled to cut the extra material whilst maintaining the integrity of the episode. Lipsey credits Moffat for not [...] "being precious" [...] over his material during the editing process, and points out that his willingness to cut superfluous <b>material</b> <b>means</b> that he is taken seriously when he argues for something to be retained.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Psychiatric Bulletin of the Royal College of Psychiatrists {{published}} the article [...] "Compulsion in psychiatry: blessing or curse?" [...] by Russian psychiatrist Anatoly Koryagin. It contains {{analysis of the}} abuse of psychiatry and eight arguments by which {{the existence of a}} system of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR cаn easily be demonstrated. As Koryagin wrote, in a dictatorial State with a totalitarian regime, such as the USSR, the laws have at all times served not the purpose of self-regulation of the life of society but {{have been one of the}} major levers by which to manipulate the behavior of subjects. Every Soviet citizen has constantly been straight considered state property and been regarded not as the aim, but as a means to achieve the rulers' objectives. From the perspective of state pragmatism, a mentally sick person was regarded as a burden to society, using up the state's <b>material</b> <b>means</b> without recompense and not producing anything, and even potentially capable of inflicting harm. Therefore, the Soviet State never considered it reasonable to pass special legislative acts protecting the material and legal part of the patients' life. It was only instructions of the legal and medical departments that stipulated certain rules of handling the mentally sick and imposing different sanctions on them. A person with a mental disorder was automatically divested of all rights and depended entirely on the psychiatrists' will. Practically anybody could undergo psychiatric examination on the most senseless grounds and the issued diagnosis turned him into a person without rights. It was this lack of legal rights and guarantees that advantaged a system of repressive psychiatry in the country.|$|E

The island that has been promised him always floats before him like the air-drawn dagger before Macbeth, and beckons him on. The whole character is exquisite. And, fitly enough, when he at last becomes governor of his imaginary island of Barataria, he makes an excellent magistrate--because statesmanship depends for its success so much less on abstract principle than on precisely that traditional wisdom in which Sancho was rich.|$|E
