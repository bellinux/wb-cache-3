40|$|Abstract Background The {{diagnosis}} of uterine smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> {{depends on a}} combination of microscopic features. However, a small number of these tumors still pose difficult diagnostic challenges. Aim To investigate progesterone receptor (PR) and p 53 expression in leiomyomas (LMs), atypical leiomyomas (ALMs), smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP), and leiomyosarcomas (LMSs) and to evaluate the potential utility of the selected immunohistochemical markers in differentiating these tumors. Materials and methods Immunohistochemical expression of PR and p 53 was investigated in 41 uterine smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> comprising: 15 LMS, 4 STUMP, 6 ALM and 16 LM. Quantitative evaluation of PR and p 53 expression was graded on a scale from 0 to 3 +. Results Leiomyosarcomas showed reduced PR expression. All LMs as well as ALMs and STUMP were stained intensely for PR. Conversely, LMS was strongly stained with p 53, while the three non-sarcomatous groups (STUMP, ALM, LM) were either entirely negative or weakly stained for p 53. Regarding both PR and p 53 expression, the difference between the LMS group and the three non-sarcomatous groups was highly significant (p Conclusion Immunohistochemistry for PR and p 53 is valuable as an adjunct tool to morphological assessment of problematic uterine smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVascular smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> {{are very}} rare. They can be benign or malign. Intravascular leiomyomatosis is a benign {{neoplasm}} that extends through the veins and caries significant morbidity. Angioleiomyoma is a benign neoplasm of the extremities that caries minimal morbidity. Vascular leiomyosarcomas are malign neoplasms derived from vascular smooth cells. They are usually localized to the inferior vena cava, {{but can also}} arise from the pulmonary arteries or veins or other peripheral vessels.

Such case is presented here. We present {{a case of a}} large smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor</b> located in the mesentery of a 48 years old patient. The histopathologic features of the surgically excised tumor were that of a benign-appearing smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor,</b> either a primary mesenteric smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor</b> of unknown biologic behavior or a parasitic leiomyoma. The patient was discharged 4 days after from the hospital without any early postoperative complication. Close followup was further decided. Nine months after her primary therapy, our patient is alive and with no evidence of recurrent disease.

40|$|A 48 -year-old woman {{underwent}} total abdominal hysterectomy with {{conservation of}} the ovaries and tubes. Histology showed a well-circumscribed smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor</b> with foci of degeneration (including infarct-type necrosis) but no coagulative tumor cell necrosis and only mild focal cytological atypia. She presented, 24 years later with {{shortness of breath}} and abdominal distension and underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, omental biopsy and para-aortic lymph node sampling. Histology showed bilateral ovarian smooth muscle tumors with no coagulative tumor cell necrosis or significant cellular atypia. The cells were mitotically active. The tumors in both ovaries were most likely secondary to the previous uterine smooth muscle neoplasm. To our knowledge, this case {{is the first in}} the literature to describe a benign cellular leiomyoma that subsequently behaved as a smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor</b> of uncertain malignant potential, which recurred 24 years after the initial diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Background Rhabdomyosarcoma {{is a rare}} {{malignant}} skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor.</b> It mainly {{occurs in}} {{children and young adults}} and has an unsatisfactory prognosis. Prior studies showed a direct myotoxic effect of bupivacaine on differentiated muscle cells in vitro and in vivo. Exact mechanisms of this myotoxicity are still not fully understood, but a myotoxic effect on malignant <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor</b> cells has not been examined so far. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} examine if bupivacaine has cytotoxic effects on rhabdomyosarcoma cells, immortalized muscle cells and differentiated muscle cells. Methods Cell lines of rhabdomyosarcoma cells, immortalized muscle cells and differentiated muscle cells were established. After microscopic identification, cells were exposed to various concentrations of bupivacaine (500, 1, 000, 1, 750, 2, 500 and 5, 000 ppm) for 1 and 2 h, respectively. 24 and 28 h after incubation the cultures were stained with propidium iodid and analyzed by flow cytometry.

40|$|Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> are a {{group of}} {{intramural}} GI tumors formerly known as leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. This retrospective study was made to review our experience in surgical management of GI smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors.</b> Methods: The clinical records for patients with GI smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> during 1993 - 1999 were reviewed. Results: Ten tumors were located in stomach. Abdominal pain was the main presenting symptom followed by GI bleeding. The preoperative diagnosis was made by enhanced computerized tomography (CT) on eleven patients out of thirteen, while upper GI endoscopy with biopsy identified six tumors out of thirteen patients had the test. Tumors were treated by conservative excision in four and radical excision in fourteen. Histology was leiomyoma in six patients (with mitotic figures &# 60; 4 per 10 high power field) and leiomyosarcoma was found in twelve patients (with mitotic figures&# 62; 4 per 10 high power field). Median follow-up was 4 years. There was one recurrence for leiomyoma (size: 6 cm). All patients with leiomyosarcoma presented later with metastasis and died. Conclusion: Size and mitotic activity of tumors are the main determinant factors. Enhanced CT remains the proper diagnostic tool...|$|R
40|$|Mesenchymal tumors of {{the lower}} {{reproductive}} tract of women are poorly understood {{at the molecular level}} as a result in part of the lack of relevant animal models. The present study describes a novel model of gynecological smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> in which these neoplasms arise in Eker rats as part of a familial cancer syndrome. The tumors develop {{as a result of a}} germline mutation in the tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC 2) gene, and predisposition to tumor development is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Uterine and/or cervical tumors arise spontaneously as single or multicentric neoplasms and increase in incidence with increasing age. The tumors were classified into three phenotypic variants of leiomyoma/leiomyosarcoma and into stromal cervicovaginal tumors on the basis of cytological and histological features and immunostaining patterns for smooth muscle actin and desmin. Tumors histologically identical to the typical human myometrial leiomyoma arose, as did a subset of atypical leiomyomas having an epithelioid phenotype. Eker rats were found to develop both benign and malignant smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors.</b> The high spontaneous incidence of smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> of uterus and cervix in this rodent model provides a unique opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of these clinically important gynecological neoplasms...|$|R
