500|$|Filming {{took place}} between 28 May and 13 July 1956. The film's budget, at £92,000, was much larger than that of The Quatermass Xperiment. The bigger budget was {{achieved}} by the advance sale of the distribution rights in the United States to United Artists. United Artists contributed some £64,000 towards {{the production of the}} film, as well as Brian Donlevy's $25,000 fee and his airfare to London from the US. The larger budget allowed for greater use of location filming in the making of the film than had been possible for its predecessor. The key location used was the oil refinery at Shell Haven in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, on the Thames Estuary, which represented the secret Winnerden Flats complex. This was exactly the same location as used in the BBC television production of the story. Despite its size, the plant was run by {{a relatively small number of}} personnel, which made Guest's job of making the plant appear eerily deserted easier. Guest was also surprised at how relaxed the plant's management were about allowing him to stage the climactic gun battle at such a potentially flammable location. Focus puller Harry Oakes recalled, however, that a Newman-Sinclair clockwork camera had to be used for some scenes because of the danger posed by sparks from electrical equipment. The scenes of Vincent Broadhead emerging from one of the domes covered in the noxious black slime were particularly difficult to realise, necessitating many retakes. Tom Chatto, playing Broadhead, whose wife was a leading casting director, joked after the scene was finally completed, [...] "Remind <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my wife about casting me in this". The Shell Haven location was further enhanced by the use of matte paintings created by special effects designer Les Bowie to add the giant domes within which the aliens were incubated.|$|E
2500|$|A 2004 NPR survey {{indicated}} {{that the majority of}} the 1001 parent groups polled wanted complete sex education in schools, as over 80% agreed with the statement [...] "Sex education in school makes it easier for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my child about sexual issues", and under 17% of polled parents agreed with the statement that their children were being exposed to [...] "subjects I don't think my child should be discussing". An additional 90% believed that their children’s sexual education was “not too early,” and 49% of the respondents were [...] "somewhat confident" [...] that the values taught in their children's sexual education classes were similar to those taught at home, with 23% of polled parents being somewhat less confident.|$|E
2500|$|In the 108th Congress, a {{preliminary}} Medicare vote passed 216–215, {{a vote on}} Head Start passed 217–216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209-208, and [...] "Fast track", usually called [...] "trade promotion authority", passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as [...] "growing the vote". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists {{in the process of}} passing House bills. One lobbyist said, [...] "I've had members pull me aside and ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill—at least like they are asking us to whip bills now." [...] His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear Rosy, {{you don't}} expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> much <b>to</b> such a {{conceited}} ass as that, I hope," [...] said Lydgate, brusquely. [...] "If {{he got his}} head broken, I might look at it with interest, not before." ...|$|R
2500|$|Elvis Presley {{reportedly}} spent {{days and}} nights with his friends and employees from the Memphis Mafia. They were a big family and Elvis lived in a [...] "milieu of a protective brotherhood." [...] Gerald Marzorati says that Elvis [...] "couldn't go anywhere else without a phalanx of boyhood friends." [...] Even the girls he dated lamented, [...] "Whenever you were with Elvis {{for the most part}} you were with his entourage. Those guys were always around". According to the singer's cousin Billy Smith, Elvis got into bed with Smith and his wife Jo [...] "many times at Graceland when we would spend the night there in Lisa's room, or on tour in the hotel, and at the trailer on the property at Graceland. ... we were all three there talking for hours about everything in the world! Sometimes he would have a bad dream and come looking for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> and he would actually fall asleep in our bed with us. That happened a lot of times, and we thought nothing of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Mark Crispin Miller, Graceland became for Presley [...] "the {{home of the}} {{organization}} that was himself, was tended by a large vague clan of Presleys and deputy Presleys, each squandering the vast gratuities which Elvis used to keep his whole world smiling." [...] The author adds that Presley's father Vernon [...] "had a swimming pool in his bedroom", that there [...] "was a jukebox next to the swimming pool, containing Elvis' favorite records" [...] and that the singer himself [...] "would spend hours in his bedroom, watching his property on a closed-circuit television." [...] According to the singer's cousin, Billy Smith, Presley {{spent the night at}} Graceland with Smith and his wife Jo many times: [...] "we were all three there talking for hours about everything in the world! Sometimes he would have a bad dream and come looking for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> and he would actually fall asleep in our bed with us." [...] Priscilla Beaulieu also lived at Graceland for five years before she and Elvis wed in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 1, 1967. Their daughter Lisa Marie Presley was born on February 1, 1968, and spent the first years of her life on the estate until her parents divorced in 1972, and she moved to California with her mother. Every year around Christmas, Lisa Marie Presley and all her family would go to Graceland to celebrate Christmas together. Lisa Marie often goes back to Graceland for visits.|$|E

[...] "It does <b>me</b> good <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you--after {{the life}} I've lived, this {{everlasting}} loafing comes mighty hard <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I believe once I {{knew we were}} victorious I could let go everything and die happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack, you're being double-crossed here--an' by more 'n one," [...] he said, deliberately. [...] "But if {{you want}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> you've got <b>to</b> {{guarantee}} no gun-play." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No; he's {{preoccupied with}} other matters {{that he wanted}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about," [...] said her husband, hesitatingly. [...] "He is--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there must}} be something. You have given <b>me</b> no chance <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, and I {{wanted to know if}} you'd let <b>me</b> speak <b>to</b> Father Naab." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Please don’t {{discourage}} her, Lady Canterville,” Jackson firmly said; “and give <b>me</b> {{a chance}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{her a little}} more myself. You haven’t given me much chance, you know.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay, I am {{sure you}} cannot have a better; for if I do not know anybody, it is {{impossible}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them; and, besides, I do not want to talk to anybody." ...|$|E

60|$|LADY BASILDON. [Looking round {{through her}} lorgnette.] I don’t see anybody here to-night whom one could {{possibly}} call a serious purpose. The {{man who took}} <b>me</b> in <b>to</b> dinner <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about his wife the whole time.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nuflo?" [...] She {{spoke as}} if putting a {{question}} to herself. [...] "Is that {{an old man with}} two dogs that lives somewhere in the wood?" [...] And then, with sudden petulance: [...] "And you ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you!" ...|$|E
60|$|Arthur was {{standing}} with his back <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Isobel. Certainly her welcome was flattering enough.

6000|$|... "I'm {{not quite}} sure I {{understand}} you," [...] said the young officer. [...] "People who want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> plain. Still, I suppose one has always a certain sympathy for the fellow who gets himself killed decently." ...|$|R
