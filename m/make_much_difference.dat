5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>difference.</b>|$|E

But the Vikings responded with Cunningham's 53-yard completion to Reed setting up a 3-yard touchdown reception by Carter, narrowing the gap to 24-14.

[...] Richard Moe, in his book on the 1940 election, suggested that the nomination of Willkie left long-lasting scars on the Republican Party, with conservatives angered by the success of its Eastern Establishment wing; [...] "whatever else it did, Philadelphia gave birth to the bitter proprietary division within the Republican Party, one accentuated by ideology and geography, that would define the party for decades to come." [...] Among those converted from isolationism by Willkie's oratory, and who worked intensely on the Willkie campaign in Michigan, was Gerald R.

2500|$|However, {{the courts}} have had {{difficulty}} in defining appropriate principles for cases where trusts are declared over property that many people have an interest in. This is especially true where the person who possesses that property has gone insolvent. In Re Kayford Ltd a mail order business went insolvent and customers who had paid for goods wanted their money back. Megarry J held that because Kayford Ltd had put its money in a separate account the money was held on trust, and so the customers were not unsecured creditors. By contrast in Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd Oliver J held that customers who had bought wine bottles were not entitled to take their wine because no particular bottles had been identified for a trust to arise. A similar view was expressed by the Privy Council in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd, where the customers of an insolvent gold bullion reserve business {{were told that they}} never had been given particular gold bars, and so were unsecured creditors. These decisions were said to be motivated by the desire to not undermine the statutory priority system in insolvency, although it is not entirely clear why those policy reasons extended to consumers who are usually seen as [...] "non-adjusting" [...] creditors. However, in the leading Court of Appeal decision, Hunter v Moss, there was no insolvency issue. There, Moss had declared himself to be a trustee of 50 out of 950 shares he held in a company, and Hunter sought to enforce this declaration. Dillon LJ held that it did not matter that the 50 particular shares had not been identified or isolated, and they were held on trust. The same result was reached, however, in an insolvency decision by Neuberger J in the High Court, called Re Harvard Securities Ltd, where clients of a brokerage company were held to have had an equitable property interest in share capital held for them as a nominee. The view that appears to have been adopted is that if assets are [...] "fungible" [...] (i.e. swapping them with other will not <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>difference)</b> a declaration of trust can be made, so long as the purpose of the statutory priority rules in insolvency are not compromised.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Ori" [...] {{comes from}} the word [...] "Origin", as in {{the origin of the}} Ancients. When {{executive}} producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of [...] "origin", he retcon-invented the word [...] "Origin" [...] as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as [...] "how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?" [...] Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, {{it would be hard to}} present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>difference</b> for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the [...] "magic powers" [...] of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that [...] "it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do." [...] Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should [...] "first and foremost [...] entertain people", he considered it representative of television and the media, [...] "mak people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box [...] whatever they want you to believe they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people." [...] For Cooper, [...] "the followers of the Ori were the interesting part", and he [...] "wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that." [...] Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting [...] "mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes." [...] The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.|$|E
