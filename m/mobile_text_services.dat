As part of this initiative, surveys studying the adoption of general <b>mobile</b> commerce <b>services,</b> <b>text</b> messaging <b>services,</b> <b>mobile</b> payment services, mobile parking services, mobile gaming services and mobile contact services have been conducted. This paper presents the results of a study of multimedia messaging services. The paper is mainly written by Professor Per E.

40|$|What is {{the current}} state of mobile {{services}} among academic libraries of the country’s top 100 universities, and what are the best practices for librarians implementing mobile services at the university level? Through in-depth website visits and survey questionnaires, the authors studied each of the top 100 universities’ libraries’ experiences with mobile services. Results showed that all of these libraries offered at least one mobile service, and the majority offered multiple services. The most common mobile services offered were <b>mobile</b> sites, <b>text</b> messaging <b>services,</b> e-books, and mobile access to databases and the catalog. In addition, chat/IM services, social media accounts and apps were very popular.   Survey responses also indicated a trend towards responsive design for websites so that patrons can access the library’s full site on any mobile device. Respondents recommend that libraries considering offering mobile services begin as soon as possible as patron demand for these services is expected to increase...|$|R

To oppose this negative trend, public transport companies have to figure out ways to attract more car users. In order to be competitive, public transports have to become more attractive in several ways. Existing information systems focus on the travelers as a collective. We believe that more personalized and easily accessible services would {{have a positive impact on}} the usage of public transports. This thesis focuses on ways to increase the competitiveness of public transport, through improving mobile traveler information services. Through an ethnographical approach we have been able to identify needs of public transport travelers and make suggestions of useful mobile information services. Hence, our results consist of two separate parts. First, the identification of several different needs of the individual traveler, and secondly the suggestions of possible personalized and <b>mobile</b> information <b>services.</b> (<b>Text</b> in Swedish. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith the {{revolution}} of mobile devices and their applications, significant improvements have been witnessed over years to support new features {{in addition to}} normal phone communication including web browsing, social networking and entertainment, mobile payment, medical and personal records, e-learning, and rich connectivity to multiple networks. As mobile devices continue to evolve, the volume of hacking activities targeting them also increases drastically. Receiving short message spam {{is one of the}} common vectors for security breaches. Besides wasting resources and being annoying to end-users, it can be used for phishing attacks and as a vehicle for other malware types such as worms, backdoors, and key loggers. The next generation of mobile technologies has more emphasis on security-related issues to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability. This paper explores a number of content-based feature sets to enhance the <b>mobile</b> phone <b>text</b> messaging <b>services</b> in filtering unwanted messages (a. k. a. spam). Moreover, it develops a more effective spam filtering model using a combination of most relevant features and by fusing decisions of two machine learning algorithms with the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA). The performance has been evaluated empirically on two SMS spam datasets. The results showed that significant improvements can be achieved in the overall accuracy, recall and precision of spam and legitimate messages due to the application of the proposed DCA-based model...|$|R
