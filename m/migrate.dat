5|$|Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they <b>migrate</b> to calving/mating grounds.

Until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty milk. With the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales <b>migrate.</b> Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will <b>migrate</b> back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.|$|E

Colonies developing from slowly <b>migrating</b> cells had twice as many cells during exponential growth as did the most rapidly <b>migrating</b> cells, and the numbers of cells per colony at any time was inversely related to the electrophoretic migration rate. The DNA measurements by fluorescence flow cytometry indicates that the slowest <b>migrating</b> cell populations are enriched in cells that have twice as much DNA as the fastest <b>migrating</b> cells.

5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which neurons <b>migrate.</b> Without Tbr1, neurons fail to <b>migrate</b> properly.|$|E

In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells <b>migrate</b> {{to the top of a}} fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
