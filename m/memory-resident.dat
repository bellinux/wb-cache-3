2500|$|The BIOS and BDOS were <b>memory-resident,</b> {{while the}} CCP was <b>memory-resident</b> unless {{overwritten}} by an application, {{in which case}} it was automatically reloaded after the application finished running. A number of transient commands for standard utilities were also provided. The transient commands resided in files with the extension [...]COM on disk.|$|E
5000|$|ALTIBASE HDB is a {{so-called}} [...] "hybrid DBMS", {{meaning that it}} simultaneously supports access to both <b>memory-resident</b> and disk-resident tables via a single interface. It is compatible with Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, Linux, and Windows.It supports the complete SQL standard, features Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), implements Fuzzy and Ping-Pong Checkpointing for periodically backing up <b>memory-resident</b> data, and ships with Replication and Database Link functionality.|$|E

50|$|Atari DOS 2.0S {{consisted}} of two portions, a <b>memory-resident</b> portion that facilitated access to disk files by programs, and a disk-resident portion providing menu-driven utilities to format, copy, delete, rename, and otherwise manipulate files on Atari's 810 disk drive. The menu system was too large to keep <b>memory-resident,</b> but the necessity to reload the menu system after every program was frustrating to many users.|$|E

50|$|ABC, {{discovered}} in October 1992, is a <b>memory-resident,</b> file-infecting computer virus which infects EXE files and may alter both COM and EXE files. ABC activates on the 13th day of every month.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{reported}} in 2009 that several commercial security products required users to uninstall Spybot when they are being installed or run, due to stated incompatibility with <b>memory-resident</b> [...] "immunizer" [...] Teatimer.|$|E
50|$|When a YAFFS system mounts a NAND flash device, it must visit each {{block to}} check for valid data by {{scanning}} its spare area. With this information it then reconstitutes the <b>memory-resident</b> tree data structure.|$|E
5000|$|OS-9 keeps a [...] "module directory", a <b>memory-resident</b> {{list of all}} modules {{that are}} in memory either by having been loaded, or by having been found in ROM during an initial scan at boot time.|$|E
50|$|The ISA-based Action Replay needs <b>memory-resident</b> {{drivers for}} both the real and {{protected}} mode. The card has a grabber, a trainer, and a slowdown feature. It can also interrupt the current game or save it to disk (freezer).|$|E
50|$|Db for Dummies (DBD) is a flexible, lightweight, <b>memory-resident</b> database. Unlike {{traditional}} databases {{that store}} values in table-like structures, DBD stores data as {{a network of}} nodes. DBD manages tables, multi-rooted hierarchies, graphs and complex networks without user having to specify a schema.|$|E
50|$|Friday-15th causes {{infected}} {{files to}} grow by 1,813 bytes. If the virus is <b>memory-resident</b> and a program is run on Friday the 15th, the virus will create a new file with the same name as the program. It is needed to format your computer.|$|E
50|$|MS-DOS 3.3 was {{supplied}} with all PPCs, along with 'Organizer' - a <b>memory-resident</b> suite of utilities including a card file, diary, calculator and telephone dialler. In addition, the PPC 640 was {{supplied with}} Mirror II, a communications package {{for use with}} the built-in modem.|$|E
50|$|Cruncher is {{an example}} of a {{compression}} virus, a strain of which - Cruncher.2092 is described by McAfee as <b>memory-resident</b> virus that infects all but small com files, making them smaller. The reason for excluding small programs is that their infected versions will be bigger than their originals.|$|E
50|$|Upon infection, ABC becomes <b>memory-resident</b> {{at the top}} {{of system}} memory but below the 640K DOS {{boundary}} and hooks interrupts 16 and 1C. The copy of command.com pointed to by the COMSPEC environment variable may also be altered. ABC infects/alters COM and EXE files as they are executed.|$|E
50|$|When {{software}} queries a <b>memory-resident</b> {{agent that}} {{resides in the}} background, it responds by sending data in MIFs (Management Information Format) or activating MIF routines. Static data in a MIF would contain items such as model ID, serial number, memory- and port-addresses. A MIF routine could read memory and report its contents.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>memory-resident</b> [...] "footprint" [...] of OS/8 {{was only}} 256 words; 128 words {{at the top}} of Field 0 and 128 words {{at the top of}} Field 1. The rest of the {{operating}} system (the USR, [...] "User Service Routines") was swapped in and out of memory transparently (with regard to the user's program) as needed.|$|E
5000|$|Paul Houle's Enhanced DOSKEY is {{designed}} to be an enhanced drop-in replacement for the DOSKEY.COM that ships with MS-DOS and Windows 9x/Me. It also has a smaller disk and <b>memory-resident</b> footprint. The primary added feature is command and file [...] "auto-completion" [...] via the Tab key. Version 2.5, released in 2014, also adds full support for long filenames (LFN).|$|E
50|$|A systems manager {{may also}} install special CCL commands, which take {{precedence}} over all KBM commands (with the exception of DCL). A CCL is analogous to a shortcut to a program on a Windows system or a symbolic link on Unix-based systems. CCLs are installed as a <b>memory-resident</b> command either during startup, or dynamically while the system is running by a system's manager (i.e.: it is not permanent like a disk file).|$|E
50|$|Databases can be disk {{resident}}, memory resident or a hybrid. In {{the first}} case, all access to disk resident structures (both data or data index information), happens through an in-memory data cache {{maintained by the}} database server sub-system. Alternatively, the application can define database structures to reside in memory. An application can also define a database with mixed disk-based or <b>memory-resident</b> data structures. The data definition language of the engine supports mixing different storage types for any data structure.|$|E
50|$|ALTIBASE HDB is a in-memory database, {{relational}} {{database management system}} manufactured by Altibase Corporation. The software comes with a hybrid architecture which allows it to access both <b>memory-resident</b> and disk-resident tables using single interface. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous replication and offers real-time ACID compliance. Support is also offered {{for a variety of}} SQL standards and programming languages. Other important capabilities include data import and export, data encryption for security, multiple data access command sets, materialized view and temporary tables, and others.|$|E
50|$|The aim of NewIcons is {{to solve}} all these faults. Unlike a {{standard}} Workbench icon, which only includes palette index information and is thus {{at the mercy of}} the user's chosen Workbench palette, NewIcons icons are natively drawn in 32 colours (5-bit colour) and hold the actual RGB colour information in the icon file. A <b>memory-resident</b> program (called a Commodity in Amiga terminology) tries its best to adapt the icon's colours into the current Workbench screen palette. Up to 256 colour icons are supported by NewIcons system.|$|E
50|$|The base-model Tandy 2000 {{supported}} only a text-mode {{display in}} monochrome. The Tandy VM-1 monitor used the 8-pin video port on the computer's rear panel. The text-mode address space {{was in a}} different location but third-party <b>memory-resident</b> software hacks remedied this by copying the PC-compatible text-mode memory to the Tandy 2000's text space {{at a rate of}} 5-10 times per second. This sometimes caused some choppiness in the display. It produced a fast text display rate—often too fast to read—but the 'HOLD' key on the keyboard could be used to pause text output.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the first}} {{computer}} that might {{qualify as a}} [...] "workstation" [...] was the IBM 1620, a small scientific computer designed to be used interactively by a single person sitting at the console. It was introduced in 1960. One peculiar feature of the machine was that it lacked any actual arithmetic circuitry. To perform addition, it required a <b>memory-resident</b> table of decimal addition rules. This saved {{on the cost of}} logic circuitry, enabling IBM to make it inexpensive. The machine was code-named CADET and rented initially for $1000 a month.|$|E
50|$|The bootblock {{became an}} obvious target for virus writers. Some games or demos that used a custom bootblock {{would not work}} if {{infected}} with a bootblock virus, as the code of the virus replaced the original. The first such virus was the SCA virus. Anti-virus attempts included custom bootblocks. These amended bootblock advertised {{the presence of the}} virus checker while checking the system for tell-tale signs of <b>memory-resident</b> viruses and then passed control back to the system. Unfortunately these could not be used on disks that already relied on a custom bootblock, but did alert users to potential trouble. Several of them also replicated themselves across other disks, becoming little more than viruses in their own right.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>memory-resident</b> virus (or simply [...] "resident virus") {{installs}} {{itself as}} part of the operating system when executed, after which it remains in RAM from the time the computer is booted up to when it is shut down. Resident viruses overwrite interrupt handling code or other functions, and when the operating system attempts to access the target file or disk sector, the virus code intercepts the request and redirects the control flow to the replication module, infecting the target. In contrast, a non-memory-resident virus (or [...] "non-resident virus"), when executed, scans the disk for targets, infects them, and then exits (i.e. it does not remain in memory after it is done executing).|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{experimental}} distributed <b>memory-resident</b> databases advocate multi single-threaded core (MuSiC) transactional environments. [...] "Single-threaded" [...] {{refers to}} transaction threads only, and to serial execution of transactions. The purpose is possible {{orders of magnitude}} gain in performance (e.g., H-Store and VoltDB) relatively to conventional transaction execution in multiple threads on a same core. In what described below MuSiC is independent {{of the way the}} cores are distributed. They may reside in one integrated circuit (chip), or in many chips, possibly distributed geographically in many computers. In such an environment, if recoverable (transactional) data are partitioned among threads (cores), and it is implemented in the conventional way for distributed CO, as described in previous sections, then DOCO and Strictness exist automatically. However, downsides exist with this straightforward implementation of such environment, and its practicality as a general-purpose solution is questionable. On the other hand, tremendous performance gain can be achieved in applications that can bypass these downsides in most situations.|$|E
