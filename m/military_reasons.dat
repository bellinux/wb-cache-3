5|$|William's {{choice of}} Pevensey as a {{defensive}} location {{may not have been}} entirely due to practical <b>military</b> <b>reasons.</b> It also had political connotations, implying that the Normans were on a level with the Romans. He followed a similar pattern elsewhere in England, building the Tower of London alongside the still-extant Roman city wall and constructing Colchester Castle on top of the ruins of the Temple of Claudius.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, the Australian Government {{committed}} twelve Australian Army brigades {{to replace}} six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in Bougainville, New Britain and the Aitape–Wewak area in New Guinea {{in order to}} free up the American units for operations in the Philippines. While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions, their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed to destroy the remaining Japanese forces in these areas. The value of these campaigns was controversial {{at the time and}} remains so to this day as the Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political, rather than <b>military,</b> <b>reasons.</b> It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater influence in any post-war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia's influence in its region. Critics of these campaigns, such as author Peter Charlton, argue that they were unnecessary and wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective.|$|E
25|$|From ancient times, it {{has been}} used for hunting, {{religious}} reasons, and <b>military</b> <b>reasons</b> (such as camouflage and to indicate membership in a military unit). Recent archaeological research shows that Neanderthals had the capability and tools for face painting; although they are no longer considered a direct ancestor of homo sapiens, they lived alongside them in some areas and it is a reasonable assumption that humanity has painted faces and bodies since the very beginning.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} {{initiatives}} failed, often {{because of the}} assignment of generals to Grant for political rather than <b>military</b> <b>reasons.</b> Butler's Army of the James bogged down against inferior forces under P.G.T. Beauregard before Richmond in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign. Sigel was soundly defeated at the Battle of New Market in May and was soon afterward replaced by David Hunter. Banks was distracted by the Red River Campaign and failed to move on Mobile. However, Crook and Averell were able to cut the last railway linking Virginia and Tennessee, and Sherman's Atlanta campaign was a success, although it dragged on through the fall.|$|E
25|$|Doehring, who had {{discounted}} {{the growing}} discontent and longing for peace during the war, was taken completely {{aback by the}} people's revolutionary riots of 1918. In his condemnation of the January strikes, Doehring spoke of betrayal {{and may have been}} the first to evoke the stab-in-the-back legend, which held that Germany lost the First World War not for <b>military</b> <b>reasons</b> but due to unpatriotic elements at home. Doehring blamed the subsequent defeat in the war and the following November Revolution and claimed that these events were caused by the decline in Germany's Christian faith and values. For him, most of the blame lay with the Catholic Church and the socialist labor movement. He envisioned a reformation along the lines of Luther's as a solution for Germany.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, LKAB's {{predecessor}} Gellivare Aktiebolag {{is granted}} concession for mining in Malmberget. Four years later, {{the first part}} of the Ore Line, from Malmberget to Luleå, was completed. In 1889, the mining company filed for bankruptcy, and the Government of Sweden bought the line for 8 million Swedish krona (SEK), half the investment cost. Construction of the Ore Line and Ofoten Line from Gällevare to Narvik started in 1898 and was completed in 1902. A bridge, Norddalsbron, was built along the Ofoten Line, extra long for <b>military</b> <b>reasons,</b> to be able to cut the line in case of war. In 1940, during the war, the bridge was blown up. However, because of lack of explosives, the demolition was not well done, and the bridge could be repaired by the Germans.|$|E
5000|$|Churchill had {{continued}} to bridle at Lucas' perceived passivity. He had written on February 10 to General Alexander encouraging him to exert his authority and Alexander had visited the beachhead on February 14 to tell Lucas he wished for a breakout {{as soon as the}} tactical situation allowed. After his visit Alexander wrote to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Alan Brooke, saying: [...] I am disappointed with VI Corps Headquarters. They are negative and lacking in the necessary drive and enthusiasm to get things done. They appeared to have become depressed by events. [...] Lucas wrote in his diary on February 15: [...] I am afraid that the top side is not completely satisfied with my work... They are naturally disappointed that I failed to chase the Hun out of Italy but there was no <b>military</b> <b>reason</b> why I {{should have been able to}} do so.

Some sources state {{that there was}} a <b>military</b> <b>reason</b> to create a {{regiment}} of [...] "Long Guys" [...] because loading a muzzleloader is easier to handle for a taller soldier. Another source states that many of the men were unfit for combat due to their gigantism.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} campaign was criticized even by other {{opponents of the}} government. Rev. Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional Forum said on 14 March that while he sympathized with the <b>Military's</b> <b>reasons</b> for opposing government policies, it was unacceptable in a democracy for the Military {{to intervene in the}} electoral process and that such interference must be stopped. Fiji Village revealed the same day that Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola had filed another complaint with police about the Commander's public statements against the government.|$|R
25|$|Goring's {{return to}} the west had already been {{countermanded}} {{and he had been}} directed to march to Harborough, while the South Wales Royalists were also called in towards Leicester. Later orders on 26 May directed him to Newbury, whence he was to feel the strength of the enemy's positions around Oxford. It is hardly necessary to say that Goring found good <b>military</b> <b>reasons</b> for continuing his independent operations, and marched off towards Taunton regardless of the order. He redressed the balance there for the moment by overawing Massey's weak force, and his purse profited considerably by fresh opportunities for extortion, but he and his men were not at Naseby. Meanwhile, the King, at the geographical centre of England, found an important and wealthy town at his mercy. Rupert, always for action, took the opportunity, and Leicester was stormed and thoroughly pillaged {{on the night of the}} 30 May31 May.|$|E
25|$|In 545, Justinian legislated {{that the}} right of {{existence}} of any synagogue on land belonging to an ecclesiastical institution be nullified. He {{was also the first}} emperor to order that existing synagogues be converted into churches. There is, however, only one example of such a conversion taking place by force: the synagogue in Borem. This synagogue was most likely converted for <b>military</b> <b>reasons,</b> in light of its strategic position on the frontier with the territory of the Berber tribes. In fact, Justinian banned all non-Christian places of worship in northern Africa, in legislation that grouped Jews with pagans and heretics. This legislation was hardly enforced, but set a precedent for the violability of synagogues and the blurring of the difference between Jews and other non-Christians. Once more, this represents the divergence between the Empire's theological objectives, its pragmatic goals and its capability to enforce its legislation. The poor efficacy of legislation points to the dominating power of the latter in restraining the two former factors, which, in this case, coincided.|$|E
25|$|The BEF's {{manpower}} shortage was {{not solely}} {{the fault of}} the politicians. 120,000 men of the BEF general reserve were kept in Britain to help the economy by spending their wages there. There were too many troops in the Middle East (2 divisions were rushed from there to France after the German offensive began), but this was partly the fault of Robertson who had attempted to prevent action there by submitting inflated estimates of troop requirements. 88,000 BEF men were on leave when the German offensive began. Haig seems to have had little sympathy with the government’s political constraints – he was unhappy at their lack of vigour in conscripting organised labour (diary 23 December 1917, 10 March), whilst as late as 29 March, following the first German Spring Offensive, Haig would press for the extension of conscription to Ireland (not just for <b>military</b> <b>reasons</b> but “for the good of Ireland”, and disagreeing with the King). Although there were about 1.5m soldiers under Home Forces Command in the UK at any one time, nearly a third of these were sick or wounded and another third engaged on legitimate work for various branches of the Army. Only around a third were potentially available for service on the Western Front, the majority of these being in training or under nineteen. Eighteen-year olds had to be sent to France after the German Spring Offensives in 1918.|$|E
50|$|The {{experience}} during the 1960s {{of both the}} United States with the Manned Orbiting Laboratory and the Soviet Union with the Almaz space station suggests that the military usefulness of human spaceflight is quite limited and that practically all military uses of space are much more effectively performed by unmanned satellites. Thus while the Shenzhou orbital module {{could be used for}} military reconnaissance {{there appears to be no}} <b>military</b> <b>reason</b> for incorporating such a system in a manned mission, as China could use purely unmanned satellites for these purposes.|$|R
50|$|Soon after retiring, Hirabayashi {{received}} a call that would prove consequential. Peter Irons, {{a political science professor}} from the University of California, San Diego, had uncovered documents that clearly showed evidence of government misconduct in 1942—evidence that the government knew there was no <b>military</b> <b>reason</b> for the exclusion order but withheld that information from the United States Supreme Court. With this new information, Hirabayashi’s case was reheard by the federal courts, and in 1987 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a writ of coram nobis which overturned his criminal conviction.|$|R

500|$|The Tower was orientated {{with its}} strongest and most {{impressive}} defences overlooking Saxon London, which archaeologist Alan Vince suggests was deliberate. It would have visually dominated {{the surrounding area}} and stood out to traffic on the River Thames. The castle {{is made up of}} three [...] "wards", or enclosures. The innermost ward contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle. Encircling it to the north, east, and west is the inner ward, built during the reign of Richard the Lionheart (1189–1199). Finally, there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under EdwardI. Although there were several phases of expansion after William the Conqueror founded the Tower of London, the general layout has remained the same since EdwardI completed his rebuild in 1285. The castle encloses an area of almost [...] with a further [...] around the Tower of London constituting the Tower Liberties– land under the direct influence of the castle and cleared for <b>military</b> <b>reasons.</b> The precursor of the Liberties was laid out in the 13thcentury when HenryIII ordered that a strip of land adjacent to the castle be kept clear. Despite popular fiction, the Tower of London never had a permanent torture chamber, although the basement of the White Tower housed a rack in later periods. Tower Wharf was built {{on the bank of the}} Thames under EdwardI and was expanded to its current size during the reign of RichardII (1377–1399).|$|E

60|$|The 'Death March' was {{the least}} of the misfortunes caused by the storms. The violent rains {{produced}} floods such as had not been seen in the Soudan for fifty years. The water, pouring down the broad valleys, formed furious torrents in the narrower gorges. More than twelve miles of the railway was washed away. The rails were twisted and bent; the formation entirely destroyed. The telegraph wires were broken. The work of weeks was lost in a few hours. The advance was stopped as soon as it had been begun. At the moment when every <b>military</b> <b>reason</b> demanded speed and suddenness, a hideous delay became inevitable.|$|R

2500|$|India {{provides}} an example of the British Empire pouring its money and expertise into a very well built system designed for <b>military</b> <b>reasons</b> (after the Mutiny of 1857), with the hope that it would stimulate industry. The system was overbuilt and too expensive for the small amount of freight traffic it carried. [...] Christensen (1996), who looked at colonial purpose, local needs, capital, service, and private-versus-public interests, concluded that making the railways a creature of the state hindered success because railway expenses had to go through the same time-consuming and political budgeting process as did all other state expenses. Railway costs could therefore not be tailored to the timely needs of the railways or their passengers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organisation}} of {{the returns}} on a feudal basis, enabled the Conqueror and his officers {{to see the}} extent of a baron's possessions; and it also showed to what extent he had under-tenants, and {{the identities of the}} under-tenants. This was of great importance to William, not only for <b>military</b> <b>reasons,</b> but also because of his resolve to command the personal loyalty of the under-tenants (though the [...] "men" [...] of their lords) by making them swear allegiance to himself. As Domesday Book normally records only the Christian name of an under-tenant, {{it is not possible to}} search for the surnames of families claiming a Norman origin. Scholars, however, have worked to identify the under-tenants, most of whom have foreign Christian names.|$|E

60|$|Perceiving {{that he was}} {{in front}} of the whole Boer army, and knowing that he might expect reinforcements, Cookson decided to act upon the defensive. A {{position}} was rapidly taken up along the Brakspruit, and preparations made to resist the impending attack. The line of defence was roughly the line of the spruit, but for some reason, probably to establish a cross fire, one advanced position was occupied upon either flank. On the left flank was a farmhouse, which was held by two hundred men of the Artillery Rifles. On the extreme right was another outpost of twenty-four Canadians and forty-five Mounted Infantry. They occupied no defensible position, and their situation was evidently a most dangerous one, only to be justified by some strong <b>military</b> <b>reason</b> which is not explained by any account of the action.|$|R

[...] After the Rape of Nanking mosques in Nanjing were found to be filled with dead bodies. They also followed a policy of economic oppression which involved the destruction of mosques and Hui communities and made many Hui jobless and homeless. Another policy was one of deliberate humiliation. [...] This included soldiers smearing mosques with pork fat, forcing Hui to butcher pigs to feed the soldiers, and forcing girls to supposedly train as geishas and singers but in fact made them serve as sex slaves.

In early 1949 the Israeli army moved thousands of Bedouin from south and west of Beersheba to a concentration zone east of the town. In November 1949, 500 families were expelled across the border into Jordan and on September 2, 1950 some 4,000 Bedouin were forced across the border with Egypt., Only around 11,000 of the 110,000 Bedouin population remained in the Negev.|$|E
2500|$|Until mid-March 1939, Germany had {{considered}} that [...] "for <b>military</b> <b>reasons</b> a common Hungarian-Polish frontier was undesirable". [...] Indeed, Hitler had warned Hungary {{not to touch}} the remainder of Slovakia, when he authorized Hungary to occupy the rest of Carpathorus in March 1939. He meant to use Slovakia as a staging ground for his planned invasion of Poland. In March 1939 Hitler {{changed his mind about}} the common Hungarian-Polish frontier, and decided to betray Germany's ally, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, who had already in 1938 begun organizing Ukrainian military units in a sich outside Uzhhorod under German tutelage. Polish political and military authorities saw the sich as a real and present danger to nearby southeastern Poland, with its largely Ukrainian population. Hitler, however, was concerned that if a Ukrainian army organized in Rus were to accompany German forces invading the Soviet Union, Ukrainian nationalists would insist on the establishment of an independent Ukraine; Hitler, who had plans for the natural and farming resources of Ukraine, did not want {{to have to deal with}} an independent Ukrainian government.|$|E

From {{the beginning of the}} invasion, Árbenz was confident that Castillo Armas could be defeated militarily and expressed this confidence in public. But he was worried that a defeat for Castillo Armas would provoke a direct invasion by the U.S. military. This also contributed to his decision not to arm civilians initially; lacking a <b>military</b> <b>reason</b> to do so, this could have cost him the support of the army.
