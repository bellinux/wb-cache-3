5|$|A {{large-scale}} uprising {{erupted in}} Serbia following the Axis {{invasion of the}} Soviet Union in June 1941. Although they took no part in the rebellion, Jews were targeted for retaliatory execution by the Germans. The Germans soon implemented a number of anti-Jewish laws, {{and by the end}} of August 1941, all Serbian Jewish <b>males</b> <b>were</b> interned in concentration camps, primarily at Topovske Šupe in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|In nature, it was {{observed}} that males would venture away from the nest in order to attract females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it. This is used to attract females, and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. Interestingly, it was also found that on some occasions, <b>males</b> <b>were</b> attracted to other male scents.|$|E

50|$|<b>Male</b> hyraxes have <b>been</b> {{categorised}} {{into four}} classes: territorial, peripheral, early dispersers, and late dispersers. The territorial <b>males</b> <b>are</b> dominant. Peripheral <b>males</b> <b>are</b> more solitary and sometimes {{take over a}} group when the dominant <b>male</b> <b>is</b> missing. Early-dispersing <b>males</b> <b>are</b> juveniles that leave the birth site around 16 to 24 months of age. Late dispersers <b>are</b> also juvenile <b>males,</b> but they leave the birth site much later; around 30 or more months of age.|$|R
50|$|Similar to females, the head, thorax and abdomen of M. nuda <b>males</b> <b>are</b> dark black. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> {{differentiated}} {{by having}} much less scopa, or hair, on their posterior tibiae. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> characterized by yellow markings on their heads, the broad {{plate on the}} front of the head being completely yellow.|$|R
5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the <b>males</b> <b>were</b> larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, {{and they may have}} had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E
5|$|While poorly documented, {{chemical}} communication {{is believed to}} be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females were attracted to these groups so {{it seems likely that the}} <b>males</b> <b>were</b> producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties.

5|$|Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite In 1784, in Bordeaux, the man {{calling himself}} Count Alessandro di Cagliostro opened the first lodge of his Egyptian Rite masonry. This had the three degrees of normal French masonry (Apprentice, Companion and Master), {{but with a}} greatly different, more mystical ritual. Cagliostro claimed that he was re-introducing true Freemasonry, and he {{attempted}} to attract candidates wherever he went. Male candidates were already Freemasons, but women were also admitted. The ceremony for the two sexes differed only in minor points - <b>males</b> <b>were</b> admitted by Cagliostro (the Grand Copht) and females by his wife (the Queen of Sheba).

5|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases found in shell middens are broken {{and many of the}} bones found exhibit cut marks, it is assumed that the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes. One study looking at the remains in shell middens in Penobscot Bay reported that sea mink craniums were intact, more so than that of other animals found, implying that they were specifically placed there. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> more often collected than females.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk.

In addition a significant number of patrons who were not familiar with the game were also present during the release weekend.|$|E
25|$|Social insect <b>males</b> <b>are</b> {{often seen}} as mating machines, with an undiscriminating eagerness to mate. However, males {{encounter}} costs of unsuccessful mating in terms of energy investment. Therefore, P. dominula <b>males</b> <b>are</b> able to recognize female castes and preferentially choose reproductive females to workers, regardless of health or age. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> able to differentiate castes through perceiving differences in chemical signals and physiological status. While <b>males</b> <b>are</b> able to discriminate between castes, they are not capable of discriminating between health, as males showed a strong preference for gynes, both healthy and parasite-castrated, compared to workers, because males distinguish females by CHC profiles, which are very similar between healthy and unhealthy gynes. Therefore, <b>males</b> <b>are</b> not able to evaluate the true reproductive potential of the females they encounter.|$|R
30|$|To {{determine}} the predation sex rate, the consumption rate of ten <b>males</b> <b>was</b> estimated {{under the same}} conditions, and to calculate the female daily consumption rate, the daily predation rate of <b>males</b> <b>was</b> subtracted from the average predation rate of the pairs.

5|$|After a punitive {{operation}} {{was conducted in}} the surrounding villages, during which 422males were shot and four villages burned down, another 70male Jews and communists who had been arrested in Kragujevac were shot. Simultaneously, males {{between the ages of}} 16and 60, including high school students, were assembled by German troops and local collaborators, and the victims were selected from amongst them. The selected <b>males</b> <b>were</b> then marched to fields outside the city, shot with heavy machine guns, and their bodies buried in mass graves. Contemporary German military records indicate that 2,300hostages were shot. After the war, inflated estimates ranged as high as 7,000deaths, but German and Serbian scholars have now agreed on the figure of nearly 2,800killed, including 144high school students.

Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and <b>males</b> <b>were</b> twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E
5|$|D. s. sumatrensis, {{known as}} the Western Sumatran rhinoceros, which has only 75 to 85 rhinos remaining, mostly in the {{national}} parks of Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci Seblat, Gunung Leuser in Sumatra, but also in Way Kambas National Park in small numbers. They have recently gone extinct in Peninsular Malaysia. The main threats against this subspecies are habitat loss and poaching. A slight genetic difference is noted between the Western Sumatran and Bornean rhinos. The rhinos in Peninsular Malaysia were once known as D. s. niger, but were later recognized to be a synonym of D. s. sumatrensis. Three males and four females currently live in captivity at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas, the youngest male having been bred and born there in 2012. Another calf, a female, was born at the sanctuary in May 2016. The sanctuary's two <b>males</b> <b>were</b> born at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.|$|E

5|$|Farmwork {{combined}} with lessons {{from his mother}} — such was the order of Jan's life {{for the next few}} years. During his early childhood, still too young to be given formal responsibilities on the farm, Jan accompanied the Coloured farm labourers as they went about their daily work. At this time the relations between master and servant, between black and white, were certainly not based on social equality; nevertheless, on these Swartland farms there was little of the rigid segregation which was already emerging elsewhere in South Africa and which was later to have such profound consequences. Since 1828 the Cape had enshrined in law the principle of strict legal equality between the races. Unlike the rest of South Africa, all adult <b>males,</b> <b>were</b> entitled to vote and to stand for election to the Colonial legislature, subject only to a property qualification. In these country districts therefore, there existed a certain intimacy between the farm owners and their labourers. At harvest times it was common to find both working together to gather in the crops and it was also commonplace to find the farm's children playing with one another, irrespective of race.|$|E
5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between <b>males</b> <b>were</b> common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a Spanish {{research}} vessel {{conducted a study}} of the cephalopod population off the coast of Mozambique. The study found populations of V. togata across the entire study area, which ran most of the coast of Mozambique, with especially high concentrations at the very southern end of the Mozambiquan coast, in the waters near the city of Maputo. The study performed trawls in four depth groups, 200–400, 400–500, 500–600, and 600–700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they were most abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The study also noted that <b>males</b> <b>were</b> most common in the shallower two groups, while females were more common in the deeper two groups.|$|E
