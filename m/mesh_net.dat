5|$|On July 2, 2009, Weber {{was invited}} to the Canadian {{orientation}} camp for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. On December 30, 2009, he {{was named to the}} final Canadian roster for the tournament. In Canada's qualification round game versus Germany, Weber scored Canada's second goal of the game in an 8–2 victory. His shot passed through the <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> behind German goaltender Thomas Greiss and a video review was required to award the goal. Weber finished the tournament with six points in seven games, ranking second amongst defencemen in terms of scoring, and was named to the tournament's all-star team, which defeated the United States 3–2 in overtime to win the gold medal. Weber, along with his British Columbian teammates from the Olympic team, will be inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame in September 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Four to five {{juvenile}} geoducks {{are planted}} inside PVC tubes that are [...] "wiggled" [...] into the sandy substrate along the intertidal zone during low tide. The PVC tubes are between 5 and 15nbsp&cm in diameter, with lengths from 20 to 30nbsp&cm, [...] about 7nbsp&cm of which remain above the substrate. The plastic tubes {{are covered with}} a <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> to protect the clams from predators. [...] The tubes also serve to retain seawater at low tide, which prevents dehydration of the clams. After one to two growing seasons when the juvenile geoducks have burrowed themselves deep enough into the substrate {{to be out of}} reach of predators, the PVC tubes are removed. Not all tidelands are suitable for geoduck aquaculture. [...] The sand must be deep and clean, and the water must have the right salinity and degree of cleanliness.|$|E
5000|$|Neuston net tows {{are often}} made at or {{just below the}} surface using a nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> fitted to a {{rectangular}} frame ...|$|E

25|$|Behavioral {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that sharks can take visual cues in order to discriminate between different objects. The bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of <b>mesh</b> <b>netting</b> that is present underwater. It was found that bull sharks tended to avoid <b>mesh</b> <b>netting</b> of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water. Bright yellow <b>mesh</b> <b>netting</b> {{was found to be}} easily avoided when it was placed {{in the path of the}} bull shark. This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black. This is very important because it gives an insight into how bull sharks are able to pick up certain visual keys underwater that might give them an advantage when seeking out certain prey.|$|R
50|$|Research vessels collect ichthyoplankton {{from the}} ocean using fine <b>mesh</b> <b>nets.</b> The vessels either tow the nets through the sea or pump sea water onboard and then pass it through the net.|$|R
5000|$|Ring net tows {{involve a}} nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> fitted to a {{circular}} frame. These {{have largely been}} replaced by bongo nets, which provide duplicate samples with their dual-net design.|$|E

50|$|The aquatic larvae {{of these}} caddisflies spin <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> of silk in flowing water to catch food. A larva can spin over a {{kilometer}} of extremely thin silk to create its intricate net.|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{changes in}} an estuarine fish {{assemblage}} were investigated using two seine <b>mesh</b> <b>nets.</b> Major temporal {{changes in the}} fish fauna were a function of both monthly and, in particular, spring/neap differences, rather than short-term ebb/flood changes. This trend was relatively consistent for two sizes of <b>mesh</b> <b>nets,</b> suggesting that the occurrence of spring/neap changes in catch composition were a characteristic {{of the system and}} independent of the pool of available species. Trophic patterns were generally stronger and more consistent than taxonomic trends, a result highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge of feeding interactions in understanding the processes influencing temporal changes in multi-species communities...|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, combat helmets have often been {{equipped}} with helmet covers to offer greater camouflage. There have been two main types of covers, <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> were earlier widely used, but most modern combat helmets use camouflage cloth covers instead.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} carriage {{is built}} {{from a combination}} of bolted aluminium and plastics. The propeller is mounted within a two-tube safety ring, with a <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> set forward to keep objects out of the propeller. In flight steering is accomplished via handles that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. The main landing gear incorporates spring rod suspension.|$|E
50|$|Tarzan and Khan battle {{each other}} {{in two of the}} {{challenge}} events of the fourth test which concludes with the third and final challenge event with each man fighting with swords on a wide <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> suspended above large vats of boiling oil in which Khan dies by falling through the net into one of the boiling vats.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The epibenthic sled is {{a device}} that trawls {{across the surface of}} the sea floor {{occasionally}} digging into the bottom sediment. It collects benthic fish and invertebrates. Along with a <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> to collect the specimens, there is a front door that opens when traveling along the sea floor and closes as the sled is brought up through the water column.|$|E
5000|$|To {{reduce the}} {{by-catch}} mortality of seals aged over one year, {{it has been}} banned since 2011 to use certain fishing methods, such as strong <b>mesh</b> <b>nets,</b> large fish traps, and fish-baited hooks, in {{the main part of}} the Saimaa ringed seal’s habitat.|$|R
25|$|Bouchot culture: Intertidal growth technique, or bouchot technique: pilings, {{known in}} French as bouchots, are planted at sea; ropes, {{on which the}} mussels grow, are tied in a spiral on the pilings; some <b>mesh</b> <b>netting</b> {{prevents}} the mussels from falling away. This method needs an extended tidal zone.|$|R
50|$|Fisher folks {{also tend}} to use smaller <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> in fishing {{as a means to}} {{increase}} their catch. To arrest overfishing, fishing is not permitted on Tuesdays and in other towns fishing is banned on Sundays and before certain festival times. These are all means to reduce overfishing and over exploitation of the fish.|$|R
50|$|Kikiki is a genus of fairyfly wasps {{containing}} a single species, Kikiki huna, known from Hawaii, Costa Rica, and Trinidad. At 0.15 mm (150 micrometers), {{it is the}} smallest known flying insect. It is a close relative of wasps in the genus Tinkerbella. It was discovered by entomologist John S. Noyes after he swept a <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> through vegetation at Costa Rica's La Selva Biological Station.|$|E
50|$|Dugong {{hunting in}} Australia is not prohibited; however, the {{practise}} is heavily regulated. Dugongs are protected throughout Australia, although the rules vary by state; {{in some areas}} indigenous hunting is allowed. Dugongs are listed under the Nature Conservation Act in the Australian state of Queensland as vulnerable. Most currently live in established marine parks, where boats must travel at a restricted speed and <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> fishing is restricted.|$|E
50|$|Another type of helmet {{cover is}} the <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> cover, which also helps reduce the metal glare from combat helmets {{as well as}} giving an {{opportunity}} to add natural camouflage such as grass, leaves and twigs. This type of cover is however not as widely used anymore, as the modern camouflage cloth covers in various patterns are more common on modern combat helmets, and most cloth covers have cut-outs for placing foliage anyways.|$|E
50|$|Shark (<b>meshing)</b> <b>nets</b> {{operate as}} a catch-and-kill {{strategy}} to reduce the incidence rate of shark attack by reducing the local population size of sharks. Shark nets have been heavily criticized in the media for the environmental effects of bycatch. They also don't provide a fully enclosed swimming area as sharks can swim above, below or around them.|$|R
40|$|Chromatography covered flat plates, pipe cleaners, nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> {{and string}} {{suspended}} from towers {{were used as}} artificial targets to collect drift downwind of cotton fields sprayed by aircraft. Analysis was by fluorometry, immunoassay or HPLC/GC analysis for the pesticide active ingredient All of the collectors produced satisfactory results, although correction for collection efficiency may be advisable when {{using some of the}} larger collectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of commercial small craft pair trawling trials conducted on Lake Chilwa from May to August 1971. Type of vessels and equipment {{used and the}} fishing method and operation employed are described and design data given for the different trawls used. The effects on catching efficiency of varying amounts of small <b>mesh</b> <b>netting</b> trawls are dealt with and recommendations made for trawls design modifications...|$|R
50|$|The United States Army often {{utilized}} nets {{to reduce}} the helmets' shine when wet and to allow burlap scrim or vegetation to be added for camouflage purposes. Most nets were acquired from British or Canadian Army stocks or cut from larger camouflage nets. The Army did not adopt an official issue net until the M-1944 <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> that included a neoprene foliage band, {{which would have been}} retained on later Mitchell and woodland camouflage covers.|$|E
50|$|The nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> is {{the middle}} part of the {{plankton}} net and is used to filter the plankton in the water sample {{in accordance with the}} size of the mesh. In addition, its funnel shape makes it possible to effectively capture plankton of various sizes. There are various mesh sizes for nets, depending on the target microorganism to be collected and the condition of the water body. The narrower the mesh size, the smaller the plankton in the water sample.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{over-fishing}} by steamships {{authorized by}} the national government, namely with small <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> that caught even the youngest fish, making the once abundant fish, that led to the prosperity of the community, starting to vanish significantly, creating severe social problems and emigration. But, in this century, the community had already enlarged even further to Vila do Conde territory. The religious parishes of Lapa, without the civil form, appeared in 1935 and in Vila do Conde the Parish of Caxinas and Poça da Barca appeared in 1944.|$|E
2500|$|A {{track that}} will run {{high-speed}} trains {{in excess of}} [...] is being tested in Illinois between Chicago and St. Louis, Missouri. Here, due to the high speed of the trains, gates that totally prevent road traffic from reaching the tracks are mandatory on all level crossings. Steel <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> were tested on some crossings to further prevent collisions, but these were removed because of maintenance issues in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The smaller {{members of}} the family are tiny enough to pass through the {{apertures}} in typical window screens. Camping tents are often equipped with extra-fine <b>mesh</b> <b>netting,</b> called no-see-um nets, to keep the pests out. One experienced researcher recommends: [...] "A mesh size of 4900 (per square inch) will stop most biting midges, but to ensure that even the smallest cannot feast on you, a mesh size of 10,000 is necessary." ...|$|R
25|$|Many {{have looked}} to Japan for an {{explanation}} for these advanced methods. The roe was transplanted to safe pens for incubation and to guard the small fry from predators. Only when sufficiently mature {{to fend for themselves}} were they released back into the wild. These days this method is practiced by fisheries throughout the world. Before the Spanish came, the Filipinos also only used large <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> when fishing in rivers, lakes or in the sea. This ecologically sound practice protected the young ensuring future good catches. However, the competition brought by the Spaniards resulted in the use of such small <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> that the Spanish themselves eventually had to regulate the nets to prevent the destruction of the fisheries. Other Pre-Spanish Filipino industries included the manufacture of liquors and vinegars like tuba, basi, etc., the production of hides for export to Japan, export of edible bird's nests from Northern Palawan to China, the raising and trade of civet cats, the manufacture of gunpowder, the making of wax for export to China, and the making of cotton stockings for export.|$|R
5000|$|A Plankton net is {{equipment}} used for collecting samples of plankton in standing bodies of water. It {{consists of a}} towing line and bridles, nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>net,</b> and a cod end. Plankton nets are {{considered one of the}} oldest, simplest and inexpensive methods of sampling plankton [...] The plankton net can be used for both vertical and horizontal sampling. It allows researchers to analyse plankton both quantitatively (cell density, cell colony or biomass) and qualitatively (e.g. Chlorophyll-a as a primary production of phytoplankton) in water samples from the environment.|$|E
50|$|On 16 February, Boxwood sailed for Indian Island, Washington, and {{was soon}} busily engaged in work at the Net Depot there, {{installing}} an antisubmarine net line at Port Townsend, a combination antisubmarine and anti-torpedo net line at Marrowstone Spit, and a fine <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> line across the Portage Canal. She completed the installation of approximately {{a mile and a}} half of netting on 11 July and remained in the Puget Sound area tending nets for the remainder of 1942. Placed in full commission on 2 January 1943, Boxwood resumed her tending tasks after her overhaul at Todd, Seattle, shipyard and carried them out through the spring of 1943.|$|E
50|$|Other tools {{may be used}} {{to remove}} food boluses. The Roth Net® is a <b>mesh</b> <b>net</b> that can be {{inserted}} through the endoscope, and opened and closed from the outside; {{it can be used to}} retrieve pieces of obstructed food. Snares, which are normally used to remove polyps can be used to macerate the food causing the obstruction. Dormia baskets, which are metal baskets used to remove stones from the common bile duct in a procedure known as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, can be opened and closed from the outside in a similar manner to macerate food and facilitate removal. Forceps used for biopsies can also be employed in a similar manner.|$|E
50|$|The nearby fishing {{communities}} of Kunduchi, Unonio, and Msasani all {{appear to be}} heavily dependent on the resources in the reserves http://www.icran.org/SITES/doc/dmrs.pdf and resource over-exploitation is an increasing concern with local fishermen attributing a decline in fish catches over recent years {{to the use of}} small <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> and dynamite fishing. A decrease in the abundance of fish and coral health, and an increased amount of bleached and broken coral has been noted by divers.|$|R
50|$|Late 19th {{century was}} tragic for Povoan {{fishermen}} due to over-fishing by vapors {{authorized by the}} national government, namely with small <b>mesh</b> <b>nets</b> that caught even young fish. The once abundant fish became rare {{in such a way}} that serious social problems emerged and lead to the emigration of the fishermen. On February 27, 1892, a tragedy devastated the community. Seven lanchas poveiras wrecked in a storm and 105 fishermen were killed, just meters off the shore.|$|R
5000|$|Bee-keepers wear {{various levels}} of {{protection}} depending on the temperament of their bees and {{the reaction of the}} bees to nectar availability. At minimum most bee keepers wear a brimmed hat and a veil made of fine <b>mesh</b> <b>netting.</b> The next level of protection involves leather gloves with long gauntlets and some way of keeping bees from crawling up one's trouser legs. In extreme cases, specially fabricated shirts and trousers can serve as barriers to the bees' stingers.|$|R
