500|$|... "You and I"'s {{music video}} was filmed in Springfield, Nebraska in July 2011, and was {{directed}} by Lady Gaga's choreographer Laurieann Gibson. In the video, Gaga walks from New York City to Nebraska to get her boyfriend back. According to Gaga: [...] "I'm walking with no luggage and no nothing and it's just me and <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> are bleeding {{a little bit and}} there's grass stuck in my shoes and I've got this outfit on and it's real sort of New York clothing and I'm sprinting... And the [...] idea that when you're away from someone you love, it's torture," [...] she continued. [...] "I knew I wanted the video to be about me sprinting back and walking hundreds of thousands of miles to get him back." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{forgot that}} he should have left <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> for me to untie for myself.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw himself}} {{down on the}} ground and clasped <b>my</b> <b>ankles.</b> But I had my doubts about Gunga Dass's benevolence, and kicked him off as he lay protesting.|$|E
60|$|I came out, {{trailing}} {{a portion}} of some unknown shrub which had twined itself about <b>my</b> <b>ankle.</b>|$|R

3000|$|Now <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> is {{starting}} to bother me and I had surgery on that…now it hurts to walk…[64 -year-old Caucasian male] [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{right as}} can be,' Rube {{said in his}} {{ordinary}} cheerful tone; 'except that I feel as if a fellow was sawing away at <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> and wrists with a blunt knife.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They weren't silk, Mrs. Dillon's stockings. They were lisle. Her {{legs are}} nice and slim. But no nicer than mine. I hate cotton tops on silk stockings. [...] . Are <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> getting fat? I will NOT have fat ankles! ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet, yet, ye downcast hours, I know ye also, [...] Weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at <b>my</b> <b>ankles,</b> [...] Earth to {{a chamber}} of {{mourning}} turns--I hear the o'erweening, mocking [...] voice, [...] Matter is conqueror--matter, triumphant only, continues onward.|$|E
60|$|I put my {{arms about}} him and, as <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> gave way at the same moment, we nearly rolled upon the ground together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something {{gone wrong}} with <b>my</b> <b>ankle.</b> That <b>my</b> blazer? Thanks. Coming {{over to the}} house? Clowes {{was just going to}} help me over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hadn't I better stay here, Giant? Somebody {{ought to}} mind the camp until Snap and Shep get back, and <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> is quite swollen." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{they threw}} me upon the ground, binding <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> {{together}} and trussing {{them up to}} my wrists behind. There they left me, lying upon my stomach--a most uncomfortable and strained position, to which was added the pain where the cords cut into my flesh.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely had he {{departed}} on the errand when Bill Quigley, who lay at my feet, {{created a}} diversion. I jumped--yes, and I freely confess that I yelled--with startle and surprise, when I felt his paws clutch <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> and his teeth shut {{down on the}} calf of my leg.|$|E
60|$|I {{was still}} {{thinking}} {{it over and}} straining with my wrists and <b>my</b> <b>ankles,</b> when their chief came out from his grotto, and after some talk with his lieutenant, who lay groaning near the fire, they both nodded their heads and looked across at me. He then said some few words to the band, who clapped their hands and laughed uproariously. Things looked ominous, and I was delighted to feel that my hands were so far free that I could easily slip them through the cords if I wished. But with <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> I feared that I could do nothing, for when I strained it brought such pain into my lance-wound that I had to gnaw my moustache to keep from crying out. I could only lie still, half-free and half-bound, and see what turn things were likely to take.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Denis. But {{you must}} do it another time. I must {{go in and get}} <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> into hot water. It's {{beginning}} to swell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it is true. I {{fell into}} a large tree, and that broke my fall. But I was badly {{scratched}} up, and <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> was sprained." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Gibault," [...] {{observed}} March ruefully, [...] "they've almost sawed {{through the}} skin o' <b>my</b> <b>ankle.</b> I've no left foot at all, as far as feelin' goes." ...|$|R
60|$|Catching up a broom, I belabored the dog so energetically that he {{was forced}} to turn from the poor Czar to me. What would have become of me I don't know, for the dog was in a rage, and evidently meditating a grab at <b>my</b> <b>ankles,</b> when his master {{appeared}} and ordered him off.|$|E
6000|$|You felons {{on trial}} in courts, [...] You convicts in prison-cells, you sentenced assassins chain'd and [...] handcuff'd with iron, [...] Who am I too that I am not on trial or in prison? [...] Me {{ruthless}} and devilish as any, that my wrists are not chain'd with [...] iron, or <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> with iron? ...|$|E
6000|$|I dote on myself, {{there is}} that lot of me and all so luscious, [...] Each moment and {{whatever}} happens thrills me with joy, [...] I cannot tell how <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish, [...] Nor {{the cause of the}} friendship I emit, nor the cause of the [...] friendship I take again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I don't {{know where}} he is," [...] gasped Nat. [...] "Oh, say, won't you please help me? <b>My</b> <b>ankle</b> is fast in a trap! Oh, how it hurts!" ...|$|R
5|$|The abscess in <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> {{was painful}} and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|R
6000|$|I limped at the outset, {{but after}} the second mile <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> warmed to forgetfulness, {{and the rest of}} the way I walked well. Suppose, after all, I was wrong? ...|$|R
60|$|He unfastened my arms first,--that is, {{as soon as}} he {{had taken}} the {{handkerchief}} off my mouth,--and the moment he had taken the bandage from around <b>my</b> <b>ankles,</b> he put for the door. But I was ready. I sprang out of bed, made one jump over his bed, around which he had to go, and caught him just at the door.|$|E
60|$|I {{had little}} time given me to realise the {{extraordinary}} and humiliating position in which I found myself, for I was lifted up by <b>my</b> <b>ankles,</b> as if I were a fowl pulled off a perch, and jerked roughly down into the room, my back striking upon the stone floor with a thud which shook the breath from my body.|$|E
60|$|The gag in {{my mouth}} nearly choked me, but try my best I could not {{dislodge}} it. The ropes about my body, especially those that were tightened around <b>my</b> <b>ankles,</b> hurt me not a little, but all my efforts to loosen them only appeared to draw them closer, until, had I {{been able to do}} so, I would have cried out from pain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I sprained <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> the day I {{followed}} {{one of you}} boys--that is, I {{suppose it}} was one of your crowd. I mean the chap who fell over the cliff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said Rosa, making a pretence of freeing him. [...] "I’m afraid I’m leaning on you; but I sprained <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> yesterday, and I thought—" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cut {{the lines}} {{at my feet}} first, lad," [...] said Coleman, [...] "they've a'most sawed through <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> bones. There, that's it now, help me to git up an' shake myself." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{words were}} his death-warrant. For Sophie's sake I {{could not let}} him go back alive. Our blades crossed, and an instant later mine was through his black beard and deep in his throat. I {{was on the ground}} almost as soon as he, but the one thrust was enough. He died, {{snapping}} his teeth at <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> like a savage wolf.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} I had been jerked roughly to my feet. One of the fellows stopped and severed the bonds that held <b>my</b> <b>ankles.</b> I could {{scarcely}} stand alone. The two pulled and hauled {{me through the}} low doorway and along the trench. A party of forty or fifty warriors were awaiting us at the brink of the excavation some {{hundred yards from the}} hut.|$|E
60|$|In a jiffy I was trussed up as neatly as {{you might}} wish. One of the nooses dropped to <b>my</b> <b>ankles</b> and was jerked up with a suddenness that brought me to my face upon the ground. Then {{something}} heavy and hairy sprang upon my back. I fought to draw my knife, but hairy hands grasped my wrists and, dragging them be-hind my back, bound them securely.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{compelled}} {{to believe what}} the girls say--that you are inclined {{to the language of}} compliment. <b>My</b> <b>ankle</b> is nearly well, thank you. It hurts a little now and then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was coming}} to you," [...] he said; [...] "and in {{crossing}} the stream the plank turned under me, and I am afraid I have sprained <b>my</b> <b>ankle.</b> I can't walk on it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sprang from}} the east wing," [...] he explained. [...] "I guess <b>my</b> <b>ankle</b> is sprained." [...] And then he dropped down and was carried {{away from the scene}} to a place of safety.|$|R
