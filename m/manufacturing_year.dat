50|$|The {{use of the}} 7-digit {{registration}} plate in Israel began in 1980. The 2 last digits of the number, referred to as its suffix, have special meaning. In the eighties, the suffix indicated the vehicle’s <b>manufacturing</b> <b>year</b> (80-89). In 1990 this rule was changed, and the suffix was determined according to the car’s dealer or brand, when each dealer or brand was given a suffix, sometimes sharing the same suffix with other dealers or brands. This rule was gradually changed starting from 2000, and the suffix started to indicate the vehicle’s <b>manufacturing</b> <b>year</b> again (although not according to a general rule as in the eighties) as well as dealer or brand.|$|E

5000|$|Model year 1974 (G Series. Aug. 1973 to July 1974 production) {{saw three}} {{significant}} changes. First, the engine size was increased to 2687 cc achieving higher torque.

40|$|The {{self-protection}} {{standards of}} the vehicle fleet were hypothesized to have decreased {{as a function of}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>year.</b> The hypothesis was tested using GIDAS data from 2000 - 2015, for both the belted and unbelted populations. Occupant injury was assessed using an iteration of the New Injury Severity Score, the NISSx. Injury rates were described by point estimates and were plotted against vehicle <b>manufacturing</b> <b>year.</b> Vehicle mileage was considered an exposure measure when determining injury rates. For a given sample of injured occupants, the greatest decrease in injury rate was associated with a NISSx> 1 (MAIS 2 +) injury. The reason for the strong reduction to this injury severity was attributable to the mitigation of 1 ≤NISSx&lt; 2. 5 injuries. Logistic regression models were developed to identify factors that have caused this injury mitigation. Euro NCAP compliancy and a deployed frontal airbag for the belted population had significantly reduced effects of mitigating injury. Results also indicated the rate of 2. 5 ≤NISSx&lt; 5 injuries has remained constant. Future development of vehicle platforms should consider safety measures to mitigate injuries of these severities...|$|E

30|$|The {{model output}} we used {{is the total}} {{travelled}} distance and annual PM 2.5 emission. This output data was selected against specific vehicle types from the MySql output database of MOVES. Then, we compute emission factors by dividing total emission by total distance traveled and this gave us emission factors in gram/km for corresponding vehicle types. The emission factors were further sorted based on vehicle age. The vehicle age is calculated as a difference of reference year (year 2010) and the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>year</b> and finally, we inserted these emission factors in equation 1 discussed in chapter 3, to obtain total PM emission according to the US emission levels.|$|E
5000|$|In {{at least}} the US market, the N54 engine has been {{characterized}} by {{a very large number}} of High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP) failures, leading to BMW North America vehicle Lemon Law [...] "buy backs" [...] and reduced customer goodwill. BMW's failure to solve the HPFP problem has led to serious safety concerns over dangerous sudden losses of power at highway speeds. Reports of drivers being stranded are not uncommon and some have accused BMW of actively concealing the problem rather than addressing it.
