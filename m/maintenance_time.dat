5|$|The {{first two}} blocks of JF-17 {{is powered by}} a single Russian RD-93 {{turbofan}} engine, which is a variant of the RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter. The engine gives more thrust and significantly lower specific fuel consumption than turbojet engines fitted to older combat aircraft being replaced by the JF-17. The advantages of using a single engine are a reduction in <b>maintenance</b> <b>time</b> and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters. A thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.99 can be achieved with full internal fuel tanks and no external payload. The engine's air supply is provided by two bifurcated air inlets (see airframe section).|$|E

40|$|A central tenet in {{the theory}} of {{reliability}} modelling is the quantification of the probability of asset failure. In general, reliability depends on asset age and the maintenance policy applied. Usually, failure and <b>maintenance</b> <b>times</b> are the primary inputs to reliability models. However, for many organisations, different aspects of these data are often recorded in different databases (e. g. work order notifications, event logs, condition monitoring data, and process control data). These recorded data cannot be interpreted individually, since they typically do not have all the information necessary to ascertain failure and preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>times.</b> This paper presents a methodology for the extraction of failure and preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>times</b> using commonly-available, real-world data sources. A text-mining approach is employed to extract keywords indicative of the source of the maintenance event. Using these keywords, a Naïve Bayes classifier is then applied to attribute each machine stoppage to one of two classes: failure or preventive. The accuracy of the algorithm is assessed and the classified failure time data are then presented. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated on a maintenance data set from an Australian electricity company...|$|R

2500|$|Throughput is a {{variable}} which quantifies {{the number of}} parts produced in the unit of time. Although estimating throughput for a single process maybe fairly simple, doing so for an entire production system involves an additional difficulty due {{to the presence of}} queues which can come from: machine breakdowns, processing time variability, scraps, setups, <b>maintenance</b> <b>time,</b> lack of orders, lack of materials, strikes, bad coordination between resources, mix variability, plus all these inefficiencies tend to compound depending {{on the nature of the}} production system. One important example of how system throughput is tied to system design are bottlenecks: in job shops bottlenecks are typically dynamic and dependent on scheduling while on transfer lines it makes sense to speak of [...] "the bottleneck" [...] since it can be univocally associated with a specific station on the line. This leads to the problem of how to define capacity measures, that is an estimation of the maximum output of a given production system, and capacity utilization.|$|E
2500|$|Exhaust steam is {{directed}} upwards {{out of the}} locomotive through the chimney, {{by way of a}} nozzle called a blastpipe, creating the familiar [...] "chuffing" [...] sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that {{is at the same time}} traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, strictly speaking, the ejector) require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and often ignored by others, sometimes with catastrophic consequences). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, a strong draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter-effect of exerting back pressure on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector became a specific science, with engineers such as Chapelon, Giesl and Porta making large improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in <b>maintenance</b> <b>time</b> and pollution. A similar system was used by some early gasoline/kerosene tractor manufacturers (Advance-Rumely/Hart-Parr) – the exhaust gas volume was vented through a cooling tower, allowing the steam exhaust to draw more air past the radiator.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a manufacturing {{system in which}} an input generating installation transfers a raw material to a subsequent production unit. Both machines deteriorate stochastically with usage and may fail. For each machine the deteriorating process is described by some known transition probabilities between different degrees of deterioration. A buffer has been built between the two machines in order to cope with unexpected failures of the installation. A discrete-time Markov decision model is formulated for the optimal preventive maintenance of both machines. The <b>maintenance</b> <b>times</b> are geometrically distributed and the cost structure includes operating costs, storage costs, maintenance costs and costs due to the lost production. It is proved that for fixed buffer content and for fixed deterioration degree of one machine, the average-cost optimal policy initiates a preventive maintenance of the other machine {{if and only if}} its degree of deterioration exceeds some critical level. We study, by means of numerical results, the effect of the variation of some parameters on the optimal policy and on the minimum average cost.
