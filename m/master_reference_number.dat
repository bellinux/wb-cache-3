40|$|Each {{time you}} cite or refer to someone else’s {{work in your}} paper you must {{identify}} the source with a <b>reference</b> <b>number.</b> These numbers appear in the reference list consecutively {{in the same order}} in which they appear in the text. Once a source has been cited, the same number is used in all subsequent references. No distinction is made between print and electronic references when citing within the text. Element The <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> appears in superscript after the full stop if it {{is at the end of}} a sentence, or after a comma if it is in the middle of a sentence. If you are citing the same source again, use the same <b>reference</b> <b>number.</b> If you have written about someone else’s ideas, you must use a <b>reference</b> <b>number,</b> even if you haven’t mentioned that person in your paper. Put the <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> after the relevant sentence or paragraph and cite their details in your reference list. When multiple references are cited at a given place in the text, use a hyphen to join the first and last numbers that are inclusive. Use commas (without spaces) to separate non‐sequential numbers. Use both commas and a hyphen for inclusive and non‐sequential references. If your lecturer asks you to add page <b>numbers</b> after the <b>reference</b> <b>number,</b> put the page number in brackets after the <b>reference</b> <b>number...</b>|$|R
