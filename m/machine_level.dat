50|$|The CPU {{instruction}} decoder, decoded <b>machine</b> <b>level</b> instructions (as {{opposed to}} micro-instructions).

Scalability is the counterpart characteristic of convertibility.

Implementing solutions to these problems at the virtual <b>machine</b> <b>level</b> prevents repeated efforts to solve these problems in the individual client languages.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the single machine scheduling problem with job-dependent machine deterioration. In the problem, {{we are given}} a single machine with an initial non-negative maintenance level, {{and a set of}} jobs each with a non-preemptive processing time and a machine deterioration. Such a machine deterioration quantifies the decrement in the <b>machine</b> maintenance <b>level</b> after processing the job. To avoid machine breakdown, one should guarantee a non-negative maintenance level at any time point; and whenever necessary, a maintenance activity must be allocated for restoring the <b>machine</b> maintenance <b>level.</b> The goal of the problem is to schedule the jobs and the maintenance activities such that the total completion time of jobs is minimized. There are two variants of maintenance activities: in the partial maintenance case each activity can be allocated to increase the <b>machine</b> maintenance <b>level</b> to any level not exceeding the maximum; in the full maintenance case every activity must be allocated to increase the <b>machine</b> maintenance <b>level</b> to the maximum. In a recent work, the problem in the full maintenance case has been proven NP-hard; several special cases of the problem in the partial maintenance case were shown solvable in polynomial time, but the complexity of the general problem is left open. In this paper we first prove that the problem in the partial maintenance case is NP-hard, thus settling the open problem; we then design a 2 -approximation algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} creative problem-solving (CPS) principles to the reduction of plant maintenance costs. A brief description of CPS principles and methods is rst given. Three case studies are then described that illustrate the use of CPS on problems at plant and <b>machine</b> <b>levels,</b> by different group compositions and on problems of different types. A review of experience {{of the use of}} CPS methods by maintenance engineers trained in their use is also given. It is concluded that CPS is a valuable approach that may be used effectively to identify causes of maintenance problems and to nd solutions to particular problems of diverse kinds that incur maintenance costs...|$|R
50|$|IBM {{developed}} {{the concept of}} hypervisors in their CP-40 and CP-67, and in 1972 provided it for the S/370 as Virtual Machine Facility/370. IBM introduced the Start Interpretive Execution (SIE) instruction as part of 370-XA on the 3081, and VM/XA versions of VM to exploit it. PR/SM is a type-1 Hypervisor based on the CP component of VM/XA that runs directly on the <b>machine</b> <b>level</b> and allocates system resources across LPARs to share physical resources. It is a standard feature on IBM System z machines.|$|E

5000|$|The {{existing}} {{control and}} status register definitions support RISC-V's error and memory exceptions, {{and a small}} number of interrupts. For larger systems, the specification also defines an interrupt controller. Interrupts always start at the highest-privileged <b>machine</b> <b>level,</b> and the control registers of each level have explicit [...] "forwarding" [...] bits to route interrupts to less-privileged code. For example, the hypervisor need not include software that executes on each interrupt to forward an interrupt to an operating system. Instead, on set-up, it can set bits to forward the interrupt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Conical screw rotor is the {{key part}} of conical double-screw extruder, with complex {{geometrical}} features, such as variable outside and inside diameter, unequal groove depth, varied head and lead. The manufacturing process is complicated and difficult. The precision and efficiency of conventional machining method is lower, the mating character of machined screw rotor is bad and the exchangeability is hard. On the basis of studying the geometric character and contacting process of double conical screw, this paper presents a new NC manufacturing method to envelope milling screw rotor with several axes moving combined. The automatic programming system for screw rotor NC machining is developed. This research increases the <b>machining</b> <b>level</b> of conical double screw. It has conspicuous engineering meaning...|$|R
5000|$|McCabe {{showed that}} the cyclomatic {{complexity}} of any structured program with only one entrance point and one exit point {{is equal to the}} number of decision points (i.e., [...] "if" [...] statements or conditional loops) contained in that program plus one. However, this is true only for decision points counted at the lowest, machine-level instructions.

5000|$|The terms {{high-level}} and low-level {{are inherently}} relative. Some decades ago, the C language, and similar languages, were most often considered [...] "high-level", as it supported {{concepts such as}} expression evaluation, parameterised recursive functions, and data types and structures, while assembly language was considered [...] "low-level". Today, many programmers might refer to C as low-level, as it lacks a large runtime-system (no garbage collection, etc.), basically supports only scalar operations, and provides direct memory addressing. It, therefore, readily blends with assembly language and the <b>machine</b> <b>level</b> of CPUs and microcontrollers.|$|E

Thus, UltraHLE software is in fact an emulator with some parts implemented as a simulation, and the technique is not used in purist emulation projects such as MAME. However, it {{paved the way for}} creating playable emulators which use complex graphic routines that require considerable computation power which could be simulated easily with available PC graphic cards.|$|E

40|$|A {{brief summary}} of the Hierarchical Development Methodology (HDM) is provided. The design of a system is {{decomposed}} into a hierarchy of abstract machines, linearly ordered with a different abstract <b>machine</b> at each <b>level</b> in the hierarchy. Each abstract machine in the hierarchy is dependent only on the functionality of lower <b>level</b> <b>machines.</b> The facilities of the highest <b>level</b> abstract <b>machine,</b> and only those of that machine, are visible to a user of the system. A machine is itself decomposed into modules, each module having operations and data structures which typically define a single abstract data concept. As in the Parnas module concept, the module is the programming unit of HDM; each of the modules may be independently implemented. The programs implementing a module can access the data structures of their own abstract machine, but not those of lower <b>level</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R
