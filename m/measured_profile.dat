They are, every atom, done by Greeks, and are as pure Greek as the temple of Ægina; but more rich and refined. I drew with {{accurate}} care, and with <b>measured</b> <b>profile</b> of every moulding, the tomb built for Roger II. (afterwards Frederick II. was laid in its dark porphyry). And it is a perfect type of the Greek-Christian form of tomb--temple over sarcophagus, in which the pediments rise gradually, as time goes on, into acute angles--get pierced in the gable with foils, and their sculptures thrown outside on their flanks, and become at last in the fourteenth century, the tombs of Verona. But {{what is the meaning}} of the Normans employing these Greek slaves for their work in Sicily (within thirty miles of the field of Himera)? Well, the main meaning is that though the Normans could build, they couldn't carve, and were wise enough not to try to, when they couldn't, as you do now all over this intensely comic and tragic town: but, here in England, they only employed the Saxon with a grudge, and therefore being more and more driven to use barren mouldings without sculpture, gradually developed the structural forms of archivolt, which breaking into the lancet, brighten and balance themselves into the symmetry of early English Gothic.|$|E

40|$|The {{retrospective}} {{identification of}} preseizure states usually bases on a time-resolved characterization of dynamical aspects of multichannel neurophysiologic recordings {{that can be}} assessed with measures from linear or non-linear time series analysis. This approach renders time profiles of a characterizing measure - so-called <b>measure</b> <b>profiles</b> - for different recording sites or combinations thereof. Various downstream evaluation techniques have been proposed to single out <b>measure</b> <b>profiles</b> that carry potential information about preseizure states. These techniques, however, rely on assumptions about seizure precursor dynamics {{that might not be}} generally valid or face the statistical problem of multiple testing. Addressing these issues, we have developed a method to preselect <b>measure</b> <b>profiles</b> that carry potential information about preseizure states, and to identify brain regions associated with seizure precursor dynamics. Our data-driven method is based on the ratio S of the global to local temporal variance of <b>measure</b> <b>profiles.</b> We evaluated its suitability by retrospectively analyzing long-lasting multichannel intracranial EEG recordings from 18 patients that included 133 focal onset seizures, using a bivariate measure for the strength of interactions. In 17 / 18 patients, we observed S to be significantly correlated with the predictive performance of <b>measure</b> <b>profiles</b> assessed retrospectively by means of receiver-operating-characteristic statistics. Predictive performance was higher for <b>measure</b> <b>profiles</b> preselected with S than for a manual selection using information about onset and spread of seizures. Across patients, highest predictive performance was not restricted to recordings from focal areas, thus supporting the notion of an extended epileptic network in which even distant brain regions contribute to seizure generation. We expect our method to provide further insight into the complex spatial and temporal aspects of the seizure generating process.

He is famous for his invention of the Rietveld refinement method, which is used for the characterisation of crystalline materials from powder diffraction data. The Rietveld refinement uses a least squares approach to refine a theoretical line profile (calculated from a known or postulated crystal structure) until it matches the <b>measured</b> <b>profile.</b> The introduction of this technique was a significant step forward in the diffraction analysis of powder samples.|$|E
50|$|This is primary mode {{of signal}} {{and the main}} goal of SJEM. The {{substrate}} expands when Joule heated, resulting in change in the <b>measured</b> <b>profile</b> by the cantilever, resulting in a change in signal. However, thermal expansion coefficients can vary significantly. For example, the thermal expansion coefficients of metal are typically one order of magnitude {{higher than those of}} dielectric and amorphous materials; while the expansion coefficient of polymer is one order higher than those of metals. So by coating the sample surface with a layer of polymer, the expansion signal could be enhanced. More importantly, after coating, the signal only depends on the temperature, independent of the expansion coefficient of different materials, allowing for SJEM to be used for a wide array of samples. Expansion signal increases linearly with temperature and thus quadratically with voltage. In addition, expansion signal increases monotonically with the thickness of coating polymer, while the resolution will decrease due to greater thermal diffusion. Lastly, expansion signal decreases as the frequency increases.|$|E

40|$|In {{a growing}} number of {{publications}} it is claimed that epileptic seizures can be predicted by analyzing the electroencephalogram (EEG) with different characterizing measures. However, many of these studies suffer from a severe lack of statistical validation. Only rarely are results passed to a statistical test and verified against some null hypothesis H- 0 in order to quantify their significance. In this paper we propose a method to statistically validate the performance of measures used to predict epileptic seizures. From <b>measure</b> <b>profiles</b> rendered by applying a moving-window technique to the electroencephalogram we first generate an ensemble of surrogates by a constrained randomization using simulated annealing. Subsequently the seizure prediction algorithm is applied to the original <b>measure</b> <b>profile</b> and to the surrogates. If detectable changes before seizure onset exist, highest performance values should be obtained for the original <b>measure</b> <b>profiles</b> and the null hypothesis. "The measure is not suited for seizure prediction" can be rejected. We demonstrate our method by applying two measures of synchronization to a quasicontinuous EEG recording and by evaluating their predictive performance using a straightforward seizure prediction statistics. We would like to stress that the proposed method is rather universal and can be applied to many other prediction and detection problems...|$|R
