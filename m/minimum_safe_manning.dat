This document certifies that the person holding is a seaman as per The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch keeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, as amended from time to time. Seaman Book {{is one of the}} compulsory document for applying crew transit visas. The record of employment on board of a merchant ship (sea service) is recorded in a Seaman Service Book. Different countries issue to their seafarers the similar service book with different names i.e. Seaman Record Book, Seaman Discharge Book etc. In Pakistan Government Shipping Office issue this book under section 120 of Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 2001.

40|$|Going {{back to the}} {{beginning}} of 90 -ies of last century before the present STCW- 78 / 95 Convention was established the shipping industry relied on Maritime Education and Training Institutions for well-educated and trained seafarers. Every shipowner simply employed seafarers that his ships needed and the relevant <b>Minimum</b> <b>Safe</b> <b>Manning</b> Certificate required. Generally speaking MET Institutions were the only Institutions responsible for initial and following education and training of seafarers. The last decade in the shipping industry has been marked by plenty changes and quick development in different directions. One of the directions is improving the quality of seafarer’s education and training, knowledge and skills as well. The obligatory competences in STCW- 78 / 95 Convention are not enough for shipowners and they try to extend the education process outside the Convention’s requirements and recommendations. It is a well known and more and more spread practice for Shipowners to organize and perform meetings with officers and engineers working on board their vessels. Such meetings get publicity as Fleet Officer’s Meetings (FOM) or Fleet Officer’s Seminars (FOS). The meetings or seminars are performed at least on a yearly basis but it is the Owner’s decision to establish the agenda and the scope of the topics. The usefulness of the above mentioned events is visible enough and it is easy to understand that the applied efforts are not time wasted. The question is whether the companies can perform such kind of training and whether their lecturers and instructors, who are usually part of the office staff, are ready to deliver their experience at an acceptable level. It has to be highlighted that it is not a rule that good professionals as Masters and Engineers are always good lecturers and trainers. This article describes the summary results of the authors’ experience in participating as a fleet officer and as an assessor in fleet officers’ seminars. The article makes a SWAT analysis of such events and shares experience as a conclusion. The author gives his personal collaboration to the lifelong learning process in the shipping industry. The article makes an attempt to open the door to the co-operation between the shipping industry and MET Institutions at a higher level after the seafarers’ graduation in their MET Institutions...|$|E

To complete the economic analysis we were asked to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> flow operating speed at the rated operating speed and use this information to set a minimum flow line for all potential pump speeds. This minimum flow line was used to determine if the spillback line would still be required at the reduced operating speeds.

40|$|The {{great effort}} is being {{recently}} spent to develop better Collision Avoidance Warning Systems (CAWS) {{to reduce the}} total number of accidents. Improvements in crash avoidance have proven far more difficult to attain, mainly because the probability of a crash is affected by an array of complex and interacting factors involving the drivers, vehicles, and the road environment. One of the important criteria in CAWS is the criteria for system activation. Proper activation algorithm of the system will reduce the number of false alarms and collision by not presenting the warning too early or too late, but at the right time. The determination of a <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> distance is a very fundamental and pivotal step for CAWS system activation. Hence, the success of CAWS system relies very much on whether the activation algorithm or model used is able to indicate a <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> distance precisely and timely. Limitations of existing methods in determining the <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> distance is restricted to only the kinematic variables such as speed and deceleration. Other important independent parameters for heavy vehicle such as vehicle classification (VC), Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) and tire-road coefficient of friction (CoF), which may have a direct impact on vehicle braking performance, have not been explicitly considered. The characteristics of these important heavy vehicle parameters are assumed to be same for all types of vehicle. The <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> distance is very much related on vehicle braking performance. The important parameters in vehicle braking performance are the deceleration and braking distance (BD). Thus, this study offers a detailed analysis in understanding the factors which influence the deceleration and BD for heavy vehicle. To do this, deceleration data for various heavy vehicle classes under various loads, speeds and road surface conditions was generated employing a commercial multi-body dynamic simulation package. Through statistical analysis, results shown that these four parameters have significant effect on heavy vehicle’s deceleration and braking distance. The results shows that changes in the vehicle dynamics’ characteristics will affect a heavy vehicle’s braking performance and its ability to stop safely in emergency situations. Therefore these parameters are important and must be considered in determining the <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> distance. This result is the first major contribution of this dissertation. To represent the adaptive <b>minimum</b> <b>safe</b> distance which will be used in activation algorithm for CAWS, the new distance-based CAWS model, namely <b>Minimum</b> <b>Safe</b> Distance Gap (MSDG) is introduced. By applying non-linear regression analysis to the simulation results, a mathematical model of MSDG has been established. This MSDG model is the second major contribution of this dissertation. In addition, a graphical user interface (GUI) based calculator was developed based on the proposed regression model. It is envisaged that this calculator would provide a more realistic depiction of the real situation for safety analysis involving heavy vehicles. Finally, the development of prototype microcontroller-based CAWS featuring MSDG activation algorithm has been developed. The accuracy and the functionality of the system has been tested and validated. It is envisaged that this CAWS featuring MSDG algorithm would provide a more realistic depiction of the real traffic situation for safety purposes...|$|R
