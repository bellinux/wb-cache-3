The paper proposes six myths in the <b>machine</b> <b>lea.</b> n_ng community that address issues of bias, learning as search, computational learning theory, Occam's razor, _universal &quot; learning algorithms, and interactive |ea. _ng. Some of the problems raised are also addressed from a Bayesian perspective. The paper concludes by suggesting questions that machine learning researchers should be addressing both theoretically and experimentally...|$|E

This paper reports some results obtained by analyzing international conflict databases using machine learning and case-based reasoning techniques. 1 Introduction Research in Artificial Intelligence {{has always been}} heavily supported by "defense agencies". While enormous amounts of money have been and still are spent {{on the development of}} AI methods for military purposes, practically no effort is undertaken to use these methods to support the prevention and termination of conflicts and wars. We believe that Artificial Intelligence has a great potential for peacefare although research in this area has not yet received the attention that it deserves (Trappl, 1986, 1992). One possible contribution of AI to peacefare is the knowledge that can be gained by analyzing databases of international conflicts or conflict management attempts with <b>machine</b> <b>lea</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Automatic shot {{boundary}} detection {{has been an}} active research area {{for nearly a decade}} and has led to high performance detection algorithms for hard cuts, fades and wipes. Reliable dissolve detection, however, is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we present the first robust and reliable dissolve detection system. A detection rate of 69 % was achieved while reducing the false alarm rate to an acceptable level of 68 % on a test video set for which so far the best reported detection and false alarm rate had been 57 % and 185 %, respectively. In addition, the temporal extent of the dissolves are estimated by a multi-resolution detection approach. The three core ideas of our novel approach are firstly the creation of a dissolve synthesizer capable of creating in principle an infinite number of dissolve examples of any duration from a video database of raw video footage, secondly two new features for capturing the characteristics of dissolves, and thirdly, the exploitation of <b>machine</b> <b>lea</b> [...] ...|$|E

A few months ago, Hormel Foods Corporation {{launched}} Spam Snacks; dried, bite-sized flavored pieces of meat produced with a nutraREV <b>machine.</b> Gay <b>Lea</b> Foods, {{the second largest}} dairy co-operative in Canada, recently started the production of “Nothing But Cheese”, a crunchy cheese snack, on a nutraREV unit.|$|R

Townsend, Jr., and was counted among the Union Republicans. In 1904 he was the Union Republican candidate for Governor. Popular in New Castle County Republicans circles and benefiting from the well funded Addicks <b>machine</b> elsewhere, <b>Lea</b> won nearly all the growing number of Republicans voters, easily defeating both Joseph Chandler, the regular Republican Party candidate and Caleb S. Pennewill, the Democratic Party candidate.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{algorithms}} {{have been}} {{proven to be a}} powerful tool within the area of machine learning. However, there are some classes of problems where they seem to be scarcely applicable, e. g. when the solution to a given problem consists of several parts that influence each other. In that case the classic genetic operators cross-over and mutation do not work very well thus preventing a good performance. This paper describes an approach to overcome this problem by using high-level genetic operators and integrating task specific but domain independent knowledge to guide the use of these operators. The advantages of this approach are shown for learning a rule base to adapt the parameters of an image processing operator path within the SOLUTION system. 1 Introduction Genetic algorithms are a class of adaptive search techniques which use evolutionary principles like inheritance and natural selection. They have been applied successfully to many problems in different areas including <b>machine</b> <b>lea</b> [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|Crump became {{involved}} in earnest in state politics during the 1928 gubernatorial election when Henry Horton was seeking election in his own right. Horton had earlier been speaker of the state senate and succeeded {{to the position of}} governor when Austin Peay died in office. [...] Crump supported Hill McAlister in the Democratic primary, while the Nashville <b>machine</b> of Luke <b>Lea</b> supported Governor Horton. Horton won the primary despite the strong vote for McAlister in populous Shelby County. When Horton ran for reelection in 1930, Crump and Lea cut a deal, and Crump swung his formidable political machine behind Horton. Horton defeated independent Democrat L. E. Gwinn in the primary and Republican C. Arthur Bruce in the general election.|$|R
