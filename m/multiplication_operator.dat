40|$|This paper {{studies the}} "energy space" H_E (the Hilbert space of {{functions}} of finite energy, aka the Dirichlet-finite functions) on an infinite network (weighted connected graph), {{from the point}} of view of the <b>multiplication</b> <b>operators</b> M_f associated to functions f on the network. We show that the <b>multiplication</b> <b>operators</b> M_f are not Hermitian unless f is constant, and compute the adjoint M_f^ in terms of a reproducing kernel for H_E. A characterization of the bounded <b>multiplication</b> <b>operators</b> is given in terms of positive semidefinite functions, and we give some conditions on f which ensure M_f is bounded. Examples show that it is not sufficient that f be bounded or have finite energy. Conditions for the boundedness of M_f are also expressed in terms of the behavior of the simple random walk on the network. We also consider the bounded elements of H_E and the (possibly unbounded) <b>multiplication</b> <b>operators</b> corresponding to them. In a previous paper, the authors used functional integration to construct a type of boundary for infinite networks. The boundary is described here in terms of a certain subalgebra of these <b>multiplication</b> <b>operators,</b> and is shown to embed into the Gel'fand space of that subalgebra. In the case when the only harmonic functions of finite energy are constant, we show that the Gel'fand space is the 1 -point compactification of the underlying network.
