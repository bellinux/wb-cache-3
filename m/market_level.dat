25|$|Another 2008 {{paper by}} the same authors {{experimentally}} demonstrated the existence of Giffen goods among people at the household level by directly subsidizing purchases of rice and wheat flour for extremely poor families. It is easier to find Giffen effects where the number of goods available is limited, as in an experimental economy: DeGrandpre et al. (1993) provide such an experimental demonstration. In 1991, Battalio, Kagel, and Kogut proved that quinine water is a Giffen good for some lab rats. However, they were only able to show {{the existence of a}} Giffen good at an individual level and not the <b>market</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moscoe {{played a}} {{significant}} role in Metro Council's deliberations over market value tax reform in late 1992, working with three Progressive Conservative councillors to broker a last-minute compromise on the issue. Under the proposed plan, businesses and factories that paid rates below the <b>market</b> <b>level</b> would have had their rate increases capped at 25% over three years, while tenants and homeowners would have had increases capped at 10% over three years. Those paying more than the market rate would also have had their reductions capped. The compromise won the support of council, despite opposition from councillors representing wards in downtown Toronto. The provincial government later rejected the proposal. Moscoe supported a similar five-year phase-in plan in 1998, which was accepted.|$|E
40|$|The monthly and {{quarterly}} price determination {{processes for}} 31 - 40 and 21 - 25 {{size classes of}} raw-headless shrimp were examined to determine price leadership between <b>market</b> <b>levels.</b> Causal relationships were assessed using Haugh-Pierce, Sims, and Granger methods. Price models at the retail, wholesale, and exvessel <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> were estimated. Economic factors analyzed were income, prices of competing products, landings and imports of raw headless shrimp, total retail supply, beginning stocks, and marketing costs. Monthly prices generally exhibited unidirectional causality from exvessel to retail price. Quarterly prices were determined interdependently among <b>market</b> <b>levels.</b> Price responses between <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> were found to by symmetric with beginning stocks, landings, and imports of own-size shrimp the most important determinants of price.

40|$|This paper extends Mukherjee and Naka's (1995) multivariate cointegration {{analysis}} {{of the impact of}} economic forces on the Japanese stock market to the Singapore context. We find that changes in two measures of real economic activity, industrial production and trade, are not integrated of the same order as changes in Singapore's stock <b>market</b> <b>levels.</b> Building a vector error-correction model, we find that changes in Singapore's stock <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> form a cointegrating relationship with changes in price levels, money supply, short term interest rates, long term interest rates and exchange rates. While changes in interest and exchange rates contribute significantly to the cointegrating relationship, those in price levels and money supply do not. This suggests that the Singapore stock market is interest and exchange rate-sensitive. We also build a trivariate vector error-correction model using changes in the Singapore, US and Japanese stock <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> and find that the three markets are [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} brief {{discussion}} of the Atlantic sea scallop fisheries, a 12 -equation model, and an evaluation using the model of management strategies proposed by the New England Fishery Management Council. The demand for sea scallops at all <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> is price inflexible. Income price flexibility is positive but less than 1 for demand at all <b>market</b> <b>levels.</b> Crossprice flexibility is positive but also less than 1 and is approximately the same for demand at all <b>market</b> <b>levels</b> (between 0. 36 and 0. 37). In general, fishing effort elasticities for each fishing area with respect to scallop abundance for that area are larger than 1. Effort elasticities with respect to ex-vessel price are 0. 42 and 0. 32 for the New England fleet's effort to the South Channel and eastern Georges Bank fishing areas, respectively. The partial elasticity of production with respect to inputs is higher for scallop abundance than for fishing effort in all Georges Bank resource areas. Reduction in fishing effort or in meat count would accrue positive benefits to the sea scallop industries and consumers, and the greater the reduction in effort and/or in meat count, the larger the benefits under long-term equilibrium conditions. However, the short-term economic impacts of the various management strategy scenarios are generally the reverse of the long-term benefits.
