25|$|Since 2004, {{many rural}} Canadian {{residents}} have been required to use community mail stations (known as a Community <b>Mail</b> <b>Box,</b> or CMB) instead of individual curbside mailboxes {{in an attempt to}} reduce health and safety complaints by Canada Post rural mail carriers. This change has been extended to some suburban areas of the country as well.|$|E
25|$|Until 1916, mail {{carriers}} {{knocked on}} the door and waited patiently for someone to answer. Efficiency experts estimated that each mailman lost over 1.5 hours each day just waiting for patrons to come to the door. To correct this problem, the Post Office Department ordered that every household must have a <b>mail</b> <b>box</b> or letter slot in order to receive mail. This requirement was phased in, starting with new delivery locations, around 1912. Slowly, homeowners and businesses began to install mail slots or attached mailboxes to receive mail when they were either not at home or unable to answer the door. The requirement was made mandatory in 1923.|$|E

25|$|Safety {{of rural}} mobile {{delivery}} personnel on busy roads {{has been an}} ongoing concern. Canada Post launched the Rural Mail Safety Review as rural and suburban mail carriers across the country, supported by their union, raised complaints about workplace safety. As of March 2008, {{there have been more}} than 1,400 such complaints. In some cases, the union staged protests in delivering mail, even after Canada Post tests showed there was no undue traffic safety risk at a particular <b>mail</b> <b>box.</b> Such cases were referred to Labour Canada, who in several instances asked Canada Post to cease delivery to mailboxes. In December 2006, the Canadian government ordered that Canada Post maintain rural delivery wherever possible. On January 1, 2004 rural route contractors became employees of Canada Post and joined the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.|$|E

[...] Standing under the rustic arch, leaning upon the gate, {{a man and woman}} composed a pieture so arresting and beautiful that Saxon caught her breath. They were side by side, the delicate hand of the woman curled in the hand of the man, which looked as if made to confer benedictions. His face bore out this impression--a beautiful-browed countenance, with large, benevolent gray eyes under a wealth of white hair that shone like spun glass. He was fair and large; the little woman beside him was daintily wrought. She was saffron-brown, as a woman of the white race can well be, with smiling eyes of bluest blue. In quaint sage-green draperies, she seemed a flower, with her small vivid face irresistibly reminding Saxon of a springtime wake-robin.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike Canadian mailboxes, {{which were}} painted red, U.S. <b>mail</b> {{collection}} <b>boxes</b> were originally painted in red or green.

[...] Dark green gave way to olive drab green after World War I, when the U.S. Army donated a large supply of olive drab green paint to the Post Office. Olive drab green subsequently became the standard color for all U.S. <b>mail</b> collection <b>boxes</b> until 1955. On 4 July 1955, Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield announced that the Post Office would begin painting all <b>mail</b> collection <b>boxes</b> in red, white, and blue to make them easily identifiable. Subsequently, the Post Office began painting <b>mail</b> collection <b>boxes</b> in red and blue, with white lettering. In 1971 the Post Office (now USPS) changed <b>mail</b> collection <b>boxes</b> to the current USPS Dark Blue with contrasting lettering. The coming of the automobile also influenced U.S. mailbox design, and in the late 1930s, an extension chute or [...] "snorkel" [...] to drive-up curbside collection boxes was adopted.|$|R
