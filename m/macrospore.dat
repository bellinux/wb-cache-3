30|$|The mobile–immobile {{partition}} coefficient, β, of the T-R {{represents the}} fraction of solute present in the mobile region under equilibrium conditions (Schulin and van Genuchten 1987). In the T-R, solute ions in the mobile region can freely move by dispersion but can only move and exchange by diffusion in the immobile region. The values of the mobile–immobile partition coefficient, β, became smaller with increases in the pore water velocity (Table  1). This was dependent on the initial tracer input {{in the presence of}} <b>macrospores,</b> since a portion of the solute transported by preferential flow moves quickly down the soil column without fully interacting with the soil matrix. Increasing pore water velocity results in greater resistance to preferential flow through the <b>macrospores,</b> so that convection and diffusion of ions in the mobile region will be reduced relative to the immobile region, resulting in reductions {{in the value of the}} mobile–immobile partition coefficient, β.|$|R

40|$|Dinoflagellate parasites of {{the genus}} Hematodinium are {{associated}} with heavy mortality of the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) off {{the west coast of}} Scotland. The Syndinean dinoflagellate has been isolated from N. norvegicus and has been successfully cultured axenically in vitro. Twelve isolates have been serially cultivated in a medium of 10 % fetal calf serum in a balanced Nephrops saline with added antibiotics at 8 - 10 °C. In this medium the parasite undergoes developmental changes that are believed to represent stages in the life cycle of the parasite in vivo. This is the first complete life cycle in vitro to be described for a Syndinean dinoflagellate. Flagellate dinospores arise in vitro from circulating sporogenic parasite forms - sporoblasts removed in the haemolymph from infected lobsters. Sporogenic parasites are recognised by the presence in the cytoplasm of structures not found in the trophont. These are (1) trichocysts and (2) flagellar hairs within swollen endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. Dinospores are of two types - a larger <b>macrospore</b> and a smaller, more active microspore. Individual isolates produce one or the other, not both. Condensation of chromosomes in the nucleus is more pronounced in the microspore than in the <b>macrospore.</b> Both spore types germinate after 18 - 62 days in the culture medium to produce the main multiplicative stage of the parasite in vitro - the multinucleate filamentous trophont. No fusion of flagellates has been observed and each type of spore can germinate independently of the presence of the other, indicating that the spores are not gametes. The filamentous trophonts correspond to the only form of the type species {{of the genus}}, Hematodinium perezi, found circulating in the blood of infected crabs by Chatton and Poisson (1931).

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{formation}} of <b>macrospores</b> in normally mycelial strains of Tricho-phyton mentagrophytes and T. rubrum was induced by growing the cultures in a gas phase containing air + 12 - 24 % (v/v) CO,. When conidial transfers {{were made from}} strains which had thus been induced to form <b>macrospores</b> and were incubated in normal air, the subsequent growth was mycelial and downy. One strain of each fungus, normally conidial and granular, formed arthrospores under increased CO,. The bases for genus and species differentiation of the superficial dermato-phytes are shape and size of macroconidia and gross cultural characteristics (Emmons, 1934). Identification of these Fungi imperfecti is complicated by loss {{of the ability to}} form macroconidia and variation in cultural morphology; most of the dermatophytes exist in two morphological types, conidial and mycelial (Wilhelm, 1947). When these fungi are first isolated from lesions on to Sabouraud's glucose agar, they usually grow as the conidial, macroconidia-forming, type. Upon repeated transfer, however, they often lose the ability to sporulate and continue growth as the mycelial type. Reversion of the mycelial to the conidial form is very uncommon. Investigations in this laboratory have shown that non-sporulating strains of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. rubrum can be induced to form macroconidia, thus reverting to the conidial type, by incubation in a gas phase containing concentrations of carbon dioxide above that of normal air (c. 0. 03 %, v/v) ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The colour {{variation}} of {{a strain of}} Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht ex Fr. was found {{to depend on the}} production of carotenoids and naphthoquinones. The carotenoids were only produced as a result of exposure to light, whereas the produc-tion of naphthoquinones, which were pH indicators, was mainly regulated by the carbon/nitrogen ratio of the medium. The morphogenetic effects of radiation and of carbon/nitrogen ratio were also considered. A low carbon/nitrogen ratio favoured chlamydospore formation and aerial mycelium, whereas ultraviolet radiation, {{and to a lesser extent}} light, promoted <b>macrospore</b> and sclerotium production. The identification of Fusarium spp. has presented difficulties which are only now being slowly resolved. Appel, Wollenweber and their co-workers, who have made the greatest single contribution to Fusarium taxonomy, developed a system, in particular in Die Fusarien (Wollenweber & Reinking, 1935), which makes use of the presence or absence of microspores, chlamydospores and sclerotia, the shape and distribution of the macrospores and, to some extent, the colour and texture of the mycelium. They also introduced a cultura...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{observations}} made in the ovule {{and development of the}} macrogametophyte in Coffea arabica L. var. monosperma. The young ovule is normally constituted by a rudimentary nucellus surrounded by a single and well developed integument. No irregularities are found until the beginning of the first meiotic division in the ma-crosporocyte which is situated inside the nucellus. The two meiotic divisions are very abnormal and during this process, 44, 4 % of the otherwise normal macrospores degenerate. Only. a few normal macrospores are formed. The functional <b>macrospore</b> is not always the chalazal one as in the normal coffee varieties. Irregularities occur also in the subseguent divisions {{in the formation of the}} embryo sac. Degeneration then increased from 44, 4 to 82, 0 %. Only one complete embryo sac has been found among the 87 examined ovules. During the formation of the embryo sac, even when complete degeneration occurs, the ovule increases in volume due to the multiplication of the integument cells. From the moment in which the embryo sac should be formed (two days after the flower opening) this increase in volume stops. A total desorganization of the ovule occurs around 105 days after the opening of the flower...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Acid {{activated}} clay minerals {{are used as}} catalysts in the desulphurization of crude oil or as catalyst carrier, as drilling mud, as bleaching earth. Approach: The efficiency of the acid activation {{can be described in}} two ways. As increase of the surface and as increase of the cumulative pore volume after the activation. Results: In different samples of the clay mineral the activation was done with different sulfuric acid concentrations for two and 3 h. Afterwards the specific surface was measured by means of nitrogen adsorption. All the measured isotherms belong to the pseudo-two kind. After the activation the surface enhanced from around 100 - 180 m 2 g - 1. The mesopore distribution is calculated out of the hysteresis between adsorption-desorption isotherms of the nitrogen. Conclusion: It is shown that the activation increases significantly the amount of mesopores which is reflected in the cumulative volume. The <b>macrospore</b> volume of the clay samples were measured by means of mercury intrusion porosimetry for pore sizes up to 320 nm. The volume of the macrospores results to an increase up to two times after the activation. The cumulative volume of all the pores is shown like a good parameter of the efficiency of the acid activation. The measurements were fulfilled in the newly equipped laboratory of the surface characterizations of the Tirana University. These analyses are of big interest for the industry in Albania and Kosove...|$|E
50|$|Scientists {{speculate}} that spore ingestion {{is the main}} transmission pathway in which crustacean hosts acquire Hematodinium parasites (Shields, 1994). However, cannibalism with the ingestion of trophonts is another possibility. Vegetative cells known as trophonts are usually located in the host’s hemolymph and quickly multiply via schizogony. Plasmodia containing 2 to 8 nuclei are motile in H. perezi. Sporulation follows, leading {{to the formation of}} prespores then of dinospores. Dinospores supposedly exit the host through small openings in the carapace or through antennal glands. <b>Macrospores</b> are slightly larger than microspores by a few micrometers, and both are able to withstand ocean water conditions for several days.|$|R

40|$|The {{suitability}} of viable and non-viable volumetric collectors as prevalence indicators for potentially allergenic airborne fungi was studied during 124 paired exposures of the Burkard (Hirst) spore trap and a modified, wind-oriented Andersen sampler. Overall, viable recoveries of several Cladosporium form species varied directly with microscopic spore counts (p≤ 0. 0001). However, as spore levels rose, culture plate data progressively underestimated prevailing concentrations (recoveries falling below 5 % at levels above 500 spores/M 3). Viable collections yielded low estimates of prevalence (20 – 40 %) even at modest Cladosporium levels (< 100 spores/M 3) and substantially understated the abundance and regularity in air of several additional taxa. Spores typical of Penicillium and Aspergillus form species were not sought in spore trap deposits. Careful examination of these failed to reveal typical arthrospores or Fusarium <b>macrospores</b> despite substantial recoveries of corresponding growth in culture.

The objective {{of this study was to}} correlate the severity of leaf streak (Stenocarpella macrospora) with the pathogen incidence in grains, as well to evaluate the effect of this incidence on grain germination of different maize hybrids. For that purpose, a trial was carried out at the experimental field of Dow AgroSciences in Uberaba (MG). Sixteen hybrids in 2002 / 2003, and 20 in 2003 / 2004 were evaluated for leaf streak severity, under natural infection in the field, in a randomized complete block design with two replications, and experimental plot consisting of four 4 m-long rows. The two central rows of each plot were graded for disease severity. After harvested, a grain sample (1 Kg) was taken from each plot to seed health (blotter test with freezing method) and germination (germination roll method) tests. In both experiments, results showed no positive correlation between disease severity and pathogen incidence on grains, suggesting that the high level of severity of the foliar phase of the disease cannot be taken as an indication of the incidence of the fungus on grains. A negative correlation between the incidence of the pathogen on grains and germination, and a positive correlation between pathogen incidence and the percentage of non-germinated grains were observed, indicating that S. <b>macrospore</b> affects the physiological quality of maize grain...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{existing}} data concerning {{the evolution of the}} sexual reproduction, it is argued that the processes of sex differentiation and interactions {{play a key role in}} evolution. From the beginning environment and organism are unified. In a changing dynamic environment life originates and the interaction between life and environment develops from simple to more complex organisms. Sexual reproduction is introduced after the origin of meiosis and is a key process in evolution. The asexual reproduction process prepares to dispersal. Sexual reproduction process adds the genome renewal and the gamete-gamete interaction. Reproduction and dispersal are connected and the process of reproduction has similarities between asexual and sexual reproduction. Unicellular algae develop the physiological and morphological sex differentiation. Sex differentiation is connected with the way of dispersal. The step to multicellular plants introduces cell isolation after meiosis and by the stay on the mother plant within a cell or organ, plant-cell apoplastic interaction originates and by prolonged stay the plant-plant interaction. This stay influences the type of dispersal. A life cycle with alternation of generations and two moments of dispersal permits plants to go on land. In ferns a shift in the moment of sex differentiation to meiospore happens and the stay of the <b>macrospore</b> leads to the seed plants. In water all types of sexual reproduction, interactions and the alternation of generations are prepared and these are used to conquest land. On land the biotic dispersal is realized. The phylogeny of sexual reproduction reveals that the sex differentiation and interaction are the main causes in the evolution of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction shows interactions during gamete fusion, between organism and environment and in multicellular plants between organisms. With respect to other types of interaction as in symbiosis or the nutrient chain, interaction is considered as an important action which is based on a persisting cooperation and points to a push during evolution. The push is expressed as communication: the driving force in the evolution. Based on the interactions between organisms and interactions between organisms and the dynamic environment, communication is considered as a driving force leading to the evolution as explained in the development of plant reproduction. Consequences for reproduction, its regulation and the process of evolution are discusse...|$|E
30|$|The BTCs {{also showed}} more {{significant}} tailing phenomenon, {{especially for the}} slower pore water velocities (Fig.  1). Due to the slower movement of some chloride solution through the soil matrix by convection and diffusion, {{a fraction of the}} chloride in the pulse flowed relatively rapidly via the <b>macrospores</b> {{to the base of the}} soil column, as a result, the remaining chloride migrated through the soil matrix relatively slowly by diffusion, which led to the chloride appeared in the effluent over a longer period of time as demonstrated by the long tailing. The degree of tailing for the slower pore water velocities can thus be considered to result from a lesser degree of bypass flow and a greater degree of flow through the soil matrix (Bouma and Anderson 1977; Sollins and Radulovich 1988) resulting in an overall slower solute flow. With increasing pore water velocity, the chloride moving by diffusion cannot fully exchange by convection while a greater fraction moves through preferential flow so that the tailing becomes longer. This explanation is consistent with our experimental results.|$|R
40|$|The aleuriospore, a {{secondary}} submerged spore type {{found in the}} Aspergillus terreus-flavipes group, was recently shown to have taxonomic significance {{as well as a}} unique morphology. Aleuriospores were demonstrated in pathological material from a pulmonary aspergilloma. In a series of experiments, mice were inoculated intravenously with A. carneus, A. flavipes, A. niveus and A. terreus. Although there was species and strain variation in virulence, all species caused lateral and truncal ataxia which was frequently correlated with multiple acute asper-gillomas of the cerebellum and cerebrum. All 4 species produced aleuriospores in brain tissue, which was diagnostic for the group, in contrast to other Aspergillus pp. which did not. The aleuriospores were identical in morphology to those produced in vitro and represent a rare example of exogenous sporulation by fungi in non-necrosed tissues.

The minimal functional core of conserved SWI/SNF complexes {{consists of}} a SWI 2 /SNF 2 ATPase, SNF 5, SWP 73, {{and a pair of}} SWI 3 subunits. Because of early duplication of the SWI 3 gene family in plants, Arabidopsis thaliana encodes four SWI 3 -like proteins that show remarkable functional diversification. Whereas ATSWI 3 A and ATSWI 3 B form homodimers and heterodimers and interact with BSH/SNF 5, ATSWI 3 C, and the flowering regulator FCA, ATSWI 3 D can only bind ATSWI 3 B in yeast two-hybrid assays. Mutations of ATSWI 3 A and ATSWI 3 B arrest embryo development at the globular stage. By a possible imprinting effect, the atswi 3 b mutations result in death for approximately half of both <b>macrospores</b> and microspores. Mutations in ATSWI 3 C cause semidwarf stature, inhibition of root elongation, leaf curling, aberrant stamen development, and reduced fertility. Plants carrying atswi 3 d mutations display severe dwarfism, alterations in the number and development of flower organs, and complete male and female sterility.

40|$|Estimation of hydraulic: {{properties}} or soils having macropores is difficult, yet {{very important}} for describing soil-water flow dynamics. Conventional approaches of defining macroporosity based on pore size may not be generally successful quantitatively relating macroporosity to the dynamics of water flow. A definition or macroporosity based on water flux at different degrees or water saturation {{can be expected to}} be more useful. This study attempted to quantify the functional macroporosity of field soil from In situ measurements of water content, 6 (z, t), during drainage of an initially field-saturated soil. The soil was assumed to be a two-domain water flow system comprised of macropores, which dominate the early drainage process, and the matrix pore space, which is responsible for drainage occurring after macropores are emptied. The unit hydraulic gradient approach of calculating hydraulic productivity was extended and applied to the two-domain system. Field-measured data for a well-drained Wahiawa soil (clayey, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Tropeptic Eutrustox) in Hawaii are used to test the approach. The partitioned hydraulic conductivities obtained for the two domains appeared qualitatively realistic, and when summed, resulted in a composite saturated conductivity which was close to that measured by the in situ instantaneous profile method. In addition, the macosporosites obtained from drainage calculations for three soil depths were very similar to those obtained from water retention measurements on undisturbed soil cores from the same field site. The proposed approach thus appears to be a promising method for evaluating hydraulic properties for a well-drained soil profile containing <b>macrospores...</b>|$|R

Three of the four <b>macrospores</b> resulting from the'division of the macrosporocyte, degenerate. The remaining chalazal cell {{gives rise to a}} "normal'' embryo sac, which is ready for fertilization {{at the time of the}} flower opening. Double fertilization occurs, as a rule, the day the flower opens. The embryo sac then increases in volume and compresses the inner integument cells. The outer cells of the integument, however, multiply actively, giving rise to the "perisperm". After degeneration of the synergids and antipodals, the zygote stays near the micro-pyle in a resting stage, while the primary endosperm nucleus divides. This first division of the endosperm occurs from 21 to 27 days after flower opening. The cytoplasm condenses around the newly formed nuclei, permitting the adjacent tissues to sink into the embryo sac. Since the separating walls were not seen at the binueleate stage and were present at the four-nucleate stage, it seems that the endosperm belongs to the' "nuclear type". As the number of endosperm cells increases, the "perisperm" cells are again compressed and give more and more room to the new tissue. The first division in the zygote occurs from sixty to seventy days after flower opening, when the endosperm is already multinucleate. A differentiated embryo develops, with a hypocotyl and two small cotyledons in the ripe seed.

Due {{to the lack}} of two-phase transport data in literature, Leverett function developed for sand was used in modeling liquid transport phenomena in porous media [1]. In recent years, experimentally measured capillary functions of the porous media used in PEM fuel cells have become available [2 - 9]. Gostick et al. [2] measured the capillary functions of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) with the method of standard porosimetry (MSP), which only obtained the hydrophilic part of the capillary curve. Kumbur et al. [3 - 5] investigated the compression, hydrophobicity, and temperature effects on the capillary functions of GDLs and developed an appropriate form of Leverett empirical function that took both compression and mixed wettability into consideration. Fairweather et al. [6] reported capillary curves for Toray 090 by applying microfluidic device. The results showed significant hysteresis between imibibition and drainage curves. I. R. Harkness et al. [7] and Gostick et al. [8] also found hysteresis for porous media used PEM fuel cell. In contrary, no hysteresis was observed in Nguyen et al. ’s work [9]. Nguyen et al. attributed the lack of hysteresis to the narrow capillary pressure range in their experiment.
