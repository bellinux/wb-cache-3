2500|$|Only the <b>monk</b> <b>parakeet</b> {{and five}} species of lovebirds build nests in trees, and three Australian and New Zealand ground parrots nest on the ground. All other parrots and {{cockatoos}} nest in cavities, either tree hollows or cavities dug into cliffs, banks, or the ground. The use of holes in cliffs {{is more common}} in the Americas. Many species use termite nests, possibly to reduce the conspicuousness of the nesting site or to create a favourable microclimate. In most cases, both parents participate in the nest excavation. The length of the burrow varies with species, but is usually between [...] in length. The nests of cockatoos are often lined with sticks, wood chips, and other plant material. In the larger species of parrots and cockatoos, the availability of nesting hollows may be limited, leading to intense competition for them both within the species and between species, as well as with other bird families. The intensity of this competition can limit breeding success in some cases. Hollows created artificially by arborists have proven successful in boosting breeding rates in these areas. Some species are colonial, with the burrowing parrot nesting in colonies up to 70,000 strong. Coloniality is not as common in parrots as might be expected, possibly because most species adopt old cavities rather than excavate their own.|$|E

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} to the United States in the 1960 s, <b>monk</b> <b>parakeets</b> (Myiopsitta monachus) have thrived (Figure 1). Until recently, annual Christmas Bird Count data have shown the population to be increasing exponentially. In the U. S., <b>monk</b> <b>parakeets</b> are an urban and suburban species with few natural predators, diseases or other factors limiting their population growth. They exploit backyard bird feeders and non-native ornamental plants for food. <b>Monk</b> <b>parakeets</b> often construct nests on man-made structures, such as electric utility facilities and cell phone towers. Because the birds build and maintain nests throughout the year, management of parakeet populations has become an important issue for utility companies in several States. Currently, nest removal and trapping are the primary methods for managing parakeet damage, Reproductive control through contraception shows promise for long-term, nonlethal population management...|$|R

50|$|<b>Monk</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{tend to be}} {{restricted}} to urban areas where they feed and nest in ornamental palm trees, occupying a niche that no indigenous bird holds. So far, their distribution in Louisiana has been limited almost exclusively to the City of New Orleans, where they have had no adverse effects on local wildlife. If their numbers increase, however, <b>monk</b> <b>parakeets</b> could pose {{a serious threat to}} agricultural areas, possibly becoming as much of a pest here as they already are in their native range.|$|R

5000|$|An {{agricultural}} pest in {{its native}} South American range, the <b>monk</b> <b>parakeet</b> was first {{brought to the}} U.S. as a cage bird. They were so popular that over 60,000 were imported between 1969 and 1972. By the 1980s {{it had already been}} released {{in many parts of the}} country and had established small breeding colonies. Twenty years later, <b>monk</b> <b>parakeet</b> numbers have increased exponentially but their distribution remains spotty.|$|E
50|$|Because of monk parakeets' listing as an {{agricultural}} pest, California, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Hawaii, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wyoming, and Western Australia outlaw sale and ownership. In Connecticut, one can own a <b>monk</b> <b>parakeet,</b> but cannot sell or breed them. In New York and Virginia, {{it is possible}} to own a <b>monk</b> <b>parakeet</b> with banding and registration. In Ohio, owning one is legal if the bird's wings are clipped or it is incapable of free flight.|$|E

5000|$|They {{have also}} found a home in Brooklyn, New York, after an {{accidental}} release decades ago of what {{appears to have been}} black-market birds within Green-Wood Cemetery. The grounds crew initially tried to destroy the unsightly nests at the entrance gate, but no longer do so because the presence of the parrots has reduced the number of pigeons nesting within it. The management's decision was based on a comparative chemical analysis of pigeon feces (which destroy brownstone structures) and <b>monk</b> <b>parakeet</b> feces (which have no ill effect). The monk parakeets are in effect preserving this historic structure. Brooklyn College has a <b>monk</b> <b>parakeet</b> as an [...] "unofficial" [...] mascot in reference to the colony of the species that lives in its campus grounds. It is featured on the masthead of the student magazine. They have also made their homes in the lamp posts in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx.

50|$|Like {{the other}} neotropical parrots, the <b>monk</b> <b>parakeet</b> is usually {{placed in the}} tribe Arini, which might warrant {{elevation}} to subfamily rank as the Arinae.

50|$|The cliff parakeet (Myiopsitta luchsi) {{is a small}} {{species of}} parrot in the family Psittacidae.

50|$|Thousands of <b>monk</b> <b>parakeets</b> were {{imported}} to the United States between 1960s and 1980s as pets. Many escaped or were intentionally released, and {{populations were}} allowed to proliferate. By the early 1970s, M. monachus was established in seven states, and by 1995, it had spread to eight more. In Florida alone estimates range from 150,000 to 500,000.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Monk</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{are highly}} intelligent, social birds. Those kept as pets {{routinely}} develop vocabularies {{of scores of}} words and phrases. Due to this early speaking ability, it is overtaking the cockatiel as the favorite bird to teach to talk. Another asset is that this bird has a much more reasonable lifespan and price than African grey parrots.|$|R
