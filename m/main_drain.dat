5|$|A new <b>main</b> <b>drain</b> to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E

The fittings were removed in the late 4th century, but debris nearby suggests they were originally made of sandstone. The walls were plastered and coloured white with red stripes and patches of pink. The latrine was accessible via a passageway which contained a mosaic floor. Parts of the plaster fragments of one of the walls still remain.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} amounts of money spent on the schemes, they were not {{particularly}} effective, because of the failure to provide an outfall at Marfleet. Ship owners continued to oppose such a plan until at least 1810, and there was an agricultural depression from 1815 to 1830. During this period, the port of Hull developed, with the opening of Humber Dock in 1809 and Junction Dock (later Princes Dock) in 1829. By the time the agricultural industry began to recover, the carrs were in a bad state, but so was the Old Harbour at Hull. Holderness Drainage acted quickly, obtaining an Act of Parliament in 1832, which authorised the construction of a drain to Marfleet, where the outlet sluice (known locally as a clow) could be built at a lower level than previous outlets, thus providing a better gradient for the flow of the water. The old <b>Main</b> <b>Drain</b> was embanked where it crossed the carrs, and was used to carry runoff from the streams of Holderness to the Hull. The new lowland drain carried water from the carrs to Marfleet, passing under the upland drain in the Great Culvert. Where possible, old drains were made straighter, wider and deeper, and the meres in the Leven and Tickton area soon disappeared. By 1854, around one sixth of the land was still subject to occasional winter flooding, but most of the carrs were by then used for crops, rather than for pasture.|$|E

500|$|As {{the land}} dried, the peaty soils shrank, causing the land surface to drop. Much of the Middle Levels was flooded in 1841-2, and this led the Commissioners {{to obtain an}} Act of Parliament in 1844, which {{authorised}} {{the construction of a}} new <b>main</b> <b>drain,</b> [...] long, in order that water could flow by gravity to Wiggenhall St Germans, where the levels of the tidal river were about [...] lower than at Salters Lode. The work was completed in 1848, and the sluice at Marmount Priory was also built at this time, in order to allow boats with a deeper draught to navigate through Upwell and Outwell. A railway line from [...] to [...] passed through the port of March from 1846, which soon became a railway hub, with branch lines to Wisbech and St Ives. Traffic transferred from the waterways, which made the drainage responsibilities of the Commissioners easier. The new <b>main</b> <b>drain</b> enabled Whittlesey Mere to be drained. A pumping station with an Appold centrifugal pump was used to achieve this, rather than the more traditional scoop wheel. The pump had been shown for the first time at the Great Exhibition in 1851, where it amazed visitors, and its inventor was commissioned to design a pump for the draining of the mere. It was [...] in diameter, and powered by a [...] steam engine, could raise 101 tons of water per minute by [...] In 1862 an Act of Parliament created the Middle Level Commissioners as a separate body to the Bedford Level Corporation, although they had been almost independent since 1810, and they embarked on a series of improvements. Drainage was always the primary function, but navigation was also important, and the new body had powers to charge tolls for the use of the waterways.|$|E
500|$|A {{separate}} {{entry block}} was planned, {{adjacent to the}} Villy Est casemate. The underground gallery system at La Ferté is simple, limited to a gallery linking the two blocks, which were initially designed to function as separate units with separate generating plants and ventilation facilities in each block. The [...] gallery contained some shared facilities, such as a kitchen, a laundry and an infirmary, at an average depth of [...] below the surface. The gallery's small size made it most useful as a link, rather than as the garrison, magazine, command post and long-term shelter afforded by the gallery systems of most Maginot ouvrages. Unlike most ouvrages, La Ferté's living spaces were near the surface in the two combat blocks. A more typical Maginot position would have such spaces under [...] of earth or rock cover. Unlike many Maginot positions, the <b>main</b> <b>drain</b> at La Ferté was not configured as an emergency exit. The mixed-arms turret used on Block 2 {{was known to be}} mechanically trouble-prone, and La Ferté's turret particularly so.|$|E
500|$|In 1762, the Witham Drainage Act {{was passed}} by Parliament, and among other things {{constituted}} the Commissioners of Sewers for the Second and Sixth District, which covered the area including Asgarby, Ewerby, Great Hale, Heckington, Holland Fen, Howell, Little Hale and South Kyme. Much of the area {{to the south and}} west of Boston, some , was inundated by the Great Flood of 1763, and against this background, the Black Sluice Drainage and Navigation Act 1765 was obtained which created the Black Sluice Commissioners, giving them power to raise taxes and authority to carry out drainage works. The scheme largely revived the Earl of Lindsey's original scheme. The initial design work was carried out by the civil engineer Langley Edwards, on loan from the Witham Commissioners. Some of the surveying was performed by John Landen, who was the steward of the estate of Earl Fitzwilliam at Peterborough, and a proficient amateur mathematician. The two men were jointly appointed Surveyors of the Works, acting as engineers for the scheme, while John Chapman and Richard Strattard were assistants. A new sluice, called the Black Sluice, was built at Boston as a direct replacement for the Skirbeck Sluice, having three openings with a total width of [...] The [...] of the drain were scoured from Boston to Great Hale, beyond which the <b>Main</b> <b>Drain</b> was upgraded by cutting a new [...] channel, effectively extending the South Forty-Foot Drain to Guthram, {{on the banks of the}} River Glen. A total of [...] of highland streams were improved by scouring and raising of the banks. The estimated cost of £16,000 was raised by issuing bonds, but the project overran, and another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1770 to authorise the raising of the drainage taxes, to cover the difference. By mid-1769, when Landen and Edwards left the project, because the work was largely complete, the scheme had cost £24,000. They were replaced by Edward Hare as Surveyor of Works, with Chapman and Strattard continuing as assistants. A historian called W. H. Wheeler, who chronicled the Lincolnshire fens, wrote that [...] "the works were efficiently carried out and, being well-designed, entirely answered expectation." ...|$|E

After increased urban development in the 1920s a need for improved metropolitan drainage (in particular drainage infrastructure involving more than one municipal district) was identified.

2500|$|In {{order to}} improve the gravity {{discharge}} {{of water from the}} district, the sluice into the River Nene at Peters Point was rebuilt in 1937. Its width was reduced slightly to , but the cill was lowered to [...] below Ordnance Datum. In order to cope with the silty sub-soil in which the foundations had to be built, well point dewatering equipment was used {{for the first time in}} England. This consists of inserting small tubes into the ground and pumping them with a high-efficiency vacuum pump to lower the ground water levels, creating a dry and stable working environment. The need to grow more food during the Second World War led to large areas of low-lying grassland being ploughed up for crops, and this required improved drainage. The <b>Main</b> <b>Drain</b> Improvement Scheme was drawn up in 1942, and widening and deeping of the <b>Main</b> <b>Drain</b> and other channels was carried out.

2500|$|It {{appears that}} Grundy had been acting as Chief Engineer since July 1764. In {{addition}} to the <b>main</b> <b>drain,</b> the scheme involved the construction of [...] of barrier bank, on the east bank of the River Hull, to prevent inundation of the low-lying land from that source. Construction of the bank had begun in July 1764, with John Hoggard acting as Superintendent of the works. In March 1765, work on the main sluice began, and bricklayers, carpenters and masons were employed. The resident engineer or 'Surveyor' for {{this part of the}} work and for the construction of the <b>main</b> <b>drain</b> was Joseph Page, who was paid £80 per year. Throughout the contract, Charles Tate, who had produced the original engraved plan, worked as the land surveyor. Grundy in his capacity as Chief Engineer, visited the sites on four occasions in 1765, and continued to do so until October 1767, when the main drains and sluice were finished. Both he and Page then moved on, but work on the banks and drains continued under the supervision of Hoggard. By the time this first phase was completed in 1772, the cost had been around £24,000.|$|E
2500|$|His {{report of}} 1786 had stated that a {{navigation}} {{might be an}} advantage to the drainage.

However, the trustees did not take the plan any further. An independent group proposed a canal running parallel to the drain in September 1791, which would be navigable from near the Holderness outfall to Monk bridge, or to Leven, about [...] further to the north. The drainage trustees were anxious to ensure that such a plan would not damage the drainage, and asked John Hudson of Louth to assess it in February 1792. The promoters then petitioned Parliament in March, but the plan foundered.|$|E

Further improvements followed, when negotiations with British Rail resulted in the skew bridge, which carried the Ely to Norwich line over the <b>main</b> <b>drain</b> being demolished and replaced by a culvert.

2500|$|The South Holland Drainage District was {{established}} by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793. At the time, the <b>main</b> <b>drain</b> was the Old Shire Drain, which had been cut from Clowes Cross to Tydd in 1629 by the Adventurers of the Bedford Level, a group of early venture capitalists. The drain was {{also known as the}} South Eau or Old South Holland Drain, and its outfall was into the River Nene at Tydd Gote through a sluice. Prior to obtaining the Act, landowners in South Holland had engaged George Maxwell and John Hudson to draw up plans for a drainage scheme. Maxwell was a land agent and engineer, while Hudson was a surveyor. They made an initial inspection in November 1791, after which they employed others to conduct a full survey. They returned in August 1792, and Maxwell measured the fall on the proposed route as [...] in [...] The estimated cost of the project was nearly £18,000, of which the cutting of the drain accounted for £8,450 and the construction of the sluice at Peters Point on the Nene, £3,100.

25|$|Flooding in the Holderness Level {{increased}} between 1840 and 1880, {{as farmers}} used tile drains {{to keep their}} land free of standing water. These carried the water away more quickly to the <b>main</b> <b>drains,</b> increasing the peak flow. Where this drained into the upland drain, {{this was not a}} problem, but where it entered the lowland drain, it caused difficulties, particularly when Marfleet was tide locked. Following the successful introduction of steam pumping on the Beverley and Barmston drain, {{to the west of the}} River Hull, the Trustees looked at the possibility of installing pumps as Marfleet. However, help came from another source.|$|R
2500|$|The scheme {{included}} {{provision for}} drainage engines, one in Sutton St Mary or Tydd, to pump the <b>main</b> <b>drain</b> into the Nene, {{and the other}} on the Lord's Drain. Land owners {{to the west of the}} Welland could still route water under the Welland to the Lord's Drain on payment of suitable fees. In order to finance the scheme, the Commissioners could charge an acre tax, which could not exceed £2 per acre, spread over three years, and which was apportioned based on the benefit that the landowner would receive from the works. The outfall of the River Nene was inadequate, and a new one was constructed in 1832, towards which the South Holland trustees contributed £7,000. As a consequence, they were allowed to lower their own outfall, which they did in 1852. The new sluice was [...] wide, and the cill level was [...] below Ordnance Datum, some [...] lower that the original sluice constructed in 1795.
