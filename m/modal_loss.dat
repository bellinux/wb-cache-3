30|$|The <b>modal</b> <b>loss</b> {{per unit}} length αi and modal {{confinement}} factor Γwg are significant factors of the optical cavity relevant to lasing. The modal confinement factor is an indicator of how well the mode overlaps with the gain medium, which {{is defined as the}} ration between the modal gain the material gain in the active region [27, 28]. The <b>modal</b> <b>loss</b> {{per unit length}} αi can be obtained from the imaginary part of modal propagation constant kz as αi[*]=[*] 2 [*]Im[kz]. As shown in Fig.  4 b, the <b>modal</b> <b>loss</b> of CPN-N and CPN-W lasers behaves negatively correlated with the nanowire diameter D. Whereas as shown in Fig.  4 c, the confinement factor of CPN-N and CPN-W lasers behaves positively correlated with the nanowire diameter D. With the decreasing diameter of nanowire, the electromagnetic energy cannot be localized well inside the nanowire, more and more electromagnetic energy leaks. Part of electromagnetic energy scatters outside from the upper part of nanowire, and part of energy interacts with groove surface leading to more metal dissipation. It {{is interesting to note that}} mode TM 01 in CPN-N laser has both relatively large confinement factor and <b>modal</b> <b>loss.</b> This can be attributed to the distribution of electric field of mode TM 01. As shown in Fig.  3 d, electromagnetic energy distributes both inside the nanowire and around its surface. Though the confinement is tighter, the electromagnetic energy has stronger interaction with the metal groove. Importantly in Fig.  4 c, as the nanowire diameter increases, the confinement factor becomes larger, indicating that the electromagnetic energy is confined in the cavity and overlaps well with the active region and potentially lower the lasing threshold.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest in making the photonic devices more and more compact in the integrated photonics industry, {{and one of the}} important questions for manufacturers and design engineers is how to quantify the effect of the finite cladding thickness on the <b>modal</b> confinement <b>loss</b> of photonic waveguides. This requires at least six to seven digits accuracy for the computation of propagation constant β since the <b>modal</b> confinement <b>loss</b> is proportional to the imaginary part of β that is six to seven orders of magnitude smaller than its real part by the industrial standard. In this paper, we present an accurate and efficient method to compute the propagation constant of electromagnetic modes of photonic waveguides with arbitrary number of (nonsmooth) inclusions in a layered media. The method combines a well-conditioned boundary integral equation formulation for photonic waveguides which requires the discretization of the material interface only, and efficient Sommerfeld integral representations to treat the effect of the layered medium. Our scheme is capable of calculating the propagation loss of the electromagnetic modes with high fidelity, even for waveguides with corners imbedded in a cladding material of finite thickness. The numerical results, with more than 10 -digit accuracy, show quantitatively that the <b>modal</b> confinement <b>loss</b> of the rectangular waveguide increases exponentially fast as the cladding thickness decreases...|$|R
40|$|In {{the hollow}} core {{photonic}} bandgap fibers, <b>modal</b> <b>losses</b> are strongly differentiated, potentially enabling effectively single mode guidance. However, {{in the presence}} of macro-bending, due to mode coupling, power in the low-loss mode launched into a bend is partially transferred into the modes with higher losses, thus resulting in increased propagation loss, and degradation of the beam quality. We show that coupled mode theory formulated in the curvilinear coordinates associated with a bend can describe correctly both the bending induced loss and beam degradation. Suggested approach works both in absorption dominated regime in which fiber modes are square integrable over the fiber crossection, as well as in radiation dominated regime in which leaky modes are not square integrable. It is important to stress that for multimode fibers, full-vectorial coupled mode theory developed in this work is not a simple approximation, but it is on par with such "exact" numerical approaches as finite element and finite difference methods for prediction of macro-bending induced losses.

40|$|Abstract Remarkable {{progress}} has been made over the past decade in controlling light propagation and absorption in compact devices using nanophotonic structures and metamaterials. From sensing and modulation, to on-chip communication and light trapping for solar cells, new device applications and opportunities motivate the need for a rigorous understanding of the modal properties of metamaterials over a broad range of frequencies. In this review, we provide an overview of a metamaterial band theory we have developed that rigorously models the behavior of metamaterials made of dispersive materials such as metals. The theory extends traditional photonic band theory for periodic dielectric structures by coupling the mechanical motion of electrons in the metal directly to Maxwell’s equations. The solution for the band structures of metamaterials is then reduced to a standard matrix eigenvalue problem that nevertheless fully takes into account the dispersive properties of the constituent materials. As an application of the metamaterial band theory, we show that one can develop a perturbation formalism based on this theory to physically explain and predict the effect of dielectric refractive index modulation or metallic plasma frequency variation in metamaterials. Furthermore, the metamaterial band theory also provides an intuitive physical picture of the source of <b>modal</b> material <b>loss,</b> as well as a rigorous upper bound on the <b>modal</b> material <b>loss</b> rate of any plasmonic, metamaterial structure.

40|$|Metamaterials {{can provide}} many {{different}} functionalities and striking optical properties, whereby the optical control often comes from metallic building blocks which exhibit plasmonic resonances in the optical and infra-red frequency regimes. However, {{one of the}} major obstacles in the use of metallic elements is the overcoming of the losses in plasmonic structures. In this thesis, we consider how mode hybridisation can be used to circumvent these losses using cut-wire plasmonic arrays coupled to photonic slab waveguides. The resulting hybrid modes can have low loss characteristics and we investigate how the geometric parameters of the structure can be used to control the transmission and dispersion properties. We then investigate finite arrays finding they can support modes with extremely high quality factors (Q∼ 4000), which is highly unusual in plasmonic systems, and that the individual loss mechanisms can be controlled via the geometry. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we consider another type of surface mode, the spoof SPP. Theoretical methods for describing spoof SPPs in perfectly conducting materials are well established, enabling the design of an arbitrary spoof plasma frequency. However, for dispersive materials there have been a lack of theoretical studies. We begin by considering first how small changes to the spoof plasmon geometry affect the characteristics of spoof SPP waves, adapting the coupled mode method to slanted geometries and even right-angled triangular indentations, a structure not normally associated with spoof SPPs. We then develop a formalism based on the coupled mode method allowing the dispersion of real metal spoof SPPs to be understood and tuned, thus enabling control of the optical spoof SPP characteristics via both the geometry and the incorporated materials.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of optical mode loss in semiconductor lasers is of significant commercial value, contributing to lower threshold current densities and higher above-threshold slope efficiencies. While it has improved significantly with successive developments in semiconductor laser design resulting from {{improvements to the}} fabrication process, characterisation methods for the measurement of optical mode loss have not kept pace. Today values of optical mode losses as low as 1 cm- 1 are frequently reported, and yet the precision and accuracy of its measurement are rarely better than 1 cm- 1 itself. To address this, I demonstrate that a modulated approach to the segmented contact method for the measurement of <b>modal</b> absorption and <b>loss</b> can measure optical mode losses with precisions as low as 0. 1 cm- 1.

The dissipative treatments used for noise and vibration control such as viscoelastic patches and acoustic absorbing materials {{must be taken into}} account in the problem. The Statistical modal Energy distribution Analysis (SmEdA) model consists in extending Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) to the mid-frequency range by establishing power balance equations between the modes of the different subsystems. The modal basis of uncoupled-subsystems that can be estimated by the finite element method in the mid-frequency range is used as input data. SmEdA was originally developed by considering constant modal damping factors for each subsystem. However, this means that it cannot describe the local distribution of dissipative materials. To overcome this issue, a methodology is proposed here to take into account the effect of these materials. This methodology is based on the finite element models of the subsystems that include well-known homogenized material models of dissipative treatments. The Galerkin method with subsystem normal modes is used to estimate the <b>modal</b> damping <b>loss</b> factors. Cross-modal coupling terms which appear in the formulation due to the dissipative materials are assumed to be negligible. An approximation of the energy sharing between the subsystems damped by dissipative materials is then described by SmEdA. The different steps of the method are validated experimentally by applying it to a laboratory test case composed of a plate-cavity system with different configurations of dissipative treatments. The comparison between the experimental and the simulation results shows good agreement in the mid-frequency range...|$|R
