25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used to take <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> cowboy movies {{all the time when}} I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|My illness helped <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that what}} was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all you want and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E
500|$|According to Hubert Wellington, Delacroix—who {{would become}} the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault's death—wrote, [...] "Géricault allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his Raft of Medusa {{while he was still}} working on it. It made so {{tremendous}} an impression on me that when I came out of the studio I started running like a madman and did not stop till I reached my own room." ...|$|E

500|$|Hubert Wellington {{said that}} while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the {{dominating}} enthusiasm of his youth was for Géricault. The dramatic composition of Géricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, [...] "Géricault allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his Raft of Medusa {{while he was still}} working on it." [...] The painting's influence is seen in Delacroix's The Barque of Dante (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix's later works, such as The Shipwreck of Don Juan (1840).|$|E
500|$|Special effects makeup {{designer}} David White took {{head and}} body casts of actors, such as Bautista, {{to experiment with}} materials used to create the characters. White said, [...] "James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the real deal there on set." [...] White {{was careful not to}} use [...] "modern" [...] creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different colored aliens. For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create [...] "a colorful science-fiction world", and include elements of 1950s and 60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, {{as an example of the}} latter. Science fiction artist Chris Foss inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.|$|E
500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Marquis, but remembering betimes {{that from}} your enemy's speech you may sometimes learn {{where to look}} for his next attack, I thought better of it and bade my host admit him.|$|R

500|$|Another {{source of}} {{criticism}} by the Liberals involved PedroI's abolitionist views. The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation {{was in the}} hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition. The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate at Santa Cruz as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there. PedroI also professed other advanced ideas. When he declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and pulling his carriage themselves, the then-Prince Regent refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the divine right of kings, of nobility's supposedly superior blood and of racism: [...] "It grieves <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> my fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, I know that my blood is the same color as that of the Negroes." ...|$|E
500|$|Chartwell {{remained}} a haven {{in times of}} acute stress – Churchill {{had spent the night}} there just before the fall of France in 1940. Summoned back to London by a desperate plea from Lord Gort for permission to retreat to Dunkirk, Churchill broadcast the first of his wartime speeches to the nation; [...] "Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valour...for it is better for us to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation..." [...] He returned again on 20 June 1941, after the failure of Operation Battleaxe to relieve Tobruk, and determined to sack the Middle East commander, General Wavell. John Colville recorded Churchill's deliberations in his diary; [...] "spent the afternoon at Chartwell. After a long sleep the P.M. in a purple dressing gown and grey felt hat took <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his goldfish. He was ruminating deeply about the fate of Tobruk and contemplating means of resuming the offensive". Churchill continued to pay occasional, short, visits to the house; on one such, on 24 June 1944, just after the Normandy landings, his secretary recorded that the house was [...] "shut up and rather desolate".|$|E
500|$|Agnew's first {{marriage}} was to Beverley in 1983; it {{ended in divorce}} in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away {{for months at a time}} each and every winter?... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer." [...] Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.|$|E

500|$|Stephen King {{called the}} series [...] "a feat of which only a {{superior}} imagination is capable", and declared [...] "Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor" [...] to be [...] "remarkable". However, {{he wrote that}} despite the story being [...] "a good one", he is [...] "a little tired of discovering Harry {{at home with his}} horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books. King has also joked that [...] "Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!" [...] He does however predict that Harry Potter [...] "will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages". Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying [...] "It depresses <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> 16 and 17 year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas. What that says about the adults who are fanatical fans I’m not sure – but I suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump, comfortable, infantilising society and the popularity of Potter." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eagle Scout filmmaker Steven Spielberg {{had been}} a long-time {{supporter}} of Scouting, depicting a young Indiana Jones as a Boy Scout in the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and helping to create the Cinematography merit badge. Spielberg resigned from the BSA Advisory Council in 2001, saying, [...] "it has deeply saddened <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Boy Scouts of America actively and publicly participating in discrimination." ...|$|E

2500|$|McKean {{was over}} six feet tall, always wore a large cocked hat and carried a gold-headed cane. He {{was a man of}} quick temper and {{vigorous}} personality, [...] "with a thin face, hawk's nose and hot eyes." [...] John Adams described him as [...] "one of the three men in the Continental Congress who appeared to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more clearly {{to the end of the}} business than any others in the body." [...] As Chief Justice and Governor of Pennsylvania he was frequently the center of controversy.|$|E
2500|$|After {{years apart}} the two reunited {{to write their}} own {{material}} and [...] "create music based around our harmonies {{because that was the}} one thing that people really enjoyed about our performances in the band". Lucas had seen a folk group, Tiddas, performing [...] "Inside My Kitchen" [...] on TV music video program, rage, [...] "t was a revelation for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> three women singing harmonies, playing acoustic guitar and telling their stories through song. Right then and there I decided that I wanted to play acoustic guitar, focus on my vocals and write songs".|$|E
2500|$|Tiner {{served in}} the United States Marines and fought for {{thirteen}} months in the Vietnam War. He was trained at Parris Island, South Carolina, and was a combat correspondent with the 3rd Marine Division. Having been reared in a segregationist society, Tiner recalled having been [...] "thrown together in boot camp, black and white people from the South. All of that made a very profound impact on <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> black Marines getting shot and dying for their country. I {{came back with the}} very clear idea that something's not right about this, {{that it was time to}} change how we did things in this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|If I {{wished to}} take the results of my {{philosophy}} as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, {{it must be a}} pleasure to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence [...] For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.|$|E
2500|$|Renoir {{was largely}} raised by Gabrielle Renard, his nanny and his mother's cousin, {{with whom he}} {{developed}} a strong bond. Shortly before his birth, {{she had come to}} live with the Renoir family. She introduced the young boy to the Guignol puppet shows in Montmartre, which influenced his later film career. He wrote in his 1974 memoirs My Life and My Films, [...] "She taught <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the face behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes. She taught me to detest the cliché." [...] Gabrielle was also fascinated by the new motion-picture invention, and when Renoir was only a few years old she took him to see his first film.|$|E
2500|$|Ah, Lord, your sorrow--why {{was it not}} my death? Now {{they lead}} you forth as naked as a worm, with torturers around you and armed knights. [...] The press of the crowd was {{incredibly}} intense as they threw things and harried you so shamefully, kicking at you {{as if you had}} been a dog. [...] I see in my soul how ruefully you walk, your body so bloody, so raw and blistered. The crown on your head is so sharp, and your hair, blown in the wind, is all matted with blood. Your lovely face is so pale and swollen with the blows and the beatings, and covered with spittle and phlegm. [...] And down runs your blood; it horrifies <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it.|$|E
