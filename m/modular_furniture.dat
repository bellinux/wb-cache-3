Tests were conducted to investigate the effects of supply volume, supply location, supply direction, supply/return temperature difference, heat load density, and workstation size and layout. Temperature differences {{in the range of}} 1 °C to 2. 5 °C between adjacent workstations were observed, and stratification in the room was strongly dependent on the supply air volume. The jet flow characteristics of the floor supply outlets produced high velocities in their immediate vicinity, increasing the risk of draft discomfort in these regions. However, by controlling the volume and trajectory of the supply air entering the space, office workers were able to control their local environment over a wide range, giving them the opportunity to fine-tune the thermal conditions in their workstation to their personal comfort preferences...|$|R

50|$|Modularity {{enters the}} modern artistic {{repertory}} largely through the disciplines of industrial design and architecture. Belgian architect Louis Herman De Koninck led {{a team of}} countrymen in creating {{one of the first}} modular product systems in their Cubex kitchen series of 1932. The series consisted of standardized and industrially produced components that could be combined and arrayed in limitless combinations to accommodate almost any size kitchen. New York designer Gilbert Rohde crafted several lines of modular casework for the Herman Miller Corporation in the 1930s and 40s; like De Koninck, Rohde standardized the units in dimensions, materials and configurations to facilitate mass production and interchangeability. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942, was a similarly ground-breaking systems approach to office furniture. Just a year before Eero Saarinen and Charles Eames had jointly produced a suite of <b>modular</b> domestic <b>furniture</b> for the Red Lion Company, a result of a competition held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1950 Herman Miller brought out the EAS Storage Unit series by Charles and Ray Eames, a very successful modular shelving and wall unit system that remains in production today.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{recently}} completed laboratory and field measurements investigating the thermal performance of an occupant-controlled desktop task conditioning system. The laboratory experiments were performed in a controlled environment chamber configured to resemble a modern office space with <b>modular</b> workstation <b>furniture</b> and partitions. Velocity and temperature distributions were measured throughout the test chamber {{for a range of}} test conditions to investigate the effects of supply volume and direction, supply outlet size, and heat load levels (both uniform and nonuniform) in the space. Comfort model predictions are presented to describe the degree of environmental control and range of occupant comfort levels produced in the workstations. Individual desktop units in side-by-side workstations having significantly different heat load levels could be adjusted to maintain close to comfortable conditions, demonstrating localized comfort control. The field study was performed in a small demonstration office containing two permanent data acquisition systems capable of monitoring in detail the thermal and energy performance of the office, including four installed desktop task conditioning units. Portable measurement methods were also used to assess the thermal comfort of the workers occupying the office. Initial results from the field study demonstrate the occupant response and use patterns of the desktop system, typical energy use pattrns, and the effect of the desktop system on local air velocities and thermal comfort within the workstations...|$|R
2500|$|The $29 million {{renovation}} {{was completed}} in 1983. Much of the building was gutted to utilize the interior space more efficiently, but some [...] "preservation zones" [...] were established to retain the interior's historic character. Much of the old marble was replaced with new, pink marble, and the interior repainted in shades of cream, gray, green, and ivory pastels. A glass-enclosed elevator to the observation deck was also added, {{as well as a}} new grand staircase to the second floor and two [...] restaurants. The renovated building was officially dedicated on April 19, 1983. Vice President George H. W. Bush presided over the event. The re-opening was celebrated with peals from the Bells of Congress from the clock tower. Federal tenants included the Institute for Museum Services, National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. (<b>Modular</b> office <b>furniture</b> was used to allow more people to work in the offices, which proved controversial among federal employees used to traditional desks and chairs.) The retail levels, which occupied the first three floors of the building, opened on September 13, 1983. The retail section included a performance space known as the Nancy Hanks Center. Hanks died on January 7, 1983, just weeks before the building's re-opening. The clock tower and observation deck reopened to the public on May 1, 1984. The 1983 renovation won strong praise from architectural critic Benjamin Forgey.|$|R

40|$|During {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} {{amount of attention}} has been paid to air distribution systems that individually condition the immediate environment of office workers within their workstations. As with task lighting systems, the controls for these "task conditioning" systems are partially or entirely decentralized and under the control of the occupants. Among the primary types of task conditioning systems (floor-, desktop-, and partition-based), floor-based are the most common, having been widely developed and used in South Africa and Europe, and are now gaining acceptance in the United States. This paper reports the results of recently completed laboratory measurements investigating the thermal performance of a floor-based task conditioning system. The experiments were performed in a controlled environment chamber configured to resemble a modern office space with <b>modular</b> workstation <b>furniture</b> and partitions. Tests were conducted to study the effects of supply volume, supply temperature, supply direction, and heat load levels in the space. In addition to detailed temperature and velocity measurements, a new skin-temperature-controlled thermal manikin was used to evaluate the non-uniform thermal environments produced by the floor-based system, in both sitting and standing positions. Under the low to intermediate supply volumes investigated in this study, the overall performance of the floor-based system resembled that of displacement ventilation systems. Primarily by controlling supply volume the floor-based system can be operated to maintain acceptable thermal comfort in the occupied zone of the building, while at the same time taking advantage of the temperature stratification inherent in displacement flow to achieve savings in space conditioning energy use...|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : The self-balancing table. The table {{legs are}} formed by modules that are {{programmed}} to jointly maintain the table surface level. Robotics has great potential in designing interactive <b>furniture.</b> <b>Modular</b> robots are a special type of robot that {{are composed of}} multiple units, {{and each of them}} has independent computation and actuation capabilities. Recently, we have proposed an environmentally-adaptive shape formation framework for modular robots [Yu et al. 2007]. In this paper, we review one specific application under this framework—a self-balancing table. The table legs are formed by connected modules that are programmed to jointly maintain the table surface level at all time. We present a decentralized control algorithm to achieve this goal which has several salient features: first, it relies on simple local rules for each module; second, if the environment changes, the modules automatically adapt to jointly maintain the table surface level; third, it is scalable to the number of modules and finally it is robust to individual module failure. In addition, such an algorithm can achieve a wide range of environmentally-adaptive structures beyond the level table surface. There are several ongoing research directions in our group that share the same theme. We foresee such types of self-adaptive frameworks have great potential in future interactive/adpative furniture designs. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} today's office {{environment}} make it increasingly {{more difficult for}} conventional centralized HVAC systems to satisfy the environmental preferences of individual officer workers using the standardized approach of providing a single uniform thermal and ventilation environment. Since its original introduction in West Germany during the 1950 s, the open plan office containing <b>modular</b> workstation <b>furniture</b> and partitions is now the norm. Thermostatically controlled zones in open plan offices typically encompass relatively large numbers of workstations in which a diverse work population having {{a wide range of}} preferred temperatures must be accommodated. Modern office buildings are also being impacted by a large influx of heat-generating equipment (computers, printers, etc.) whose loads may vary considerably from workstation to workstation. Offices are often reconfigured during the building's lifetime to respond to changing tenant needs, affecting the distribution of within-space loads and the ventilation pathways among and over office partitions. Compounding this problem, there has been a growing awareness {{of the importance of the}} comfort, health, and productivity of individual office workers, giving rise to an increased demand among employers and employees for a high-quality work environment. During recent years an increasing amount of attention has been paid to air distribution systems that individually condition the immediate environments of office workers within their workstations to address the issues outlined above. As with task/ambient lighting systems, the controls for the ''task'' components of these systems are partially or entirely decentralized and under the control of the occupants. Typically, the occupant has control over the speed and direction, and in some cases the temperature, of the incoming air supply. Variously called ''task/ambient conditioning,'' ''localized thermal distribution,'' and ''personalized air conditioning'' systems, these systems have been most commonly installed in open-plan office buildings in which they provide supply air and (in some cases) radiant heating directly into workstations. TAC systems can be classified into the following two major categories: (1) furniture-based, and (2) floor-based, underfloor air distribution (UFAD). A large majority of these systems include a raised floor system with which underfloor plenums are used to deliver conditioned air to the space through floor grills, or in conjunction with the workstation furniture and partitions...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a Master´s thesis in Industrial Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology, based on IDEO´s user-centered design process, which {{contains}} the three phases; Inspiration, Ideation and Implementation. The product development started with an extensive user research, which based on 512 respondents showed an experienced problem with keeping order in narrow hallways. Many respondents experienced stress, when leaving {{their home and}} sometimes difficulties with finding their belongings. Further researches were made in cooperation with a focus group containing seven participants. In {{this phase of the}} project, they collected valuable data in terms of design probes, and were further involved during the entire design process. The inspiration phase ended up with six discovered needs, which were summarized in a need specification, which in turn was the basis of further development. The Ideation phase included scientific methods for coming up with solutions based on the users´ needs and their discovered problems. Three concepts were chosen and developed, among others by building three full-scale mock-ups in cardboard, to visualize their size and expression. The final concept was chosen, based on the user group as well as a concept selection matrix. It was furthermore developed in the Implementation phase; among others by building a full-scale prototype, to evaluate its functions. Further all dimensions were set, materials were chosen and proposals of manufacturing methods were established. This work resulted in the stylistically pure <b>modular</b> based hallway <b>furniture,</b> FJÄLL, an environmentally friendly product, focusing on smart storage for narrow hallways.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 Traditional Japanese {{architecture}} has had {{a significant}} impact on the development of both the physical forms and the underlying principles of American design. Much has been written about this Japanese influence, but only in passing in the general histories of American art and architecture, or in relationship to individual American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright or Greene and Greene. It has not been discussed in a broader context. In addition, most studies of Japanese influence in American architecture have depended upon superficial visual resemblance and neglected seriously exploring the historical roads of migration, transmission, and dissemination of traditional Japanese forms and principles into American design. The primary aim of my dissertation is to analyze the specific nature of the Japanese impact on American architecture, and how it changed from 1854, when Japan opened its door to America, up to the present. Japanese impact on American landscape architecture will be analyzed in a limited scope, however, mainly focusing on the close relationship between the house and its surrounding gardens. During the given period, when American architects sought some external reference to solve their own vexing design problems, they selected certain Japanese forms and principles such as horizontality, plain walls, <b>modular</b> organization, built-in <b>furniture,</b> visible framed structure, open planning with movable partitions, interaction of house and garden, frank exploitation of wood, deep-overhanging eaves with exposed rafters, shoji-like grid and effect of shadows and Mused light. As their problems differed through the time, so were the ways they perceived Japanese architecture. These various perspectives are evident when one reads literature written by American critics on traditional Japanese architecture and when one investigates buildings built by American architects...|$|R
40|$|Overcrowded {{living space}} is a {{contributing}} factor to {{the social and economic}} problems in impoverished areas such as Jabal Al-Natheef refugee camp in Jordan. Addressing such a convoluted problem requires long-term planning and availability of resources. However, initiation of small projects to target pain points, employing technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) to design solutions, and empowering the people to implement them could alleviate the impact of poverty. Giving the stakeholders the ability to build and reproduce the designed solutions will help communities grow by allowing individuals to provide for themselves. This will also create jobs and sets the stage for sustainable development. ^ This project is based on a field study initiated by Purdue University Global Engineering Program in collaboration with the School of Technology. This project illustrates the need and capability of multifunctional furniture design features in order to maximize space usage and improve the livelihood conditions of people living in underprivileged communities. The author designed a furniture piece which serves as a tabular unit, storage and seating units, as well as sleeping units based on the need and time of day. The design criteria should achieve easy-to-implement and aesthetically-pleasing <b>modular</b> pieces of <b>furniture.</b> To facilitate a manufacturing process led by the locals, furniture design specifications, prototype diagrams, and clear graphics were produced. Options for raw material were described based on market availability and source of imported wood. Moreover, a potential forestation program that takes advantage of the fast growing poplar trees was examined to create a local timber industry in the long-term. The designs addressed common requirements of many families who had been interviewed in Jabal Al-Natheef. Floor plans of six of these families 2 ̆ 7 homes were presented with 3 -D rendering perspectives using AutoCAD, Google Sketchup, and Revit modeling software. This thesis addressed one specific problem in the overcrowded and poorly facilitated environment of Jabal Al-Natheef; however, there were many other challenges that required urgent attention. Hence, there was room for many more similar efforts as per the recommendations for further studies and future research projects. ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the suitability of different wood-based materialsfor the connectors of the <b>modular</b> <b>furniture</b> system, the focus being on the strength properties. 13 different types of wood-based material were tested in three-point bending tests, and the modulus ofelasticity (MOE) and the modulus of rupture (MOR) were determined. The tested materialsincorporated wood modifications such as compression, heat treatment and impregnation, as well asdifferent types of adhesives. It could be concluded that birch plywood bonded with soybean glue, andsolid cumaru wood are the most suitable types of wood-based material for the modular furnituresystem. Compressed plywood generally exhibited better strength properties than ordinary plywood,and the type of adhesive had no significant influence on either MOE or MOR. Self-bonding plywoodhad a high MOE, but a comparably low MOR. Solid cumaru wood exhibited both a high MOE and ahigh MOR. Materials which had reasonable strength properties and a comparably low environmentalimpact were considered suitable for the connectors of the <b>modular</b> <b>furniture</b> system, which meant thatnon-formaldehyde-emitting adhesives were favoured.
