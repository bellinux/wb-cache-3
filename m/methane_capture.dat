30|$|Molybdenum-based {{catalysts}} {{are employed}} in many reactions [16] {{in part due to}} the numerous different molecular structures and oxidation states, which supported molybdenum species can take. Mo structures and oxidation states are determined by preparation parameters such as loading, preparation method, calcination temperature, reduction temperature and reaction temperature [17]. One area of interest is in their ability to form carbides through the insertion of carbon into the lattices of Mo. The carbon donates its valence electron into the outer d band of Mo resulting in the appearance of a narrower metallic type band with a density of states at the Fermi level similar to that of a noble metal [18, 19].

40|$|In 2009, manure {{management}} accounted for 2, 356 Gg or 107 billion standard cubic ft of methane (CH{sub 4 }) {{emissions in the}} United States, equivalent to 0. 5 % of U. S. natural gas (NG) consumption. Owing to the high global warming potential of <b>methane,</b> <b>capturing</b> and utilizing this methane source could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The extent of that reduction depends on several factors - most notably, {{how much of this}} manure-based <b>methane</b> can be <b>captured,</b> how much GHG is produced in the course of converting it to vehicular fuel, and how much GHG was produced by the fossil fuel it might displace. A life-cycle analysis was conducted to quantify these factors and, in so doing, assess the impact of converting methane from animal manure into renewable NG (RNG) and utilizing the gas in vehicles. Several manure-based RNG pathways were characterized in the GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation) model, and their fuel-cycle energy use and GHG emissions were compared to petroleum-based pathways as well as to conventional fossil NG pathways. Results show that despite increased total energy use, both fossil fuel use and GHG emissions decline for most RNG pathways as compared with fossil NG and petroleum. However, GHG emissions for RNG pathways are highly dependent on the specifics of the reference case, {{as well as on the}} process energy emissions and methane conversion factors assumed for the RNG pathways. The most critical factors are the share of flared controllable CH{sub 4 } and the quantity of CH{sub 4 } lost during NG extraction in the reference case, the magnitude of N{sub 2 }O lost in the anaerobic digestion (AD) process and in AD residue, and the amount of carbon sequestered in AD residue.

The Office of the Executive Vice President established the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative (DCOI) in June 2009 to develop the University’s strategy for meeting its carbon offset goals. As the client for this report, the DCOI charged Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment Masters team with preparing a purchasing guide to aid in its strategy. The paper analyzes the options considered by Duke to meet its carbon neutrality goals, which include: reducing on-campus emissions through improving energy efficiency; buying carbon offsets on the market; creating carbon offsets through local projects; purchasing Renewable Energy Credits; and developing renewable energy resources on-campus. The final product sets forth a recommended strategy to meet the carbon offsets goals, including a timeline of purchases and an overview of costs. Given the University’s role as an institution motivated by both financial and non-financial goals, such as education and economic benefits to the local community, combinations of purchasing options are presented in three portfolios: the cheapest portfolio, the portfolio yielding the greatest co-benefits {{to the community and}} university, and the portfolio balancing costs and benefits.

For comparing different passenger transportation services by photocatalytically produced fuels gasoline vehicles and battery electric vehicles powered by electricity from the grid are also considered.

The lowest global warming impact of the considered transport concepts is caused by battery electric vehicles charged with electricity from a power plant with CO 2 capture and storage.
