25|$|The II {{torpedo boat}} {{flotilla}} encountered the II Light Cruiser Squadron commanded by William Goodenough and the XI destroyer flotilla commanded by Commodore Hawksley on HMS Castor. There was still enough light for the attackers to be spotted before getting sufficiently close, {{and they were}} forced to retreat to the west. The VI flotilla was also forced back west, receiving fire for 20 minutes at ranges of 3,300 to 5,500 yards. S50 was struck by a shell which severed a <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> pipe, reducing her speed to 25 knots, affecting her steering and electrical power so that she had to return to the main fleet. Lahs turned eastward again at 2110 and Schuur at 2140, but now found themselves too far north.

Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm provided the covering {{force for the}} attack, which failed after the cruiser [...] struck a mine and sank off Odessa. The Russian fleet attempted to intercept the Turkish force, but Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm were able to escape undamaged. The two ships, joined by Hamidiye, conducted a sweep to attack Russian transports on 6 May, but found no targets.

In a brief firefight, the cruiser crippled Gnevny with a hit in her starboard engine compartment that broke the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> line to the engines, but was forced to turn away when Gnevny fired five torpedoes at her.

500|$|The Italian fleet {{made another}} attempt to {{intercept}} a British convoy in the eastern Mediterranean south of Crete in late March. This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 2729 March. For most of the daytime engagement, Pola {{and the rest of}} the 3rd Division were stationed on the disengaged side the Italian fleet, and so did not see action during this phase. Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed by British aircraft from the carrier [...] and was forced to withdraw, and the 3rd Division remained on the port side of the Italian fleet to screen against another possible British attack. A second British airstrike later in the day failed to locate the retiring Vittorio Veneto and instead scored a single torpedo strike on Pola, hitting her amidships on her starboard side. In the confusion of the attack, Pola had nearly collided with Fiume and had been forced to stop, which had prevented her from taking evasive action. The damage filled three compartments with water and disabled five of her boilers and the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> line that fed the turbines, leaving her immobilized.|$|E
500|$|Trials {{continued}} into 1894, and while conducting forced draft tests in Strander Bucht on 16 February 1894, the ship suffered the worst machinery {{accident in the}} history of the Kaiserliche Marine. One of the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> valves from the starboard boilers exploded, killing forty-four men in the boiler room and injuring another seven. The cause of the explosion was a defect in the construction of the valve. Prince Henry, aboard the nearby transport ship Pelikan, immediately ordered the ship to come to Brandenburgs aid, and took off the dead and wounded men. Brandenburg then put into Wiker Bucht, and was later towed to Kiel, where she entered the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) for repairs. The accident caused a minor political incident after the press criticized Wilhelm II for failing to send Prince Henry to the funerals for the sailors. Additionally, Vizeadmiral Friedrich von Hollmann, the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Naval Office) stated before the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) that [...] "such accidents could occur again and again", which increased parliamentary resistance to further increases in naval budgets; this led to an initial rejection of funds for the first armored cruiser, [...] Admirals Eduard von Knorr and Hans von Koester criticized the comment, forcing Hollmann to publicly apologize.|$|E

Erich Giese reported that she was only capable of , although her torpedoes had been replenished from the damaged destroyers. The battleship [...] and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, not including Giese, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships. The ship did not have enough steam raised to participate and remained in the harbor. She attempted to leave the harbor after the British had driven off the other German ships, but her port engine seized up and left her almost dead in the water {{at the mouth of the}} harbor. While attempting to repair her engine, Giese was approached by the destroyers [...] and [...] which fired five torpedoes at her. All of them missed and Gieses torpedoes were equally unsuccessful. She did hit Punjabi with six or seven 12.7cm shells which holed the ship several times just above the waterline, wrecked her fire-control system, severed her <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> line and started several fires. Casualties aboard Punjabi were seven killed and 14 wounded. In the meantime, Giese had managed to repair her engine after ten minutes of work and limped forward at her maximum speed of [...] to engage the remaining British destroyers. Bedouin closed to point-blank range and had her forward gun turret knocked out by Giese, but the latter was hit at least 20 times and reduced to a blazing wreck that finally sank shortly before midnight. Eighty-three of her crew were killed outright during the battle, but the destroyer [...] did rescue 11 men, although two subsequently died of their wounds.

2500|$|In the United States, Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 50, Appendix A, General Design Criteria (GDC 54-57) or {{some other}} design basis {{provides}} the basic design criteria for isolation of lines penetrating the containment wall. Each large pipe penetrating the containment, such as the steam lines, has isolation valves on it, configured as allowed by Appendix A; generally two valves. [...] For smaller lines, one {{on the inside and}} one on the outside. For large, high-pressure lines, space for relief valves and maintenance considerations cause the designers to install the isolation valves near to where the lines exit containment. In the event of a leak in the high-pressure piping that carries the reactor coolant, these valves rapidly close to prevent radioactivity from escaping the containment. Valves on lines for standby systems penetrating containment are normally closed. [...] The containment isolation valves may also close on a variety of other signals such as the containment high pressure experienced during a high-energy line break (e.g. <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> or feedwater lines). [...] The containment building serves to contain the steam/resultant pressure, but there is typically no radiological consequences associated with such a break at a pressurized water reactor.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, reactor-plant {{operating}} procedures precluded a rapid reactor restart following a scram, {{or even the}} ability to use steam remaining in the secondary system to [...] "drive" [...] the submarine to the surface. After a scram, standard procedure was to isolate the <b>main</b> <b>steam</b> system, cutting off the flow of steam to the turbines providing propulsion and electricity. This was done to prevent an over-rapid cool-down of the reactor. Threshers Reactor Control Officer, Lieutenant Raymond McCoole, was not at his station in the maneuvering room, or indeed on the boat, during the fatal dive. McCoole was at home caring for his wife who had been injured in a household accident—he had been all but ordered ashore by a sympathetic Commander Harvey. McCoole's trainee, Jim Henry, fresh from nuclear power school, probably followed standard {{operating procedures}} and gave the order to isolate the steam system after the scram, even though Thresher was at or slightly below its maximum depth. Once closed, the large steam system isolation valves could not be reopened quickly. Reflecting on the situation in later life, McCoole was sure he would have delayed shutting the valves, thus allowing the boat to [...] "answer bells" [...] and drive itself to the surface, despite the flooding in the engineering spaces. Admiral Rickover later changed the procedure, creating the [...] "Fast Recovery Startup" [...] procedure. The Fast Recovery Startup allows an immediate reactor restart and for steam to be withdrawn from the secondary system in limited quantities for several minutes following a scram.|$|E
