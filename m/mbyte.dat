5|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega {{announced}} the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade board, which served as a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3. NAOMI shared the same technology as the Dreamcast—albeit with twice as much system, video, and audio memory and an 160 <b>Mbyte</b> flash ROM board in place of a GD-ROM drive—allowing nearly identical home conversions of arcade games. Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including Capcom (Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Project Justice), Tecmo (Dead or Alive 2), Treasure (Ikaruga), and Sega itself (F355 Challenge and Crazy Taxi).|$|E

40|$|In our hospital, two {{buildings}} {{are separated by}} public road and was communicated each other using 2 Mbps public cable network. Recently inter-building communication with 100 Mbps infrared has been established for PACS. Gigabit network {{has been established in}} the main building. To evaluate usefulness of infrared communication, actual data transfer rate was checked. When 2 Mbps public cable was used, actual data transfer rate using 32 <b>Mbytes</b> text file was 193. 9 Mbps. After infrared communication was established, effective network speed between two link heads of infrared was 45 Mbps. Actual data transfer rate with 32 <b>Mbytes</b> text file was 4. 98 Mbps. Average transfer rates was also checked each 10 times using compressed medical images of each modalities from CR (4 <b>Mbytes),</b> ultrasound (200 Kbytes), CT (250 Kbytes), MRI (77. 6 Kbytes) and fluoroscopy (1 <b>Mbytes),</b> and using a raw data of CR (28 <b>Mbytes).</b> Total average transfer rate was 4. 91 Mbps. To compare data transfer rate in the separated building with them in the main building, the rate with a 14 <b>Mbytes</b> CR was checked 10 times at the each building. Average data transfer rate was 6. 93 Mbps in the main building and 4. 05 Mbps in the separated building. In conclusion, when two hospital buildings are separated, an infrared networking can be replaced for fiber-optic cable networking in PACS environment...|$|R

RealPC emulated a Pentium-based PC with MMX technology, supported Sound Blaster and MMX, and allowed you to use a Macintosh joystick, allowing you to run PC programs, including MS-DOS, and Windows, games and applications, alongside your existing Macintosh applications. RealPC was provided with MS-DOS 6.22 already installed, so you could immediately run MS-DOS games and applications on your Macintosh. Linux was not supported and due to shared RAM between MAC-OS and RealPC Windows-98 was the reasonable limit. RealPC was able to convert Virtual-PC hard disk files to use and run the installed OS.|$|R

The memory modules decoded 26-bit physical word addresses and within this limit total memory capacity was restricted only by the number of available system bus slots; depending on the I/O configuration of the system, up to 10 <b>Mbytes</b> of physical memory could be installed. A later implementation of the memory module increased the size to 2 MB using 256K RAMs.|$|R
