25|$|Some {{newspapers}} {{have dealt with}} the criticism by moving the strip from the comics page to the editorial page, because <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a politically based comic strip like Doonesbury does not belong in a traditionally child-friendly comics section. The Lincoln Journal started the trend in 1973. In some papers (such as the Tulsa World and Orlando Sentinel) Doonesbury appears on the opinions page alongside Mallard Fillmore, a politically conservative comic strip.|$|E
25|$|Even though 2012 {{marked the}} first Olympic Games in which every country sent women athletes to compete, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Olympic Games are far from {{reaching}} gender equality. This belief {{is evidenced by the}} fact that the number of women participating in the Olympics is still significantly less than the number of men competing. The 2012 Olympic Games did mark the highest percentage of women athletes ever, though, at 45%.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Krasner {{stopped working}} in the 1940s in order to nurture Pollock's home life and career, she never stopped {{creating}} art. Throughout her career, she went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique, revise, or destroy the work she would produce. Because of her self-criticism, there are periods of time where little to none of her work exists, specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Benny appears {{behind the}} wheel of his Maxwell in the 1963 film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, but in fact it was a 1932 Cadillac.] The long shots for the scene were shot months before Benny was cast—with a stunt driver at the wheel—and the role was {{intended}} for Stan Laurel (which is why the character wears a derby, which Jack almost never did). When Laurel ultimately passed on appearing, Jack agreed to play it. According to the commentary on the Criterion edition of the film, his close-ups were filmed on a rear-projection stage at the Paramount studio.|$|E
500|$|After unsuccessfully {{trying to}} persuade the referee to change his {{decision}} about the penalty, Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved. However, Seaman failed {{to hold on to}} the ball and Jason McAteer scored from the rebound. Although <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play, Fowler said at the time: [...] "As a goalscorer it's part of my job to take it and I wanted to score it.

500|$|ABT dancer Sarah Lane {{served as}} a [...] "dance double" [...] for Portman in the film. In a March 3 blog entry for Dance Magazine, {{editor-in-chief}} Wendy Perron asked: [...] "Do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan." [...] This led to responses from Benjamin Millepied and Aronofsky, who both defended Portman {{as well as a}} response from Lane on the subject.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Akhtar {{directed}} Positive, a film produced by Shernaz Italia and Frenzy Kodaiji, starring Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. It {{was a short}} film running for 12 minutes. Dealing with a family's attitude towards a person suffering from HIV-AIDS, the film was shot in Mumbai and aimed at creating awareness about the problem. It also introduced Arjun Mathur in the film industry. Speaking about {{the purpose of the}} project, Akhtar stated that [...] "Just as a social stigma, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> an HIV patient should be isolated. They also have certain misconceptions about dealing with the disease. And since India has a lot of joint families, it becomes very important for them to understand the value of support to the person who has acquired this disease. This is exactly what Positive talks about." [...] The film had its background score composed by Ram Sampath but had no soundtrack. It {{was a part of the}} [...] "AIDS JaaGo" [...] ("AIDS Awake"), a series of four short films, directed by Mira Nair, Santosh Sivan, Vishal Bhardwaj and himself, in a joint initiative of Mira Nair's Mirabai Films, voluntary organisations Avahan and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.|$|E
500|$|<b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Donen owed {{everything}} to Kelly, and Kelly biographer Clive Hirschhorn described Donen as having [...] "no particular identity or evident talent... {{and was just}} a kid from the south who wanted to make it in show business." [...] Donen stated that he moved to Hollywood of his own accord; other sources state that he followed Kelly, who then helped him get his first job. Kelly would sometimes embarrass and patronize Donen in public, such as berating him {{for not being able to}} keep up with his dance steps during the rehearsals for Cover Girl. Donen has admitted that he did not consider himself to be a great performer. Despite Donen's growing resentment of Kelly, he was able to contain his feelings and professional attitude during their collaborations. Tensions between the two exploded on the set of It's Always Fair Weather. After Donen's recent hits Deep in My Heart and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers he did not want to make another film with Kelly. They fought on the set for the first time, with the now more confident Donen asserting himself. Donen almost quit the film, and his friendship with Kelly ended.|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the most}} famous members of the breed are the teams that make up the hitches of the Budweiser Clydesdales. These horses were first owned by the Budweiser Brewery at the end of Prohibition in the United States, and have since become an {{international}} symbol of both the breed and the brand. The Budweiser breeding program, with its strict standards of colour and conformation, have influenced the look of the breed in the United States to the point that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Clydesdales are always bay with white markings. As well as being driven, some Clydesdales are used for riding and can be shown under saddle. Due to their calm disposition they have proven to be very easy to train as well as capable of making exceptional trial horses. Clydesdales and Shires are used by the British Household Cavalry as drum horses, leading parades on ceremonial and state occasions. The horses are eye-catching colours, including piebald, skewbald and roan. To be used for this purpose, a drum horse must stand a minimum of [...] high. They carry the Musical Ride Officer and two silver drums weighing [...] each.|$|E
500|$|According to Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe, a U.S. {{literary}} journal, the film's {{audiences are}} likely to have the preconception that human trafficking is not slavery in the same sense that the Atlantic slave trade was, and <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> slavery was abolished a long time ago with such instruments as the U.S. Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. Rhodes writes that society now uses the word [...] "slavery" [...] in modern contexts only as a metaphor, so that references to actual contemporary slavery can be dismissed as hyperbole, and she describes the film's goal as to [...] "reclaim the original term [...] and convince us that what is happening now is what happened then: highly organized and pervasive, intentional, highly profitable and... fully as coercive and wantonly cruel." [...] Rhodes says that the word [...] "slavery" [...] has started to be used in its original sense again in recent years, but that audiences' views on contemporary slavery are nonetheless influenced by the slave-like imagery in such films as Hustle & Flow (2005) and Black Snake Moan (2007). The Academy Award-winning Hustle & Flow portrays a pimp as the hero, while Black Snake Moan features Christina Ricci as a young nymphomaniac; the marketing for Black Snake Moan centered on evocative, sexualized slave imagery, including a scantily-clad Ricci in chains. According to Rhodes, Bilheimer [...] "rescue modern slaves from representation as exotic creatures, to restore their humanity" [...] and allow audiences to relate to them. For this purpose, Bilheimer tells stories of individuals {{in the context of their}} communities and families. While Bilheimer had previously done extensive social justice work with religious organizations, he did not proselytize in the film, despite the many opportunities the film afforded him to do so.|$|E

2500|$|High-stakes {{testing is}} not synonymous with {{high-pressure}} testing. [...] An American {{high school student}} might feel pressure to perform well on the SAT-I college aptitude exam. [...] However, SAT scores do not directly determine admission to any college or university, {{and there is no}} clear line drawn between those who pass and those who fail, so it is not formally considered a high-stakes test. [...] On the other hand, because the SAT-I scores are given significant weight in the admissions process at some schools, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it has consequences for doing well or poorly and is therefore a high-stakes test under the simpler, common definition.|$|E

In appearance Sihamba was very strange, for, although healthy, perfectly shaped and copper-coloured rather than black, she was no taller than a child of twelve years old--a thing that made <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> she was a bush woman, which she most certainly was not.
