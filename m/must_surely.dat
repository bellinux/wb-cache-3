5|$|Ruisdael was not Jewish. Slive reports that, {{because of}} Ruisdael's {{depiction}} of a Jewish cemetery and various biblical names in the Ruisdael family, he often heard speculation that Ruisdael <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> be Jewish. The evidence shows otherwise. Ruisdael {{was buried in the}} Saint Bavo's Church, Haarlem, a Protestant church at that time. His uncle Salomon van Ruysdael belonged to the Young Flemish subgroup of the Mennonite congregation, one of several types of Anabaptists in Haarlem, and it is probable that Ruisdael's father was also a member there. His cousin Jacob was a registered Mennonite in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E

25|$|Afyon is {{the centre}} of an {{agricultural}} area and the city has a country town feel to it. There is {{little in the way}} of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey. However Afyon Kocatepe University opened in the 1990s and this <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> lead to improvements eventually.|$|E
25|$|It <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> have a deplorable {{effect upon}} our Allies {{to be told}} by an ex-Cabinet Minister that the Palestine Administration do not like Jews, {{and that there are}} enough anti-Semites in Great Britain to back up the Hitler policy and spirit. This {{suggestion}} is a complete reversal of the truth. If a comparison is to be made with the Nazis, it is surely those who wish to force an imported régime upon the Arab population who are guilty of the spirit of aggression and domination. Lord Wedgwood's proposal that Arabs should be subjugated by force to a Jewish régime is inconsistent with the Atlantic Charter, and that ought to be told to America. The second principle of that Charter lays down that the United States and ourselves desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned; and the third principle lays down that they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government under which they will live.|$|E

25|$|If 1936 {{had been}} {{something}} of a disappointment 1937 started with great success. Wickets came in virtually every innings and with his 4 wickets against Derbyshire at Taunton he had reached 100 wickets for the season by 15 July, the earliest any Somerset player has reached 100 first-class wickets. Having also scored over 700 runs at this point Andrews <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> have been in the reckoning for either the Players or even a Test place against the New Zealanders. Wellard was selected for the Players at Lord's and later played a single Test against the tourists. Wellard's 1937 figures were no better than Andrews's but he had had a much better 1936 than Andrews. Andrews performances fell away later in the season but he still finished with 137 wickets for Somerset at an average under 20 and with 1000 runs at an average over 20 he completed the double, even achieving it in Championship matches alone. The highlight of the season was the match against Surrey at The Oval. On the third morning Somerset had just avoided following-on and when Surrey batting again they were dismissed for 35 in 13.4 overs. Andrews took 8-12 including a hat-trick. Despite a rapid 91* from Wellard Somerset lost by 11 runs.|$|E

500|$|The term {{archaeoastronomy}} {{was first}} used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973, but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined. Clive Ruggles says that Heinrich Nissen, working {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf Sinclair says that Norman Lockyer, working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy'. Euan MacKie would place the origin even later, stating: [...] "...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> lie in the work of Alexander Thom in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s".|$|E

500|$|As a collector, Gibson's tastes were eclectic. At {{the same}} time as {{acquiring}} paintings by [...] "the younger Australian painters" [...] of his time, he was also collecting antique English silver. This led one writer to exclaim of his collection that [...] "it <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> cover more ground than almost any other private one in this country". Toward {{the end of his life}} the collection included over 560 items from artists of over 30 countries. His fascination with silver also led him to spend time during a visit to Europe in 1952, learning from the British silversmith Robert Stone how silverware was made. This was an experience recounted in Gibson's only book The Rosebowl, so named because of a commission Gibson sought of Stone.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety called Edge of Tomorrow [...] "a cleverly crafted and propulsively {{executed}} sci-fi thriller", {{saying that}} the film was director Doug Liman's best since The Bourne Identity (2002). Chang said that the screenwriters, {{with the assistance of}} the editors, [...] "tell their story in a breezy narrative shorthand (and at times, sleight-of-hand), transforming what <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> be an unbelievably tedious gauntlet for our hero into a deft, playful and continually involving viewing experience". Regarding the relationship between Cruise and Blunt's characters, Chang said [...] "Liman handles it with a pleasing lightness of touch that extends to the proceedings as a whole." [...] He also commended the visual effects of the [...] "expertly designed Mimics" [...] as well as Dion Beebe's cinematography.|$|E
500|$|... "A Day in the Life" [...] {{became one}} of the Beatles' most {{influential}} songs, and is now {{considered by many to be}} the band's greatest work. Paul Grushkin, in his book Rockin' Down the Highway: The Cars and People That Made Rock Roll, called the track [...] "one of the most ambitious, influential, and groundbreaking works in pop music history". According to musicologist John Covach, [...] "'A Day in the Life' is perhaps one of the most important single tracks in the history of rock music; clocking in at only four minutes and forty-five seconds, it <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> be among the shortest epic pieces in rock." [...] In his review of the 50th anniversary edition of Sgt. Pepper for Rolling Stone, Mikal Gilmore says that [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] and Harrison's [...] "Within You Without You" [...] are the only songs on the album that transcend its legacy as [...] "a gestalt: a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts".|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the novel}} for The Guardian, Mark Lawson wrote that Faulks {{had made a}} good job of imitating Fleming, as the plot [...] "persistently picks up whispers from the books Fleming left behind", and using a style and turn of phrase that [...] "read as if they were {{directly}} borrowed from Fleming." [...] The main difference Lawson identified between Fleming and Faulks was that Faulks [...] "misses the chilling indifference of tone which Bond's creator brought to both kissing and killing". Overall, Lawson considered that Devil May Care [...] "is a smart and enjoyable act of literary resurrection. Among the now 33 post-Fleming Bonds, this <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> compete only with Kingsley Amis's for the title of the best." [...] Nicola Barr, writing for The Guardians Saturday edition, was broadly supportive of Faulks, commenting that [...] "No one expects or wants subtlety from Bond, and Faulks delivers a thriller that manages to feel reassuringly familiar rather than predictable." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, George Kimball of Rolling Stone magazine said that [...] "The Allman Brothers had many fine moments at the Fillmores, and this live double album (recorded March 12th and 13th of this year) <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> epitomize all of them." [...] Kimball cited the band as [...] "the best damn {{rock and roll}} band this country has produced {{in the past five}} years" [...] and said of comparisons to the Grateful Dead at the time, [...] "The range of their material and the more tenuous fact that they also use two drummers have led to what I suppose are inevitable comparisons to the Dead in its better days." [...] Album Reviews|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media|date=August 19, 1971|accessdate=2011-09-25}} In a less enthusiastic review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave At Fillmore East a [...] "B–" [...] grade and said the songs [...] "sure do boogie", but ultimately found it musically aimless: [...] "even if Duane Allman plus Dickey Betts does equal Jerry Garcia, the Dead know roads are for getting somewhere. That is, Garcia (not to bring in John Coltrane) always takes you someplace unexpected on a long solo. I guess the appeal here is the inevitability of it all." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{continued}} to receive praise {{after the release}} of Dopesmoker. Eduardo Rivadavia of online music database AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five stating [...] "Dopesmoker is [...] an instant doom metal classic—some might even say a masterpiece". The British music magazine Mojo gave the album a rating of five out of five stars proclaiming that Dopesmoker is [...] "A benchmark by which all that dares call itself stoner rock <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> be judged." [...] Exclaim! praised Dopesmokers production value and noted that the album was [...] "ultimately better version of 1999's stoner opus Jerusalem." [...] Stylus Magazine's Stewart Voegtlin defined Dopesmoker as [...] "a 60-minute song about the spliff, a monstrous rock ode to stinky buds". Voegtlin pointed out that London Records' refusal to [...] "share Sleep's affection or vision, [...] disbanding in disgust. Matt Pike went on to form High on Fire; Al Cisneros and Chris Hakius contemplate the universe's navel with Om." [...] A New York Times critic wrote: [...] "What seems disorienting and monochromatic at first grows richer and more rewarding upon repeated exposure. It’s like a Mark Rothko painting hitting you over the head with a bag of hammers." ...|$|E

500|$|The mental {{element is}} taken to be either an {{intention}} to kill, or an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm is [...] "really serious" [...] harm. The extension of the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm has been criticised, although it has remained in place despite several legal challenges, and, {{in the case of}} [...] the minority judgments of Lord Diplock and Lord Kilbrandon which would have removed it. The judges there made reference to the abolition under the Homicide Act 1957 of constructive malice (causing death whilst committing a felony or resisting arrest), believing the rule for grievous bodily harm to be a hang-over of the old system. It can now be concluded that only legislative intervention could abolish this form of murder, and, although the Law Commission proposed a change in the law, none has yet been enacted. The current law was judged to be compatible with Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to Northern Ireland. It can also be defended with reference to the actor taking responsibility for his actions, even unforeseen consequences, or merely as an appropriate response in itself. Intent is subjective: that the defendant <b>must</b> <b>surely</b> have intended their actions because a reasonable person would, knowing what the defendant knew, have foreseen death as a result, is insufficient. This seemed to have been allowed as a form of intent in DPP v Smith, but that case has been considered overturned following legislative changes, and more recent cases leave no room for doubt on this issue.|$|E
