5|$|A {{commemorative}} {{was wanted}} by the State of Illinois {{to mark the}} centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union, and in 1918, legislation was introduced into Congress to accomplish this. It met no opposition, though several amendments were <b>made</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> legislative process. After it passed, the two engravers produced designs, but Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo required changes, not {{all of which were}} made.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} opening was planned for 19 July 1919 {{but it was}} delayed until Saturday, 26 July 1919 so that Scouts could participate in the Official Peace Festival commemorating the end of World War I.

Because of limited finances, few improvements were <b>made</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression of the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Expectations {{were high}} for Norwich after they {{finished}} the previous season in 11th {{position in the}} league, their highest league finish since 1992–93.
