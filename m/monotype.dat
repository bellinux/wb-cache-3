5|$|<b>Monotype</b> created Bembo {{during a}} period of renewed {{interest}} in the printing of the Italian Renaissance, under the influence of <b>Monotype</b> executive and printing historian Stanley Morison. It followed a previous more faithful revival of Manutius's work, Poliphilus, whose reputation it largely eclipsed. <b>Monotype</b> also created a second, much more eccentric italic for it to the design of calligrapher Alfred Fairbank, which also did not receive the same attention as the normal version of Bembo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monotype</b> has {{digitised}} Ehrhardt {{into the}} TrueType and OpenType font formats. It {{is sold in}} standard and professional releases, some releases including text figures and small caps (in the roman style only). Like several other <b>Monotype</b> typefaces digitised in the early period of computerised publishing, it is sold under two releases credited both to <b>Monotype</b> itself and to Adobe, the latter only in the standard version without small caps. Fleet Titling and the Initial Teaching Alphabet version have not been digitised.|$|E
5|$|A revival by Frederic Goudy for the American {{branch of}} <b>Monotype,</b> the name chosen to differ from other revivals. An elegant sample created by Bruce Rogers {{was shown in}} a spring 1923 issue of Monotype's magazine. It like <b>Monotype</b> Garamond {{features}} a large range of swash characters, based on Imprimerie Nationale specimen sheets.|$|E
50|$|She {{was known}} for {{reviving}} older etching and printing techniques, such as the mezzotint and aquatint, but was especially well known for <b>monotypes.</b> In 2009, the Fourth International Festival of <b>Monotypes</b> was dedicated to her.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Monotype's</b> {{contemporary}} digital {{version was}} developed {{under the supervision}} of Robin Nicholas, and is based on the larger display style of <b>Monotype's</b> metal version. Another digital version, believed to be based on a smaller cut of the same metal type, is available from URW++.|$|R

5|$|In the 1940s, Mardersteig {{developed}} {{plans for}} a second design, Dante, which was again cut by Malin slowly from 1946 onwards but taken also up by <b>Monotype.</b> <b>Monotype</b> Dante Series 592, Dante Semi Bold Series 682 and Dante Titling Series 612, were only produced in Didot-sizes. It was a more eccentric revival of the Aldine face than Bembo, it did not attract as much popularity.|$|E

5|$|From 1937 to 1938, <b>Monotype</b> re-cut {{the type}} for modern-day usage, {{and it has}} become a popular book typeface. Ehrhardt has a {{slightly}} condensed design, giving it a strongly vertical, crisp appearance.|$|E
5|$|Gill Sans is a {{sans-serif}} typeface {{designed by}} Eric Gill and {{released by the}} British branch of <b>Monotype</b> from 1928 onwards.|$|E
5|$|In the italic, the {{expansive}} ascenders of Tagliente's type were shortened and the curl {{to the right}} replaced with more conventional serifs. <b>Monotype</b> also cut italic capitals sloped to match the lower-case, whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition. The bold (Monotype's invention, since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type) is extremely solid, providing a very clear contrast to the regular styles, and <b>Monotype</b> also added lining (upper-case height) figures {{as well as the}} text figures (at lower-case height) used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.|$|E

5|$|<b>Monotype</b> created several titling designs {{based on}} Renaissance {{printing}} {{that could be}} considered complementary to Bembo: Bembo Titling (based directly on Bembo's capitals, but more delicate to suit a larger text size) and the more geometric Felix Titling in 1934, inspired by humanist capitals drawn by Felice Feliciano in 1463. In the hot metal type era <b>Monotype</b> also issued a titling version of Centaur, which was often used by Penguin; Monotype's digitisations of Centaur do not include it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monotype</b> later {{created a}} bold and bold italic (called a {{semi-bold}} in some digitisations) {{to match the}} roman and italic of the original release. (True bold type {{did not exist in}} Kis's time.) Released in 1967, Fleet Titling was a capitals-only alphabet intended to serve as a companion for titling use. It was created by Monotype's occasional collaborator John Peters, a Cambridge University Press designer who also worked as a private printer. <b>Monotype</b> used it for their logo and letterhead. More oddly, <b>Monotype</b> in the 1960s used Ehrhardt as a base for printing in the Initial Teaching Alphabet. This alphabet system, intended to be used to teach children to read, used alternative characters for different sounds spelled with the same letter, like t's and c's dropped below the baseline of the text.|$|E

5|$|As {{was normal}} in metal type fonts {{of the period}} from <b>Monotype</b> and other companies, the font was drawn {{differently}} at different sizes by modifying Griffo's original single-size design, a quite large letter at an approximate size of 15 points. The changes made were looser spacing, higher x-height (taller lower-case letters) and a more solid colour of impression at smaller sizes, and a finer, more graceful and tightly spaced design at large sizes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monotype</b> has {{released}} two separate digitisations named Bembo {{and more recently}} Bembo Book, {{as well as the}} more slender caps-only display font Bembo Titling and the alternate italic design Fairbank. Bembo Book is considered to be superior by being thicker and more suitable for body text, as well as for offering the alternate shorter R for better-spaced body text.|$|E

500|$|Ehrhardt {{attracted}} {{considerable attention}} on its initial release; <b>Monotype's</b> publicity material blurbed it as [...] "in {{the opinion of}} some authorities, the most important new book face since Times New Roman". However Ehrhardt remains considerably less well-known than many of <b>Monotype's</b> other classic serif designs of the interwar period, such as Times, Perpetua, Garamond or Bembo.|$|R
5|$|Since its creation, Bembo {{has enjoyed}} {{continuing}} popularity as an attractive, legible book typeface. Prominent users of Bembo have included Penguin Books, the Everyman's Library series, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, the National Gallery, Yale University Press and Edward Tufte. Bembo {{has been released}} in versions for phototypesetting and in several revivals as digital fonts by <b>Monotype</b> and other companies.|$|E
5|$|The small edition {{was sold}} for $450; like the deluxe edition, {{it was set}} in <b>Monotype</b> Gill Sans, but in single columns. It was printed on Mohawk Superfine text by the Sun Hill Press, with the {{reproduction}} of the etchings printed on a Canon laser printer. The edition was then Smythe sewn at Spectrum Bindery and enclosed in a solander box. A bronze-boxed collectors' copy was also released, and retailed at $7,500.|$|E
5|$|A logical {{extension}} of the humanist sans-serif concept is the font superfamily: a serif font and a matching humanist sans-serif with similar letterforms. Martin Majoor's FF Scala Sans is a popular example of this influenced by Gill's work, as are Charlotte Sans and Serif by Michael Gills for Letraset and Mr and Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko, {{which are based on}} Baskerville. Indeed, <b>Monotype</b> themselves released Joanna Sans in 2015, as a screen-optimised sans-serif font intended to complement (but not exactly match) Gill's serif design Joanna. It is intended for use at smaller sizes than Gill Sans.|$|E
