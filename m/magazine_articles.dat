5|$|Because of {{the public}} uproar over the U-2 Incident, which sparked a major Soviet-American {{diplomatic}} crisis {{that led to the}} collapse of the 1960 Paris Summit, most of the official celebrations for Tritons submerged circumnavigation were canceled.

5|$|These scenic {{areas were}} first {{described}} {{for the public}} in <b>magazine</b> <b>articles</b> published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads in 1916. People like Forest Supervisor J.

5|$|African-American {{history and}} culture scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was a {{consultant}} on the film, and researcher David Fiske, co-author of Solomon Northup: The Complete Story of the Author of Twelve Years a Slave, provided some material used to market the film.

5|$|Fences and Windows: Dispatches {{from the}} Front Lines of the Globalization Debate is a 2002 book by Canadian {{journalist}} Naomi Klein and editor Debra Ann Levy. The {{book is a}} collection of newspaper articles, mostly from The Globe and Mail, with a few <b>magazine</b> <b>articles</b> from The Nation and speech transcripts. The articles and speeches were all written by Klein in the 30 months after the publication of her first book, No Logo (1999), from December 1999 to March 2002. The articles focus upon the anti-globalization movement, including protest events and responses by law enforcement. The book was published in North America and the United Kingdom in October 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the path}} of his {{grandfather}} Vic Richardson, who was a radio commentator for many years, Chappell entered the media in 1973 by writing ghosted <b>magazine</b> <b>articles</b> and a column for The Age. He did television commentary for the 0–10 Network and the BBC before playing WSC. During the 1980s, Chappell spent eight years co-hosting with Mike Gibson, Wide World of Sports, an innovative magazine-style program broadcast by Channel Nine on Saturday afternoons and co-hosted a sister show, Sports Sunday, for five years. Early in his stint on the former program, he swore without realising that he was live to air. A similar incident occurred during a live telecast of the 1993 Ashes series. Channel Nine suspended him on both occasions.|$|E

5|$|From 1950 onwards David {{was well}} known for her <b>magazine</b> <b>articles</b> and, in the 1960s and '70s, for her kitchen shop, but her {{reputation}} rested and still rests principally on her books. The first five, published between 1950 and 1960, cover the cuisine of continental Europe and beyond. In the 1970s David wrote two books about English cooking. The last of her books published in her lifetime was a collection of previously-printed essays and articles. From the extensive notes and archives left by the author, her literary executor, Jill Norman, edited and completed four more books that David had planned. Six other books published since the author's death in various formats in hardback and paperback have been compilations drawn from her existing works.|$|E
5|$|Lilian Faithfull {{was born}} in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, in 1865. Her father, Francis Faithfull, was a clerk at the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors. Her mother, Edith Lloyd, stayed home with eight {{children}} while also writing a History of England and <b>magazine</b> <b>articles.</b> Lilian was the second youngest of the six girls and two boys. She lived in an upper-middle class country house in Hertfordshire and was educated at The Grange in Hoddesdon (the only girl at the time), and later at home by her mother and governesses. Emily Faithfull, an early women's rights activist, was her cousin. Both of Faithfull's parents were opinionated about issues such as femininity and social class, but were not radicals.|$|E
5|$|The first {{appearance}} of the mounted police in fiction occurred in Joseph Collin's The Story of Louis Riel, published in 1885. The police soon became a popular subject for writers, with over 150 novels about the force and its successor, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, being published between 1890 and 1940 across North America and Britain, along with <b>magazine</b> <b>articles</b> and publications for children. Gilbert Parker, James Curwood and Ralph Connor's works proved particularly popular and influential. Connor's Corporal Cameron, published in 1912, {{set the tone for}} many later books with a tale of its initially dissolute protagonist's redemption through service with the police. Numerous poems were written about the force, with the best known probably being the Riders of the Plains, which was first published in 1878 and later expanded upon several times.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Dungeons & Dragons, now {{referred to}} as OD, was a small box set of three booklets published in 1974. It was amateurish in production and assumed the player was familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold {{in the first year}} followed by 3,000 in 1975, and much more in the following years. This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original Greyhawk and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975), as well as <b>magazine</b> <b>articles</b> in TSR's official publications and many fanzines.|$|E
5|$|Lotus Temple, is a Bahá'í House of Worship {{completed}} in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, {{it serves as}} the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent {{and has become a}} prominent attraction in the city. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and <b>magazine</b> <b>articles.</b> Like all other Bahá'í Houses of Worship, is open to all regardless of religion, or any other distinction, as emphasised in Bahá'í texts. The Bahá'í laws emphasise that the spirit of the House of Worship be that it is a gathering place where people of all religions may worship God without denominational restrictions. The Bahá'í laws also stipulate that only the holy scriptures of the Bahá'í Faith and other religions can be read or chanted inside in any language; while readings and prayers can be set to music by choirs, no musical instruments can be played inside. Furthermore, no sermons can be delivered, and there can be no ritualistic ceremonies practised.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an {{animated}} film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached {{for a series of}} <b>magazine</b> <b>articles</b> by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: , to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for the adaptation of Rowlf could not be secured. An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film. The manga—titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind—ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tankōbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.|$|E

5|$|In 1946 David {{returned}} to England, where food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained in force. Dismayed by {{the contrast between}} the bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food to which she had become used in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write <b>magazine</b> <b>articles</b> about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, at the age of 36, she published A Book of Mediterranean Food. Her recipes called for ingredients such as aubergines, basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, and to over-elaborate cooking and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973. Her reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on.|$|E
