40|$|This study {{examines}} the amplitude <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> discrimination for sinusoidal and noise carriers. It was {{shown that the}} discrimination of AM rates is a monotonically growing function of <b>modulation</b> <b>rate.</b> Higher values of the discrimination thresholds were observed for a narrowband carrier. It appears {{that in the case}} of a narrowband noise carrier, the spectral range of the noise envelope is similar to that of the <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> of the signal (up to 120 Hz). It results in a masking in the <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> domain and in a much higher threshold growth than that observed for a wideband noise carrier or a sinusoidal carrier. The results are consistent with the idea of the so-called second stage of filtering acting on the envelope of the acoustic signal. This hypothesis postulates the existence of a so-called modulation filter bank, (MFB), responsible for the frequency selectivity observed in the amplitude <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> domain. The existence of the MFB suggests that a certain form of the spectral analysis of any acoustic signal envelope may be performed in the auditory system after initial filtering in the auditory filter bank. A model of the <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> discrimination based either on the classical concept of the excitation patterns or on the modulation excitation patterns has not accounted for our experimental data. According to both the models, an increase in the frequency discrimination threshold versus <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> should be slower than that measured in the experiment. 1...|$|R

Further, performance for identical <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> appears to decline with increasing carrier frequency, supporting the view that the low-pass characteristics observed for envelope ITD processing is carrier-frequency dependent. Here, we assessed listeners’ sensitivity to ITDs conveyed in pure tones and in the modulated envelopes of high-frequency tones.

While accurate rate estimation yields better rate-selection decisions and increased throughput, those methods must still choose between a handful of <b>modulation</b> <b>rates.</b> Each <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> is effective {{in a range of}} actual signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) but the limited number of practical rates means that transmitters are often forced to “step down ” to a lower data rate despite having a higher SNR than the minimum required for that lower rate. In this paper we describe, evaluate and implement a practical multiuser communication scheme that exploits these discrete “steps” in <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> to transmit two packets in the time normally needed to transmit a single packet, increasing aggregate throughput precisely when it is most needed- when the network is busy and suffers from rate unfairness. Because the method transmits a group of packets simultaneously, we call this scheme Group Rate Transmission with Intertwined Symbols, or GRaTIS. In addition to up to 120 % improvement in network throughput achieved by GRaTIS, the technique is backward compatible with 802. 11 and doesn’t require complex DSP algorithms as required by competing methods...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that multisensory integration may occur at an early phase in sensory processing and within cortical regions traditionally though to be exclusively unisensory. Evidence from perceptual and electrophysiological studies indicate that the cross modal temporal correspondence of multisensory stimuli plays {{a fundamental role in}} the cortical integration of information across separate sensory modalities. Further, oscillatory neural activity in sensory cortices may provide the principle mechanism whereby sensory information from separate modalities is integrated. In the present study we aimed to extend this prior research by using the steady-state EEG response (SSR) to examine whether variations in the cross-modality temporal correspondence of amplitude modulated auditory and vibrotactile stimulation are apparent in SSR activity to multisensory stimulation. To achieve this we varied the cross-modal congruence of <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> for passively and simultaneously presented amplitude modulated auditory and vibrotactile stimuli. In order to maximise the SSR response in both modalities 21 and 40 Hz <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> were selected.

Despite consistent and reliable changes in SSR activity with manipulations of <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> within modality, the present study failed to provide strong evidence of multisensory interactions in SSR activity for temporally congruent, relative to incongruent, cross modal conditions.

Three experiments investigated {{the specificity of}} the FFR for carrier and modulation frequency using adaptation.

The first experiment investigated peristimulus adaptation of the FFR for pure and complex tones {{as a function of}} stimulus frequency and fundamental frequency (F 0). It showed more adaptation of the FFR in response to sounds with higher frequencies or F 0 s than to sounds with lower frequency or F 0 s. The second experiment investigated tuning to <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> in the FFR. The FFR to a complex tone with a <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> of 213 Hz was not reduced more by an adaptor that had the same <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> than by an adaptor with a different <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> (90 or 504 Hz), thus providing no evidence that the FFR originates mainly from neurons that respond selectively to the <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> of the stimulus.

Our ability to understand speech and other sounds relies crucially on the capacity to detect and perceive temporal amplitude fluctuations {{in the range of}} about 1 - 100 Hz. However, most individual neurons in auditory cortex are capable of precisely aligning their activities only to <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> {{at the lower end of}} this range. This raises the question of how higher <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> might be encoded, and of how the auditory cortex might be organised to accommodate the full range of perceptually relevant amplitude envelope modulations. Here we show, with noninvasive magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography measurements, that population oscillatory responses of human auditory cortex transition between a mode of strong phase locking to <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> below about 40 - 50 Hz, to a non phase-locked mode of responding at rates higher than about 50 Hz. Such dual response modes are predictable from the behaviours of single neurons in auditory cortex of non-human primates, but only the low rate phase locking mode has been previously observed in the neuronal population responses indexed in human MEG/EEG recordings. Taken together, the single neuron and MEG and EEG results from current thesis work suggest that two distinct types of neuronal encoding are required to represent the full range of temporal <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> that are relevant to everyday perception.

In this paper, we design a custom cross-layer framework that enables: 1) implementation of multiple and previously unimplemented rate adaptation mechanisms; 2) experimental evaluation and com-parison of rate adaptation protocols on controlled, repeatable channels as well as residential urban and downtown vehicular and nonmobile environments in which we accurately measure channel conditions with 100 - s granularity; and 3) comparison of performance on a per-packet basis with the ideal <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> obtained via exhaustive experimental search. Our evaluation reveals that SNR-triggered protocols are susceptible to overselec-tion from the ideal rate when the coherence time is low (a scenario that we show occurs in practice even in a nonmobile topology), and that “in situ ” training can produce large gains to overcome this sensitivity. Another key finding is that a mechanism effective in differentiating between collision and fading losses for hidden terminals has severely imbalanced throughput sharing when competing links are even slightly heterogeneous. In general, we find trained SNR-based protocols outperform loss-based protocols {{in terms of the}} ability to track vehicular clients, accuracy within outdoor environments, and balanced sharing with heterogeneous links (even with physical layer capture).
