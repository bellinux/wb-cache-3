5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by <b>micelle</b> encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the <b>micelle</b> core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E

The rate of this process was found to be a decreasing power-law of the degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic block to the power 2/3.

Assuming that similar sustained release also occurs in vivo, this would provide the <b>micelles</b> the necessary time required to exert their influence on drug bioavailability. In addition, the release rate of CyA from mPEG 5 –PLA 10 <b>micelles</b> was comparable to that from mPEG 5 –PLA 15 <b>micelles</b> and faster than that from mPEG 5 –PLA 2.5 and mPEG 5 –PLA 5 <b>micelles,</b> and remarkable burst release was observed in the release profiles of the former.

These {{can be achieved}} in two ways: when the unimers forming the micelles are not soluble in the solvent of the <b>micelle</b> solution, or if the core forming blocks are glassy at the temperature in which the micelles are found. Kinetically frozen micelles are formed when either of these conditions is met. A special example in which both of these conditions are valid is that of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide). This {{block copolymer}} {{is characterized by the}} high hydrophobicity of the core forming block, PS, which causes the unimers to be insoluble in water. Moreover, PS has a high glass transition temperature which is, depending on the molecular weight, higher than room temperature. Thanks to these two characteristics, a water solution of PS-PEO micelles of sufficiently high molecular weight can be considered kinetically frozen. This means that none of the relaxation processes, which would drive the <b>micelle</b> solution towards thermodynamic equilibrium, are possible. Pioneering work on these micelles was done by Adi Eisenberg. It was also shown how the lack of relaxation processes allowed great freedom in the possible morphologies formed.

25|$|In {{the fusion}} process, the lipid head group {{is not only}} {{involved}} in charge density, but can affect dehydration and defect nucleation. These effects are independent {{of the effects of}} ions. The presence of the uncharged headgroup phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) increases fusion when incorporated into a phosphatidylcholine bilayer. This phenomenon has been explained by some as a dehydration effect similar to the influence of calcium. The PE headgroup binds water less tightly than PC and therefore may allow close apposition more easily. An alternate explanation is that the physical rather than chemical nature of PE may help induce fusion. According to the stalk hypothesis of fusion, a highly curved bridge must form between the two bilayers for fusion to occur. Since PE has a small headgroup and readily forms inverted <b>micelle</b> phases it should, according to the stalk model, promote the formation of these stalks. Further evidence cited in favor of this theory is the fact that certain lipid mixtures have been shown to only support fusion when raised above the transition temperature of these inverted phases. This topic also remains controversial, and even if there is a curved structure present in the fusion process, there is debate in the literature over whether it is a cubic, hexagonal or more exotic extended phase.|$|E

In addition, one of the copolymers (60 mol % MEMA, Mw = 30 [*] 000, Mw/Mn = 1. 05) was selected for a detailed small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) study. SANS data for the <b>micelles</b> were analyzed in terms of a weakly interacting polydisperse sphere model and were in reasonable agreement with the light scattering data. The DEA−core <b>micelles</b> are larger than the MEMA−core <b>micelles,</b> but both light scattering and SANS data indicated that the DEA−core <b>micelles</b> had a lower mean aggregation number than the MEMA−core <b>micelles.</b> This suggests that the MEMA−core <b>micelles</b> are relatively dense and compact compared to the more loosely packed DEA−core <b>micelles...</b>|$|R

These <b>micelles</b> can be shorter cylindrical <b>micelles</b> or long worm-like <b>micelles.</b> For such a system {{the size of the}} <b>micelles</b> varies strongly with solute conditions, being dependent on the total amount of amphiphile in solution, as well as, the lipid to detergent ratio in the <b>micelles.</b> Although the broad phase behaviour of such systems has been studied and is relatively well understood, there are still many open questions remaining. Some of the questions that motivated the work presented are: how the length and composition of the <b>micelles</b> varies within the micellar region, and how the <b>micelles</b> grow? The biologically interesting system under study is lecithin and bile salt, where the equilibrium sizes were experimentally determined for different samples within the micellar region. A model, combining the length of the <b>micelles,</b> with the concentrations of lecithin and bile salt in the system is presented, and is used to calculate the composition of the <b>micelles</b> at equilibrium. The kinetics of the growth of the <b>micelles</b> after a pertubation causing a shift in the equilibrium size has not been studied in detail before. The kinetics of the system are studied using a stopped flow setup, which I specifically designed for neutron scattering experiments. The stopped flow setup allows for the measurement to start 200 ms after the initial mixing of the two liquids, after dilution of a solution the <b>micelles</b> relax to a new longer length. The kinetics of this relaxation were studied {{as a function of the}} initial and final size of the <b>micelles,</b> as well as, the ionic strength of the solution. The <b>micelles</b> were found to grow through coalescence, where the rate of growth seems to be constant for different sizes of <b>micelles</b> and the time taken for the relaxation depends on the difference between the final and initial lengths of the <b>micelles.</b> The rate of growth is strongly influenced through changing the ionic strength of the solution, indicating the importance of an electrostatic barrier to the fusion of <b>micelles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Block {{copolymer}} <b>micelles</b> {{have been}} prepared with a dithiomaleimide (DTM) fluorophore located in either the core or shell. Poly(triethylene glycol acrylate) -b-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (P(TEGA) -b-P(tBA)) was synthesized by RAFT polymerization, with a DTM-functional acrylate monomer copolymerized into either the core forming P(tBA) block or the shell forming P(TEGA) block. Self-assembly by direct dissolution afforded spherical <b>micelles</b> with Rh of ca. 35 nm. Core-labeled <b>micelles</b> (CLMs) displayed bright emission (Φf = 17 %) due to good protection of the fluorophore, whereas shell-labeled <b>micelles</b> (SLMs) had lower efficiency emission due to collisional quenching in the solvated corona. The transition from <b>micelles</b> to polymer unimers upon dilution could be detected by measuring the emission intensity of the solutions. For the core-labeled <b>micelles,</b> the fluorescence lifetime was also responsive to the supramolecular state, the lifetime being significantly longer for the <b>micelles</b> (τAv,I = 19 ns) than for the polymer unimers (τAv,I = 9 ns). The core-labeled <b>micelles</b> could also self-report {{on the presence of}} a fluorescent hydrophobic guest molecule (Nile Red) as a result of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the DTM fluorophore and the guest. The sensitivity of the DTM fluorophore to its environment therefore provides a simple handle to obtain detailed structural information for the labeled polymer <b>micelles.</b> A case will also be made for the application superiority of core-labeled <b>micelles</b> over shell-labeled <b>micelles</b> for the DTM fluorophore...|$|R
