2500|$|An {{authenticated}} video surfaced on the Internet {{that shows}} two gunmen {{and a police}} officer, Ahmed Merabet, who is wounded and lying on a sidewalk after an exchange of gunfire. This took place near the corner of Boulevard Richard-Lenoir and Rue <b>Moufle,</b> [...] east of the main crime scene. One of the gunmen ran towards the policeman and shouted, [...] "Did {{you want to kill}} us?" [...] The policeman answered, [...] "No, it's fine, boss", and raised his hand toward the gunman, who then gave the policeman a fatal shot to the head at close range.|$|E
5000|$|In Roman times, {{the place}} of the glove was taken by long sleeves (manicae) {{reaching}} to the hand, and in winter special sleeves of fur were worn. In Medieval Latin we find the word muffulae, defined by Du Cange as chirothecae pellitae et hibernae ("leather winter gloves"). He quotes from a cartulary of the year 817, of the issuing to monks of sheepskin coverings to be used during the winter. These may have been, as the Roman certainly were, separate coverings for each hand, although the cartulary cited also distinguishes the glove for summer from the muffulae for winter wear. The Old French <b>moufle</b> meant a thick glove or mitten, and from this the Dutch mof, Walloon mouffe, and thence English [...] "muff", are probably derived.|$|E
