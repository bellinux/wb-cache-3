40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} the projective linking number Link(M,Z) of a compact oriented real submanifold M of dimension 2 p- 1 in complex projective n-space P^n with an algebraic subvariety Z in P^n - M of codimension p. This notion is related to projective winding numbers and quasi-plurisubharmonic functions, and it generalizes directly from P^n to any projective <b>manifold.</b> <b>Part</b> 1 of this paper establishes the following result for the case p= 1. Let M be an oriented, stable, real analytic curve in P^n. Then M is the boundary of a positive holomorphic 1 -chain T with Mass(T) -K deg(Z) for all algebraic hypersurfaces Z in P^n - M. An analogous theorem is implied in any projective <b>manifold.</b> <b>Part</b> 2 of this paper studies similar results for p> 1.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Cellular sets in the Hilbert cube are the {{intersection}} of nested sequences of normal cubes. One way of getting cellular maps on the Hilbert cube is by decomposing the Hilbert cube into cellular sets and using a quotient map. By using a cellular decomposition of the Hilbert cube, {{an example of a}} cellular map is given to show that the image of the Hilbert cube under a cellular map can have complex non <b>manifold</b> <b>part,</b> not be a Hilbert cube manifold, and still be a Hilbert cube manifold factor. The non degenerate decomposition elements are shown to satisfy the cellularity criteria. To measure how far the image is from being a Hilbert cube manifold, the idea of covering codimension in finite dimensions is generalized by using a homological codimension approach. In finite dimensional settings, the two codimensions are equivalent. The complexity of the non <b>manifold</b> <b>part</b> of the image space is measured in terms of intrinsic codimension, which uses the homological codimension of the image of the union of nondegenerate decomposition elements. The intrinsic codimension of the map in this example is found to be exactly two. Using a characterization of Hilbert cube manifolds, it is shown that the decomposition space is not the Hilbert cube, but is a factor of the Hilbert cube...|$|E
