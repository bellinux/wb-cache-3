5|$|Although the North Indian Ocean is a {{relatively}} inactive basin, extremely high population densities in the Ganges and Ayeyarwady Deltas <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the deadliest tropical cyclones {{in the world have}} formed here, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed 500,000 people. Nations affected include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the world is real according to Tulsidas, {{in keeping with the}} Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E

5|$|Copenhagen {{has some}} of the highest gross wages in the world. High taxes <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> wages are reduced after {{mandatory}} deduction. A beneficial researcher scheme with low taxation of foreign specialists has made Denmark an attractive location for foreign labour. It is however also among the most expensive cities in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Davidson {{played a}} large role in the Fourth Test Old Trafford. Victory would give Australia an {{unassailable}} 2–1 series lead and retention of the Ashes. A loss would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Australia would need to win the Fifth and final Test to prevent England from reclaiming them.|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{cannot be}} placed within any ruling dynasty. Numismatic {{evidence}} suggests he succeeded Æthelweard.

5|$|Overfishing is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna.
