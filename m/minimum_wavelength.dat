Since these information are generally not experimentally available, image interpretation is more speculative than rigorously quantitative at the present time. This theoretical analysis confirms by a simple criterion that MFM image interpretation can be perform in terms of point dipole probing provided that some experiment constraints are satisfied. The validity of the criterion is demonstrated for various experimentally relevant example.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} in satellite altimetry that attempts to simultaneously determine the geoid and sea surface toography with <b>minimum</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of about 500 km and to reduce the radial orbit errors caused by geopotential uncertainties. The modeling of these errors is made using the linearized Lagrangian perturbation theory. Observation equations are developed using sea surface heights and crossover discrepancies as observables. A minimum variance solution with prior information can then provide estimates of parametrs representing the sea surface topography and corrections to the orbit. The potential of the method is demonstrated in a solution where simulated geopotential errors and the Levitus sea surface topography are used to generate the observables for a Seasat 3 day arc.

50|$|Ceramography {{is the art}} {{and science}} of preparation, {{examination}} and evaluation of ceramic microstructures. Ceramography {{can be thought of}} as the metallography of ceramics. The microstructure is the structure level of approximately 0.1 to 100 µm, between the <b>minimum</b> <b>wavelength</b> of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye. The microstructure includes most grains, secondary phases, grain boundaries, pores, micro-cracks and hardness microindentions. Most bulk mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties are significantly affected by the microstructure. The fabrication method and process conditions are generally indicated by the microstructure. The root cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the microstructure. Ceramography is part of the broader field of materialography, which includes all the microscopic techniques of material analysis, such as metallography, petrography and plastography. Ceramography is usually reserved for high-performance ceramics for industrial applications, such as 85 - 99.9% alumina (Al2O3) in Fig. 1, zirconia (ZrO2), silicon carbide (SiC), silicon nitride (Si3N4), and ceramic-matrix composites. It is seldom used on whiteware ceramics such as sanitaryware, wall tiles and dishware.|$|E

The technique, photoelectron microscopy, is similar to fluorescence microscopy using incident ultraviolet light except that photoejected electrons form {{the image of the}} specimen surface.

The photoelectron image thresholds for these compounds are 220 (I), 215 (II), 220 (III), and 240 nm (IV), all ± 5 nm. Contrast of I-IV with respect to typical protein, lipid, nucleic acid, and polysaccharide surfaces was examined over the wavelength range 240 - 180 nm. The low magnification micrographs exhibited bright areas corresponding to I-IV but dark regions for the biochemical surfaces. The high contrast suggests the feasibility of performing extrinsic photoelectron microscopy experiments through selective labeling of sites on biological surfaces...|$|R
