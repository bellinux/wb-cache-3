50|$|<b>Monensin</b> is used {{extensively}} in the beef and dairy industries to prevent coccidiosis, increase the production of propionic acid and prevent bloat. Furthermore, <b>monensin,</b> but also its derivatives <b>monensin</b> methyl ester (MME), and particularly <b>monensin</b> decyl ester (MDE) are widely used in ion-selective electrodes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monensin</b> {{has some}} degree of {{activity}} on mammalian cells and thus toxicity is common. This is especially pronounced in horses, where <b>monensin</b> has a median lethal dose 1/100th that of ruminants. Accidental poisoning of equines with <b>monensin</b> is a well-documented occurrence which has resulted in deaths.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monensin</b> A is an {{ionophore}} {{related to}} the crown ethers with a preference to form complexes with monovalent cations such as: Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Ag+, and Ti+. <b>Monensin</b> A is able to transport these cations across lipid membranes of cells in an electroneutral (i.e. non-depolarizing) exchange, playing an important role as an Na+/H+ antiporter. Recent {{studies have shown that}} <b>monensin</b> may transport sodium ion through the membrane in both electrogenic and electroneutral manner. This approach explains ionophoric ability and in consequence antibacterial properties of not only parental <b>monensin,</b> but also its derivatives that do not possess carboxylic groups. It blocks intracellular protein transport, and exhibits antibiotic, antimalarial, and other biological activities. The antibacterial properties of <b>monensin</b> and its derivatives are a result of their ability to transport metal cations through cellular and subcellular membranes.|$|E

5000|$|Having united {{these two}} complex fragments, Still {{was able to}} {{complete}} the synthesis of <b>monensin</b> in three additional steps. First, hydrogenolysis of the benzyl group afforded the free primary alcohol under standard conditions. Next, cleavage of the triethylsilyl (TES) protecting groups was achieved {{in the presence of}} para-toluenesulfonic acid; the resulting free secondary alcohols then engaged the ketone in a spontaneous cyclization reaction to form the thermodynamic spiroketal linkage. Finally, hydrolysis of the methyl ester under basic conditions furnished the sodium salt of <b>monensin,</b> completing the synthesis of this challenging natural product.|$|E
50|$|Ionophores {{have been}} used to modify the {{permeability}} of biological membranes toward certain ions. Additionally, some ionophores are used as antibiotics and/or as growth-enhancing feed additives for certain animals, such as cattle (see <b>monensin)</b> and chickens.|$|E

50|$|An {{indirect}} {{means of}} inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca2+ stores. As noted above, this usually entails collapsing the H+ gradient with either V-ATPase inhibitors (e.g. Bafilomycin A1) or protonophores (e.g. nigericin or <b>monensin).</b> In platelets {{it has been}} suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADP-dependent signals.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of {{selective}} Ca2+ uptake inhibitors (often {{because we do not}} even know the protein/route), it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca2+ uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive (the H+ gradient). The H+ gradient can be eliminated either with H+ ionophores (protonophores) such as nigericin or <b>monensin</b> or by inhibiting the V-ATPase that generates the H+ gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin.|$|E
50|$|Nigericin is an {{antibiotic}} derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Its isolation {{was described in}} the 1950s, and in 1968 the structure could be elucidated by X-ray crystallography. The structure and properties of nigericin {{are similar to the}} antibiotic <b>monensin.</b> Commercially it is obtained as a byproduct, or contaminant, at the fermentation of Geldanamycin. It is also called Polyetherin A, Azalomycin M, Helixin C, Antibiotic K178, Antibiotic X-464.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{in order}} to {{counteract}} the amount of methane that ruminants give off, a type of drug called <b>monensin</b> (marketed as rumensin™) has been developed. This drug is classified as an ionophore, which is an antibiotic that is naturally produced by a harmless bacteria strain. This drug not only improves feed efficiency but also reduces the amount of methane gas emitted from the animal and its manure.|$|E
5000|$|In case of {{multiple}} carbonyl types in one molecule, one {{can expect the}} most electrophilic carbonyl carbon to react first. Acyl chlorides and carboxylic anhydrides react fastest, followed by aldehydes and ketones. Esters react much more slowly and amides are almost completely unreactive due to resonance of the amide nitrogen towards the carbonyl group.

50|$|Ideally {{pastures}} {{should be}} used before they become overly lush and protein-rich. If this is not possible, the new diet should be introduced slowly by grazing the cattle {{just a few hours}} each day and increasing gradually, over a period of a fortnight. Cutting the pasture immediately before putting the cattle out may help. Drugs are available (<b>monensin</b> or lasalocid) which change the rumen biochemistry in preparation for high tryptophan levels, inhibiting the bacteria that convert L-tryptophan to 3-methylindole. Care must be taken to keep these products away from horses, for which, since horses have no rumen, they are toxic.|$|E
5000|$|Measures for {{preventing}} lactic acidosis in ruminants include avoidance of excessive amounts of grain in the diet, and gradual introduction of grain {{over a period}} of several days, to develop a rumen population capable of safely dealing with a relatively high grain intake. [...] Administration of lasalocid or <b>monensin</b> in feed can reduce risk of lactic acidosis in ruminants, [...] inhibiting most of the lactate-producing bacterial species without inhibiting the major lactate fermenters. [...] Also, using a higher feeding frequency to provide the daily grain ration can allow higher grain intake without reducing the pH of the rumen fluid.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, Still and {{coworkers}} reported the total synthesis of <b>monensin,</b> a complex polyether natural product {{that acts as}} an ionophore. [...] One of the key steps in this route is the late-stage union of two advanced fragments via an intermolecular aldol reaction. In this reaction, low-temperature deprotonation of the methyl ketone with lithium diisopropylamide formed the kinetic enolate which then underwent transmetalation upon the addition of magnesium bromide. Subsequent addition of the aldehyde component initiated a diastereoselective aldol reaction, forming the desired beta-hydroxyketone in 75% yield as a 3:1 mixture of diastereomers. Notably, this instance of acyclic stereocontrol {{is consistent with the}} Cram-Felkin-Anh model for the addition of nucleophiles to an aldehyde bearing an existing stereocenter in the alpha position.|$|E

40|$|What's Ahead for Cattlemen? {{is known}} as Cattlemen’s Day, 1977 Two grazing trials {{conducted}} at different locations in Kansas evaluated feeding <b>Monensin</b> to grazing yearling cattle. In one trial <b>Monensin</b> was fed with and without implant treatments of diethylstilbestrol or Ralgro. <b>Monensin</b> increased weight gain on summer grass; diethylstilbestrol and Ralgro implants also increased weight gains, and the combination of <b>Monensin</b> with either implant was more effective than <b>Monensin</b> alone...|$|E
40|$|<b>Monensin</b> is {{a widely}} used feed {{additive}} {{with the potential to}} minimize methane (CH 4) emissions from cattle. Several studies have investigated the effects of <b>monensin</b> on CH 4, but findings have been inconsistent. The objective {{of the present study was}} to conduct meta-analyses to quantitatively summarize the effect of <b>monensin</b> on CH 4 production (g/d) and the percentage of dietary gross energy lost as CH 4 (Y m) in dairy cows and beef steers. Data from 22 controlled studies were used. Heterogeneity of the <b>monensin</b> effects were estimated using random effect models. Due to significant heterogeneity (> 68 %) in both dairy and beef studies, the random effect models were then extended to mixed effect models by including fixed effects of DMI, dietary nutrient contents, <b>monensin</b> dose, and length of <b>monensin</b> treatment period. <b>Monensin</b> reduced Y m from 5. 97 to 5. 43 % and diets with greater neutral detergent fiber contents (g/kg of dry matter) tended to enhance the <b>monensin</b> effect on CH 4 in beef steers. When adjusted for the neutral detergent fiber effect, <b>monensin</b> supplementation [average 32 mg/kg of dry matter intake (DMI) ] reduced CH 4 emissions from beef steers by 19 ± 4 g/d. Dietary ether extract content and DMI had a positive and a negative effect on <b>monensin</b> in dairy cows, respectively. When adjusted for these 2 effects in the final mixed-effect model, <b>monensin</b> feeding (average 21 mg/kg of DMI) was associated with a 6 ± 3 g/d reduction in CH 4 emissions in dairy cows. When analyzed across dairy and beef cattle studies, DMI or <b>monensin</b> dose (mg/kg of DMI) tended to decrease or increase the effect of <b>monensin</b> in reducing methane emissions, respectively. Methane mitigation effects of <b>monensin</b> in dairy cows (- 12 ± 6 g/d) and beef steers (- 14 ± 6 g/d) became similar when adjusted for the <b>monensin</b> dose differences between dairy cow and beef steer studies. When adjusted for DMI differences, <b>monensin</b> reduced Y m in dairy cows (- 0. 23 ± 0. 14) and beef steers (- 0. 33 ± 0. 16). <b>Monensin</b> treatment period length did not significantly modify the <b>monensin</b> effects in dairy cow or beef steer studies. Overall, <b>monensin</b> had stronger antimethanogen ic effects in beef steers than dairy cows, but the effects in dairy cows could potentially be improved by dietary composition modifications and increasing the <b>monensin</b> dose. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of levels of <b>monensin,</b> a polyethor ionophore, on digestibility, rumenal diet protein degradation and bacterial protein synthesis when steers are fed high fiber diets {{was investigated in}} two metabolism trials. In addition, three performance trials were used to evaluate <b>monensin</b> levels when protein or energy was the first limiting nutrient and to evaluate possible interactions of forage quality and <b>monensin</b> level. ^ The level of <b>monensin</b> influenced organic matter, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and ruminal NDF digestibilities in a quadratic manner, with the intermediate levels of <b>monensin</b> being superior to either high levels of <b>monensin</b> or no <b>monensin.</b> <b>Monensin</b> decreased (P =. 10) the bacterial protein concentration and increased (P =. 02) the ratio of total N:diaminopimilic acid in the rumen. In duodenally cannulated steers, a linear tendency for bacterial N flow to decrease (P =. 17) and for diet N flow to increase (P =. 27) was observed. This resulted in no overall difference in duodenal N flow or flow of individual amino acids. The data indicate {{that it may be}} possible to obtain both improved fiber digestion and increased diet N to the lower tract with supplementation of <b>monensin</b> at 18. 3 ppm. ^ In a calf performance trial when energy was first limiting no interaction of forage quality and <b>monensin</b> was observed. <b>Monensin</b> did linearly decrease feed intake (P =. 09) and had a quadratic effect on daily gain (P =. 03) and feed/gain (P =. 07). The 100 mg level, which corresponds to the 18. 3 ppm level in the metabolism trials, was superior to either the 0 or 200 mg level in this trial. In calf and lamb performance trials, when protein was first limiting, no significant interactions of protein and <b>monensin</b> were observed. However, the animals on the low levels of protein did tend to respond more to <b>monensin</b> which may indicate that protein sparing occurred. The animals also responded to increasing levels of protein in a linear manner and to <b>monensin</b> in a quadratic manner as was observed in the other performance trial. ...|$|E
40|$|Nisin, a bacteriocin, is a {{potential}} alternative to antibiotics to modulate rumen fermentation. However, {{little is known about}} its impacts on rumen microbes. This study evaluated the effects of nisin (1 and 5 μM) on in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics, microbiota, and select groups of rumen microbes in comparison with <b>monensin</b> (5 μM), one of the most commonly used ionophores in ruminants. Nisin had greater effects than <b>monensin</b> in inhibiting methane production and decreasing acetate/propionate ratio. Unlike <b>monensin,</b> nisin had no adverse effect on dry matter digestibility. Real-time PCR analysis showed that both <b>monensin</b> and nisin reduced the populations of total bacteria, fungi, and methanogens, while the population of protozoa was reduced only by <b>monensin.</b> Principal component analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene amplicons showed a clear separation between the microbiota shaped by <b>monensin</b> and by nisin. Comparative analysis also revealed a significant difference in relative abundance of some bacteria in different taxa between <b>monensin</b> and nisin. The different effects of <b>monensin</b> and nisin on microbial populations and bacterial communities are probably responsible for the discrepancy in their effects on rumen fermentation. Nisin may have advantages over <b>monensin</b> in modulating ruminal microbial ecology and reducing ruminant methane production without adversely affecting feed digestion, and thus it may be used as {{a potential}} alternative to <b>monensin</b> fed to ruminants...|$|E
