While a Prius is likely to convert fuel to <b>motive</b> <b>energy</b> on average at about 30% efficiency (well below the engine's 38% peak efficiency) the engine of a PHEV-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency.

Methods: Demographics, alcohol and energy drink consumption-related questions, and motives for the consumption of energy drinks (alone or mixed with alcohol) were assessed. The motives to mix alcohol with energy drinks were compared with those for mixing alcohol with other nonalcoholic beverages. Results: A total of 2, 329 students who completed the study consumed <b>energy</b> drinks. The <b>motives</b> for consuming <b>energy</b> drinks (without alcohol) included "I like the taste" (58. 6 %), "To keep me awake" (54. 3 %), "It gives me energy" (44. 3 %), "It helps concentrating when studying" (33. 9 %), "It increases alertness" (28. 8 %), "It helps me concentrate better" (20. 6 %), and "It makes me less sleepy when driving" (14. 2 %). A total of 1, 239 students reported occasionally consuming AMED (AMED group). The most frequent motives included "I like the taste" (81. 1 %), "I wanted to drink something else" (35. 3 %), and "To celebrate a special occasion" (14. 6 %). No relevant differences in motives were observed for using an energy drink or another nonalcoholic beverage as a mixer. A minority of students (21. 6 %) reported at least one negative motive to consume AMED. Despite these negative motives, students reported consuming significantly less alcohol on occasions when they consumed AMED compared to alcohol-only occasions.

First, this report shows (as expected) that use of the spherical image-potential-energy formula, rather than the planar formula, appears to make little difference to the values of calculated parameters. Second, values of the exponent n (in the SOC model) are tabulated as a function of internal cone half-angle.

Prepared as a background document for the 2012 World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development, and part of the Social Development Department's ongoing work on gender and infrastructure, the report describes and evaluates the evidence on the links between gender and energy focusing on: increased access to woodfuel through planting of trees and forest management; improved cooking technologies; and access to electricity and <b>motive</b> <b>energy.</b> The report's main finding is that energy interventions can have significant gender benefits, which can be realized via careful design and targeting of interventions based on a context-specific understanding of energy scarcity and household decision-making, in particular how women's preferences, opportunity cost of time, and welfare are reflected in household energy decisions. The report focuses on the academic peer-reviewed literature and, although it applies fairly inclusive screening criteria when selecting the evidence to consider, finds that the evidence on many of the energy-gender linkages is often limited.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the countercultural politics expressed within {{the work of}} the American novelist Thomas Pynchon, contributing to critical work already published on the subject of Pynchon’s politics, in which there has been a recent upsurge of interest. Expressions of sympathy with anarchist and anti-Capitalist principles discerned in Pynchon’s work are explored in their connection with the author’s experience of particular practices and philosophies of the 1960 s counterculture. Furthermore, the ongoing significance of sixties politics in Pynchon’s more recent production is demonstrated as ideological connections between earlier and later novels are traced. In Slow Learner Pynchon professed admiration for the <b>motive</b> <b>energy</b> of Beat literature, so influential on the formation of the counterculture. With particular focus on Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, chapter one demonstrates the impact of the Beat movement, and its limits, in Pynchon’s early novels. New Left thought and tactics as manifested across the decade provide the focus of the second chapter, which engages primarily with Gravity’s Rainbow’s depiction of Communist revolutionaries in Weimar-era Germany. The following chapter considers the role of psychedelic experience and the philosophies of Timothy Leary in Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 and Against the Day, arguing that the fantastical has a concrete political role in Pynchon’s novels. Black Power, and specifically the political theory of the Black Panther Party, is the subject of chapter four. Gravity’s Rainbow’s framing of Huey P. Newton’s concept of “revolutionary suicide” is central to an analysis which offers insights into the novel’s perspectives on the use of violence and on leadership in revolutionary groups.

This formula must indicate the dependence on ionization energy I. Existing formulae were derived using atomic units. However, many scientists work with ESFI as an important technical process, but {{are not familiar with}} the Gaussian or atomic units systems. In the 1970 s, the present International System of Quantities (ISQ), which includes the equations behind SI units, was designated as the main system for university teaching and the communication of scientific equations. 40 years on, ISQ derivations of ESFI rate-constant formulae are still not easily found, but are now needed. This tutorial paper gives a detailed ISQ derivation of a formula for K_e. The derivation is closely modelled on the Landau and Lifshitz (LL) approach used in their 1958 work (in atomic units) on hydrogen atom ESFI. The ISQ derivation confirms that, for hydrogenic atoms, ionization energy appears in the pre-exponential as I^(5 / 2), and defines a universal "field ionization constant". It also shows how the ISQ formula relates to the Gurney and Condon "attempt frequency" form for tunnelling rate-constants, and an ISQ formula is given for the <b>motive</b> <b>energy</b> in the related JWKB integral. The ISQ derivation uses a motive-energy transformation analogous to a transformation used by LL. The need for this transformation in ESFI theory raises questions as to the correctness of theoretical treatments of field electron emission from non-planar emitters, which do not make this transformation.

40|$|Selection of {{the working}} fluid for the {{refrigeration}} or solar air-conditioning system is the crucial problem because of the strong influence of the thermodynamic fluid properties on the system efficiency. Moreover, the working fluid should fulfil the environmental criteria such as zero ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential) and as low GWP (Greenhouse Warming Potential) as possible. Therefore the natural fluids are thought as the best option. From presented in literature analysis {{it can be concluded}} that isobutane is the best option as a working fluid for ejection system in application to air-conditioning since it offers the highest COP. Other important issue in ejection cycle analysis is the operating parameters. Thermal energy use as the <b>motive</b> <b>energy</b> for ejection cycles makes this cycle comparable with absorption system. In absorption system the temperature of the heat source tg in most cases exceeds 100 C. With decreasing of the generator (motive) temperature the efficiency of absorption system also decreases due to vanishing of the difference of strong and weak solutions concentrations. Therefore temperature tg 3 ̆c 80 C can be considered as the minimum value at which the absorption system can still operate. In contrast, for ejection systems for most of working fluids temperature of the motive fluid at the level of 100 C is not required. Also, there is no physical limitation for operation of the ejection system at lower temperatures. Therefore the operation of the ejection cycle below tg 3 ̆c 80 C can be considered as very attractive and in this range of the motive temperatures the ejection cycles becomes truly competitive in comparison with the absorption refrigeration systems. The paper deals with numerical analysis of operation of the ejection systems driven by low grade heat.

40|$|O objetivo desta dissertaÃÂÃÂo ÃÂ apresentar a revista PresenÃÂa por meio da anÃÂlise de 25 ensaios-manifestos contidos no Tomo I deste periÃÂdico, pesquisando os seus objetivos enquanto uma revista literÃÂria portuguesa surgida em 1927, que se dispÃÂs a revolucionar o cenÃÂrio literÃÂrio coimbrÃÂo da ÃÂpoca, desde o {{material}} em que fora produzida atÃÂ a proposta a qual esteve engajada, ou seja, a conquista de uma literatura, de fato, viva. NÃÂo temos a pretensÃÂo de promover teorizaÃÂÃÂes amplas e/ou finitas, a respeito da PresenÃÂa, uma vez que pelas prÃÂprias palavras de David MourÃÂo-Ferreira (1977) ÃâÅqualquer que seja o estereÃÂtipo, ainda que mÃÂnimo, de verdade ou pelo menos de verossimilhanÃÂa, nem a soma de todos eles lograria alguma vez definir ou caracterizar, na sua globalidade, o que, de fato, foi a PresenÃÂaÃâÂ. Ainda assim, e com maior desafio objetivamos, atravÃÂs do Tomo I, pelos ensaios selecionados, promover o acesso a esta produÃÂÃÂo literÃÂria, tÃÂo importante ao modernismo portuguÃÂs, alÃÂm de perscrutar a energia motriz que fez com que seus colaboradores a conduzissem, com algumas dissidÃÂncias, sem dÃÂvida, por mais de treze anos de uma produÃÂÃÂo intensa, provocativa e, sobretudo, reflexiva sobre o que se fazia por/e se entendia de Literatura, de meados de 1930 em Portugal. Para tal estudo, utilizamos alguns textos, dentre eles destacamos: Adolfo Casais Monteiro (1959, 1995), Clara Rocha (1985) e ediÃÂÃÂes integradas nas comemoraÃÂÃÂes do cinquentenÃÂrio da revista PresenÃÂa: David MourÃÂo-Ferreira (1977) e Jorge de Sena (1977). The {{aim of this}} dissertation is {{to present}} PresenÃÂa literary magazine by the analysis of 25 essay-manifests contained in the Tome I of this periodical, researching its goals while a Portuguese literary magazine emerged in 1927, which was willing to revolutionize the Coimbra literary scenario at time, since the material that had been produced until the proposal which was engaged, in other words, the conquest of a literature, in fact, alive. There is no pretension to promote wide and/or finite theorizations about PresenÃÂa, since in the very words of David MourÃÂo-Ferreira (1977) ÃâÅany stereotype, still being minimum, by the truth or at least by verisimilitude, neither {{the sum of all}} of them would be once successful to define or characterize, in its totality, what, in fact, was the PresenÃÂaÃâÂ. Nevertheless, and with the biggest challenge we aimed, by Tome I and the selected essays, to promote the access to this literary production so important to the portuguese modernism, also scrutinizing the <b>motive</b> <b>energy</b> which have made that the PresenÃÂa collaborators have conducted it, with some dissidences, no doubt, for more than thirteen years of an intense, provocative, and above all, reflexive about what was made and/or understood as Literature, in the middle of 30 s in Portugal. To make this study possible, some texts were necessary, among them we can highlight: Adolfo Casais Monteiro (1959, 1995), Clara Rocha (1985) and integrated issues in the fiftieth anniversary of PresenÃÂa magazine: David MourÃÂo-Ferreira (1977) and Jorge de Sena (1977...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a review on energy efficient WiseMAC Protocol for wireless sensor networks. Among various MAC layer protocol WiseMAC is a {{known as one}} of the most energy efficient protocol. Non-persistent carrier sense multiple access (np-CSMA) and the preamble sampling technique are the main techniques used in basic WiseMAC protocol, they are used to reduce the consumption of power when energy is wasted in listening to idle medium. Here we investigate the WiseMAC protocol with the different important schemes that used in implementation of WiseMAC in sensor networks, these schemes are basically emphasizing on energy saving methods in WiseMAC, various modifications are done in original WiseMAC to make them more energy efficient; with the same <b>motive</b> of more <b>energy</b> efficiency, we propose adaptive WiseMAC protocol with dynamic duty cycle and the adaptive Contention Window...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not think}} I have known another man whose motives were so entirely pure, so entirely unmixed with any {{personal}} calculation, whether of ambition, of prudence or of vanity. He caught up into his imagination the public gain as other men their private gain. For {{much of his life}} he had seemed, though a good soldier and a good shot, and a good rider to hounds, to care deeply for nothing but religion, and this religion, so curiously lacking in denominational limits, concerned itself alone with the communion of the soul with God. Such men, before some great decision, will sometimes give to the analysis of their own <b>motive</b> the <b>energy</b> that other men give to the examination of the circumstances wherein they act, and it is often those who attain in this way to purity of motive who act most wisely at moments of great crisis. It is as though they sank a well through the soil where our habits have been built, and where our hopes take root and are again uprooted, to the lasting rock and to the living stream. They are those for whom Tennyson claimed the strength of ten, and the common and clever wonder at their simplicity and at a triumph that has always an air of miracle about it.|$|R
40|$|With energy security, {{climate change}} mitigation, and {{sustainable}} development as three main <b>motives,</b> global <b>energy</b> policies have evolved, now asking for higher shares of renewable energies, shale oil and gas resources in the global energy supply portfolios. Yet, concerns have recently been raised about {{the environmental impacts of}} the renewable energy development, supported by many governments around the world. For example, governmental ethanol subsidies and mandates in the U. S. are aimed to increase the biofuel supply while the water footprint of this type of energy might be 70 – 400 times higher than the water footprint of conventional fossil energy sources. Hydrofracking, as another example, has been recognized as a high water-intensive procedure that impacts the surface and ground water in both quality and quantity. Hence, monitoring the water footprint of the energy mix is significantly important and could have implications for energy policy development. This paper estimates the water footprint of current and projected global energy policies, based on the energy production and consumption scenarios, developed by the International Energy Outlook of the U. S. Energy Information Administration. The outcomes reveal the amount of water required for total energy production in the world will increase by 37 %– 66 % during the next two decades, requiring extensive improvements in water use efficiency of the existing energy production technologies, especially renewables...|$|R
