2500|$|There are subcultures {{worldwide}} which {{advocate the}} belief that the Moon landings were faked. By 1977 the Hare Krishna <b>magazine</b> <b>Back</b> to Godhead called the landings a hoax, claiming that, since the Sun is 93,000,000 miles away, and [...] "according to Hindu mythology the Moon is 800,000 miles farther away than that", the Moon would be nearly 94,000,000 miles away; to travel that span in 91 hours would require a speed of more than a million miles per hour, [...] "a patently impossible feat even by the scientists' calculations." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{noted by}} {{literary}} critic Dumitru Hîncu, the art historian's wartime conduct was never censured by the interwar governments. He was again received into Queen Marie's circle, who allegedly told him: [...] "Iorga is jealous {{that he sees}} you coming over to visit with us." [...] Tzigara was still an art columnist for Convorbiri Literare, and, in 1921, became its new editor in chief. According to ASTRA's newspaper, Transilvania, Tzigara rescued Convorbiri from bankruptcy, but only catered to a niche audience. He was thus unable to steer the <b>magazine</b> <b>back</b> into the cultural mainstream, its previous dominance replicated by the left-wing Viața Românească.|$|E

He has written several books and {{articles}} about Hindu spirituality under the name Drutakarmā dāsa. He has also been a contributing editor to the <b>magazine</b> <b>Back</b> to Godhead and a bhakti yoga teacher. Cremo told Contemporary Authors that he decided to devote his life to Krishna in the early 1970s, after receiving a copy of the Bhagavad Gita at a Grateful Dead concert. In the end of the 1990s he authored a paper on the official ISKCON statement on capital punishment. His work on [...] "Puranic Time and the Archaeological Record" [...] was published in ISKCON Communications Journal and Time and Archaeology.|$|E

6000|$|... "That was {{an awful}} night. I'd made my plan whilst I was waiting for her. The papers were safe so far, but I couldn't {{take the risk of}} leaving them there any longer. They might throw that {{magazine}} away any minute. I lay awake waiting until I judged it must be about two o'clock in the morning. Then I got up as softly as I could, and felt in the dark along the left-hand wall. Very gently, I unhooked one of the pictures from its nail--Marguerite with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my coat and took out the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I had shoved in. Then I went to the washstand, and damped the brown paper {{at the back of the}} picture all round. Presently I was able to pull it away. I had already torn out the two stuck-together pages from the magazine, and now I slipped them with their precious enclosure between the picture and its brown paper backing. A little gum from the envelopes helped me to stick the latter up again. No one would dream the picture had ever been tampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the <b>magazine</b> <b>back</b> in my coat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my hiding-place. They'd never think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures. I hoped that they'd come to the conclusion that Danvers had been carrying a dummy all along, and that, in the end, they'd let me go.|$|E

6000|$|ANNA--Good-night. [He {{picks up}} the can of beer and goes slowly into the room on left, his {{shoulders}} bowed, his head sunk forward dejectedly. He closes the door after him. ANNA turns over {{the pages of the}} magazine, trying desperately to banish her thoughts by looking at the pictures. This fails to distract her, and flinging the <b>magazine</b> <b>back</b> on the table, she springs to her feet and walks about the cabin distractedly, clenching and unclenching her hands. She speaks aloud to herself in a tense, trembling voice.] Gawd, I can't stand this much longer! What am I waiting for anyway?--like a damn fool! [She laughs helplessly, then checks herself abruptly, as she hears the sound of heavy footsteps on the deck outside. She appears to recognize these and her face lights up with joy. She gasps:] Mat! [A strange terror seems suddenly to seize her. She rushes to the table, takes the revolver out of drawer and crouches down in the corner, left, behind the cupboard. A moment later the door is flung open and MAT BURKE appears in the doorway. He is in bad shape--his clothes torn and dirty, covered with sawdust {{as if he had been}} grovelling or sleeping on barroom floors. There is a red bruise on his forehead over one of his eyes, another over one cheekbone, his knuckles are skinned and raw--plain evidence of the fighting he has been through on his [...] "bat." [...] His eyes are bloodshot and heavy-lidded, his face has a bloated look. But beyond these appearances--the results of heavy drinking--there is an expression in his eyes of wild mental turmoil, of impotent animal rage baffled by its own abject misery.] ...|$|E
