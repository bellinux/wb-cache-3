In addition, their methods of study include modern proteomic approaches, computational and atomic-resolution structural methods (e.g., X-ray crystallography), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), force spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{in vitro}} {{sensitivity}} of 104 isolates ofNeisseria gonorrhoeae to six antimicrobial agents was tested. More than 50 % ofthe isolates produced penicillinase. Ofthose {{that did not}} produce penicillinase, 26 % were resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)) > 0 5 mg/i), and 68 % showed a decreased sentitivity for penicillin G (0 - 06 1 mg/i) and tetracycline (MIC> 2 mg/i). All isolates were sensitive to spectinomycin, kanamycin, and norfloxacin. Of 20 penicillinase producing N gonorrhoeae (PPNG) isolates examined, seven contained the 3 - 4 <b>megadalton</b> R-plasmid, another seven contained both the 3 - 4 <b>megadalton</b> and 22 5 <b>megadalton</b> plasmids, five the 4 - 3 <b>megadalton</b> and 22 5 <b>megadalton</b> plasmids, and one isolate harboured both the 34 and 43 R-plasmids, together with the 22 - 5 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid.

40|$|Though the {{incidence}} of gonorrhoea caused by penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) strains at St Mary's Hospital rose rapidly from 1980 to reach 6. 2 % in 1982, it declined in 1983 (8. 6 %) and in 1984 (6. 5 %), a trend that has continued in 1985. The use of penicillinase stable antibiotics or more effective contact tracing {{are unlikely to be}} responsible for this recent decline. We have always isolated very few PPNG strains from homosexual men, and the possible effects of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) on sexual behaviour in this group is therefore unlikely to be relevant. We have seen a steady increase in the proportion of PPNG strains carrying the 4. 4 <b>megadalton</b> penicillinase plasmid (67 % of PPNG strains in 1984). Strains carrying both the 4. 4 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid and the 24. 5 <b>megadalton</b> conjugal plasmid were very common in 1982, but since then have declined in importance. PPNG strains carrying the 3. 2 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid have become less common, and the presence of the 24. 5 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid in these strains has not apparently led to their wider dissemination in the community. Whereas the basic pattern of PPNG auxotypes has changed little, since 1982 we have isolated an increasing number of mixed auxotypes with nutritional requirements other than just proline. PPNG strains carrying the 4. 4 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid seem to be more resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, and streptomycin than those carrying the 3. 2 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid. Spectinomycin resistance has only occurred in strains carrying the 4. 4 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid...|$|E

The total molecular size of HVP DNA was calculated {{as close to}} 110 <b>megadaltons.</b> The following methods were used for construction of the map; (i) fragments near the ends of HVP DNA were identified by treating viral DNA with lambda exonuclease before restriction enzyme digestion; (ii) fragments containing nucleotide sequences in common with fragments from the second enzyme digest of HVP DNA were examined by Southern blot hybridization; and (iii) the location of some fragments was determined by isolating individual fragments from agarose gels and redigesting the isolated fragments with a second restriction enzyme.

The gonococci were from men (61 strains) and women (39 strains) attending a referral sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic, from women presenting for delivery at hospital with signs of sepsis (22 strains) or with an asymptomatic infection (16 strains), and from babies with ophthalmia neonatorum (17 strains). Seventy five of the 100 isolates from STD clinic patients and 29 of the 55 isolates from hospital patients were penicillinase producing N gonorrhoeae (PPNG). Two thirds of all PPNG strains contained the 24. 5 <b>megadalton</b> conjugative plasmid. The 3. 2 <b>megadalton</b> resistance plasmid, usually associated with PPNG strains originating in Africa, was present in only {{one third of the}} PPNG strains. The 2. 6 <b>megadalton</b> cryptic plasmid was present in all strains. Prototrophic and proline requiring auxotypes predominated in both PPNG and non-PPNG strains. Arginine requiring auxotypes were found in four of the 16 isolates from asymptomatic women, whereas three of the 22 strains from women with puerperal sepsis and four of the 61 strains from men with urethritis required both proline and arginine. Fifty eight out of 66 PPNG strains with the 4. 4 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid required proline compared with 22 / 38 PPNG strains with the 3. 2 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid and 20 of the 51 non-PPNG strains.

Of the 26 strains, 16 belonged to serogroup WI (containing protein type IA) and 10 to serogroup WII/III (containing protein IB). Among the IA strains four different serovars were represented, whereas six serovars were found among the IB strains. Five different auxotypes were identified, of which proline requiring (found in 12 strains) and prototrophic (found in 10 strains) dominated. Twelve strains harboured a 4. 4 <b>megadalton</b> as well as a 24. 5 <b>megadalton</b> plasmid.

Recombinant plasmids could be recovered after transformation of S. sanguis (Challis) with these preparations. Three useful chimeras were constructed. pVA 680, 5. 5 <b>megadaltons</b> in size, contained a single KpnI site into which passenger DNA may be spliced. pVA 736, 5. 0 <b>megadaltons</b> in size, contained single EcoRI, HindIII, and KpnI sites into which passenger DNA may be spliced. The EcoRI and KpnI sites of pVA 736 {{may be used}} in combination with one another when ligating DNA into this plasmid. pVA 738, 3. 7 <b>megadaltons</b> in size, contained single HindIII and AvaI sites into which passenger DNA may be spliced. pVA 680, pVA 736, and pVA 738 were stably maintained as multicopy plasmids in S. sanguis (Challis). None of them continued to replicate (amplify) in chloramphenicol-treated cells. By using pVA 736 as a vector, we have cloned a chloramphenicol resistance determinant obtained from a large, conjugative streptococcal R plasmid. In addition, chromosomal DNA sequences from Streptococcus mutans have been inserted into pVA 736 by using the KpnI-EcoRI site combination...|$|R
