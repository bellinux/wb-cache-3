However, in 1995, Veron's morphological study once again grouped it with Felidae. In 2003, molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial genes by Anne Yoder and colleagues showed that all native Malagasy carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores (meaning they form a clade, making them monophyletic) and are most closely related to Asian and African Herpestidae. To reflect these relationships, all Malagasy carnivorans are now placed in a single family, Eupleridae.

50|$|Euplerinae, more {{commonly}} known as malagasy civets, is a subfamily of carnivorans that includes four species restricted to Madagascar. Together with the subfamily Galidiinae, which also only occurs on Madagascar, it forms the family Eupleridae. Members of this subfamily, which include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), falanoucs (Eupleres goudotii and Eupleres major) and <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet</b> (Fossa fossana), were placed in families like Felidae and Viverridae before genetic data indicated their consanguinity with other Madagascar carnivorans.

50|$|Recent {{molecular}} {{studies indicate}} that the 10 living species of Madagascar carnivorans evolved from one ancestor that {{is thought to have}} rafted over from mainland Africa 18-24 million years ago. This makes Malagasy carnivorans a clade. They are closely allied with the true herpestid mongooses, their closest living relatives. The fossa and the <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet</b> (Fossa fossana) are believed to be the most ancient surviving species within this group.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the family}} Eupleridae, some {{relations}} remain unclear, with evidence from several genes {{and methods of}} inference providing conflicting evidence as to the relations among Galidiinae, the fossa, and the <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet</b> (Fossa fossana). Molecular evidence suggests that Galidia was the earliest to diverge of the four galidiine genera and that Mungotictis and Salanoia are each other's closest relatives. Morphological evidence, on the other hand, supports the relation between Mungotictis and Salanoia, but suggests that Galidictis was the earliest lineage to diverge.|$|E
50|$|Of the twenty-five {{species of}} mammals in the park, {{endemics}} include eight species of lemur, the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and the <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet</b> (Fossa fossana).

50|$|The {{differences}} in form {{make it difficult}} to concisely summarise the species in this family. The range in size is as diverse as the range in form, with smaller species at less than 500 g (1 lb) and the largest species at up to 12 kg (26 lb). Some have retractile or semi-retractile claws (the fossa and the <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet)</b> and others do not (the falanouc and Malagasy mongooses). They all tend to have slender bodies and pointed rostra (except the fossa, which has a blunt snout). Diet varies with size and form of the species and, like their mainland counterparts, ranges from small mammals, insects and invertebrates through to crustaceans and molluscs.|$|E
5000|$|Family Eupleridae (the [...] "Malagasy carnivorans") {{includes}} fossa, falanouc, <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet</b> and Malagasy mongooses, all {{of which}} are restricted to the island of Madagascar. The eight species in the family exhibit significant variations in form. These differences initially led to the species in this family sharing common names with, and being placed in the different families of, apparently more similar species on the mainland (e.g. civets and mongoose). However, phylogenetic analysis of DNA provides strong evidence that all Malagasy carnivorans evolved from a single common ancestor that was a herpestid (Yoder et al. 2003). Recent phylogenetic analysis supports this view and places all of the Malagasy carnivorans in the family Eupleridae (Gaubert et al. 2005).|$|E
50|$|In 1993, Géraldine Veron and François Catzeflis {{published}} a DNA hybridization study {{suggesting that the}} fossa was {{more closely related to}} mongooses (family Herpestidae) than to cats or civets.

5000|$|The family Herpestidae {{was first}} {{described}} by French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1845. In her 1973 book The Carnivores, mammalogist R. F. Ewer included all mongooses {{in the family}} Viverridae (the civets), though subsequent publications considered them a separate family. In 1864, British zoologist John Edward Gray classified the herpestids into three subfamilies: Galiidinae, Herpestinae and Mungotinae. This grouping was supported by British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock in his 1919 publication, in which {{he referred to the}} family as [...] "Mungotidae". However, in the 2000s, genetic evidence from nuclear and mitochondrial analyses argued against placing the galidiines in the mongoose family; these species {{have been found to be}} more closely related to other Madagascar carnivores, including the fossa and <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet.</b> Galiidinae is presently considered a subfamily of Eupleridae.|$|E
50|$|The fossa was {{formally}} described by Edward Turner Bennett {{on the basis}} of a specimen from Madagascar sent by Charles Telfair in 1833. The common name is the same as the generic name of the <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet</b> (Fossa fossana), but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with civets, mongooses, and cats (Felidae), its classification has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the fossa as a type of civet in the family Viverridae, a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact braincase, large eye sockets, retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous dentition have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids. In 1939, William King Gregory and Milo Hellman placed the fossa in its own subfamily within Felidae, the Cryptoproctinae. George Gaylord Simpson placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still within its own subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{divergence between}} the herpestids and the euplerids {{dates back to}} the Oligocene;. At that time, feliforms shared many similarities, particularly between the cats and the viverrids. Palaeoprionodon (within the superfamily Aeluroidea), found in Europe and Asia from the late Eocene or early Oligocene, looked similar to the modern fossa, while Proailurus, an extinct form of cat, exhibited many viverrid-like characteristics. Despite these similarities in the fossil record, the modern Malagasy carnivores are distinctly different, with the Euplerinae and Galidiinae subfamilies bearing similarities with civets and mongooses, respectively. Species in Euplerinae (including the fossa, falanouc, and <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet)</b> have auditory regions similar to those of viverrids, while those in Galidiinae have auditory regions similar to those of herpestids. Based on this trait, Robert M. Hunt Jr. proposed in 1996 that Madagascar was colonized twice, once by viverrids and once by herpestids. However, the genetic studies by Yoder and colleagues in 2003 suggested that a single colonization event occurred by a primitive herpestid ancestor, which was quickly followed by adaptive radiation. The common ancestor arrived from Africa, probably by rafting, during the late Oligocene or early Miocene (24-18 Mya), though Philippe Gaubert and Veron estimated a divergence date of 19.4 Mya (16.5-22.7 Mya).|$|E
40|$|Chromosome {{painting}} {{was used to}} investigate the conservation of high-resolution longitudinal 4 #, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) /G bands in Carnivore chromosomes. Cat (Felis catus) and raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) painting probes were hybridized to the ringtail (Bassaricus astutus), dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula), and <b>Malagasy</b> <b>civet</b> (Fossa fossa) to identify homologous chromosome elements. The patterns of chromosome segment homology among Carnivore species allowed us to reconstruct and propose the disposition of a high-resolution banded ancestral carnivore karyotype (ACK). Three bi-armed chromosomes consistently found among Caniformia species are represented as 6 homologous acrocentric chromosomes among Feliformia species of Carnivora. However, reexamination of the most basal of Feliformia species, the African palm civet Nandinia, revealed {{the presence of the}} 3 heretofore Caniformia bi-armed chromosomes. Because these 3 bi-armed chromosomes are found in both Caniformia and Feliformia lineages, they are presumed ancestral for all Carnivora, suggesting that the ACK chromosome number would be 38, rather than the previously supposed 42. Banded chromosomes of the ACK are used to evaluate the consistency between recently determined molecular phylogenetic relationships and postulated cytogenetic dynamics in the same Carnivore species...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{efforts to}} understand and conserve Madagascar&#x 2019;s unique biodiversity, relatively {{little is known about}} the island&#x 2019;s carnivore populations. We sampled four rainforest sites to explore the effects of forest logging and fragmentation on carnivore species richness and the density of the two largest endemic carnivores, the Fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and <b>Malagasy</b> <b>Civet</b> (Fossa fossana). Our rainforest sites were selected across a gradient of increasing anthropogenic disturbance from primary to selectively-logged to fragmented forest &#x 3 c; 2. 5 km from primary forest, to fragmented forest &#x 3 e; 20 km from primary forest. We deployed a minimum of 26 passive infrared camera stations at each forest site to non-invasively sample carnivores. By identifying C. ferox and F. fossana individuals based on unique pelage patterns, we were able to apply capture-recapture analyses using the Huggins model in Program MARK and Program DENSITY. We used a buffer of full mean-maximum-distance-moved (MMDM) and a spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) method to estimate density. A total of 5, 579 camera-trap nights yielded detections of five endemic carnivores (C. ferox, F. fossana, ring-tailed mongoose Galidia elegans, broad-striped mongoose Galidictus fasciata, small-toothed civet Eupleres goudotii). We found variation in carnivore species richness among the four sites. All endemic carnivores were present in the primary and selectively-logged rainforest, while overall endemic species richness was greatly reduced in the fragmented forests. Density also varied significantly among the rainforest sites. F. fossana density (individuals/km- 2 1; SE) decreased significantly between the primary rainforest (SECR 3. 19 1; 0. 55, MMDM 2. 47 1; 0. 13) and selectively-logged rainforest (SECR 1. 38 1; 0. 223, MMDM 1. 22 1; 0. 055). F. fossana was absent from both fragmented sites. C. ferox density also decreased significantly between the primary rainforest (SECR 0. 12 1; 0. 05, MMDM 0. 14 1; 0. 001) and the selectively-logged rainforest (SECR 0. 09 1; 0. 04, MMDM 0. 09 1; 0. 002). C. ferox was absent from the fragmented rainforest &#x 3 e; 20 km from primary forest, yet we did detect a single individual at the fragmented rainforest &#x 3 c; 2. 5 km from the primary forest. Our results suggest that forest logging and fragmentation negatively impact C. ferox and F. fossana populations in Malagasy rainforests. Unlike F. fossana, C. ferox appears to be able to occupy rainforest fragments near primary forest. Our study provides the first assessment of carnivore population parameters in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar and will be of importance to Malagasy governmental and non-governmental agencies seeking to more accurately assess the status of these species and to best set management goals...|$|E
