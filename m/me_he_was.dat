5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was Kiss Them for <b>Me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{personally}} asked by Cary Grant to direct and began developing it while still under contract at MGM. With a plot that strongly resembles On the Town, the film features Grant, Ray Walston and Larry Blyden as three navy officers on leave in San Francisco in 1944. Unlike On the Town, Kiss Them for Me {{is a dark}} comedy that contrasts the officers' selfless heroism with their self-absorbed hedonism while on leave. The film was released in 1957 to mostly poor reviews.|$|E

25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E

[...] "The title is a tribute to his vision. He had a plan and he saw it through. That was a real eye-opener for me.

She and her mother Susan {{moved out of the}} house to a rented apartment in Crescent, Oklahoma. Susan's instability continued, and in 1998 she attempted suicide; Manning's sister drove their mother to the hospital, with the 11-year-old Manning sitting {{in the back of the}} car trying to make sure their mother was still breathing.|$|E
500|$|According to Paul Hornsby, {{who played}} with Duane Allman in Hour Glass in 1967–1968 before the Allman Brothers Band, [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] {{inspired}} Allman to take up slide guitar. [...] After hearing Beck's record, Allman [...] "loved that slide part and told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going {{to learn to play}} it", Hornsby recalled. [...] In 1970, Joe Walsh adapted the slide-guitar section of [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] for a James Gang song. [...] Titled [...] "The Bomber", the multi-part suite also includes a rendition of Ravel's Boléro and appears on the James Gang Rides Again album. [...] Several artists have recorded renditions of [...] "Beck's Bolero", including SRC, the Posies, Les Fradkin, Eric Johnson, and Return to Forever.|$|E
500|$|Boulding was {{tracked by}} Bradford City and Crewe Alexandra, {{with whom he}} was offered a {{contract}} after a successful trial, but instead decided to retire from professional football after being asked {{to play on the}} left wing. Crewe manager Dario Gradi said: [...] "He told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to retire because he didn't want to sit on the bench all season—or drop down the divisions." [...] His retirement lasted seven months while he worked for his father's company until he joined Rotherham United in March 2006 following three reserve games. He signed {{for the rest of the}} 2005–06 season, but did not make any first-team appearances for Rotherham and left the club at the end of the season.|$|E

500|$|Dickinson {{attended}} {{primary school}} in a two-story building on Pleasant Street. Her education was [...] "ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl". Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to [...] "keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned". While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests {{that her mother was}} regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she [...] "always ran Home to Awe [...] when a child, if anything befell <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none." ...|$|E

Egan said that her mother [...] "told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone seems to think we have good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town." [...] Egan said Adam was Sharon's biggest supporter when Chelsea had Billy's baby and gave him up.|$|E
500|$|Godrich's {{father died}} {{on the day of}} the {{recording}} of the string sessions for [...] "Burn the Witch".

And it was a very, very emotional day for <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people. It was a miracle that that record got made at all." ...|$|E

[...] Despite Yost's hopes, Maulbetsch fell far short of the prior year's performance in 1915. [...] He was several pounds lighter after the illness and surgery, and it was noted that [...] "a few pounds means much to a man of Maulbetsch's weight." [...] In the opening game against Lawrence, Maulbetsch scored three touchdowns, but he was [...] "woefully weak on interference." [...] Playing against Mount Union, Maulbetsch made several big gains, including a 50-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. [...] His difficulties returned in the season's third game against Marietta, as [...] "Maulbetsch was powerless to stop the Marietta forward pass, all of the successful ones being directed toward his side of the line." ...|$|E

To <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the quintessential old-school heavy metal singer. He could hit notes that were just sick, and he was a great showman. Everything made me a fan. And there wasn't a dude that I hung out with that wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks", while their music also helped Jesper Strömblad of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre, stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden's melodic guitar sounds.|$|E

[...] "He was always coming into the huddle and telling <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> open and that I should throw to him," [...] Graham said. [...] "He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.' Many a time when I was stuck and heard that voice I would throw it in his direction and darned if he didn't come down with it. He had fantastic hands." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1936 London Films {{released}} Things to Come, {{in which}} Richardson played the swaggering warlord [...] "The Boss". His performance parodied the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini so effectively {{that the film}} was immediately banned in Italy. The producer was Alexander Korda; the two men formed a long and mutually beneficial friendship. Richardson later said of Korda, [...] "Though not so very much older than I am, I regarded {{him in a way}} as a father, and to <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> as generous as a prince." [...] In May 1936 Richardson and Olivier jointly directed and starred in a new piece by Priestley, Bees on the Boatdeck. Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain's decline, did not attract the public. It closed after four weeks, the last in a succession of West End productions in which Richardson appeared to much acclaim but which were box-office failures. In August of the same year he finally had a long-running star part, the title role in Barré Lyndon's comedy thriller, The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse, which played for 492 performances, closing in October 1937.|$|E

And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. Why should I? ...|$|E

Jon Caramanica from The New York Times also wrote that on the song, Brown [...] "double-time-raps about stealing girlfriends." [...] Akshay Bhansali from MTV News wrote that [...] "LookatMeNow" [...] features [...] "a fast-rapping flurry of awesome self-indulgence courtesy of Busta Rhymes, Lil Wayne and Chris, with an eerie downtempo beat cooked up by chefs Afrojack and Diplo." [...] Afrojack told MTV News that the song {{was the product of}} a beat he passed to Diplo.
