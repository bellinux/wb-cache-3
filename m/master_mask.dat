40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device and {{a process for}} the duplication of X-ray masks by means of X-ray lithography, with which the precise adjustment and spacing of the 1 x <b>master</b> <b>mask</b> and copy or heat sink and copy are possible. According to the invention, the adjustment and spacing of the 1 x <b>master</b> <b>mask</b> and copy are performed {{by means of a}} movable autocollimating telescope and adjustable mask holders. The precise spacing of the heat sink and copy is enabled by a capacitive distance sensor on the heat sink. Copying processes for X-ray masks are necessary in particular for industrial applications since several copies of an X-ray mask are frequently required...|$|E
40|$|Fractional Talbot effect {{leads to}} the {{possibility}} to implement patterning of structures with smaller periods than the <b>master</b> <b>mask.</b> This is particularly attractive when using short wavelength illumination in the extreme ultraviolet because of attainable resolution in the sub- 100 -nm range. In this Letter, we demonstrate the Talbot lithography with the fractional Talbot effect under coherent illumination generated with a capillary discharge Ne-like Ar extreme ultraviolet laser. Various spatial frequency multiplications up to 5 are achieved using a parent grating. This technique allows a fabrication of nanostructures with high-resolution patterns, which is of high interest in many applications such as the manufacturing of plasmonic surfaces and photonic devices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multi-layer technique for e-beam written x-ray master masks with electroplated gold absorbers, which allows {{to fulfill the}} demands on controlling linewidth of 0. 5 Mikrometer better than plusminus 50 nm. Besides the rather complex multi-layer process for e-beam written master masks, a procedure for x-ray mas copying is described, which provides a much faster and more simple single-layer resist technology. Here the main contribution to linewidth variation results from the dose/development behaviour of the single-layer resist, being used as the electroplating mould. Appropriate exposure and development conditions allow a CD control of the work mask drawn via a submaster within the same error budget as on the <b>master</b> <b>mask...</b>|$|E
40|$|For high {{resolution}} pattering of X-ray <b>master</b> <b>masks</b> by e-beam lithography, it is {{state of the}} art to use an elaborate tri-level technique for the absorber structuring of critical mask layers. At present PMMA is used in this application as the e-beam sensitive top resist. In producing <b>master</b> <b>masks</b> of very high complexity, e. g. SRAM or DRAM devices, the relative low sensitivity of PMMA is causing considerably long writing times. To overcome this problem the newly developed negative-tone resist 'RAY-PN' with a sensitivity of about 20 times higher than PMMA has been used. Furthermore, a one-layer arrangement with this resist was investigated {{to reduce the number of}} process steps for absorber patterning of mask layers with CD down to 0. 5 mu m...|$|R

40|$|A further {{increase}} in the integration density of SRAM and DRAM memories will be limited by resolution as well as overlay accuracy. In the case of synchrotron-based X-ray lithography, the main contribution to the total overlay budget is given by the achievable accuracy of the X-ray masks. In this paper, the pattern placement accuracy of silicon X-ray <b>master</b> <b>masks</b> will be shown, which are fabricated for real device application. The measurement results are obtained with an optimized and improved e-beam measurement system and {{discussed in terms of}} linear and nonlinear pattern placement errors. Considering a number of X-ray <b>master</b> <b>masks</b> with different absorber coverage within the step and repeat field (3 * 3 cm 2) and different levels of complexity, the average pattern placement error including both statistical and linear contributions can be reduced reproducibly down to about 70 nm, including the principal accuracy of the e-beam pattern generator and measurement system...|$|R
30|$|This tri-color shift device {{breaks through}} {{the limit of}} bi-color {{shifting}} technology. The device is hard to be replicated with special design principle, embedded structure, and high-precision manufacture, while its 1 D single period structure is good for manufacture of the high-precision <b>master</b> <b>mask.</b> Moreover, the device can be mass produced at low cost by matured embossing technique. It generates high reflection efficiencies for TE and TM polarizations simultaneously. So the general public can conveniently observe the unique visual effects in daylight. Also, the trained examiners can readily identify the distinctive spectral behaviors by machine. At last, viewing the device is enjoyable because of the novel visual effect. So the tri-color shift device may have great applications {{in the field of}} the optically variable image security.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the first}} European institutes for microelectronics, the Arbeitsstelle für Molekularelektronik Dresden AME, was founded in 1961 by WERNER HARTMANN. The purpose was to develop {{processes}} for fabrication of integrated circuits. Concerning microlithography at first a five-stage mask technique was used since 1965. The artwork original which was called "Vorlage" was cut with a scale of about 200 : 1. Using a reduction camera the artwork original was reduced about 20 times, to get the reticle known as the "Zwischennegativ". This reticle was then further reduced about 10 times by "step and repeat", using a projection microscope, to get a <b>master</b> <b>mask</b> known as the "Originalschablone" whose scale was then 1 : 1. By direct photocopying of the <b>master</b> <b>mask</b> one obtained a working mask which was called the "Arbeitsschablone". Finally, an aligned direct exposure of the working mask on to a wafer created, layer by layer, the micro-pattern of the chip array. Concerning the materials a double layer film {{was used for the}} artwork originals, and 2 inch photographic plates were used for the reticles and masks. In this way the first East German bipolar integrated circuits, NOR gates with 8 transistors, were made in Dresden in 1967. This was done with 4 masking levels on 25 mm Si wafers with 1. 5 mm chip size and 20 µm minimal figure width (critical dimensions). In the late 1960 's some improvements were introduced, particularly the 6 -barrel semi-automatic photorepeater, which improved the figure width and gave lower tolerances. The largest chip made in 1969 was a J-K master-slave flipflop, this contained 36 transistors on a chip 1. 6 mm x 1. 8 mm and was done with 9 masking levels and with 10 µm minimal figure width...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{specifics}} of X-ray mask fabrication suitable for high-aspect ratio micro-lithography in micromachining. Results of fabrication and exposures using x-ray masks with 4. tm thick gold absorber (one level resist) are illustrated. For conventional x-ray masks commercially available substrates were used: B-doped Si membrane (2 - 3. tm thick) on a 4 " Si wafer bonded to a Pyrex glass ring. A new approach- the transfer mask technique- is demonstrated. This technique {{is based on}} forming an absorber pattern directly onto the resist surface of the sample. The transfer mask method is suitable for any radiation (visible, UV, and X-rays) {{and is based on}} the use of a <b>master</b> <b>mask</b> (optical or x-ray) to achieve patterns with desired aspect ratio. When used in conjunction with multiple x-ray exposures and sequential developments the transfer mask method produces patterns with extremely high aspect ratio...|$|E

40|$|In October 2002 I {{performed}} and exhibited Troppo Obscura: A Peepshow of Historical Perversity at the Performance Space {{as part of}} the multicultural Arts festival, Carnivale, in Sydney, Australia. Troppo Obscura is a multimedia installation that explores some aspects of the complex relationships between the West and Asia. The work looks at a large range of possibilities, from the colonial gaze through to personal relationships forged through artistic endeavor. This paper—the first of two extended mediations on the topic—focuses on one such personal relationship addressed in the installation, namely that between traditional <b>master</b> <b>mask</b> dancer Ibu Sawitri from Cirebon on the West coast of Java, Indonesia and myself, a Sydney based contemporary dancer and performance artist. Between 1992 and 1999, the year Ibu Sawitri passed away, I spent many long-term visits learning dance and living in Ibu Sawitri’s house in Losari. This essay focuses on Ibu Sawitri’s family and dance background and how she, the younger generation of dancers, the dance context, and the dance itself, have been transformed over time as a result of rapidly changing socio-historical conditions. In the second half of this paper I move the discussion to the broader issues of cross-cultural encounters in what Pratt terms the ‘contact zone’ (1992). This includes looking at dance as an embodied practice and its function in the ‘contact zone’ as well as dealing with Spivak’s debates about the subaltern voice in reference to my telling of Ibu Sawitri’s story, both in the installation and in text. A closer analysis of the dynamics of my dance with Ibu Sawitri in the ‘contact zone’ is addressed here...|$|E
40|$|The paper reveals {{significance}} {{and complexity of}} automatic inspection of pattern <b>master</b> <b>masks</b> of  integrated circuits under conditions of continuous decrease of  topological design specifications. Two methods for obtaining sub-pixel resolution are presented in the paper.

The second method {{is based on the}} application of a new method for automatic inspection of <b>master</b> pattern <b>masks</b> of Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits on photo-masks. The first method allows to obtain universal algorithms with sub-pixel resolution by 20 – 30 % less than the pixel size.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a process {{for the production of}} microchannel arrays on bonded glass substrates up to 14 X 58 cm, for DNA sequencing. Arrays of 96 and 384 microchannels, each 46 cm long have been built. This technology offers significant advantages over discrete capillaries or conventional slab-gel approaches. High throughput DNA sequencing with over 550 base pairs resolution has been achieved. With custom fabrication apparatus, microchannels are etched in a borosilicate substrate, and then fusion bonded to a top substrate 1. 1 mm thick that has access holes formed in it. SEM examination shows a typical microchannel to be 40 X 180 micrometers by 46 cm long; the etch is approximately isotropic, leaving a key undercut, for forming a rounded channel.

40|$|We are {{investigating}} the possibility of replacing binary diffractive optical elements and molded aspheric lenses with a continuous relief optical element known as a kinoform. With continuous relief optical elements, diffraction efficiencies of over 90 % have been reported [1, 2]. Using a grayscale master and altered properties of a normally analog resist, continuous relief optical elements can be produced with repeatable results. Typical binary structures require multiple masters to be generated. These masters approximate a continuous slope through a binary staircase profile. Alignment of these masters from layer to layer is critical and time consuming. With a gray scale <b>master,</b> multiple <b>mask</b> alignments are eliminated.
