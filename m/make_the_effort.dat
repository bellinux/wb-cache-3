5|$|In June 2008, Bolt {{responded to}} {{claims that he}} was a lazy athlete, saying that the {{comments}} were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event, and chose to not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to train for distance running. Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in multiple events—first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece. Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.|$|E
5|$|The diplosegments of millipedes {{have evolved}} in {{conjunction}} with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; bulldozing, wedging and boring. Members of the orders Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, lower their heads and barge {{their way into the}} substrate, the collum being the portion of their exoskeleton that leads the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order Polyzoniida. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs, the wedge-shaped body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, or because they are too large to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively fast (for a millipede) and are active predators.|$|E

500|$|Teen-oriented movies. Since teenagers, [...] "the {{demographic}} with {{an excess}} of idle time in January," [...] are less interested in movies touted as potential Oscar winners than adults, Meslow reasons, studios <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to release films targeted to them. So, romantic films like She's All That, Save the Last Dance and A Walk to Remember have successfully opened in January. The low-budget parody films of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, such as Date Movie and Meet the Spartans, have also done well with the teen market in the dump months despite strongly negative reception from critics and audiences.|$|E
2500|$|Since most votes count, {{there are}} fewer [...] "wasted votes", so voters, aware that their vote can make a difference, {{are more likely to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to vote, and less likely to vote tactically. [...] Compared to {{countries}} with plurality electoral systems, voter turnout improves and the population is more involved in the political process.

On September 15, the band made Daisy available to stream through Myspace. In promoting the album, as with previous album The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me, the band were very selective over which publications they would talk to, largely avoiding the American media altogether. The band also made the decision not to make conventional music videos, as well as ultimately only releasing one song as a single after scrapping the planned [...] "Sink" [...] single. Some publications speculated that Daisy would be the band's final album, claims which the band repeatedly denied.|$|E

2500|$|The Justice Department {{launched}} {{a series of}} raids on January 2, 1920, with follow up operations {{over the next few}} days. Smaller raids extended over the next 6 weeks. At least 3000 were arrested, and many others were held for various lengths of time. The entire enterprise replicated the November action on a larger scale, including arrests and seizures without search warrants, as well as detention in overcrowded and unsanitary holding facilities. Hoover later admitted [...] "clear cases of brutality." [...] The raids covered more than 30 cities and towns in 23 states, but those west of the Mississippi and south of the Ohio were [...] "publicity gestures" [...] designed to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> appear nationwide in scope. Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents arrested everyone found in organization meeting halls, not only arresting non-radical organization members but also visitors who did not belong to a target organization, and sometimes American citizens not eligible for arrest and deportation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the controversy surrounding its exposure of fascist biographies, the work also drew criticism for being too lenient on the political and cultural establishment of the 1930s. Historian Maria Bucur, who investigated the widespread advocacy of eugenics during the Romanian interwar, is skeptical about Ornea's claim that intellectual supporters of liberal democracy were clearly separated from and always outnumbered those who preached authoritarianism, arguing that her own study proves otherwise: [...] "The position of the Romanian eugenicists challenges this confidence in the support for democracy in interwar Romania. While {{a few of these}} individuals did identify directly with the extreme right, many more eugenicists considered themselves moderate [...] The spectrum of illiberalism was broader and less clearly identified with a marginal radical rightist position than Ornea suggests in his study." [...] Rizescu also finds flaw in the book's perceived search for centrist references, which, he claims, led Ornea to neglect the contribution of Marxists and peasantists active in the 1930s, and as such to avoid inaugurating an [...] "extensive interpretative revisions" [...] of interwar leftist ideas for a post-communist world. He notes: [...] "Indeed, while Tradiționalism și modernitate is broad and ambitious in scope, paying equal attention to social-economic as well as to literary-philosophical debates, and trying to present a complete picture of the intellectual concerns and intellectual trends of the age, Anii treizeci is quite narrowly focused on the rise of the extreme right and the reactions this phenomenon raised raised among the thinkers of a different orientation. [...] The general impression one gets, after this comparison, is that Ornea [...] avoided to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to re-comprehend, in post-communist terms, the problems connected with the sociological and economic component of pre-communist doctrines and ideological currents, as well as to discover a new, post-totalitarian 'language', fit for preserving the vagaries of the Romanian left." ...|$|E
2500|$|The year 1840 {{marked a}} turning point in her career, however. In 1838, Droste had begun to {{frequent}} a literary salon in Münster, presided over by Elise Rüdiger, the [...] "Hecken-Schriftstellergesellschaft." [...] One of its members was the young poet Levin Schücking. Schücking had published an admiring review of Droste's collection and sought her help in writing his own book, Das malerische und romantische Westfalen ("Picturesque and Romantic Westphalia", 1840). The two soon formed a close friendship and Droste wrote a number of ballads for inclusion in the book, among them [...] "Das Fräulein von Rodenschild" [...] and [...] "Der Tod des Erzbischofs Engelbert von Köln". Schücking encouraged her renewed literary creativity. In the winter of 1840—1841 she wrote her famous novella Die Judenbuche (The Jew's Beech, published 1842), based on an incident which had occurred near Bökerhof in the late 18th century. The following autumn and winter, Droste and Schücking stayed at her brother-in-law's castle at Meersburg on Lake Constance, where Schücking had been given the task of cataloguing Laßberg's book collection. Here Schücking told her that her talent lay in lyric poetry, which relied on rare moments of inspiration. Droste disagreed: she had no problem composing poetry in her head but had difficulty writing it down and the failure of her first book had not encouraged her to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort.</b> Now she had a sympathetic reader in Schücking, she began to write in earnest, producing about fifty poems between October 1841 and April 1842. They include poems dedicated to Schücking, often on the theme of ageing (e.g. [...] "Kein Wort", [...] "O frage nicht"), and poems of self-analysis such as [...] "Das Spiegelbild" [...] ("The Image in the Mirror") and [...] "Die Taxuswand" [...] ("The Yew Hedge"), which looks back to her unhappy love affair with Straube. Other lyrics are the nature poems collected in the cycle [...] "Heidebilder" [...] ("Heath Pictures"), including such famous pieces as [...] "Die Krähen" [...] ("The Crows"), [...] "Der Hünenstein", [...] "Die Mergelgrube" [...] ("The Marl Pit") and [...] "Der Knabe im Moor" [...] ("The Boy on the Moor"). These often have an element of supernatural terror.|$|E
