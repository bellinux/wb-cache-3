In June 2013, the PTAB issued its final written decision, cancelling claims 17 and 26-29 as unpatentable under § 101. The case then came to the Federal Circuit.|$|E

40|$|Background Several {{authors have}} pleaded for the careful {{planning}} of mixed method reviews. However, {{the focus on}} the procedural or design related aspects of conducting a mixed <b>method</b> <b>review</b> leaves potential review authors with the impression that differences between quantitative and qualitative approaches to synthesizing research evidence are merely technical. Decisions on how to approach complex interventions reviews should be guided by the type of questions that emerge during the review process. Objectives To present a typology of questions assisting review authors in selecting appropriate review questions for different phases in a mixed <b>method</b> <b>review.</b> Methods A research inquiry into the most beneficial promotion program to stimulate breast feeding will be used as an example to illustrate how questions related to effectiveness, feasibility, appropriateness and/or meaning may reveal themselves to an author team {{in the context of a}} review on complex interventions. Results Complex intervention reviews are contingent in nature and tend to move from one particular phase in a review to another. Different research questions may be generated in different phases in the iteration process. Consequently, review authors’ decisions (1) tend to grow organically and (2) are influenced by different beliefs on what needs to be covered in a review. A phenomenon under review may appear the same across quantitative and qualitative evidence syntheses strands. However, the distinction between inquiries into ‘meaning’ and ‘effectiveness’ reconciles a phenomenon to an exclusive quantitative or qualitative research paradigm. Conclusions With an emphasis on ‘phases’ in a the process of a review of complex interventions we move away from a procedural focus on ‘mixing’ evidence synthesis approaches. We encourage review author to consider which configurations of methods, techniques and approaches make sense to answer predefined as well as emerging research questions during the review process. status: submitte...|$|E

Results ADHD exists in a surprisingly high frequency together with a broad range of child neuropsychiatric disorders. This is accompanied with many still unresolved treatment problems.

The conclusion of the dialectical addition of these two principles in the normal state of the research process is making.

Results Four types of patient mobility are defined: primary, complementary, duplicative, and institutionalized. Primary exit occurs when people without comprehensive insurance travel because they cannot {{afford to pay for}} health insurance or directly finance care, as in the United States and Mexico. Second, people will exit to buy complementary services not covered, or partially covered by domestic health insurance, in both the United States and Europe. Third, in Europe, patient mobility for duplicative services provides faster or better quality treatment. Finally, governments and insurers can encourage institutionalized exit through expanded delivery options and financing. Institutionalized exit is developing in Europe, but uncoordinated and geographically limited in the United States. Conclusions This parsimonious framework explains patient mobility by considering domestic health system characteristics relating to cost and quality.

40|$|Introduction. This {{study was}} aimed at {{providing}} an update on most recent developments regarding ocular and systemic manifestations and complications, clinical diagnosis and management, and molecular patophysiology of pseudoexfoliation syndrome. <b>Method.</b> <b>Review</b> of recent literature and own clinical and laboratory studies. Results. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is an age-related disease in which abnormal fibrillar extracellular material is produced and accumulated in many ocular tissues. Recent progress and advances have led to improvements in clinical management by understanding {{the effects of the}} pseudoexfoliation process on the ocular tissues, by refining diagnostic criteria and applying new treatment regimes, and by developing preventive strategies to reduce surgical complications. Increasing evidence of systemic associations of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, abdominal aorta aneurysm can provide better understanding and management of this condition, and new therapeutic goal. The current pathogenesis concept describes psuedoexfoliation syndrome as an elastic microfibrillopathy involving transforming growth factor-b, matrix metalloproteinase oxidative stress. Conclusion. Despite extensive research, the exact chemical composition of exfoliation material remains unknown. The presence of pseudoexfoliation should alert the physician to the increased risks of intraocular surgery, most commonly zonular dehiscence, capsular rupture, and vitreous loss during cataract extraction. Its associated clinical signs are important in the detection and management of glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Examine the {{benefits}} and limitations of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNA) used as the definitive diagnostic method before treatment. <b>Method.</b> <b>Review</b> of the 25 year experience at a multidisciplinary musculo-skeletal centre where FNA is the primary diagnostic approach to soft tissue sarcoma in the extremities and trunk wall {{and the experience of}} various experts in the field. Results. FNA has several benefits compared with coarse needle or open surgical biopsy. The most important are rapid preliminary diagnosis, no need for hospitalization and anaesthesia, negligible complications and fear for tumour cell spread. With the collected experience gained during the years a reliable diagnosis of sarcoma is the rule in general and specific-type diagnoses are possible in many histotypes, especially when the cytologic examination is supplemented with ancillary diagnostics. The most important limitations are inability to hit small deep-seated sarcoma and some diagnostic pitfalls such as the correct diagnosis of spindle cell neoplasms, variants of benign lipomatous tumours and 'new soft tissue tumour entities'. Discussion. Optimal use of FNA calls for certain requirements such as centralization, experience in soft tissue tumour cytology-histopathology, the FNA technique and close co-operation between the orthopaedic surgeon and cytopathologist...|$|E
