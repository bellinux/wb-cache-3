40|$|A brief {{description}} of the potential occupational health hazards encountered in the manufacture of plastics (polymers) is given. In general, these hazards are due to the monomers used to make the various plastics, to unreacted monomer contained within the finished products, and to the fillers, stabilizers, pigments, inhibitors, and initiators used in fabricating the finished products. They run the gamut from angiosarcomas of the liver due to vinyl chloride, to dermatitis and asthma-like reactions due to the initiators used with epoxy resins. It is impossible, in the time allotted today, to describe for you in any detail all of the occupational and environmental health hazards of plastics. At best, all we can hope to do is outline some of the more obvious ones in a general way. I have previously reviewed this topic in more detail (1). We might start by defining a plastic as "a material that contains as an essential ingredient an organic substance of large molecular weight, is solid in its finished state, and, at some stage in its manufacture or in its processing into finished articles, can be shaped by flow " (2). In many cases, the terms plastic and resin are used in an overlapping sense. However, strictly speaking, a resin is the more or less homogeneous polymer used as the starting material in the production of a <b>molded</b> <b>article,</b> while plastic signifies the finished product which may contain fillers, plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, etc. In general, the principal hazards of plastics are associated with their monomers and with the plasticizers, stabilizers, "activators, " fillers, and pigments that are used in them. Although there are exceptions to this, this statement generally holds true. Of course, the hazard we are all most acutely aware of today is that of liver angiosarcom...|$|E

40|$|Wholly {{aromatic}} thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers (TLCPs) are {{an important}} class of high-performance materials, which offer a combination of excellent thermal and mechanical properties. TLCPs can be processed from the nematic melt into high-modulus fibers, films and <b>molded</b> <b>articles.</b> However, despite their all-aromatic composition, main-chain TLCPs exhibit low glass transition temperatures (100 - 120 o C) and low moduli at elevated temperatures, which significantly limits their final use temperature. Recently we demonstrated an alternate route towards all-aromatic TLCPs. [1] We synthesized oligomers end-capped with reactive phenylethynyl functionalities. This approach allows us {{to take advantage of}} the low melt viscosity inherent to oligomeric species. In a latter, high temperature step, the reactive end-groups are activated and chain extension or crosslinking is initiated. In this paper we will present our current work, where we are utilizing this reactive oligomer approach towards the synthesis of melt processable all-aromatic esterbased TLCPs with Tg’s in excess of 200 o C. We have modified a well-known LCP formulation based on Hydroquinone (HQ) and Terephthalic acid (TA), an LCP with a Tg o...|$|R
