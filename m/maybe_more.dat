Carpathias lights were first spotted around 03:30, which greatly cheered the survivors, though it took several more hours for everyone to be brought aboard. The 30 or more men on collapsible B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made. Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (<b>maybe</b> <b>more</b> than a half) had died overnight. The remaining survivors– {{an unknown number of}} men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman– were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner Oceanic, with the bodies still aboard.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{presence}} of community cards in Texas hold 'em, different players' hands can often run very close in value. As a result, it is common for kickers to be used to determine the winning hand and also for two hands (or <b>maybe</b> <b>more)</b> to tie. A kicker is a card {{which is part of the}} five-card poker hand, but is not used in determining a hand's rank. For instance, in the hand A-A-A-K-Q, the king and queen are kickers.|$|E

Head adored children, {{as can be seen}} in his poems and his poetry also gives considerable insight into Head's great desire for a child of his own. In his poem , for example, he takes on the perspective of a woman yearning for 'the fierce joy of motherhood' and presents a sympathetic view of her plight. Head's deeply personal poems also could be said to suggest that Ruth had at some point been pregnant (<b>maybe</b> <b>more</b> than once) and perhaps even to term.|$|E

500|$|Bangalter and Homem-Christo have {{credited}} {{many sources}} that influenced their musical style. Bangalter recalled that the records motivated him to learn English {{as a second}} language, since he wanted to understand the lyrics.

500|$|Critic Jim DeRogatis {{describes}} Vedder's vocals as a [...] "Jim Morrison-like vocal growl." [...] Greg Prato of AllMusic said, [...] "With his hard-hitting {{and often}} confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also {{became one of}} the most copied lead singers in all of rock." [...] Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", [...] "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", [...] "World Wide Suicide"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, [...] "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's <b>maybe</b> <b>more</b> room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that." ...|$|E
