5|$|Australia {{competed in}} Pool D—along with Dominican Republic, Italy and Venezuela—in {{the first round}} at Cracker Jack Stadium in Orlando, Florida.

Italy is among the top nations in Europe and had access to Italian-American players under the eligibility rules for the tournament. Thus, Australia was considered the underdog in the pool.|$|E

X-Men finished 2000 as the seventh highest-grossing home release of the year with $141 million, with 78% being earned through sales.

5|$|The 1972 Winter Games, held in Sapporo, Japan, {{were the}} first to be hosted outside North America or Europe. The issue of professionalism became {{contentious}} during the Sapporo Games. Three days before the Games IOC president Avery Brundage threatened to bar a number of alpine skiers from competing because they participated in a ski camp at Mammoth Mountain in the United States. Brundage reasoned that the skiers had financially benefited from their status as athletes and were therefore no longer amateurs. Eventually only Austrian Karl Schranz, who earned <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> the other skiers, was not allowed to compete. Canada did not send teams to the 1972 or 1976 ice hockey tournaments in protest at not being able to use players from professional leagues. Francisco Fernández Ochoa became the first (and as of 2017 only) Spaniard to win a Winter Olympic gold medal; he triumphed in the slalom.|$|E
5|$|The {{advanced}} level of metallurgy in the area, coupled with its ease of access from the Continent, meant that Hengistbury Head became a significant Late-Iron Age port; trading worked metal of iron, silver, and bronze {{in return for}} figs, glass, tools and other goods. Armorican coins and pottery uncovered here show links to the Brittany peninsula. Amphorae used for the transportation of North Italian wine {{have been found in}} such quantities (<b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> other sites in the south of England put together), that {{it is clear that the}} Head was a main port of entry into the country. However, no similar amphorae have been unearthed in Armorica, hinting at a more direct trade route between Hengistbury Head and Italy. Most of these vessels date from before 50 B.C., while later styles are absent despite being common in other parts of Britain, indicating the wine trade seems to have declined at about the time Caesar began his Gaulish campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The only {{carnivore}} in the Moluccas is the Malayan civet (Musang), {{which he}} supposes {{has been introduced}} by accident as it is kept for its musk. The Celebes Babirusa is, oddly, found on Bouru, which he supposes it reached partly by swimming, citing Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology to confirm this ability. The other mammals are marsupial, so, he presumes, true natives. In contrast to the few mammals, {{there are at least}} 265 bird species, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>all</b> of Europe, which had 257, but of these just three groups – parrots, kingfishers and pigeons – make up nearly a third, compared to only a twentieth of the birds of India. Wallace suggests this is because they came from New Guinea, which has a similar lack of some groups, and adds that many New Guinea birds have not reached the Moluccas, implying that the islands have been isolated for a long time.|$|E
