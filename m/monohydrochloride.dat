40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{possibility}} of synthesizing 1, 8 -naphthyridines by the Doebner reaction {{has appeared in}} many reports. The method involves the introduction of electron releasing groups in the 6 -position of 2 -amino pyridine to activate the C- 3 position. Previously Lewis used 6 -methyl- 2 -amino pyridine with benzaldehyde and pyruvic acid, {{in an attempt to}} prepare a 1, 8 -naphthyridine. He did not obtain a 1, 8 -naphthyridine but an uncyclized product. He attributed his failure to produce a naphthyridine to the weak electron releasing power of the methyl group, which was unable to activate the C- 3 position. Nitidandhaprabhas found later that the uncyclized compound lost one molecule of water to give 1 (6 -methyl- 2 -pyridyl) - 5 -phenyl-pyrrolidine- 2, 3 -dione. Also he found that the use of 2, 6 -diaminopyridine in the Doebner reaction did produce a 1, 8 -naphthyridine, because of the strong electron releasing power of the amino group. The current work continued the investigation of the effect of electron releasing groups at position 6 in the 2 -aminopyridine ring on the formation of 1, 8 -naphthyridine. The result showed that 6 -hydroxy- 2 -aminopyridine was also effective in producing ring closure at C- 3 to form a 1, 8 -naphthyridine. The yield was less than that produced when 2, 6 -diamino pyridine was used as the starting material. A second method for the preparation of 1, 8 -naphthyridines was developed. Benzalpyruvic acid was prepared and allowed to react with the 6 -substituted 2 -aminopyridines. By this method the yield of 1, 8 -naphthyridines was increased. The effect of different aldehydes in producing 1, 8 -naphthyridines by the Doebner reaction was studied. O-methoxy benzaldehyde was used in the reaction in comparision with benzaldehyde. The use of O-methoxy benzaldehyde did produce a better yield. The compounds prepared were substituted 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 1, 8 -naphthyridine- 4 -carboxylic acid <b>monohydrochlorides.</b> The assigned structures were confirmed on the basis of carbon-hydrogen analysis and the evidence of ultraviolet spectra similar to the spectrum of 6 -bromo- 2 -(methyl amino-methyl) - 1, 2, dihydro 1, 8 -naphthyridine.

The facial and behavioral reactions of 13 cats to different concentrations of L-Proline and quinine <b>monohydrochloride</b> as well as mixtures with different concentrations of the two substances were assessed using a two-bottle preference test. The cats were videotaped during the tests and the frequency and duration of 50 different behaviors was analyzed in Noldus the Observer XT. The cats responded to tastes regarded as pleasant by having their eyes less than 50 % open for significantly longer periods of time compared to a water control. Tongue protrusions were also observed significantly more frequently when the cats sampled from a solution with a preferred taste compared to a water control. When encountering solutions of quinine <b>monohydrochloride</b> or mixtures containing quinine <b>monohydrochloride</b> the cats were observed to perform tongue protrusion gapes much more frequently compared to a water or L-Proline control. Even though the cats did not significantly differ in the number of times they licked at spouts containing the 50 mM L-Proline and 500 mM quinine <b>monohydrochloride</b> mixture compared to a 50 mM L-Proline, no masking effect could be confirmed as there was no increase in the acceptance of the mixture was observed.

40|$|Bicarbonaturic {{effect of}} lysine in the dog. The {{infusion}} of 55 µmoles/kg/min of L-lysine <b>monohydrochloride</b> increased mean fractional bicarbonate excretion (CHCO 3 /GFR) from 0. 01 to 0. 29. This massive bicarbonaturia {{was observed in}} the absence of any significant fall in GFR or kidney cortex ATP content. Kaliuresis and urinary PCO 2 also increased markedly while phosphaturia remained minimal. CHCO 3 /GFR reached 0. 52 during the infusion of 110 µLimoles/kg/min of L-lysine <b>monohydrochloride</b> and 0. 65 when carbonic anhydrase inhibition was superimposed. Bicarbonaturia remained minimal during the infusion of 55 µmoles/kg/ min of L-lysine dihydrochloride. However the same amount of isoelectric L-lysine and sodium L-lysinate increased CHCO 3 /GFR to 0. 68 and 0. 76, respectively. In dogs with ligated renal pedicles, a 1 : 1 relationship was observed between cellular entry of lysine and the combined shift of sodium and potassium from cell to extracellular fluid. Marked accumulation of lysine was observed in the kidney following the infusion of either L-lysine <b>monohydrochloride</b> or L-lysine dihydrochloride. This study demonstrates that lysine inhibits in the proximal tubule the fraction of bicarbonate reabsorption which is not mediated by carbonic anhydrase activity. This effect is best explained by trapping of hydrogen ions in the tubular cell following luminal and antiluminal entry of lysine in unionizedform. The possible role of lysine as a poorly reabsorbable cation is also recognized...|$|E

Eighteen pigs (initial BW: 11. 8 ± 0. 51 kg, Landrace x Large White x Duroc) were randomly allotted to two dietary treatments using a completely randomized design. Dietary treatments were corn-soybean meal-based diets supplemented with either L-lysine <b>monohydrochloride</b> (Treatment 1) or L-lysine sulfate (Treatment 2). Experimental diets were formulated to be fed in a 4 -phase diet series. The supplemental lysine sources were added to provide 0. 195, 0. 165, 0. 250 and 0. 189 % of total lysine in the pre-starter, starter, grower, and finisher diets, respectively. Four barrows (~ 60 days of age) from each treatment were used in a nitrogen balance trial. Six representative animals (~ 150 days of age) per treatment were slaughtered and evaluated for carcass characteristics. Replacing L-lysine <b>monohydrochloride</b> with L-lysine sulfate in pre-starter to finisher diets did not affect growth performance, nitrogen balance and carcass characteristics. Economic analysis showed that feed cost efficiency may be improved using L-lysine sulfate. Based on the prices of feed ingredients during the study, a PhP 0. 81 saving per kilogram gain in weight was attained when L-lysine sulfate was used which could be attributed to its lower price per kilogram.

40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} that {{critical}} binding of ethambutol to Mycobacterium smegmatis was both inhibited and reversed by ions. This apparent ion-susceptible characteristic suggested that ethambutol is held at critical sites by electrostatic bonds. Dissociation constant, pH, and ionic strength studies were designed to further characterize ethambutol binding. M. smegmatis was grown in Sauton synthetic liquid medium (pH 7. 4) under aerated conditions at 37 C. The pH or ionic strength of the medium was modified {{to meet the needs}} of particular experiments. Titration data revealed that ethambutol dihydrochloride has two apparent dissociation constants (pKa 1 = 6. 35, pKa 2 = 9. 35). Uptake experiments, in which pH was varied, showed that dihydrochloride and free base ethambutol were bound to a greater extent than the <b>monohydrochloride.</b> However, dihydrochloride and free base binding were not related to biological activity. Ethambutol exerted its maximal growth inhibitory effect at pH values near neutrality, where it exists primarily as the <b>monohydrochloride</b> and showed minimal binding. The increased ethambutol binding observed at pH 7. 4 in media of lowered ionic strength was consistent with growth studies showing a reduction in the minimal inhibitory growth concentration in such media. However, nonspecific as well as critical binding was enhanced at low ionic strength. We conclude that binding of ethambutol by M. smegmatis involves a heterogeneous group of drug binding sites, only one of which is directly related to biological activity. Although nothing is known about the ethambutol target site itself, critical binding of the drug seems to require the single positively charged <b>monohydrochloride</b> form. Both hydrogen bonds and ionic linkages are probably involved...|$|E

Of note, two of those patients suffered from diabetes (40 % of all diabetic patients in this cohort), a sub-cohort maybe especially prone to post-therapeutic hyperkalemia due to reduced sensitivity to endogenous insulin. An earlier study has already reported on this pathophysiologic mechanism [21]. In our study, no significant correlation between diabetes and incidence or severity of increases in potassium could be detected; however, this might be related to small sample sizes.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{essential}} tool in {{the study}} of crystallization is the saturation curve and metastable zone width, since the shape of the solubility curve defines the crystallization mode and the supersaturation conditions, which are the driving force of crystallization.

Globalization of the food industry in the 1990 ’s, in conjunction with the worldwide shipment of food created a need for the extension of shelf-life and enhanced maintenance of food quality (12). In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that each year, roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people) gets sick, 128, 000 are hospitalized, and 3, 000 die of foodborne diseases; this correlates to approximately 77. 7 billion in economic loss annually (17). Thus the demand for innovative techniques to reduce or eliminate the unintentional presence of microorganisms in food products has increased. Na-Lauroyl-L-arginine ethyl ester <b>monohydrochloride</b> (lauric arginate (LAE)) is a cationic surfactant possessing antimicrobial ability against the proliferation of several microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and yeasts (58). Composed of lauric acid, Larginine, and ethanol, LAE is active over a wide pH range (3 - 7), and the antimicrobial properties have been reported to be derived from its action on the cytoplasmic membranes of microorganisms (58). Although LAE is an ideal antimicrobial its usage in the food industry is limited due to its instability. LAE tends to precipitate from solutions at non-acid pH (pH 3 ̆e 4. 5) as well as in the presence of solutions with high ionic strength (4). Previous research has shown that the tendency for LAE to precipitate in aqueous solutions can be overcome by combining LAE with a non-ionic surfactant (Tween 20) to form mixed micelles (5).

30|$|The {{results of}} the present study {{indicate}} that the administration of high doses of cationic amino acids to mice produce a marked increase in potassium plasma levels. This is in agreement with previous observations that showed that in humans, the infusion of arginine <b>monohydrochloride,</b> a practice used to test pituitary function (Merimee et al. 1965, 1967), was associated with increases in plasma potassium concentration (Alberti et al. 1967; Massara et al. 1979). Similar increases have been reported in patients after the administration of l-arginine or l-lysine, used to prevent side effects induced by targeted radiolabelled peptide therapy in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours (Barone et al. 2004; Giovacchini et al. 2011). Moreover, whereas healthy individuals developed moderate hyperkalemia upon administration of arginine HCl, severe life-threatening hyperkalemia has been reported in patients with heart disease, renal failure or diabetes (Hertz and Richardson 1972; Bushinsky and Gennari 1978; Massara et al. 1981).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} Arg:Lys,Met source, {{and time of}} {{exposure}} to heat stress on growth and body protein accretion was tested in acutely heat-stressed (AHS) or chronically heat-stressed (CHS) broilers. Ross 308 1 -day-old chickens were raised under normal brooding condi-tions from 1 to 25 d of age and were then suddenly moved to 32 °C (AHS), whereas another group was kept at constant high temperatures throughout the grow-out period (32 °C; CHS). From 26 to 33 d of age, both groups were therefore at 32. 8 ± 1. 0 °C. Two rooms were used per environmental treatment. A basal diet deficient in TSAA was supplemented with L-Arg <b>monohydrochloride</b> to achieveArg:Lys ratios of 0. 95 and 1. 40. Dietswere supple-mentedwith either L-Met, 2 -hydroxy- 4 -(methylthio) buta-noic acid (HMB), or DL-Met (DLM) {{to a level of}} TSAA 5 % lower than requirements. Each Arg:Lys and Met sourc...|$|E
40|$|This single-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} study {{evaluated the}} tolerability and pharmacodynamic (PD) {{response of the}} first dose of the oral GPllb/llla receptor antagonist, SC- 54684 A (ethyl 3 S-[[4 -[[4 (amino-iminomethyl) phenyl]amino]-l, 4 -dioxobutyl]amino]- 4 -pentynoate, <b>monohydrochloride).</b> SC- 54684 A (SC) is the pro-drug of the active compound, SC- 54701 A. Six healthy male subjects received 50 mg of SC (free base) and 2 received placebo (PBO). Results of the inhibition to AOD (20 μM) induced platelet aggregation are shown below:Bleeding time increased a mean of 5. 6 fold at 4 hrs post-dose and returned to within normal limits at 8 hrs after dosing. No significant changes in lab values or bleeding complications occurred. Peak serum concentrations coincided with peak PD effects of inhibition of platelet aggregation. ConclusionSC- 54684 A has a rapid onset of potent inhibition of platelet aggregation that is sustained for up to 10 hours after dosin...|$|E
