40|$|The {{transition}} {{period of a}} cow is characterized by marked changes in metabolism as the cow prepares for parturition and lactogenesis. Aim {{of the present study}} was the evaluation of the effect of feeding dairy cows with <b>malt</b> <b>extracts</b> on milk production. Ten days before calving, 22 multiparous Holstein dairy cows were divided in two groups and received for four months the same base diet added with an experimental concentrate (1. 5 kg/cow/day) containing either corn starch and <b>malt</b> <b>extracts</b> (ME) or only corn starch (CS) as the main energy source. Dry matter intake was not influenced by treatment and averaged 21. 7 kg of DM/cow/day. The use of <b>malt</b> <b>extracts</b> determined a numerical increase of milk yield (+ 0. 7 kg/cow/day, i. e. + 2. 5 %) but this difference did not reach the significance level.

25|$|As this fungus {{does not}} form visible fruiting bodies, {{descriptions}} {{are based on}} macromorphological characteristics of fungal colonies growing on various standard agar media, and on microscopic characteristics. When grown on Czapek yeast autolysate (CYA) agar or yeast-extract sucrose (YES) agar, P. roqueforti colonies are typically 40mm in diameter, olive brown to dull green (dark green to black on the reverse side of the agar plate), with a velutinous texture. Grown on <b>malt</b> <b>extract</b> agar (MEA), colonies are 50mm in diameter, dull green in color (beige to greyish green on the reverse side), with arachnoid (with many spider-web-like fibers) colony margins. Another characteristic morphological feature of this species is its production of asexual spores in phialides with a distinctive brush-shaped configuration.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years of Prohibition, the new law was {{enforced}} in regions such as the rural South and western states, where it had popular support; however, in large urban cities and small industrial or mining towns, residents defied or ignored the law. The Ku Klux Klan was a major supporter of Prohibition; once it was passed they helped with its enforcement. For example, in 1923, Klansmen traded pistol shots with bootleggers, burned down roadhouses, and whipped liquor sellers, and anybody else who broke the moral code. The Prohibition was effective in reducing per-capita consumption, and consumption remained lower for a quarter-century after Prohibition had been repealed. Sale of alcoholic beverages remained illegal during Prohibition, but alcoholic drinks were still available. Large quantities of alcohol were smuggled into the United States from Canada, over land, by sea routes along both ocean coasts, and through the Great Lakes, and alcohol was diverted from the limited exceptions to the Volsted Act: medicinal and religious. While the federal government cracked down on alcohol consumption on land within the United States, it was a different story along the U.S. coastlines, where vessels outside the 3-mile limit were exempt. In addition, home brewing was popular during Prohibition. Malt and hops stores popped up across the country and some former breweries turned to selling <b>malt</b> <b>extract</b> syrup, ostensibly for baking and beverage purposes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the next}} step, brewers use {{a process called}} mashing to extract the sugars.

Modern beer mashing practices typically include high enough temperatures at mash-out to deactivate remaining enzymes, thus it is no longer [...] The liquid produced from this, wort, is then concentrated by using heat or a vacuum procedure to evaporate water from the mixture.

2500|$|<b>Malt</b> <b>extract</b> is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} brewing of beer. Its production begins by germinating barley grain in {{a process known as}} malting, [...] immersing barley in water to encourage the grain to sprout, then drying the barley to halt the progress when the sprouting begins. The drying step stops the sprouting, but the enzymes remain active due to the low temperatures used in base malt production. In one before-and-after comparison, malting decreased barley's extractable starch content by about 7% on a dry matter basis, and turned that portion into various other carbohydrates.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is a {{comparison}} of selected quality indicators of samples from single-flower honeys from {{the area of the}} Czech Republic and honeys from different retail chains. The theoretical part focuses on the characteristics of the individual kinds of honey and how different their composition is. There are described basic physical and chemical requirements for honey including sensory requirements which are specified in Regulation No. 76 / 2003 Code. The practical part contains a physically-chemical analysis according to the Harmonized methods of European Honey and a sensory evaluation of selected single-flower honeys (honeydew, acacia, lime, sunflower and rape). There were analysed twenty samples of honey from Czech beekeepers and fifteen samples of honey bought in different retail chains in the Czech Republic. Subsequently, these parameters were monitored - water content and acidity. Next step was a test for evidence of disruption by starchy sugar and <b>malt</b> <b>extracts.</b> Then, sensory requirements such as colour, smell, taste and consistence were evaluated. The conclusion of the comparison of honey samples indicates that individual honey samples differed the most in the taste and smell criteria and in addition the samples were often disrupted by starchy sugar and <b>malt</b> <b>extracts.</b> The samples collected from the beekeepers from the area of the Czech Republic complied with Regulation No. 76 / 2003 Code.
