500|$|Two fiddles, a bow, a still shawm or doucaine, three three-hole pipes, and a tabor drum with a {{drumstick}} {{were found}} throughout the wreck. These would {{have been used for}} the personal enjoyment of the crew and to provide a rhythm to work on the rigging and turning the capstans on the upper decks. The tabor drum is the earliest known example of its kind and the drumstick of a previously unknown design. The tabor pipes are considerably longer than any known examples from the period. Their discovery proved that contemporary illustrations, previously viewed with some suspicion, were in fact accurate depictions of the instruments. Before the discovery of the Mary Rose shawm, an early predecessor to the oboe, instrument historians had been puzzled by reference to [...] "still shawms", or [...] "soft" [...] shawms, that were said to have a sound that was less shrill than earlier shawms. The still shawm disappeared from the musical scene some time in the 16th century, and the instrument found on the Mary Rose is the only surviving example. A reproduction has been made and played. Combined with a pipe and tabor, it provides a [...] "very effective bass part" [...] that would have produced [...] "rich and full sound, which would have provided excellent <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> on board ship". Only a few other fiddle-type instruments from the 16th century exist, but none of them of the type found on the Mary Rose. Reproductions of both fiddles have been made, though less is known of their design than the shawm since the neck and strings were missing.|$|E

The audience for both blues and jazz split, and the border between blues and jazz became more defined.|$|E
2500|$|The Last Waltz concert event {{took place}} on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976. Approximately five {{thousand}} people were in attendance. The event began at 5 pm, beginning with the audience members being served a full traditional Thanksgiving meal at candlelit tables, with a vegetarian table serving an alternate menu as an option. The Berkeley Promenade Orchestra played waltz <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> afterwards. The tables were cleared and moved at 8 pm. [...] At 9 pm, The Band played songs for an hour, beginning with [...] "Up On Cripple Creek". Just after 10 pm, Robertson introduced Ronnie Hawkins, the first onstage guest, with a succession of guest stars appearing with the group until just after midnight.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "disc jockey" [...] was ostensibly {{coined by}} radio gossip {{commentator}} Walter Winchell in 1935, and the phrase {{first appeared in}} print in a 1941 Variety magazine, used to describe radio personalities who introduced phonograph records on the air. Playing recorded <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> and parties rose with the mass marketing of home phonographs in the late 19th century, and Jimmy Savile is credited with hosting the first live DJ dance party in 1943. Savile is also credited as the first to present music in continuous play by using multiple turntables. In 1947, the Whiskey A Go-Go opened in Paris as the first discoteque. In the 1960s, Rudy Bozak began making the first DJ mixers, mixing consoles specialized for DJing.|$|E
2500|$|Live {{music is}} still very popular with lindy hoppers, and many dancers have formed close {{relationships}} with local artists in their own communities. Newer artists such as George Gee (bandleader) and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra have proved particularly popular with lindy hoppers. Despite this relationship with live music, recorded music, DJed by dancers, {{is the most popular}} musical medium for lindy hoppers today. DJing itself has assumed great significance in lindy hop culture, with dancers and DJs alike hotly debating which types of music should be played, and when. The SwingDJs discussion board [...] is a clear example of an online community within the lindy hop community which has developed solely around the playing of <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> lindy hop.|$|E

Just four months later, however, City Manager H.C. McClintock closed the Anchorage, {{referred to as a}} “soft drink and dancing place,” for a week as a penalty for a liquor party. Referred to variously as the Anchorage Bar & Grill, it was located here at least through 1949.|$|E

2500|$|Australian Jazz Band {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom {{in early}} 1948 and Bell started the Leicester Square Jazz Club, playing <b>music</b> specifically <b>for</b> <b>dancing,</b> which {{continued into the}} 1950s. They played songs outside the standard jazz repertoire and, with their encouragement of dancing, caused concern to local jazz enthusiasts, but were popular with patrons.

50|$|Before the war, BBC radio had {{had quite}} an elitist {{approach}} to popular music. Jazz, swing or big band <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> was {{relegated to a}} few late night spots. During the war, the BBC was obliged to adapt, if only because British soldiers were listening to German radio stations to hear their dance music favourites.|$|E
50|$|Big Bands {{continued}} to {{flourish in the}} 1950s, touring, selling records, and appearing on radio and the new medium of television. As the decade wore on, however, many mostly younger listeners preferred to hear the simpler and (some say) noisier music given the name Rock 'n' Roll, and this music {{became known as the}} most popular <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dancing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many of her songs, {{including}} “Sex-o-matic” and “Injeção”, blatantly discuss sex {{and woman}} in a way some other funk carioca performers, like Tati Quebra Barraco, consider offensive. Tigrona maintains that funk <b>music</b> is <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> and that people find her double-entendres entertaining. Despite the criticism, Tigrona’s music is gradually becoming more popular to a wider audience, even beyond the streets of Brazil: she makes a guest appearance on British dance producer Greymatter's 2010 album, with the song [...] "Eu Fomo".|$|R
50|$|Bhangra {{describes}} dance-oriented {{popular music}} with Punjabi rhythms, developed since the 1980s. The name refers {{to one of}} the traditional and folkloric Punjabi dances.

50|$|Statius Muller {{especially}} composed <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dancing,</b> {{in settings}} for piano, not only waltzes and mazurkas, but also Caribbean dances {{such as the}} tumba derived originally from the Congo. Tropical, syncopated rhythms are clearly apparent in virtually all of his works. The works are, however, no longer intended to dance to, but are stylized and refined into concert music.|$|E
50|$|During the '60s and '70s the {{interest}} in different methods to induce altered states {{without the use of}} drugs were rising. Some of the induced states by rhythmic light and sound combinations were even described as psychedelic-like, while these claims lack adequate measurements for their similarity. In this line, numerous nightclubs began using strobes to maximize the effects of the <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dancing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{one of the}} {{purposes}} of the bagpipe was to provide <b>music</b> <b>for</b> <b>dancing.</b> This has declined with the growth of dance bands, recordings, and the decline of traditional dance. In turn, this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition, and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is no longer suitable for use as dance music.|$|E
50|$|The name Amorroma {{consists}} of the two words Amor and Roma. For the Cathars these words have a contradiction. Amorroma uses this theme <b>for</b> her <b>music</b> to show all different feelings with form part of human being. The <b>music</b> is suitable <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> and to listen to. Amorroma gives concerts at festivals, schools and folk-dance balls.|$|R
50|$|The more open-fingered {{style was}} very {{successful}} <b>for</b> Pigg's <b>music,</b> allowing him a greater range of expression than a more traditional style. However, his tempos were ferociously fast and somewhat erratic, making his <b>music</b> unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>dancing,</b> and he was notoriously hard to accompany. Unfortunately, he was suffering badly from worsening ill-health throughout the 1950s and 1960s, when all the recordings were made, and it is certain his playing must have suffered. However, {{the best of his}} recordings have a wildness and passion which is both inspiring and wholly distinctive.|$|R
