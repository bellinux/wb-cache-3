The influence of polypropylene and <b>metallic</b> <b>fibres</b> (Fibraflex) has been studied in different proportioning to reduce shrinkage and cracking. The efficiency of polypropylene and <b>metallic</b> <b>fibres</b> to reduce restrained shrinkage cracking is evaluated by using a ring mortar cast around a stiff steel ring.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} flexural properties of metallic-hybrid-fibre-reinforced concrete. Two types of fibres were used: amorphous metallic straight fibre characterised as non-slipping fibre {{due to its}} rough surface and large specific surface area, and carbon steel hook-ended fibre characterised as slipping fibre. Three types of concrete: control, single-fibre-reinforced and hybrid-fibre-reinforced were prepared. The fibre was incorporated at 20 and 40 kg/m 3 for single-fibre-reinforced concrete, and at 20, 40 and 80 kg/m 3 for hybrid-fibre-reinforced concrete. The flexural properties were studied using three-point bending tests. From the experimental results obtained with fibre-reinforced concrete containing single fibre, addition of high-bonding amorphous <b>metallic</b> <b>fibre</b> delays the formation of micro-cracks and results in high peak load whereas carbon steel hook-ended fibre contributes towards the flexural toughness (energy absorption capacity) by bridging macro-cracks in the post peak region. The test results on hybrid-fibre-reinforced concrete show that the two metallic fibres when used in hybrid form result in superior performance compared to their single-fibre- reinforced counterparts. Superior performance {{as a result of}} fibre hybridisation is interpreted as a positive synergetic effect between the fibres.

Additionally, the macrofibres were mixed with aggregates in order to study how the abrasion affects their mechanical properties.

However, optimisation of the material and the structure is subject to several conflicting requirements. A high internal surface area favours rapid heat exchange with the fluid, but {{may be associated with}} a relatively low permeability, inhibiting fluid flow. This introduces uncertainty about the optimal scale of the porosity. There are relatively complex interplays between performance, exchanger size and pore (fibre network) architecture. It is difficult to just use experimental data as a guide, and modelling approaches should be explored. Finding the optimal heat exchanger structure is also complex and challenging due to various constrains. Numerical model is used in the paper to find the dependence of heat exchange performance on fibre network architecture and operating conditions. The paper discusses how the performance of a heat exchanger is affected by its dimensions, heat exchange at fibre surfaces, thermal properties of fibre core, operating temperatures, phenomena on exchanger walls, the core permeability and pumping system characteristics. A simplified analytical model is presented as well, which allows qualitative examinations. The validity of both models is assessed by comparison with experimental data...|$|E

The permeability and orientation dependent thermal conductivity of fibrous materials manufactured from copper and 446 steel are experimentally measured. The dependence of permeability on fibre volume fraction is described using the Carman Kozeny equation. An analytical model is proposed to describe thermal conductivity in short fibre porous materials, taking the effect of fibre orientation and fibre-fibre contact area into account. An analytical model for heat exchange in the steady state is proposed, and validated by comparison with experiment. Consideration is given to the effect of material and system parameters on heat exchange rate.

Mechanical properties at small deformation (e. g. Young’s modulus and 0. 2 % offset yield stress) and the effective thermal conductivity of these materials are studied. These properties are determined {{with the help of a}} novel method which is capable of simulating the real structure of the material. In this, the real sample is scanned and the micro-computed tomography images obtained are transformed into a computational model by converting the 2 D images into a 3 D structure and generating a volume mesh. Then the simulation model is defined by assigning material properties, boundary conditions and the appropriate load case. The advantage of this simulation method over experimental testing is the repetition of calculations and therefore a precise characterisation of the complex material structure is possible by investigating different spatial directions on the same sample. The accuracy of the simulation models is verified with a numerical convergence analysis and experimental testing.

40|$|AbstractAn {{accurate}} one-dimensional {{analytical model}} for simulating the pullout process {{of synthetic fibres}} from a cement matrix is proposed {{in the present study}} in order to shed light on the ductile behavior exhibited by Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) members. The proposed model is able to predict the non linear relation between the applied tensile load and the fibre displacement and is particularly suitable for synthetic fibres that may exhibit large axial elongation and slip-hardening interface behavior. Indeed, the balance conditions between the axial load and the shear stress arising on the fibre surface in frictional contact with the matrix are imposed on the deformed configuration. The frictional bond strength is assumed to increase with slippage distance {{as a consequence of the}} increasing abrasion of the fibre surface occurring for polymeric fibres that have been subjected to surface treatments. The model is also suitable for <b>metallic</b> <b>fibres</b> if constant friction or slip-softening interface behavior is assumed instead.

The ensuing spalling phenomena can be prevented by adding polymeric fibres to the mix, while material toughness can be improved – at any temperature – by adding <b>metallic</b> <b>fibres.</b> However, concrete mechanical behaviour depends on the thermal field, which is strictly related to the type of fire and to the thermal properties of the material.

Furthermore, to maximise the benefits coming from the use of better materials, a parallel rethinking of some aspects of structural analysis is needed.

The efficacy of this technology, and hence the possibility of reliably implementing it in the production processes of a pre-cast factory, clearly depends on the possibility of achieving a homogenous and uniform distribution of fibres, reducing the influence of castings and vibration.
