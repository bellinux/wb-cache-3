We test whether banks bid at lower rates in MROs before the LTRO and at higher rates after the LTRO, compared to other operations. We offer two main findings. First, we find that in general banks bid in the MRO before the LTRO at lower rates as compared to 2 ̆ 01 cother 2 ̆ 01 d MROs. Moreover, MRO participants which also bid in the following LTRO bid at even lower rates, compared to peers not bidding in the LTRO. These findings {{support the hypothesis that}} banks view obtaining liquidity from the two operations as substitutes and bid strategically. Second, we find that banks generally bid more aggressively in the MRO after the LTRO. Even more striking, banks which participated also in the LTRO preceding the MRO bid at substantially higher rates. These findings reflect that 2 ̆ 01 cshort 2 ̆ 01 d banks, with potentially large net liquidity needs after the LTRO bid more aggressively. Other counterparties with liquidity needs in that particular operation are forced, as a best response reaction, to bid also at higher rates.

40|$|In the Eurosystem, banks’ {{interest}} rate expectations {{should no longer}} {{have resulted in a}} non-zero tender spread, the difference between marginal and minimum price for liquidity, when the ECB reformed its op-erational framework for monetary policy implementation in March 2004 so that the policy rates remain constant within reserves maintenance periods. Yet, the tender spread was wider in 2005 than in any single year after 2000, when the ECB switched from fixed to variable rate tenders. Parts of the relevant literature have argued that because of the ECB’s asymmetric preferences over deviations of the market rates up and down from the policy rate, the shortest euro {{interest rate}}s persistently exceed the policy rate This paper argues, however, that when the central bank applies a quantity oriented liquidity policy, a positive tender spread may result from money market inefficiencies and banks’ risk aversion even if the central bank preferences are symmetric and the markets do not anticipate any changes in the policy rates. In such a case, {{the driving force behind the}} tender spread is banks’ uncertainty about their individual allotments at the marginal rate for the Eurosystem <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> (<b>MROs).</b> Furthermore, the allotment uncertainty is shown to be significantly related to the amount of liquidity supplied in each operation. Hence, the expansion in the MRO volumes experienced since 2002 may have had a major contribution to the emergence and observed growth of the tender spread. <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> operations; liquidity; tender spread; allotments...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few months, euro area money markets {{have been exposed to}} intense tensions. On 8 August, {{overnight}} interest rates rose to very high levels which required interventions of the Eurosystem in order to stabilise short-term money market interest rates around the target level, i. e. the minimum bid rate on the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations.</b> The article explains how the Eurosystem steers very short-term money market interest rates by adjusting its supply of liquidity on the money market. It is shown how the Eurosystem’s liquidity management stabilised short-term money market interest rates around the minimum bid rate on the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> {{in the first half of}} 2007. Although short-term money market interest rates were more volatile during the period of financial turmoil, the Eurosystem nevertheless managed to safeguard the signalling function of the short-term money market interest rates by applying its operational framework in a flexible way. More specifically, the Eurosystem decided to allot more liquidity than the benchmark amount in the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> early within the maintenance period. It was also decided to conduct fine-tuning operations on a more frequent basis in order to stabilise short-term rates. Finally, the Eurosystem also decided to increase the share of longer-term <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> in the total amount of outstanding open market operations. Despite the relative success in stabilising very short-term money market interest rates, longer maturity unsecured interest rates – for instance the 3 -month Euribor – increased significantly during the period of financial turmoil.

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognised that the operational {{framework for the}} monetary policy of the Eurosystem 1 has been functioning well since {{the launch of the}} euro in 1999. There has been little need to conduct fine-tuning operations, because of the averaging provision of the minimum reserve system {{and the quality of the}} Eurosystem’s liquidity forecasts. Also, credit institutions have had only limited recourse to the standing facilities, which shows that the money market has been working efficiently. And the small and fairly stable spread between the ECB’s fixed or minimum bid rate on its <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations</b> and the short-term money market rates displays the ability of the ECB to influence short-term interest rates. Despite th{{is generally}} positive assessment, some possible measures have been examined with the aim of further improving the efficiency of the operational framework. There are three changes to be considered: (1) changing the timing of the reserve maintenance period, so that it would always start on the settlement day of the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operation</b> following the Governing Council meeting at which the discussion of monetary policy is pre-scheduled, so that – as a rule – the implementation of changes to the standing facility rates would be aligned with the start of a new reserve maintenance period...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a unique}} data set, I study whether {{structural}} bank characteristics {{can help to}} explain a bank's propensity to take recourse to the ECB's marginal lending facility (MLF).

A bank with volatile reserve holdings, a lower average reserve fulfillment and a more aggressive bidding behavior in the <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations,</b> is {{significantly more likely to}} revert to the MLF.

40|$|The {{fixed rate}} tender {{is one of the}} main {{procedures}} used by central banks in the implementation of their monetary policies. While academic research has largely dismissed the procedure owing to its tendency to encourage overbidding, central banks such as the ECB and the Bank of England have continued using it. We investigate this apparent conflict by considering an auction-theoretic setting with private information about declining marginal valuations. Since overbidding entails exposure risk, an equilibrium may exist even if bids are costless and the intended volume is pre-announced. In fact, the allotment quota may be strictly below one with certainty. Also with adaptive expectations, overbidding need not escalate. However, the resulting allocation is typically ineffi cient.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{interconnectedness}} of banks and the price they pay for liquidity. We assess how the concentration of credit relationships and the position of a bank in the network topology of the system influence the bank's ability to meet its liquidity demand.

We match these data with the bids placed by the individual banks in the European Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo auctions. The bids measure each bank's willingness to pay for liquidity since they had variable rate tenders with a 'pay-your-bid' price. Controlling for bank characteristics and the daily fulfillment of reserve requirements, we find that banks with a more diversified borrowing structure in the interbank market bid significantly less aggressively and pay a lower price for liquidity in the ECB's <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operations.</b> These findings suggest that incentives to diversify bank liquidity risk dominate the benefits of private information.

More specifically, this paper studies the role of heterogeneity in the population of banks participating on this market, {{and the influence of}} the institutional framework and market organizational aspects of the overnight deposit market. A first empirical assessment of the functioning of this market is based on the probability of informed trade which measures the ability of traders (banks) to interpret signals on the expected evolution of the overnight rate. This indicator is estimated on real-time data publicly available to market participants. Results show that between 2000 and 2004 a heterogeneous learning process of market mechanisms within participants could be observed. From 2005 onwards, however, heterogeneity in the learning process sharply decreased. Moreover, the empirical evidence show that the March 2004 changes in Eurosystem's operational framework have modified the informational patterns of order flow in the euro area money market: informed trades became even more predominant between the last <b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operation</b> {{and the end of the}} reserves maintenance period than they were before March 2004.

In accordance with the averaging provision mechanism, minimum reserves during the maintenance period in Italy, where the interbankmarket is electronic-based, are taken as indicators of efficiency in this market. On the evidence of the data, it seems that Italian banks can reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining minimum reserves, also performing intertemporal arbitrages between theinterbank market and their reserve accounts.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of Eurosystem monetary {{policy is to}} maintain price stability, defined as an annual increase in the HICP below two percent.

Therefore, Eurosystem monetary policy has to be guided by inflation forecasts about two years ahead.

40|$|A {{sequence}} of crises - {{the global financial}} crisis in 2008, the "Great Recession" in 2009 and the subsequent Euro crisis - constituted a major challenge for policy makers. After the fiscal policy had used up its powder in fighting the 2009 recession, monetary policy remained the only expansionary player in the policy arena. The ECB reacted to the crises with applying conventional (interest rate) and unconventional (qualitative easing) measures, however, with a considerable delay to the US Fed. The interest (<b>main</b> <b>refinancing</b> <b>operation)</b> rate was set to zero in September 2014 (the Fed already in December 2008) and the proper QE programme started not until March 2015 (the Fed shortly after the Lehman brothers crash). In evaluating the crisis management of the ECB one must state a clear failure in reaching its own medium term inflation target of 2 percent. However, it was successful in bringing down interest rates for government bonds after Draghi's famous "whatever it takes" speech in July 2012 and the following announcement of the outright monetary transactions programme.
