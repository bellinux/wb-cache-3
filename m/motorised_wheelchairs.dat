40|$|INTRODUCTION: The use of {{multi-sensor}} devices, which integrate accelerometry {{and physiological}} signals to predict PAEE, is widespread in able-bodied humans. However, {{the validity of}} such devices remains to be established in wheelchair users. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the error of a multi-sensor physical activity monitor to predict PAEE in wheelchair users and to assess the efficacy of individual heart rate calibration. METHODS: Seventeen manual wheelchair users (36 ± 10 yrs, 72 ± 11 kg) completed an activity of daily living and wheelchair propulsion at various velocities and gradients on a <b>motorised</b> <b>wheelchair</b> treadmill. Participants wore a combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor (ActiheartTM). Heart rate was also monitored during an incremental arm crank ergometer test to permit retrospective individual calibration of the ActiheartTM for the activity protocol. Linear regression analysis was conducted between criterion (indirect calorimetry) and estimated PAEE from the ActiheartTM using manufacturers proprietary algorithms or individual calibration. Subsequent error statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Predicted PAEE was significantly (p< 0. 01) associated with criterion PAEE (manufacturer algorithm; r= 0. 76 and individual calibration; r= 0. 95, Figure 1). Average PAEE estimation error for all activities was 14. 6 ± 63. 2 % and - 10. 1 ± 20. 7 % using the manufacturer algorithm and individual calibration, respectively. Absolute PAEE estimation errors using the manufacturer algorithm varied from 42. 4 to 66. 3 % and from 10. 4 to 43. 1 % using individual calibration. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: The error associated with predicting PAEE in manual wheelchair users, using a multi-sensor device, is improved using an individual heart rate calibration. The inter-individual variance in cardiovascular response to exercise is high among this population. Therefore, we advocate the importance of using individual calibration of multi-sensor devices to predict PAEE in manual wheelchair users...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:To {{assess the}} {{validity}} of two accelerometer devices, at two different anatomical locations, for the prediction of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) in manual wheelchair users (MWUs). MethodsSeventeen MWUs (36 ± 10 yrs, 72 ± 11 kg) completed ten activities; resting, folding clothes, propulsion on a 1 % gradient (3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 km·hr- 1) and propulsion at 4 km·hr- 1 (with an additional 8 % body mass, 2 % and 3 % gradient) on a <b>motorised</b> <b>wheelchair</b> treadmill. GT 3 X+ and GENEActiv accelerometers were worn on the right wrist (W) and upper arm (UA). Linear regression analysis was conducted between outputs from each accelerometer and criterion PAEE, measured using indirect calorimetry. Subsequent error statistics were calculated for the derived regression equations for all four device/location combinations, using a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis. ResultsAccelerometer outputs at each anatomical location were significantly (p <. 01) associated with PAEE (GT 3 X+-UA; r = 0. 68 and GT 3 X+-W; r = 0. 82. GENEActiv-UA; r = 0. 87 and GENEActiv-W; r = 0. 88). Mean ± SD PAEE estimation errors for all activities combined were 15 ± 45 %, 14 ± 50 %, 3 ± 25 % and 4 ± 26 % for GT 3 X+-UA, GT 3 X+-W, GENEActiv-UA and GENEActiv-W, respectively. Absolute PAEE estimation errors for devices varied, 19 to 66 % for GT 3 X+-UA, 17 to 122 % for GT 3 X+-W, 15 to 26 % for GENEActiv-UA and from 17. 0 to 32 % for the GENEActiv-W. ConclusionThe {{results indicate that the}} GENEActiv device worn on either the upper arm or wrist provides the most valid prediction of PAEE in MWUs. Variation in error statistics between the two devices is a result of inherent differences in internal components, on-board filtering processes and outputs of each device...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{assess the}} error in {{predicting}} physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), using a multi-sensor device, in wheelchair users {{and to examine}} the efficacy of using an individual heart rate calibration method. Methods Fifteen manual wheelchair users (36 ± 10 years, 72 ± 11 kg) completed ten activities: resting, folding clothes, wheelchair propulsion on a 1 % gradient (3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 km·hr- 1) and propulsion at 4 km·hr- 1 (with an additional 8 % of body mass, 2 % and 3 % gradient) on a <b>motorised</b> <b>wheelchair</b> treadmill. Criterion PAEE was measured using a computerised indirect calorimetry system. Participants wore a combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor (ActiheartTM). Participants also performed an incremental arm crank ergometry test to exhaustion which permitted retrospective individual calibration of the ActiheartTM for the activity protocol. Linear regression analysis was conducted between criterion (indirect calorimetry) and estimated PAEE from the ActiheartTM using manufacturer’s proprietary algorithms (group calibration; GC) or individual heart rate calibration (IC). Bland-Altman plots were used and mean absolute error calculated to assess the agreement between criterion values and estimated PAEE. Results Predicted PAEE was significantly (p< 0. 01) correlated with criterion PAEE (GC; r= 0. 76 and IC; r= 0. 95). The absolute bias ± 95 % limits of agreement were 0. 51 ± 3. 75 kcal·min- 1 and - 0. 22 ± 0. 96 kcal·min- 1 for GC and IC, respectively. Mean absolute errors across the activity protocol were 51. 4 ± 38. 9 % using GC and 16. 8 ± 15. 8 % using IC. Summary PAEE can be accurately and precisely estimated using a combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor device, with integration of an individual heart rate calibration. Inter-individual variance in cardiovascular function and response to exercise is high in this population. Therefore, in manual wheelchair users, we advocate {{the use of an}} individual heart rate calibration when using the ActiheartTM to predict PAEE...|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of the impact of}} physical activity on the health of manual wheelchair users (MWUs) could be improved with the development of an accurate and unobtrusive monitoring tool. PURPOSE: (i) to identify the most appropriate anatomical location and accelerometer-based device to predict physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) in MWUs and (ii) to develop and test associated regression equations to predict PAEE. METHODS: Seventeen manual wheelchair users (36 ± 10 yrs, 72 ± 11 kg) completed ten activities; resting, folding clothes, propulsion on a 1 % gradient (3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 km. hr- 1) and propulsion at 4 km. hr- 1 (with an additional 8 % body mass, 2 % and 3 % gradient) on a <b>motorised</b> <b>wheelchair</b> treadmill. GT 3 X+ and GENEA accelerometers were worn on the right wrist and upper arm. Linear regression analysis was conducted between outputs from each accelerometer and criterion PAEE, measured using indirect calorimetry. Subsequent error statistics were calculated for the developed regression equations for devices at the wrist using a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis. RESULTS: Accelerometer outputs at each anatomical location were significantly (p <. 01) associated with PAEE (Upper arm, GT 3 X+; r = 0. 68 and GENEA r = 0. 87. Wrist, GT 3 X+; r = 0. 82 and GENEA; r = 0. 88). Average PAEE estimation error for all activities using new regression equations at the wrist was 13. 8 ± 49. 6 % and 3. 8 ± 25. 7 % for GT 3 X+ and GENEA, respectively. Absolute PAEE estimation errors for devices worn on the wrist varied from 17. 1 to 122. 0 % for the GT 3 X+ and from 16. 5 to 32. 1 % for the GENEA. The larger overall error associated with the GT 3 X+ worn on the wrist was mostly accounted for by a 1. 2 Kcal. min- 1 over-prediction of PAEE during the folding clothes activity. CONCLUSION: Of the two accelerometers and anatomical locations considered in this study, the results indicate that the GENEA worn on the wrist provides the most valid prediction of PAEE in MWUs. Variation in error statistics between the two devices is thought to be associated with inherent differences in internal components and on-board filtering processes of each device. The GT 3 X+ when worn on the wrist appears to lack sensitivity to accurately quantify the PAEE during low intensity activities, with low frequency components, which could lead to erroneous PAEE measurement during free-living monitoring...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{in great}} detail the design and testing of a gesture {{controller}} for a motorised wheelchair. For some, <b>motorised</b> <b>wheelchairs</b> are part of their everyday life. Those individuals who depend on their motorised wheelchair do so for a vast range of reasons; therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that modifying and improving upon the standard joystick controller for a motorised wheelchair can benefit a person’s way of life significantly. The design of the gesture controller is heavily based around the user’s needs so as to benefit them and compliment their strengths to give them more control. For individuals with limited movement and dexterity, the user interface, system responsiveness, ergonomics and safety were considered when engineering a system that is intended for people to use. A device capable of recognising a hand gesture was carefully chosen. The technology that is readily available for this application is relatively new and not extensively documented. The LEAP motion sensor was chosen as the hand gesture recognition device to be the controller for a wheelchair. This device has hand recognition software but the device’s software lacks the predictability and accuracy required for a motorised wheelchair controller. Through testing, the controller accuracy improved. Although this controller is adequate for a laboratory environment, further testing and development will be required for this alternative wheelchair controller to evolve into a commercial product. The gesture triggered controller was designed around the capabilities of the developer’s hand; but the method outlined in this paper is transferable to any individual hand size and more importantly the limitations of their hand gestures. The outcome of this thesis is a customised, non-invasive hand gesture controller for a motorised wheelchair that is able to be fully tailored to a person’s capability without losing it responsiveness or accuracy...|$|E
40|$|While {{the active}} dynamic {{stability}} of automobiles has {{increased over the}} past 17 years there have been very few similar advances made with electrically powered wheelchairs. This lack of improvement {{has led to a}} long standing acceptance of less-than-optimal stability and control of these wheelchairs. Accidents due to loss of stability are well documented. Hence, the healthcare industry has made several efforts for improved control of electric powered wheelchairs (EPWs) to provide enhanced comfort, safety and manoeuvrability at a lower cost. In response, an area of stability control was identified that could benefit from a feedback control system using solid state sensors. To design an effective closed–loop feedback controller with optimal performance to overcome instabilities, an accurate model of wheelchair dynamics needed to be created. Such a model can be employed to test various controllers quickly and repeatedly, without the difficulties of physically setting a wheelchair up for each test. This task was one central goal of this research. A wireless test-bed of a front wheel drive (FWD) wheelchair was also developed to validate a dynamic wheelchair model. It integrates sensors, a data control system, an embedded controller, and the motorised mechanical system. The wireless communication ensures the integrity of sensor data collected and control signals sent. The test-bed developed not only facilitates the development of feedback controllers of <b>motorised</b> <b>wheelchairs,</b> but the collected data {{can also be used to}} confirm theories of causes of dynamic instabilities. The prototype test-bed performed the required tasks to satisfaction as defined by the sponsor. Data collected from live tests in which the test-bed followed set patterns, was processed and analysed. The patterns were designed to induce instability. The analysis revealed that an occupied wheelchair is more stable than an unoccupied wheelchair, disproving an initial instability theory proposed in this research. However, a proximal theory explaining over-steer is confirmed. Two models of the FWD test-bed were created. First, a dynamic model inherited from prior research, based on equations of motion was tested and enhanced based on measured data. However, even with alterations to correct parameter values and variables in the equations, a complete model validation was not possible. Second, a kinematic model was created with a factor to compensate for dynamics not normally accounted in kinematic models. The kinematic model was partially validated versus the measured data. Although, still highly accurate, there is room for improvement in this model. Both models contained a sub-system drive motor model, to account for input forces to the FWD wheelchair system model, which is fully validated...|$|E
40|$|Many have {{suggested}} that given the right environment, young people’s learning will developed at a faster rate. Archambault (2002) suggests that this is no different for young disabled people. With the appropriate computer interface, {{it is possible for}} disabled children to "regain trust in their capacity to learn, to think, to communicate, and finally to improve their own self image" (2002, p 171). They add that the use of computers will also allow these children "the feeling of appurtenance to the same world: adults and other children use computers" (2002, p 171). Not only do other children use computers, but also they play computer games. They also drive cars and fly planes, something that many disabled children {{will never be able to}} do – at least not in the real world. In a press article released by Microsoft, Russ Holland, the program director for the Alliance for Technology Access, suggests that simulated sports games are the most popular game for people with disabilities. He suggests that for children with disabilities "they may not be able to get down in the sandbox, but if we can simulate the sandbox in a game, they can have some of those same experiences" (Microsoft, 2000). He goes on to say that games are the easiest way to teach computer skills, however for the participants in this study, it was not about learning computer skills. These students enjoyed car simulators because it was the nearest that they will ever come to driving a real car. They believed it would help them learn control of their <b>motorised</b> <b>wheelchairs.</b> It also appeared to improve their self-image - they were doing something that the rest of us take for granted. Most of the participants interviewed for this research will never drive a car nor fly a plane, hopefully will never be in a street fight, and will almost certainly never be part of an elite anti-terrorist squad. However, in the three dimensional virtual world of computer games, they can do exactly that. Manly people, including the teachers and staff of the centre involved in this study, view computer games as mindless entertainment. But to these students, computer games provide an opportunity to experience what life may have been like if they did not suffer from cerebral palsy. Unlike most computer games designed for the personal computer, Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation games allow up to four players in the one game, on the same screen – the perfect multi-player environment for these students. However, Xbox and Playstation controllers are designed to be used with two hands, and at least normal dexterity with each hand, something cerebral palsy sufferers often do not have. This paper highlights many of the issues surrounding computer games and disabled children. It suggests areas on further study and opportunities for developments in this area. The also details the ongoing research with Cerebral Palsy students using computer games that help them "feel like real people"...|$|E
