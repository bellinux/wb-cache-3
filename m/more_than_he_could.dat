5|$|The next USEE {{match at}} Leeds Holbeck {{followed}} the second Gentlemen v Players fixture and began on Thursday, 11 July. The opposition had 18 players and included the Yorkshire batsman Louis Hall, the lay preacher who was famously the sole teetotaller in the Yorkshire team at that time. Besides Grace himself, other noted {{players in the}} USEE team were Fred Grace, Billy Midwinter, Henry Charlwood and James Southerton. Grace took 20 wickets in the match and, batting at number six (he was habitually an opening batsman despite his status as an all-rounder), scored 22 and 73. The USEE won by 193 runs. The railways served Grace well in July and he was immediately away north to Newcastle upon Tyne for the next engagement against Eighteen of Newcastle upon Tyne, starting on Monday 15 July. The Newcastle team included Dick Barlow, Alex Watson and Arnold Fothergill so Grace may have bitten off <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> chew. Fothergill dismissed him for 5 in the first innings after Newcastle had made a sizeable 251 (Barlow 42). The USEE were humiliatingly bowled out for 66 and had to follow on. Grace could only score 14 in a second innings total of 116 and Newcastle won the match in two days by an innings and 69 runs.|$|E
25|$|Sir Alan soon told Ruth {{she was in}} {{no danger}} of being fired and instead merely asked for her opinion on who should go, to which she stated that, despite being disorganised and taking on <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> handled, Syed's passion was inspiring to those around him, and Tuan should be fired as he lacked this. In {{addition}} to her comments, Syed was credited to closing a deal with punters off the street that he managed to draw into the office.|$|E

Omar's adviser Butchie asks {{how much of the}} {{shipment}} is left. Omar tells him that there is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> ever sell on his own. Butchie suggests selling it back to Proposition Joe for a profit; it is initially taken as a joke but Renaldo and Omar begin to see the idea's potential.|$|E

25|$|He {{pushed his}} troops {{so hard that}} their horses became unusable, and killed them on this campaign, {{creating}} the namesake for Horseheads, New York. The lukewarm response of the Congress was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> accept. Broken, tired and again opposed by Congress, {{he retired from the}} army in 1779 and returned to New Hampshire. Around this time, Sullivan was approached by British agents who tried to persuade him to switch sides. This was part of a concerted effort of approaches to other Generals such as Moses Hazen, Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold who it was believed were unhappy with their treatment by Congress and had lost their faith in the goal of American independence. It was a strategy with mixed results—but which produced the notable defection of Arnold.|$|E

500|$|Several {{contemporary}} accounts {{focus on}} Mateiu's unusual preferences in clothing, {{pointing to a}} studied extravagance first adopted during his stay in Berlin, and in support {{of which he was}} reportedly spending <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> afford. Literary historian George Călinescu recalled having seen a middle-aged Caragiale taking walks through downtown Bucharest: amused by the writer's everyday clothes, which he depicted as of an archaic fashion and slightly deteriorated, compared him to [...] "a butler on Sunday leave". Călinescu also told that, during winter, Caragiale would only touch metal with his hand while wearing suede gloves. Rosetti and poet Ștefana Velisar both recorded being amused by aspects of Caragiale's clothing, such as his oversized boots and his using scissors to cut out the worn out extremities of his trouser legs. In 1926, the writer began wearing a ring bearing the seal of Mercury, which, Vartic supposes, evidenced his trust in the psychopomp god's powers.|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on {{his early}} days in training, he said, [...] "I hated ballet and would skip every chance I got." [...] More {{interested}} in jazz as a child, the flips, turns, and chance for expression appealed to him. However, his real motivation was competition, which would prepare him for his future endeavors <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have known at the time. [...] "I was a competition kid. We used to do competitions every other weekend," [...] he told Dance Magazine.|$|E
2500|$|After the war Montgomery and his {{supporters}} claimed that the battle for Normandy went largely as he had planned it before hand. The Americans argued that Montgomery's generalship was flawed and that the battle had to be fought differently from planned because Montgomery promised <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> deliver. [...] Hart finds that Montgomery's emphasis on the maintenance of morale and casualty conservation were the primary influences on his operational conduct. Hart concludes that Montgomery was the most competent British general in Europe for he understood the UK's war aims. His concern with his unit's morale was legitimate, and he recognized that the UK had a manpower problem. Both factors influenced {{his handling of the}} 21st Army Group.|$|E
2500|$|Brownson was {{summed up}} by poet and critic James Russell Lowell in his satirical A Fable for Critics as someone trying to bite off <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> chew: [...] "his mouth very full with {{attempting}} to gulp a Gregorian bull". Edgar Allan Poe refers to Brownson in his Autography series, calling him [...] "an extraordinary man," [...] though he [...] "has not altogether succeeded in convincing himself of those important truths which he is so anxious to impress upon his readers." [...] He is also mentioned in Poe's story [...] "Mesmeric Revelation," [...] referring to Brownson's 1840 novel Charles Eldwood; or, The Infidel Converted.

2500|$|Marlowe {{is alleged}} to have been a {{government}} spy (Park Honan's 2005 biography even had [...] "Spy" [...] in its title). The author Charles Nicholl speculates this was the case and suggests that Marlowe's recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge. As noted above, in 1587 the Privy Council ordered the University of Cambridge to award Marlowe his degree of Master of Arts, denying rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims, saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified [...] "affaires" [...] on [...] "matters touching the benefit of his country". Surviving college records from the period also indicate that Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university – much longer than permitted by university regulations – that began in the academic year 1584–1585. Surviving college buttery (provisions store) accounts indicate he began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance – <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have afforded on his known scholarship income.|$|E
