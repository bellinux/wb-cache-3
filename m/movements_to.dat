5|$|Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay {{as he and}} Denis Compton {{attempted}} to establish themselves. He was hurried by the pace of Lindwall and Johnston, making many last-moment <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> either hit the ball or withdraw from a shot.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} {{member of his}} local community, Bruxner became involved in emerging <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> have a political force for regional areas and joined and was convinced by friends to stand as a Progressive Party candidate in the 1920 New South Wales state election. Bruxner was elected under proportional representation with 23% as the second member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly district of Northern Tablelands alongside his friend David Drummond.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in two parts, four <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> {{be performed}} before the sermon, three after the sermon. Both parts {{begin with a}} sinfonia. Bach scored it for an alto soloist and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes (Ob), taille (Ot), obbligato solo organ (Org), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
50|$|A set {{of small}} {{movement}} makes {{the life of}} the typist easier, like drawing a small circle or a back and forth <b>movement</b> <b>to</b> write a letter uppercase. Or prolonging the <b>movement</b> <b>to</b> put accent on letters.|$|R

5|$|Bompart's {{squadron}} departed Brest {{late in the}} evening, {{hoping to}} slip past the inshore British blockade in the dark. However, they took too long to navigate the Raz passage, and were spotted at dawn on 17 September by a frigate squadron under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, in HMS Boadicea. Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering HMS Ethalion under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers White to follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> Admiral Lord Bridport, admiral of the Channel Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Campaign school, Campagneschule or Campagne, {{where the}} horse learns {{collection}} and balance through all gaits, turns and maneuvers. The horse learns to shorten and lengthen his stride, perform lateral <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> the side, and is {{introduced to the}} more complex double bridle. This is the longest training phase and may take several years.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{often have}} {{pronounced}} responses to musical sounds and numerous videos exist showing the birds dancing to popular music. Research conducted in 2008 with an Eleonora cockatoo named Snowball had {{indicated that this}} particular individual is indeed capable of beat induction—perceiving human-created music and synchronizing his body <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> the beat.|$|E

5|$|Ground {{was broken}} {{on the first}} segment of I-270 in 1965, and the freeway was {{completed}} three years later, stretching from I-70 to Vasquez Boulevard. The road was then extended to I-76 two years later. The section between I-25 and I-76 was completed in 1999. Since completion, this section has undergone much construction to renew bridges over Clear Creek and Washington Street. Because {{the western end of}} I-270 is close to the junction of I-25 and I-76, some traffic <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> I-25 can only be made by using I-76.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{developed}} by a small team at Ubisoft Reflections for internal release, the game became popular between co-workers and was eventually planned for official release, confirmed in a blog post by Ubisoft on January 22, 2015. It was created using the Unity game engine, and contains procedural animation and physics-based gameplay, which allow the player's <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the game's environment.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the revolutionary}} {{features}} of the Apache was its helmet mounted display, the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS); among its capabilities, either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter's 30mm automatic M230 Chain Gun to their helmet, making the gun track head <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> point where they look. The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS). On more modern AH-64s, the TADS/PNVS {{has been replaced by}} Lockheed Martin's Arrowhead (MTADS) targeting system.|$|E
5|$|The Adagio is in sonata {{form and}} {{presents}} a single theme. While the exposition modulates to a re-statement {{of the theme}} in F major, the recapitulation modulates to D major. The movement ends in that key, pianissimo, with a segue (an explicit direction given by Haydn to avoid too long a pause between the <b>movements)</b> <b>to</b> the D-major minuet.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow {{is found}} in parts of eastern Asia and in the Himalayas. It is not known whether its {{distribution}} is continuous between these two areas, since the political sensitivity of the Brahmaputra River's valley near the China-India border makes the area less accessible to ornithologists. In the Himalayas the russet sparrow breeds from the far northeast of India through southeastern Tibet, Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh to Kashmir and Nuristan in Afghanistan. Here, the russet sparrow makes short <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> lower altitudes between November and April in many areas.|$|E

5000|$|In {{conjunction}} with other efforts, Lessig has started an activist group called [...] Lessig made comments at Zuccotti Park {{in solidarity with}} Occupy Wall Street protesters, reiterating many of the points from Republic, Lost, and exhorted the Occupy <b>movement</b> <b>to</b> ally with the Tea Party <b>movement</b> <b>to</b> fight government corruption.|$|R
5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> improve the standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, {{the gay rights}} movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E
5|$|With Ferino's quick <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> {{encircle}} him, Charles executed {{an orderly}} withdrawal in four columns through the Black Forest, across the Upper Danube valley, and toward Bavaria, {{trying to maintain}} consistent contact with all flanks. By mid-July, the column encamped near Stuttgart. The third column, which included the Condé’s Corps, retreated through Waldsee to Stockach, and eventually Ravensburg. The fourth Austrian column, the smallest (three battalions and four squadrons), under General Wolff, marched {{the length of the}} Bodensee’s northern shore, via Überlingen, Meersburg, Buchhorn, and the Austrian city of Bregenz.|$|E
5|$|Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, {{a clumsy}} Gungan exiled {{from his home}} and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting {{director}} Robin Gurland saw him on a Stomp performance in San Francisco. Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character. Best frequently improvised <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.|$|E

5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
5|$|By 1941 radar {{was slowly}} being {{introduced}} within the Navy and Hordern was appointed {{as one of}} the first operatives who communicated enemy <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> the RAF. He later said that the post was owed to his clear diction and deep vocal range. His commentary impressed his superior officers so much that by early 1942 he had been given the job as a Fighter Direction Officer, and then first lieutenant on board HMS Illustrious. Shortly after the departure of his immediate superior, he was promoted to lieutenant commander, a post which he occupied for two years. Alongside his naval responsibilities, he was also appointed as the ship's entertainment officer, and was responsible for organising shows featuring various members of Illustriouss crew as the show's cast.|$|E
5|$|Computed tomography, {{also known}} as CT scanning, of a {{complete}} Majungasaurus skull (FMNH PR 2100) allowed a rough reconstruction of its brain and inner ear structure. Overall, the brain was very small relative to body size, but otherwise similar to many other non-coelurosaurian theropods, with a very conservative form closer to modern crocodilians than to birds. One difference between Majungasaurus and other theropods was its smaller flocculus, a region of the cerebellum that helps to coordinate movements of the eye with movements of the head. This suggests that Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids like Indosaurus, which also had a small flocculus, did not rely on quick head <b>movements</b> <b>to</b> sight and capture prey.|$|E
