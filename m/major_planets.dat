5|$|The orbital semimajor axis is only 0.13 AU, {{around a}} third of the average {{distance}} between Mercury and the Sun, and is more eccentric than the orbit of any of the <b>major</b> <b>planets</b> of our solar system.

5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the <b>major</b> <b>planets</b> completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane of the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other <b>major</b> <b>planets</b> are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of the Solar System out of convenience.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, {{each with its own}} symbol, in addition to the eight <b>major</b> <b>planets</b> (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the generic symbol ④. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, ④ Vesta, as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) Vesta, which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as 4) Vesta and 4, Vesta, was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either Vesta, or, more commonly, 4 Vesta, is used.|$|E

500|$|Some astronomers counter {{this opinion}} by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the <b>major</b> <b>planets</b> {{completely}} control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Although Jupiter does coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Earth accretes or ejects near-Earth asteroids on million-year time scales, thereby clearing its orbit. [...] Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance (i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits). Since the orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, Neptune is therefore gravitationally dominant.|$|E
500|$|Being {{distant from}} the Sun and <b>major</b> <b>planets,</b> Kuiper belt objects {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} unaffected by the processes that have shaped and altered other Solar System objects; thus, determining their composition would provide substantial information on the makeup of the earliest Solar System. Due to their small size and extreme distance from Earth, the chemical makeup of KBOs is very difficult to determine. The principal method by which astronomers determine the composition of a celestial object is spectroscopy. When an object's light is broken into its component colors, an image akin to a rainbow is formed. This image is called a spectrum. Different substances absorb light at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum for a specific object is unravelled, dark lines (called absorption lines) appear where the substances within it have absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every element or compound has its own unique spectroscopic signature, and by reading an object's full spectral [...] "fingerprint", astronomers can determine its composition.|$|E
500|$|Later on August 22, two open {{meetings}} were held {{which ended in}} an abrupt about-face on the basic planetary definition. The position of astronomer Julio Ángel Fernández gained the upper hand among the members attending and was described as unlikely to lose its hold by August 24. This position would result in only eight <b>major</b> <b>planets,</b> with Pluto ranking as a [...] "dwarf planet". The discussion at the first meeting was heated and lively, with IAU members in vocal disagreement with one another over such issues as {{the relative merits of}} static and dynamic physics; the main sticking point was whether or not to include a body's orbital characteristics among the definition criteria. [...] In an indicative vote, members heavily defeated the proposals on Pluto-like objects and double planet systems, and were evenly divided on the question of hydrostatic equilibrium. [...] The debate was said to be [...] "still open", with private meetings being held ahead of a vote scheduled for the following day.|$|E

50|$|More recently, a {{relatively}} small number of asteroids have been found to possess high eccentricity orbits which do lie within the Kirkwood gaps. Examples include the Alinda family and the Griqua family. These orbits slowly increase their eccentricity on a timescale of tens of millions of years, and will eventually break out of the resonance due to close encounters with a <b>major</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|R
50|$|ALMA was {{initially}} a 50-50 {{collaboration between the}} National Radio Astronomy Observatory and European Southern Observatory (ESO) and later extended {{with the help of}} the other Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chilean partners. ALMA is the largest and most expensive ground-based astronomical project, costing between US$1.4 and 1.5 billion. (However, various space astronomy projects including Hubble Space Telescope, JWST, and several <b>major</b> <b>planet</b> probes have cost considerably more).|$|R
500|$|Long-period comets have highly {{eccentric}} orbits and periods {{ranging from}} 200 years {{to thousands of}} years. An eccentricity greater than 1 when near perihelion {{does not necessarily mean}} that a comet will leave the Solar System. For example, Comet McNaught had a heliocentric osculating eccentricity of 1.000019 near its perihelion passage epoch in January 2007 but is bound to the Sun with roughly a 92,600-year orbit because the eccentricity drops below 1 as it moves further from the Sun. The future orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the osculating orbit is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the center of mass of the Solar System. By definition long-period comets remain gravitationally bound to the Sun; those comets that are ejected from the Solar System due to close passes by <b>major</b> <b>planets</b> are no longer properly considered as having [...] "periods". The orbits of long-period comets take them far beyond the outer planets at aphelia, and the plane of their orbits need not lie near the ecliptic. Long-period comets such as Comet West and C/1999 F1 can have aphelion distances of nearly 70,000 AU with orbital periods estimated around 6 million years.|$|E

5000|$|The asteroid's orbit must {{periodically}} {{bring it}} near Earth.

500|$|Almost immediately, some astronomers {{questioned}} Pluto's {{status as}} a planet. Barely a month after its discovery was announced, on 14 April 1930, {{in an article in}} the New York Times, Armin O. Leuschner suggested that Pluto's dimness and high orbital eccentricity made it more similar to an asteroid or comet: [...] "The Lowell result confirms the possible high eccentricity announced by us on April 5. Among the possibilities are a large asteroid greatly disturbed in its orbit by close approach to a <b>major</b> <b>planet</b> such as Jupiter, or it may be one of many long-period planetary objects yet to be discovered, or a bright cometary object." [...] In that same article, Harvard Observatory director Harlow Shapley wrote that Pluto was a [...] "member of the Solar System not comparable with known asteroids and comets, and perhaps of greater importance to cosmogony than would be another <b>major</b> <b>planet</b> beyond Neptune." [...] In 1931, using a mathematical formula, Ernest W. Brown asserted (in agreement with E. C.
