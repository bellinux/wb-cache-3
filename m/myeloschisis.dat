50|$|<b>Myeloschisis</b> (my·elos·chi·sis) is a {{developmental}} anomaly {{characterized by a}} cleft spinal cord, owing to failure of the neural plate to form a complete neural tube or to rupture of the neural tube after closure.|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the early sequential morphogenetic progress of exencephaly and <b>myeloschisis,</b> rat embryos whose mothers {{had been treated}} with hypervitaminosis A were studied at 1 -day interval from gestation day 10. 5 to 15. 5. In exposed animals sequential change was found in both exencephaly and <b>myeloschisis</b> as the embryos grew up. The 10. 5 -day old exencephalic embryos had still widely open cephalic neural tubes. Exencephalic embryos older than 13. 5 days of gestation showed strikingly severe eversion and overgrowth of the cephalic neuroepithelium, thus failed in forming normal primitive brain. The convex dorsal surface of the exencephaly was covered with ependyma, which was connected directly with surrounding surface eqithelium at the periphery. The earliest morphologically recognized <b>myeloschisis</b> was in the 13. 5 -day old embryos. In <b>myeloschisis,</b> divergence at the roof plate and eversion of the spinal neural tube, disorganized overgrowth of the neuroepithelium, malformed and misplaced spinal ganglia and nerve roots, and absence of the neural arch and dermal covering were characteristic. It is suggested that exencephaly results from failure of the cephalic neural tube closure which is followed by eversion and overgrowth of the neuroepithelium. And failure in closure of the posterior neuropore and disturbance {{in the development of}} the tail bud probably play major role in the morphogenesis of <b>myeloschisis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Though several pathogenetic {{theories}} {{concerning the}} frequent association of Chiari malformation and hydrocephalus with <b>myeloschisis</b> have been suggested, {{none of them}} explains all the aspects of the disorder. To investigate whether <b>myeloschisis</b> is the direct cause of Chiari malformation and hydrocephalus or these conditions are the results of another basic event, we observed the morphological changes of the posterior cranial fossa and its components in the chick embryos with surgically induced <b>myeloschisis.</b> To make myeloschistic lesions, we opened the neural tube for a length of 9 - 11 somites in Hamburger and Hamilton stage 16 - 19 chick embryos. They were divided into cervicothoracic (C-T) and lumbosacral(L-S) groups according {{to the area of}} incision. The embryos were re-incubated until postoperative day 11. In the control group, embryos were incubated with the eggshell window open as their experimental counterparts. The survival rates of each group were as follows; 11 % (9 survivors/ 85 operated embryos), 8 % (7 / 83), and 17 % (10 / 60) in the C-T, L-S and control groups, respectively. <b>Myeloschisis</b> positive rates were 100 % in the operated groups and 0 % in the control group. The heads of embryos were sectioned along the sagittal plane to observe the morphological changes in the posterior cranial fossa and its components. Of the survivors, five in the C-T group, two in the L-S group and six in the control group were available for light microscopic inspection. In the majority of embryos with <b>myeloschisis,</b> without difference between the C-T and L-S groups, the fourth ventricles were smaller than those of the control group and the subarachnoid spaces in the posterior cranial fossa were also narrower. In embryos with severe changes, the cerebellum displaced downward comparing with that of the control embryos. No evidence of hydrocephalus was present Though not always typical, morphological changes similar to Chiari malformation were observed in chick embryos with surgically induced <b>myeloschisis.</b> It suggests a strong direct causal relationship between the two conditions and supports the theories of derangements in cerebrospinal fluid dynamics rather than those of primary mesenchymal or neural origin as a pathogenetic mechanism of Chiari malformation...|$|E
40|$|Myeloshisis {{is defined}} as an open neural tube defect {{involving}} malformation of the vertebral arches, absence of meninges and structural or functional spinal cord abnormalities. Neural placode is located ventrally and is often opposed to the underlying spinal canal (1). <b>Myeloschisis</b> defects are difficult to repair due to soft tissue agenesis in the defective region, fragility of the dura in such areas, a deep narrow field and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage (2). Many substances {{have been used for}} repair, but a satisfactory solution has not been found. Dural graft causes neomembrane formation and wound healing, without immunologic problems (3 - 5). Tutoplast dura has favorable implantation characteristics (6). In this report, a 3 -day-old girl with a large <b>myeloschisis</b> defect (5 x 6 cm) located in th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The Robert/SC (pseudothalidomide) {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disorder, associated with phocomelia and craniofacial abnormalities. An anomalous fetus with lower limb phocomelia and micromelia, lumbar <b>myeloschisis,</b> upper limb and ribs defects and craniofacial abnormalities is reported whose diabetic mother took mebendazole and glibenclamide in early pregnancy. Ultrasonographic findings of syndromes with phocomelia are discussed as well as Robert/SC syndrome {{which is the most}} probable diagnosis. Robert/SC phocomelia {{syndrome is}} a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by severe pre and postnatal growth deficiency, symmetric limb reductions of variable severity and craniofacial anomalies including hypertelorism, hypoplastic nasal alae, cleft lip and palate. About half of the reported cases presented chromosomal abnormalities. We think that findings in our case are consistent with Robert/SC syndrome with additional abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Di(2 -ethylhexyl) {{phthalate}} (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) {{were mixed}} with diet at graded levels of 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 1. 0 wt- % {{and given to}} pregnant ICR mice throughout gestation. Maternal weight gain was suppressed and fetal resorptions increased at 0. 2, 0. 4 and 1. 0 %o levels of DEHP and 1. 0 %o level of DBP. All the implanted ova died early in rats fed 0. 4 and 1. 0 % levels of DEHP. External malformations increased significantly by 0. 2 % DEHP, and 1. 0 % DBP showed borderline significance. The major malformations in treated groups were neural tube defects (exencephaly and <b>myeloschisis),</b> suggesting that the phthalic acid esters (PAEs) affect neural tube closure in developing embryos. Treatment with the compounds caused intrauterine growth retardation and delayed ossification with an apparently dose-related response pattern. These results indicate that a high dose of DEHP and DBP might be embryotoxic and teratogenic in mice. The maximum nonembryotoxic doses of PAEs in mice were more than 2000 times the estimated level of human intake through the food chain. Thus {{it is assumed that}} the current "normal " exposure level of PAEs does not pose an imminent threat to human fetal development...|$|E
