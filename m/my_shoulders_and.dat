500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Times and Seasons, Smith had [...] "wholly removed {{suspicion}} from elder Sidney Rigdon" [...] and [...] "expressed entire {{willingness to}} have elder Sidney Rigdon retain his station", despite a [...] "lack {{of confidence in}} his integrity and steadfastness, judging from their past intercourse". Alternately, the History of the Church records that Smith replied to the vote by saying, [...] "I have thrown him off <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> you have again put him on me. You may carry him, but I will not." ...|$|E
2500|$|About 2a.m. on {{the morning}} of May 18, 1936, as Ishida was asleep, Abe wrapped her sash twice around his neck and strangled him to death. She later told police, [...] "After I had killed Ishida I felt totally at ease, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> I felt a sense of clarity." [...] After lying with Ishida's body for a few hours, she next severed his {{genitalia}} with the kitchen knife, wrapped them in a magazine cover, and kept them until her arrest three days later. With the blood she wrote [...] on Ishida's left thigh, and on a bed sheet. She then carved å®š ("Sada", the character for her name) into his left arm. After putting on Ishida's underwear, she left the inn at about 8a.m., telling the staff not to disturb Ishida.|$|E

60|$|She {{laid her}} gentle hands upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> looked calmly in my face.|$|E
60|$|She put {{her hands}} on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> drew me down to kiss her.|$|E
60|$|Her {{hands were}} clasped upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> her chin rested on them, and {{her blue eyes}} looked quietly into mine.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> gave me a slight turn, {{pointing}} with his other arm at the same time.|$|R
60|$|She winced. Then {{abruptly}} {{she was on}} {{her knees}} before me, with her hands upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> her eyes meeting mine.|$|R
60|$|WYATT. I fear {{you come}} to carry it off <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>And</b> sonnet-making's safer.|$|E
60|$|I shrugged <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> {{we stood}} {{for a little while}} looking down on the shining {{crescent}} of the Rhine.|$|E
60|$|More I {{would have}} said, {{but at that}} {{juncture}} the lash of the coachman's whip curled itself about <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> stung me vilely.|$|E
60|$|Stanley {{laid his}} hand upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> his touch was inexpressibly soothing. I felt light and happy, {{in spite of}} all.|$|R
60|$|She flung herself upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> {{clung to}} me, and began again to wish her {{daughter}} lying dead at our feet.|$|R
60|$|As I was marching sadly down Portugal Street, I felt {{a hand on}} <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> a rough voice which I knew well.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very good, sir," [...] assented the old man; [...] "lay your load upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> {{take off}} my parcel, putting it upon your own back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Smith, {{can you not}} {{guess so}} simple a thing?" [...] said Edra, placing her white hands on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> smiling {{straight}} into my face.|$|E
60|$|At our {{entrance}} {{the conversation}} ceased for a moment. Mr. Ravenor laid his hand upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> turned towards the little group.|$|R
60|$|She didn't {{seem to hear}} me: she put {{her hand}} on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> kept me where I was, sitting by her side.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Harrison {{probably}} guessed {{what was}} passing in my mind, for {{he placed a}} kindly hand upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> said, with a smile:-- ...|$|R
60|$|So Fate having {{issued its}} decree, of which Hans's version was that Zikali, or his Great Medicine, had so {{arranged}} things, I shrugged <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> waited.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Rawjester {{deliberately}} {{turned his}} back upon me and remained silent for twenty minutes. I drew my shawl the more closely around <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> closed my eyes.|$|E
60|$|What Dick's welcome was I did not hear, but {{judging from}} the grip he put on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> then on my hands, {{he was glad to}} see me.|$|E

60|$|The Sibyl {{laid her}} dry, fleshless hand on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> forced me roughly {{back into the}} chair from which I had just risen.|$|R
60|$|She {{laid her}} hand on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> looked at me in anxious silence. I saw she {{understood}} the serious risk that threatened us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, in {{that case}} we would all fall together," [...] {{returned}} the Ork. [...] "Get aboard, little girl; sit across <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> put both your arms around my neck." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{looked more}} and more like lunacy. However, there was nothing for it but to submit. I shrugged <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> sat down in the arm-chair beside the empty fireplace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pull away my old hood {{that lies}} there on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> let me tie my pretty dress with this fine belt," [...] said Bud, feeling {{something}} on her back.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the best}} way I could have taken to compose her. She laid her head on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> smiled faintly through her tears.|$|R
6000|$|This {{state of}} happy {{unconsciousness}} had scarcely lasted--it seemed to me--two minutes, when I {{was awakened by}} Peterkin laying his hand on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> saying-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Idris {{understood}} me: she {{bowed her}} head on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> wept. [...] "Why," [...] she again asked, [...] "do you tremble, Lionel, what shakes you thus?" ...|$|R
