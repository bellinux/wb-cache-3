25|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} of progesterone is very low, requiring {{very high}} doses to produce significant effects, and the hormone must be <b>micronized</b> {{in order to}} confer oral activity at practical dosages.

OMP is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but its bioavailability is very low at less than 10% (relative to intramuscular injection) due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. There is wide interindividual variability in the bioavailability of OMP, and its absorption is increased approximately two-fold when it is taken with food.|$|E

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of tailored microparticles for delivery of therapeutics {{is a challenge}} relying upon a complex interplay between processing parameters and materials properties. The emerging use of electrospraying allows better tailoring of particle morphologies and sizes than current techniques, critical to reproducible release profiles.

To this end, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was assessed as a <b>micronizing</b> and solubilizing agent for dry protein encapsulation and release from electrosprayed particles made from polycaprolactone (PCL). The physical effect of PEG in protein-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles was also studied, for comparison. The addition of 5 – 15 wt% PEG 6 kDa or 35 kDa resulted in reduced PCL particle sizes and broadened distributions, which could be improved by tailoring the electrospraying processing parameters, namely by reducing polymer concentration and increasing flow rate. Upon micronization, protein particle size was reduced to the micrometer domain, resulting in homogenous encapsulation in electrosprayed PCL microparticles. Microparticle size distributions were shown to be the most determinant factor for protein release by diffusion and allowed specific control of release patterns...|$|R
40|$|Research in {{the field}} of protein {{therapeutics}} has exploded over the past decade and continues to grow in both academia and in industry. Protein drugs have advantages of being highly specific and highly active making them coveted targets for high profile disease states like cancer and multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, their many advantages are complemented by their obstacles. Because proteins are highly active and highly specific, the window between efficacy and toxicity is very narrow and drug development can be long and arduous. In addition, protein activity is dependent on its specific folding conformation that is easily disrupted by a variety of development processes. This research aimed to identify microparticle formulations to control protein release and also to determine which formulation parameters affected burst release, encapsulation, and steady-state release the most. It was found that polymer type and composition were two of the most important factors. Long-term controlled release of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was achieved as well as a wide variety of release profiles.

The effects of four SAS process parameters, i. e. pressure, temperature, concentration and solution flow rate on particle formation were investigated. In SAS process, DLBS 3233 was dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) as the liquid solvent. The solution was then pumped through a nozzle into a chamber simultaneously with supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) which acts as the anti-solvent, resulting in DLBS 3233 precipitation. Physicochemical properties of unprocessed DLBS 3233 and SAS-processed DLBS 3233 particles were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).

40|$|AbstractSupercritical antisolvent process (SAS) {{is widely}} {{being used to}} <b>micronize</b> the {{pharmaceutical}} compounds. The advantage of SAS process is that thermal degradation does not occur in the pharmaceutical compounds as the operating temperature is near to room temperature. This process starts with the atomization of a solution, a mixture of pharmaceutical compound and solvent, in the supercritical carbon dioxide environment. The transfer of carbon dioxide (antisolvent) to the droplet decreases the solubility of solute in the solution causing precipitation of solute in micro to nano-particle size range. In this work, four solvents: dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, acetone and dichloromethane have been considered to study the effect of solvent on droplet diameter, solvent mass transfer rate into supercritical carbon dioxide environment and velocity profile. The atomized droplet moves downward and mass transfer takes place. Two film theory of mass transfer {{has been used to}} calculate the molar flow rate of solvent into supercritical environment and carbon dioxide into droplet. Due to this two way mass transfer, composition of the droplet and thus size is changing continuously. The size of the droplet is calculated assuming that the droplet remains spherical during its downward movement. The size depends on the total number of moles in the droplet and molar density. Peng-Robinson equation of state has been used to calculate the molar density. The velocity profile of droplet is calculated using force balance equation on a moving body in a medium. Result shows that dichloromethane is the best solvent as it has small initial droplet diameter and less residence time compare to other solvents...|$|R

In fact, various miniaturized and micro-devices {{have been used}} for continuous production of pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials and organic compounds, and multiple functions of chemical analysis, for instance, the paper-based analytical devices (μPADs). However, these tools were only very recently made compatible for high pressure or high temperature processes. Supercritical fluids (SCFs) find useful application in performing green chemistry and engineering, especially in pharmaceutical industry. The concern for sustainable environment was the main impetus for using SCFs. The unique properties of some SCFs have enabled the possibility of replacing toxic organic solvents. In this study, the hypothesis that dense gas based microfluidic processes can be developed as an intensified and effective technique to <b>micronize</b> drug particles was tested using two poorly water-soluble pharmaceuticals: copper indomethacin and budesonide. Carbon dioxide was used as an antisolvent to conduct precipitation of the drugs within a microfluidic system under supercritical conditions. The experiments were designed with the aim to optimize the process; the effects of operating parameters, namely temperature, pressure, flow rates of drug solution and carbon dioxide were manipulated to reduce particle size and improve product yield. The Taguchi Method (TM) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were introduced to improve operating conditions and run statistical analysis. In the study of synthesis and micronisation of copper indomethacin, particles of diameter less than 5 μm were produced at a yield of 80 % and the purity of the product was upwards of 95 %. The results from the particle size distribution analysis indicated that 90 % of the product consisted of particles that were less than 8 μm in diameter. The statistical analysis results also demonstrated that temperature and pressure were two significant factors affecting product yield while the flow rates of carbon dioxide and solution had minor impact. To extend the application of microfluidic processes, budesonide was processed in a dense gas assisted microfluidic system. The experiments were conducted under the optimal conditions computed by the Taguchi Method; a yield of budesonide particles of 71. 1 % was achieved. A particle size distribution study showed that 10 % by volume of precipitate produced had diameter smaller than 4 μm, and 90 % of them having diameters under 10 μm. Working under the dense gas or supercritical conditions at micro-scale combines the advantage of size reduction provided by micro-devices to the unique properties of the dense gas or supercritical fluids. Therefore, a dense gas based microfluidic process addresses the limitations of both macro-scale supercritical fluids reactors and conventional liquid microfluidic systems, and brings benefits to particle engineering...|$|R

40|$|Fly ash, a {{byproduct}} of coal-fired thermal power plants is considered an environmental pollutant {{if it is to}} be disposed of and requires considerate financial liabilities on fly ash producers for its safe disposal. But fortunately, because of its physical and chemical properties, it has found applications in many fields; like mineral extraction, soil stabilization, waste treatment and as a supplementary cementitious material. As cement industry is responsible for 5 - 7 % of global greenhouse gas emissions, application of fly ash as a cement replacement material provides the dual benefit of cutting down the greenhouse gas emissions and in increasing the utilization rate of fly ash produced worldwide. The majority of global fly ash production falls under class F low calcium category, which has low reactivity. Therefore to improve the performance of fly ash blended cement composites, the researchers have looked at many ways like; reducing the particle size, making use of hydrated lime, silica fume, and Metakaolin, etc. Recently, the use of nanomaterials has been gaining widespread attention of the research community due to their small particle size and high reactivity that help in improving the properties of the concrete at the nanoscale level. The majority of the past research on low calcium, class F fly ash cement composites, concentrated on 60 % or less of fly ash content and there is a great potential for the further improvement in replacement levels. Therefore, our research aimed at developing a cement composite that not only increases the percentage of fly ash content but also considerably increases the cement replacement level having comparable mechanical properties to that of ordinary portland cement (OPC). Based on the review of existing literature, there appeared to be no research available that investigates the effect of micro (silica fume) and nano silica in combination with hydrated lime and set accelerator on high volume fly ash (HVFA) cement composite replacing 80 % of cement. Therefore, our first study was undertaken to fill up this knowledge gap. The fly ash used in this study was micronised using Sturtevant jet mill microniser to produce ultra fine fly ash (UFFA). The research findings show that when UFFA is partially replaced with silica fume (SF) and used in combination with both the set accelerator (SA) and hydrated lime (HL), there is a considerable improvement in its pozzolanic activity resulting in large improvement in its 7 and 28 day compressive strength. On the contrary, nano silica (nS) modified HV-UFFA performed better when used without the SA and HL, resulting in significantly improving its 7 and 28 day compressive strength. The strength achieved at 28 days was at par with that of OPC. The addition of SA and HL to nS modified HV-UFFA blend resulted in the development of high early age microcracking, thereby considerably reducing its 28 day strength compared to that of nS, HV-UFFA and OPC blend not containing HL and SA. The second experiment was planned to look at the effect of different concentrations of nS on raw HVFA cement blends with and without SA and HL, replacing 70 % of cement. The difference in experiment 2 compared to experiment 1 were (i) raw fly ash was used in experiment 2 in lieu of UFFA as micronising fly ash consumes electricity that adds to the carbon footprint (ii) two concentrations of nano silica were used i. e. 5 and 7. 5 % to study the effect of increase in nano silica content on HVFA cement composite. The fly ash content was partially replaced with 5 and 7. 5 % of nS and 5 % HL. The results show that the 7 day strength increased with the increasing amount of nano silica. However, at 28 days both the samples showed approximately the similar improvement in strength. With the addition of set accelerator to nano silica modified HVFA cement blends, there was a considerable reduction in 7 and 28 day compressive strength results. Addition of HL to HVFA cement blend, containing 5 % nS showed no effect on its further strength development. However, when HL was added to the 7. 5 % nS modified HVFA cement coposite, a considerable reduction in its 7 and 28 day compressive strength results were observed. This shows that nS is highly effective in improving the strength of HVFA cement composites when used alone without any additives, but when it is used in combination with either HL or SA, shows no or negative effect on the development of compressive strength of raw fly ash blended cement composites. Looking at the significant improvement in the strength results of HVFA cement composites by incorporating nano silica, the next experiment was planned to looking at the effect of other nano materials on HVFA cement composites. As the major elemental oxides present in OPC are SiO 2, CaO and Al 2 O 3. This experiment was planned to incorporate the nano sized sources of these elemental oxides. Since the reaction of pure CaO is highly thermal in nature and addition of nano CaO would have been highly exothermic and could have introduced high thermal stresses at early ages of curing, nano CaCO 3 was used as a source of CaO. Therefore, the third experiment plan looked at a quantitative comparative study of the effect of 5 % and 7. 5 % of nano silica, 2. 5 % and 5 % of nano alumina (nA) and 2. 5 % and 5 % of nano calcium carbonate (nCC), on the properties of HVFA cement composites, replacing 80 % of cement. The results show that the addition of nS significantly improves the compressive strength of HVFA cement composites and considerably increases the formation and thermal stability of silica-rich hydrogarnet phase, which increases with the increase in nS content. The addition of nCC to HVFA cement composite does not show any effect on the pozzolanic reaction at 7 days of curing but at 28 days considerably improves its pozzolanic reaction, which increases with the increase in nCC content. The performance of nCC in improving the mechanical properties is less pronounced than that of nS. The addition of nA though improves the hydration/pozzolanic reaction of HVFA cement composite, resulting in the improvement in compressive strength, but only if added in small quantities (2. 5 % or less). If it is added in higher amounts, it promotes the formation of Al(OH) 3 gel that severely inhibits the hydration/pozzolanic reaction within the cement matrix. Based on the knowledge gained from the previous experiments, we found that the amorphous nano silica holds a great potential for the development of zero cement composite. That motivated us to design our fourth experiment, replacing 100 % of cement. In the fourth experiment we replaced OPC with slag, which is another industrial by product. Zero cement mix designs were developed incorporating slag, HVFA and various concentrations of nano silica and hydrated lime. The results show that the optimum content of nano silica in a high volume fly ash, slag and HL blend is 5 %. With a further increase in nano silica content although the pozzolanic reaction and the resulting C-S-H/C-A-S-H gel formation increases but it also increase the micro-cracking within the cement matrix, resulting in negatively impacting the strength development. The portlandite added externally in the form of Ca(OH) 2 powder, to the nS modified SCM blend, activates the pozzolanic reaction which increases with the increase in portlandite content. The best mix design containing 5 % nS, 70 % FA and 25 % slag in combination with 15 % HL as an additive, achieved a 28 day compressive strength of 70 % compared to that of OPC. It is to be noted that though this research aimed at minimising the carbon footprint of the cement composites, it was not completely eliminated. The various raw materials that have CO 2 emissions associated with their production are listed below: Nano silica &ndash; As per the information provided by the supplier of Nano silica, it was produced by pyrogenic method, which is highly energy intensive process. It is produced from the flame hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl 4) at ~ 1800 &deg;C temperature. Calcium hydroxide &ndash; Calcium hydroxide is produced commercially by treating lime (CaO) with water (H 2 O). The CaO used in this process is produced by the de-carbonation of limestone (CaCO 3), which releases CO 2 into the atmosphere during production. Ultrafine fly ash (UFFA) &ndash; Though fly ash is a by-product of thermal power plants using coal as a fuel, <b>micronizing</b> the fly ash (i. e. reducing the particle size of the raw fly ash) is an energy intensive process. The Sturtevant jet mill microniser used to reduce the particle size of the raw fly ash runs on electricity which otherwise is produced primarily by the thermal power plants in Australia...|$|R
