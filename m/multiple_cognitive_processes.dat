40|$|ReviewThis is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Sage via the DOI in this record. Many popular psychological accounts attribute adaptive human behavior to an ‘executive control’ system that regulates a lower-level ‘impulsive’ or ‘associative’ system. However, recent findings argue against this strictly hierarchical view. Instead, control of impulsive and inappropriate actions depends on an interplay between <b>multiple</b> basic <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes.</b> The outcome of these processes can be biased in advance. Action control is also strongly influenced by personal experiences in the recent and distant past. Thus, executive control emerges from an interactive and competitive network. Main challenges for future research are to describe and understand these interactions, and to put executive action control in a wider socio-cultural and evolutional context.

40|$|Chapter 4 {{describes}} the inferential reasoning theory of causal learning and discusses how {{thinking about this}} theory has evolved {{in at least two}} important ways. First, the authors argue that it is useful to decouple the debate about different possible types of mental representations involved in causal learning (e. g., propositional or associative) from the debate about processes involved therein (e. g., inferential reasoning or attention). Second, at the process level inferential reasoning is embedded within a broad array of mental processes that are all required to provide a full mechanistic account of causal learning. Based on those insights, the authors evaluate five arguments that are often raised against inferential reasoning theory. They conclude that causal learning is best understood as involving the formation and retrieval of propositional representations, both of which depend on <b>multiple</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes</b> (i. e., the multi-process propositional account) ...|$|E

We build a decoder that predicts the visual percept formed by four letter words, allowing us to identify words that were not present in the training data. To do so, we cast the learning problem as multiple classification problems after describing words with multiple binary attributes. This work goes beyond the identification or reconstruction of single letters or simple geometrical shapes and addresses a challenging estimation problem, that is the prediction of multiple variables from a single observation, hence facing the problem of learning multiple predictors from correlated inputs...|$|E
40|$|Addressing the {{question}} of why some people are happier than others is important for both theoretical and practical reasons and should be a central goal of a comprehensive positive psychology. Following a construal theory of happiness, the author proposes that <b>multiple</b> <b>cognitive</b> and motivational <b>processes</b> moderate the impact of the objective environment on well-being. Thus, to understand why some people are happier than others, one must understand the <b>cognitive</b> and motivational <b>processes</b> that serve to maintain, and even enhance, enduring happiness and transient mood. The author's approach has been to explore hedonically relevant psychological processes, such as social comparison, dissonance reduction, self-reflection, self-evaluation, and person perception, in chronically happy and unhappy individuals. In support of a construal framework, self-rated happy and unhappy people have been shown to differ systematically in the particular cognitive and motivational strategies they use. Promising research directions for positive psychology in pursuit of the sources of happiness, as well as the implications of the construal approach for prescriptions for enhancing well-being, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} how gamma oscillations can be modulated by cognitive reappraisal. Thirty-two participants performed cognitive reappraisal tasks to {{increase or decrease}} their emotions while viewing neutral and emotional (positive or negative) pictures. As a control task, the participants also simply viewed the pictures without an attempt to manipulate emotions. Electroencephalograms {{of the participants were}} recorded during the cognitive reappraisal tasks to extract the gamma oscillations. Gamma activity was quantified by measuring event-related changes in the gamma band power (30 - 55 Hz). During the tasks, the greatest gamma activity was found at the parietal regions. Greater parietal gamma activity was induced by the emotional pictures compared with the neutral ones when the participants passively viewed the pictures. No such difference in the parietal gamma activity was found when the participants performed the cognitive reappraisal tasks. In addition, parietal gamma activity during the cognitive reappraisal tasks was greater than that during the control task in response to the neutral pictures, implying the role of parietal gamma activity in the top-down <b>cognitive</b> execution <b>process.</b> In contrast, parietal gamma activity during the cognitive reappraisal task to increase emotions was greater than the levels of activity during the task to decrease emotions and during the control task in response to the emotional pictures, implying the role of parietal gamma activity in the bottom-up sensory emotional process.

40|$|Executive {{functions}} {{consist of}} <b>multiple</b> high-level <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes</b> that drive rule generation and behavioral selection. An emergent property {{of these processes}} {{is the ability to}} adjust behavior in response to changes in one’s environment (i. e., behavioral flexibility). These processes are essential to normal human behavior, and may be disrupted in diverse neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, alcoholism, depression, stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease. Understanding of the neurobiology of executive functions has been greatly advanced by the availability of animal tasks for assessing discrete components of behavioral flexibility, particularly strategy shifting and reversal learning. While several types of tasks have been developed, most are non-automated, labor intensive, and allow testing of only one animal at a time. The recent development of automated, operant-based tasks for assessing behavioral flexibility streamlines testing, standardizes stimulus presentation and data recording, and dramatically improves throughput. Here, we describe automated strategy shifting and reversal tasks, using operant chambers controlled by custom written software programs. Using these tasks, we have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex governs strategy shifting but not reversal learning in the rat, similar to the dissociation observed in humans. Moreover, animals with a neonatal hippocampal lesion, a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, are selectively impaired on the strategy shifting task but not the reversal task. Th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{traditional}} {{method of}} estimating an Event Related Potential (ERP) {{is to take the}} average of signal epochs time locked to a set of similar experimental events. This averaging method is useful as long as the experimental procedure can sufficiently isolate the brain or non-brain process of interest. However, if responses from <b>multiple</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes,</b> time locked to multiple classes of closely spaced events, overlap in time with varying inter-event intervals, averaging will most likely fail to identify the individual response time courses. For this situation, we study estimation of responses to all recorded events in an experiment by a single model using standard linear regression (the rERP technique). Applied to data collected during a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) task, our analysis shows: (1) The rERP technique accounts for more variance in the data than averaging when individual event responses are highly overlapping; (2) the variance accounted for by the estimates is concentrated into a fewer ICA components than raw EEG channel signals.

40|$|Background: Understanding the {{structure}} of cognitive abilities in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) has considerable practical and theoretical importance. Some investigators have argued that a single cognitive process underlies the deficits seen in AD, while others have argued for <b>multiple</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes.</b> As deficits in cognitive abilities may reflect the pathological process or processes occurring in AD, determination of {{the structure}} of abilities in AD is important. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the utility of single and multiple ability factor models in differentiating patients with AD from normals. Results: Findings show that although a single factor model accounts for a large part of the variability of a battery of measures used to differentiate patients and normals, a multiple factor model performed substantially better based on multiple fit criteria. Conclusions: At least in this sample, a multiple ability factor model of cognitive abilities fit data better than a single factor model in differentiating patients with AD from normals...|$|E
50|$|Memory {{is never}} a literal recount of past experiences. Rather, it is {{dependent}} on the constructive processes present at the time of encoding that are subject to potential errors and distortions. Essentially, the constructive memory process functions by encoding the patterns of physical characteristics that are perceived by the individual, as well as the interpretive conceptual and semantic functions that act in response to the incoming information. By utilizing <b>multiple</b> interdependent <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes</b> there {{is never a}} single location in the brain where a given complete memory trace of an experience is stored. In this manner, the various features of the experience must be joined together to form a coherent representation of the episode and if this binding process fails it can result in source memory failure, where later attempted retrieval of the episode results in fragmented recollection and an inability to consolidate the information into a cohesive narrative of a past experience.During the recall of Episodic memory, the information that a person remembers is usually limited in scope, ultimately giving an incomplete recollection of an event. By employing reconstructive processes, individuals supplement other aspects of available personal knowledge into the gaps found in episodic memory in order to provide a fuller and more coherent version, albeit one that is often distorted.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that <b>multiple</b> <b>cognitive</b> and motivational <b>processes</b> underlie individual differences in happiness (Lyubomirsky, 2001, 2008). One behavior {{that is associated with}} (un) happiness is self-reflection or dwelling. We hypothesized that unhappy individuals would be inclined to dwell about themselves, and that this behavior would have a variety of adverse consequences. Three studies tested the prediction that, unlike their happier peers, unhappy participants would be sensitive to unfavorable achievement feedback, likely to dwell about its implications and, hence, show impaired attention during important academic tasks. The results of Studies 1 and 2 showed that unhappy participants who had "failed" relative to peers subsequently displayed increased interfering thoughts; spent the most time performing a portion of the graduate record examination; and later demonstrated impaired reading comprehension. Study 3 experimentally induced versus inhibiting dwelling and found that the manipulation only impacted unhappy students.

40|$|Human {{spatial memory}} {{can be divided}} into <b>multiple,</b> partly {{separate}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes.</b> In this study, object location memory was studied using a set of tasks that assessed three different spatial memory aspects: positional memory, object location binding, and a combined process. Also, maze learning and spatial span memory were measured. Ten patients who had undergone intracranial tumour resection participated, and their individual results were compared with control data from 24 healthy subjects. Four patients showed selective spatial memory impairments; two patients were impaired at positional memory, and two other patients were impaired on object location binding and the combined process. This double dissociation provides further evidence for the notion that object location memory is not a unitary system, but consists of at least two separate mechanisms. In addition, spatial memory problems were predominantly present in the patients with lesions in either the right hemisphere or in the parietal lobe. These results are in agreement with previous findings on the involvement of the right hemisphere and the posterior parietal cortices in spatial processing. ...|$|R
40|$|Synaptic {{plasticity}} {{dependent on}} N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors {{is thought to}} underlie certain types of learning and memory. In support of this, both hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial learning in a watermaze are impaired by blocking NMDA receptors with a selective antagonist D(-) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid (AP 5) or by a mutation {{in one of the}} receptor subunits. Here we report, however, that the AP 5 -induced learning deficit can be almost completely prevented if rats are pretrained in a different watermaze before administration of the drug. This is not because of stimulus generalization, and occurs despite learning of the second task remaining hippocampus dependent. An AP 5 -induced learning deficit is, however, still seen if the animals are pretrained using a non-spatial task. Thus, despite its procedural simplicity, the watermaze may involve <b>multiple</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>processes</b> with distinct pharmacological properties; although required for some component of spatial learning, NMDA receptors may not be required for encoding the spatial representation of a specific environment...|$|E

Other learning processes enable incorporating different sources of supervisory information, alongside the visual features of the categorized objects, from which the categorical relations between few objects can be deduced.
