5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of net <b>material</b> <b>product,</b> and in total the bunkers cost {{more than twice as}} much as the Maginot Line in France, consuming three times as much concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 people a year died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E
2500|$|What {{orthodox}} Marxists traditionally {{tried to}} do, {{is to create}} concepts for a very precise standard classification schema of occupations and output-defined industrial activities, which splits the working class into productive and unproductive employees. This schematic approach to the issue was strongly influenced by the official orthodox Marxist–Leninist <b>Material</b> <b>Product</b> System (MPS) in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba and Vietnam. The MPS national accounts divide economic activity into a productive sector where tangible physical goods are produced, an unproductive sector creating services, and households. Another influence was Piero Sraffa's revival of the classical distinction between the production of [...] "basic" [...] and [...] "non-basic" [...] goods.|$|E

6000|$|This is {{the usual}} {{definition}} of wealth. Henry George (see [...] “Progress and Poverty,” pp. 34-37) regards wealth as consisting [...] “of natural products that have been secured, moved, combined, [...] separated, or in other ways modified by human exertion, so as to [...] fit them for the gratification of human desires.... Nothing which [...] Nature supplies to man without his labor is wealth.... All things [...] which have an exchange value are, therefore, not wealth. Only such [...] things can be wealth the production of which increases and the [...] destruction of which decreases the aggregate of wealth.... Increase in land values does not represent increase in the common [...] wealth, for what land-owners gain by higher prices the tenants or [...] purchasers who must pay them will lose.” Jevons (“Primer,” p. 13) [...] defines wealth very properly as what is transferable, limited in [...] supply, and useful. F. A. Walker defines wealth as comprising “all [...] articles of value and nothing else” (“Political Economy,” p. 5). [...] Levasseur’s definition (“Précis,” p. 15) is, “all material objects [...] possessing utility” (i.e., the power to satisfy a want). (Cf. [...] various definitions in Roscher’s “Political Economy,” section 9, [...] note 3.) Perry (“Political Economy,” p. 99) rejects the term [...] wealth as a clog to progress in the science, and adopts [...] property in its stead, defining it as that “which can be bought [...] or sold.” Cherbuliez (“Précis,” p. 70) defines wealth as the [...] <b>material</b> <b>product</b> of nature appropriated by labor for the wants of [...] man. Carey (“Social Science,” i, 186) asserts that wealth consists [...] in the power to command Nature’s services, including in wealth [...] such intangible things as mental qualities.|$|E

6000|$|Hypatia sat {{trembling}} with shame and dread. She, as a disciple {{of the more}} purely spiritualistic school of Porphyry, had always looked with aversion, with all but contempt, on those theurgic arts which were so much lauded and employed by Iamblicus, Abamnon, and those who clung lovingly to the old priestly rites of Egypt and Chaldaea. They had seemed to her vulgar toys, tricks of legerdemain, suited only for the wonder of the mob.... She {{began to think of}} them with more favour now. How did she know that the vulgar did not require signs and wonders to make them believe?.... How, indeed? for did she not want such herself? And she opened Abamnon's famous letter to Porphyry, and read earnestly over, for the twentieth time, his subtle justification of magic, and felt it to be unanswerable. Magic? What was not magical? The whole universe, from the planets over her head to the meanest pebble at her feet, was utterly mysterious, ineffable, miraculous, influencing and influenced by affinities and repulsions as unexpected, as unfathomable, as those which, as Abamnon said, drew the gods towards those sounds, those objects, which, either in form, or colour, or chemical properties, were symbolic of, or akin to, themselves. What wonder in it, after all? Was not love and hatred, sympathy and antipathy, the law of the universe? Philosophers, when they gave mechanical explanations of natural phenomena, came no nearer to the real solution of them. The mysterious 'Why?' remained untouched.... All their analyses could only darken with big words the plain fact that the water hated the oil with which it refused to mix, the lime loved the acid which it eagerly received into itself, and, like a lover, grew warm with the rapture of affection. Why not? What right had we to deny sensation, emotion, to them, any more than to ourselves? Was not the same universal spirit stirring in them as in us? And was it not by virtue of that spirit that we thought, and felt, and loved?--Then why not they, as well as we? If the one spirit permeated all things, if its all-energising presence linked the flower with the crystal {{as well as with the}} demon and the god, must it not link together also the two extremes of the great chain of being? bind even the nameless One itself to the smallest creature which bore its creative impress? What greater miracle in the attraction of a god or an angel, by material incense, symbols, and spells, than in the attraction of one soul to another by the material sounds of the human voice? Was the affinity between spirit and matter implied in that, more miraculous than the affinity between the soul and the body?--than the retention of that soul within that body by the breathing of material air, the eating of material food? Or even, if the physicists were right, and the soul were but a <b>material</b> <b>product</b> or energy of the nerves, and the sole law of the universe the laws of matter, then was not magic even more probable, more rational? Was it not fair by every analogy to suppose that there might be other, higher beings than ourselves, obedient to those laws, and therefore possible to be attracted, even as human beings were, by the baits of material sights and sounds?.... If spirit pervaded all things, then was magic probable; if nothing but matter had existence, magic was morally certain. All that remained in either case was the test of experience.... And had not that test been applied in every age, and asserted to succeed? What more rational, more philosophic action than to try herself those methods and ceremonies which she was assured on every hand had never failed but through the ignorance or unfitness of the neophyte?.... Abamnon must be right.... She dared not think him wrong; for if this last hope failed, what was there left but to eat and drink, for to-morrow we die? ...|$|E
