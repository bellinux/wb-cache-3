5|$|The early Archaic {{people living}} near <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> {{utilized}} the atlatl and harvested {{a wider variety}} of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had, while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rockshelters and rock art, and left evidence of animal processing and chert knapping. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde,</b> whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water.|$|E
5|$|Although the area's first Spanish explorers {{named the}} feature <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde,</b> {{the term is}} a misnomer, as true mesas are almost {{perfectly}} flat. Because <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is cuesta, not mesa. The park {{is made up of}} several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde's slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area's cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the cliff dwellings, <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> boasts a number of mesa-top ruins. Examples open to public access include the Far View Complex and Cedar Tree Tower on Chapin Mesa, and Badger House Community, on Wetherill Mesa.|$|E

5|$|<b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|This {{multi-storied}} ruin, {{the best-known}} cliff dwelling in <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde,</b> {{is located in}} the largest alcove {{in the center of the}} Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. Many of the rooms were brightly painted. Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> National Park.|$|E

5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along {{the path of the}} sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde's</b> Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory.|$|R
2500|$|Exterior filming mostly {{took place}} in Andalusia, {{southern}} Spain. Some of the locations used previously featured in Leone's Dollar Trilogy films; for example, the Almería Railway Station, used for the train sequence in For a Few Dollars More, returns in this film as <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde's</b> station. The flashback scenes with Sean and friends were shot at Howth Castle in Dublin, and Toner's Pub on Baggot Street, Dublin Ireland. As filming progressed, Leone modified the script: as he did not originally plan on directing Duck, You Sucker, he thought the script was [...] "conceived for an American filmmaker". Duck, You Sucker! {{was one of the}} last mainstream films shot in Techniscope.|$|R
5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E
5|$|In her {{quest to}} find Ancestral Puebloan settlements, Virginia McClurg, a {{journalist}} for the New York Daily Graphic, visited <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> in 1882 and 1885. Her party rediscovered Echo Cliff House, Three Tier House, and Balcony House in 1885; these discoveries inspired her {{to protect the}} dwellings and artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoan system brought large {{quantities}} of imported goods to <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> became isolated from the surrounding region. For approximately six hundred years, most Mesa Verdean farmers had lived in small, mesa-top homesteads {{of one or two}} families. They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water. This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century, but by the start of the 13th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields.|$|E

Later, Bauer, the Air Force captain who toured the base with Jimmy and his film crew, confronts him about entering the base under false pretenses and threatens to press charges if his commercial is not pulled off the air. Jimmy momentarily cracks (due to Bauer's arguments sounding similar to ones Chuck would use) but is ultimately unmoved by Bauer's threats. He points out that Bauer risks hurting his own career if {{the fact that he}} let unauthorized people onto the base comes to light, and that he could always call Fudge as a witness to sway the jury to his side. Bauer storms out but not before warning that [...] "the wheel is gonna turn." ...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : Climate {{disruption}} poses {{an unprecedented}} risk to western national parks THE NATIONAL PARKS IN THE AMERICAN WEST {{include some of}} the country’s most treasured places: the geysers of Yellowstone, the nation’s first national park; the gorges of Grand Canyon; Yosemite’s dramatic rock domes; and <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde’s</b> cliff dwellings. To preserve these national treasures for all time, Congress directed the National Park Service (NPS) to manage them “in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. ” 1 Congress believed that NPS could preserve the national parks unimpaired by managing properly the resources and uses within the parks. Now, however, the continued ability of the national parks to bring enjoyment to the American people is at risk because of an unprecedented, external threat: climate change. A climate disrupted by human activities poses such sweeping threats to the scenery, natural and cultural resources, and wildlife of the national parks and to our enjoyment of the parks that it dwarfs all previous risks to these American treasures. Climate disruption and its cause...|$|R
500|$|Mesa Verdean villages thrived {{during the}} mid-Pueblo III Era, when architects {{constructed}} massive, multi-story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. Structures built {{during this period}} {{have been described as}} [...] "among the world's greatest archaeological treasures". Pueblo III masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years, more than double the usable lifespan of the Pueblo II jacal structures. Others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more. Architectural innovations such as towers and multi-walled structures also appear during the Pueblo III Era. <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde's</b> population remained fairly stable during the 12th century drought. At the start of the 13th century, approximately 22,000 people lived there. The area saw moderate population increases during the following decades, and dramatic ones from 1225 to 1260. Most {{of the people in the}} region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as Yellow Jacket Pueblo, near Cortez, Colorado. Others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled. By 1260, the majority of Mesa Verdeans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people.|$|R
5|$|Rock art {{is found}} {{throughout}} the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common motifs in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes. As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes. Modern Hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Pei {{also drew}} {{inspiration}} from the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> cliff dwellings of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings. To this end, {{he called for a}} rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.|$|E

The lot had sat unused for about ten years before construction on the 215-unit complex began; Azulón at <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> opened in 2014. Several dozen palm and eucalyptus trees were saved and replanted on the site.|$|E
5|$|The highway, now a spur {{route of}} US91 via its {{connection}} to US191, runs through Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, {{as well as}} the tribal nations of the Navajo Nation and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. The highway passes by two mountains considered sacred by Native Americans: Ute Mountain and an extinct volcanic core named Shiprock. Other features along the route include <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> National Park and Dove Creek, Colorado, the self-proclaimed pinto-bean capital of the world.|$|E
5|$|Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of {{the early}} efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, {{starting}} in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde.</b> From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and Mug House.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{violence}} and cannibalism has been documented in the central <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered {{by members of the}} Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.|$|E
5|$|Occasional trappers and prospectors visited, {{with one}} prospector, John Moss, making his {{observations}} known in 1873. The following year, Moss led eminent photographer William Henry Jackson through Mancos Canyon, {{at the base}} of <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde.</b> There, Jackson both photographed and publicized a typical stone cliff dwelling. Geologist William H. Holmes retraced Jackson's route in 1875. Reports by both Jackson and Holmes were included in the 1876 report of the Hayden Survey, one of the four federally financed efforts to explore the American West. These and other publications led to proposals to systematically study Southwestern archaeological sites.|$|E
5|$|The McElmo Phase was {{a period}} in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, when major changes in {{ceramics}} and masonry techniques appeared in Chaco Canyon. Chacoans started using painted black-on-white pottery, and the masonry and layout of great houses built during the period, which was the last major construction era in the canyon, differs significantly from those built during the Bonito Phase (850 to 1140). Archeologists initially believed that the McElmo style was brought to Chaco Canyon by immigrants from <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde,</b> but subsequent research suggests the developments were of local origin. McElmo black-on-white pottery was abundant in later contexts at Chetro Ketl, and the problematic McElmo style masonry was used in several later additions to the building, including very characteristic Chaco-style kivas.|$|E
5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led {{to rapid}} {{depopulation}} {{in many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde,</b> causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E
5|$|Mug House {{is located}} on Wetherill Mesa; it {{contains}} 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found strung together at the site. Oak Tree House and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike. Spruce Tree House is the third-largest village, within several hundred feet of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time. Because of its protective location, it is well preserved. The short trail to Spruce Tree House begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum. The Square Tower House {{is one of the}} stops on the Mesa Top Loop Road driving tour. The tower is the tallest structure in <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde.</b>|$|E
5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|Eleven U.S. {{national}} parks – Arches, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Canyon, <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde,</b> Petrified Forest, Rocky Mountain, Saguaro, and Zion – {{are in the}} watershed, in addition to many national forests, state parks, and recreation areas. Hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and fishing are among the multiple recreation opportunities offered by these areas. Fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed, especially in the Rocky Mountains, because of polluted runoff from mining and agricultural activities. The Colorado's major reservoirs are also heavily traveled summer destinations. Houseboating and water-skiing are popular activities on Lakes Mead, Powell, Havasu, and Mojave, as well as Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Utah and Wyoming, and Navajo Reservoir in New Mexico and Colorado. Lake Powell and surrounding Glen Canyon National Recreation Area received more than twomillion visitors per year in 2007, while nearly 7.9million people visited Lake Mead and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in 2008. Colorado River recreation employs some 250,000 people and contributes $26billion each year to the Southwest economy.|$|E
5|$|The second unit filmed {{part of the}} prologue's 1912 segment from August 29 to September 3. The {{main unit}} began two days later with the circus train {{sequence}} at Alamosa, Colorado, on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. They filmed at Pagosa Springs on September 7, and then at Cortez on September 10. From September 14 to16, filming of Indiana falling into the train carriages took place in Los Angeles. The production then moved to Utah's Arches National Park to shoot more of the opening. A house in Antonito, Colorado {{was used for the}} Jones family home. The production had intended to film at <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> National Park, but Native American representatives had religious objections to its use. When Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn viewed a rough cut of the film in late 1988, they felt it suffered from a lack of action. The motorcycle chase was shot during post-production at Mount Tamalpais and Fairfax near Skywalker Ranch. The closing shot of Indiana, Henry, Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in Texas in early 1989.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pottery}} found in 9th century pueblos was sized for {{individuals}} or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on <b>Mesa</b> <b>Verde</b> grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that {{was easier to}} hold on to than regular grey wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over. Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.|$|E
