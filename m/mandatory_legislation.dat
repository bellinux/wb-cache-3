40|$|By {{focusing}} on developments between 1996 and 2006, this paper explains {{the reasons for}} one of Australia’s public health inconsistencies, the comparatively low adoption of adjusted water fluoridation in Queensland. As such, this work involved literature review and traditional historical method. In Queensland, parliamentary support for water fluoridation is conditional on community approval. Political ambivalence and {{the constraints of the}} “Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies Act (1963) ” Qld have hindered the advocacy of water fluoridation. The political circumstance surrounding the “Lord Mayor’s Taskforce on Fluoridation Report” (1997) influenced its findings and confirms that Australia’s biggest local authority, the Brisbane City Council, failed to authoritatively analyse water fluoridation. In 2004, a private member’s bill to mandate fluoridation failed in a spectacular fashion. In 2005, an official systems review of Queensland Health recommended public debate about water fluoridation. Our principal conclusion is that without <b>mandatory</b> <b>legislation,</b> widespread implementationof water fluoridation in Queensland is most unlikely...|$|E
40|$|Green roofs {{represent}} covering solutions, anciently applied, {{capable of}} significant impacts on many features {{of social and}} environmental sustainability: reduction of energy consumption, mitigation of microclimate in high-density urban contexts, hydrological cycle control. In Mediterranean climate we recognize an interesting potential for their implementation in Italian existing building heritage. With regard to energy performance, green roofs offer best results in summer; in winter, however, there are no noticeable advantages, compared to a traditional insulated roofing. At a larger scale, green roofs effectively counteract heat island effect acting on radiative heat exchanges. Their permeability, finally, allows an appropriate reduction of stormwater runoff rates directed to sewage system, so green roofs are connoted as effective solutions in containing climate change effects. This paper aims to assess briefly extensive green roofs implementation potential in existing buildings plane coverings. These interventions require careful feasibility assessment, with reference to structural, architectural and economic features; current <b>mandatory</b> <b>legislation</b> about buildings structural safety allows some argumentations concerning building types and constructional techniques...|$|E
40|$|A {{recent article}} {{advanced}} {{the argument that}} New South Wales <b>mandatory</b> reporting <b>legislation</b> requiring teachers to report suspected child abuse operates to require harm caused to children by school bullying to be reported by teachers to government child protection agencies. The article raises important issues concerning the nature and scope of <b>mandatory</b> reporting <b>legislation</b> in New South Wales and throughout Australia. In this article, we explore the argument's strengths and weaknesses. We conclude that, {{due to the nature}} and context of mandatory reporting laws, the nature of child protection systems, the differences between abuse perpetrated by parents or caregivers as opposed to bullying inflicted by children, and the presence of schoolbased responses to bullying, the more persuasive view is that the laws do not and should not require harm caused by school bullying to be reported by teachers to government child protection agencies...|$|R

40|$|Latin America is {{a region}} {{conformed}} by 20 countries {{characterized by a}} wide diversity among them, which can be demonstrated through several indicators such as rural population percentage, ethnicity, public health budget allocated and infant mortality rate; all these factors influence the extent of activities related to newborn screening.

30|$|Credibility doubts. Frameworks for {{reporting}} {{such as the}} GRI, which have been largely compliant with the EU directive 2014 / 95 /EU before it became <b>mandatory</b> <b>legislation,</b> are widely used. Yet, at times there are doubts {{as to whether the}} published information of the reports is true to the word (Fifka 2014, 5; Weber 2014, 97). On the communicator side, there is temptation to achieve advantages from positively communicated sustainability activities without carrying out the necessary efforts (Zimmermann 2016, 10 and 17). This deception is called greenwashing. By deliberately exaggerating or misreporting, companies try to be perceived in a more environmentally friendly and responsible manner (Weber 2014, 104). The intent is to gain advantages such as improved reputation, an improved awareness of the customer to purchase, or an improved motivation and recruiting of employees (Fifka 2014, 12; Weber 2014, 103). On the other hand, the credibility is at risk due to (unintentional) deception if information is left out. A recipient of information itself does not distinguish between these possibilities in his or her perception of truth (Köhnken 1990, 4).|$|E

40|$|The {{prevention}} of iodine deficiency through salt iodization {{has been recognized}} as a global success story, and China stands {{at the forefront of}} this achievement {{with one of the most}} successful programs in the world. High level political commitment, national <b>mandatory</b> <b>legislation,</b> a state-managed edible salt industry and a complex and highly sophisticated surveillance system have facilitated the success of the program. Challenges have arisen however, including: (i) concern that adequate iodine status in pregnant women cannot be achieved without causing above adequate iodine intakes in children; (ii) declining iodine intake as a result of reductions in salt consumption and increased consumption of processed foods, which may not be made with iodized salt; (iii) the existence of areas with high iodine content in the water; and (iv) declines in household use of iodized salt due to concerns about excess iodine intake and thyroid disease. This article reviews the achievements and challenges of the Chinese Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) Elimination Program and reflects on lessons learned and implications for other national salt iodization programs...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate on}} climate change has moved from a {{question}} of whether humans are responsible to how best to address man-made greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are the cause. The United States has yet to pass any legislation that aggressively and appropriately addresses this issue. In the absence of legislation mandating emission reductions, many voluntary GHG tracking and reduction programs have surfaced. The main objective of this project is to profile the participants of three differing GHG tracking and reduction programs in order to determine specific criteria used when deciding to join a particular program. The results conclude that the sector of the participant company could be a major determining factor when joining a voluntary program. Those companies in the highest emitting sectors tend to join the least stringent voluntary program that does not include reduction goals. Additionally, companies that are publically traded and produce end products for consumer use are more likely to join a more rigorous program that contains reduction goals. Finally, the creation of regulations for voluntary programs could serve as a basis for future <b>mandatory</b> <b>legislation...</b>|$|E
30|$|So far and to {{the best}} of our knowledge, no <b>mandatory</b> <b>legislation</b> {{enforcing}} anonymous job applications on a country-wide level has been introduced. One noticeable exception is a law that has been passed in France in 2006 which made anonymous job applications mandatory for firms with more than 50 employees—at least in principle. As the law lacks more detailed conditions for its range of coverage and no sanctions are applied in case of noncompliance, the legislation has basically no practical importance (Behaghel et al., 2011). It is nevertheless interesting that from time to time laws are proposed that would introduce anonymous job applications, even in countries where applications already include only a relatively small amount of personal information. For example, Hausman (2012) proposes anonymous hiring to be introduced in the United States. His concrete policy proposal goes even beyond the standard approach as selection interviews should also be eliminated. Interestingly, rather than applying sanctions in case of noncompliance, incentives for firms to hire anonymously shall be provided. These incentives could take, for example, the form of reduced liability insurance premiums. Another proposal of an amendment regarding anonymous resumes was made by the Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom in 2009. However, the proposal was rejected by the parliament.|$|E
