40|$|Reconstructing {{the feeding}} mode {{of the latest}} common {{ancestor}} of deuterostomes is key to elucidating the early evolution of feeding in chordates and allied phyla; however, it is debated whether the ancestral deuterostome was a tentaculate feeder or a pharyngeal filter feeder. To address this, we evaluated the hydrodynamics of feeding {{in a group of}} fossil stem-group echinoderms (cinctans) using computational fluid dynamics. We simulated water flow past three-dimensional digital models of a Cambrian fossil cinctan in a range of possible life positions, adopting both passive tentacular feeding and active pharyngeal filter feeding. The results demonstrate that an orientation with the mouth facing downstream of the current was optimal for drag and lift reduction. Moreover, they show that there was almost no flow to the mouth and associated <b>marginal</b> <b>groove</b> under simulations of passive feeding, whereas considerable flow towards the animal was observed for active feeding, which would have enhanced the transport of suspended particles to the mouth. This strongly suggests that cinctans were active pharyngeal filter feeders, like modern enteropneust hemichordates and urochordates, indicating that the ancestral deuterostome employed a similar feeding strategy...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} {{were made of}} the overall size of both the crown and its components of 91 mandibular premolar teeth of early hominids. The shape of the crown outline and the fissure pattern, and the expression of four morphological traits, were also recorded. Non-dental criteria were used to allocate the specimens into four major taxonomic categories (EAFROB, EAFHOM, SAFROB and SAFGRA), approximating to the hypodigms of, respectively, A. boisei, H. habilis and Homo sp., A. robustus and A. africanus. Those specimens {{that could not be}} so allocated were regarded as 'unknown'. Intertaxonomic overall size differences were established for both the P 3 and P 4, with the latter showing little overlap in crown size between the three taxonomic categories usually associated with East African sites (i. e. EAFROB, EAFHOM and SAFGRA). Crown shape is a better discriminator between taxonomic groups for P 3 than for P 4, with the P 3 s of EAFHOM showing less buccolingual expansion than the other taxonomic categories. Cusp number, the location of the lingual cusp and the expression of the median longitudinal fissure, show systematic variation between the main taxonomic categories, with the 'robust' taxa being distinguished by additional distal cusps, and a more deeply incised median longitudinal fissure, and EAFHOM being peculiar in having a distally situated lingual cusp. <b>Marginal</b> <b>grooves</b> show more overlap in their incidence and expression between taxonomic categories. Both the 'robust' australopithecine taxonomic categories have relatively large talonids, apparently {{at the expense of the}} size of the buccal cusp. The relative talonid enlargement was greater for P 3 than for P 4, a conclusion which is at variance with previous published assessments. Investigation of the allometric relationships between relative talonid size and overall crown size in the pooled 'non-robust' taxonomic categories did not suggest that talonid enlargement was a simple consequence of a larger-size crown. The results of multivariate analysis demonstrate that the absolute areas of the main cusps and the talonid provide marginally the more effective discrimination between the main taxonomic categories than do the relative areas of the cusp components. The removal of the simpler effects of overall size reduces the differences between taxa, but does not eliminate them. The data for the four taxonomic categories were used as a reference framework for the investigation of the affinities of those teeth in the unknown category for which detailed data were available.

40|$|D. Phil. Branchiuran {{crustaceans}} {{are fairly}} common parasites of freshwater fishes in Africa and are presently represented by {{not more than}} 200 described species belonging to four genera, namely: Argulus Miiller, 1785; Dolops Audouin, 1837; Chonopeltis Thiele, 1900; and Dipteropeltis Calman, 1912. Chonopeltis is, however, {{the only one of}} these genera which is endemic to Africa and species of this genus have been reported from a number of different freshwater fish hosts and localities throughout the Ethiopic region. Although 13 species of Chonopeltis have hitherto been described, lack of morphological detail and morphometric data in taxonomic and subsequent descriptions, has led to confusion and much controversy as to, for instance, the phylogenetic origin, identity and function of various structures. Consequently, the validity of the taxonomic identity or status and affinities of the various species are questionable. Lack of important morphological information has also caused a considerable number of gaps and deficiencies in our present understanding of various aspects of ecological and pathogenetic significance. In the present study, a comprehensive investigation on various aspects of the morphology, anatomy and histology of adult Chonopeltis specimens was conducted, using not only light microscopy, but also scanning electron microscopy (SEM), histological microtomizing and staining techniques and graphic reconstruction. This investigation is based on several specimens of Chonopeltis victori Avenant-Oldewage, 1991 collected during surveys of freshwater fish parasites in 1990 and 1991 from four different fish hosts, namely: Labeo rosae S teindachner, 1894; L. congoro Peters, 1852; L. ruddi Boulenger, 1907; and Barbus marequensis A. Smith, 1841, sampled at various localities in the Olifants River in the Kruger National Park, as well as several C. australis Boxshal 1, 1976 specimens found on L. capensis (A. Smith, 1841) and L. umbratus (A. Smith, 1841), sampled in Boskop Dam near Potchefstroom. By making use of the mentioned methods of investigation a more complete and reliable morphological description of the distinctive external structures, as well as the internal structures of the cephalic shield alae and especially the reproductive system of these parasites could be given. With the aid of semi-thin (2 am) serial sections and graphic reconstruction the various components of the reproductive systems could clearly be identified and the mutual relations and histomorphology of these components be described, discussed and compared with those of other members of the Branchiura. In an attempt to determine the true taxonomic position and relationships of the recognised species of Chonopeltis, the original descriptions, morphometric data, geographical distribution, hosts and affinities are compared, summarised and discussed. The {{results of the present study}} reveal a horseshoe-shaped furrow dorsally that separates the alae from the cephalon. Ventrally the frontal ala contains two <b>marginal</b> chitinous <b>grooves</b> and four sclerotized ridges which support the frontal ala. Two pairs of dorso-ventrally orientated muscles account for the movements of the frontal ala, whilst the movements of each lateral ala are controlled by a pair of transverse muscles and some longitudinal muscles. The lateral alae appear to represent the fused pleurae of the cephalic segments. The male reproductive tract consists of paired testes, vasa efferentia, vasa deferentia, ejaculatory ducts and prostate complex as well as a single median seminal vesicle and a genital atrium. Several prominent secondary sexual structures occur on the four pairs of thoracopods. The mechanism of sperm transfer presumably involves a process during which the two female spermathecal spines, being inserted into the male genital atrium, penetrate the walls of the respective ejaculatory ducts whereafter semen is actively pumped into the spermathecal vesicles. The female reproductive tract consists of a single large ovary, two anteriorly fused oviducts of which only one is functional, a genital atrium, a single median genital aperture and a crescent-shaped fertilization chamber. The paired spermathecae, each consisting of a spermathecal vesicle, duct and spine, is located separately in the abdomen and are of considerable significance during sperm transfer from the male as well as during oviposition when stored semen is presumably injected into the yet uninseminated ova. Finally, aspects on the ecology of C. victori concerning the reproductive cycle, life cycle, and epidemiology are investigated, compared and discussed...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2012. Major: Computer science. Advisor:Professor Ravi Janardan. xi, 140 pages. Computer-based virtual {{treatment}} {{planning and}} simulation {{has become increasingly}} important in orthodontics due to its potential to lower costs and provide better treatment outcomes. However, its clinical use is currently limited by the need for significant human intervention in segmenting the dental arch (a 3 -dimensional surface mesh) into individual tooth objects and then (re) aligning these tooth objects on the arch to satisfy prescribed treatment criteria. The goals of this thesis are to develop modeling techniques, computational algorithms, and associated software to automate key components of the treatment process, including dental arch segmentation, feature identification, and tooth alignment, thereby making the advantages of virtual treatment planning and simulation available to {{the vast majority of}} orthodontic patients. Towards this end, this thesis makes the following contributions: First, an algorithm is designed to segment a dental arch into individual tooth objects (sub-meshes) that can be manipulated downstream in the treatment planning and simulation pipeline. The algorithm is largely automated and requires human intervention in very difficult or unusual cases only. The algorithm avoids the limitations of known approaches to dental segmentation by dividing the segmentation task into two key subtasks—separation of the gums from the teeth and separation of the teeth from one another—and also incorporates a new technique to repair defects in the gumline caused by noise in the data. Second, algorithms are developed to automatically identify suitable features on the surfaces of individual tooth objects for use in the alignment stage. These include intrinsic features such as cusps, incisal edges, <b>grooves,</b> <b>marginal</b> ridges, and the occlusal surface boundary, as well as derived features such as the archform and occlusal plane. A key technique underlying some of these algorithms is the identification and clustering of vertices of high curvature on certain planar cross-sections of the tooth objects and stitching these clusters together to extract the features of interest. Third, an algorithm is developed to automatically align the tooth objects on two opposing arches so that the best possible intra-arch and inter-arch occlusion (i. e., contact relationship) of teeth is achieved, while respecting certain natural dental constraints. The alignment process is modeled as a simulation-based optimization of certain configurations of constraints defined with respect to the tooth features identified previously. The simulation is based on a spring-mass model where the teeth gradually move to their final positions under the influence of forces exerted by (hypothetical) springs attached to the features. Finally, all of the algorithms developed in this thesis have been implemented and incorporated into a comprehensive software tool. This tool has been used by dental practitioners to evaluate and validate the algorithms on clinical data. These experimental studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the algorithms for orthodontic treatment planning...|$|R
