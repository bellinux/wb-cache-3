The larger boats, {{which used}} the <b>Main</b> <b>Fish</b> Pier on Northern Avenue, fished the Grand Banks and stayed out {{for weeks at}} a time, {{returning}} with frozen fish. The Italian fleet used Fiske Wharf and Packet Pier (where the Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park is now). The Italian fishermen, who lived in the North and West Ends, were immigrants from Sciacca, Sicily, a major fishing port. One of the religious traditions they brought with them from Sciacca was an annual feast in honor of the Madonna del Soccorso (see Festivals). In their small boats, they fished Massachusetts Bay off Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket, returning after three or four days with fresh fish, mostly haddock. Fresh haddock {{came to be known as}} [...] haddock because it was brought in by the Italians.|$|E
