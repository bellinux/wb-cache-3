40|$|Tests were {{performed}} to minimize accelerator grid erosion of a 5 -cm diameter Kaufman ion thruster due to direct beam impingement. Several different screen hole diameters, pillow-shape-square screen holes, and dished screen grids were tried. The optimization was accomplished by copper plating the accelerator grid before testing each grid configuration on a thruster for a 2 -hour run. The thruster beam sputtered copper and molybdenum from the accelerator grid where the beam impinged.

The 1 -MW source <b>accelerator</b> <b>system</b> consists of a 400 -MeV H{sup {minus}} linac with 2. 5 MeV energy spread in the 75 % chopped (25 % removed) beam and a 30 -Hz RCS that accelerates the 400 -MeV beam to 2 GeV. The time averaged current of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>system</b> is 0. 5 mA, equivalent to 1. 04 {times} 10 {sup 14 } protons per pulse.
