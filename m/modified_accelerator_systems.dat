40|$|Tests were {{performed}} to minimize accelerator grid erosion of a 5 -cm diameter Kaufman ion thruster due to direct beam impingement. Several different screen hole diameters, pillow-shape-square screen holes, and dished screen grids were tried. The optimization was accomplished by copper plating the accelerator grid before testing each grid configuration on a thruster for a 2 -hour run. The thruster beam sputtered copper and molybdenum from the accelerator grid where the beam impinged.
