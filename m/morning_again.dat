5|$|Early on 1 September 1939, Germany {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Poland. Schleswig-Holstein had been positioned in the port of Danzig, moored close to the Polish ammunition depot at Westerplatte {{under the guise of}} a ceremonial visit in August. At 04:47 on 1 September, Schleswig-Holstein opened fire with her main battery at the Polish positions on the Westerplatte, and in doing so fired the first shots of World War II. These shots were the signal for ground troops to begin their assault on the installation; though the first German ground attack in the Battle of Westerplatte was repelled shortly thereafter. A second assault began later that <b>morning,</b> <b>again</b> supported by Schleswig-Holstein, though it too had failed to break into the installation by around noon.|$|E
500|$|In [...] Ashdod is {{mentioned}} among the principal Philistine cities. After capturing the Ark of the covenant from the Israelites, the Philistines {{took it to}} Ashdod {{and placed it in}} the temple of Dagon. The next morning Dagon was found prostrate before the Ark; on being restored to his place, he was on the following <b>morning</b> <b>again</b> found prostrate and broken. The people of Ashdod were smitten with boils; a plague of mice was sent over the land (1 Samuel 6:5).|$|E
500|$|They {{look up at}} {{the awesome}} West wall of the {{mountain}} above them. They walk up the glacier wearing new crampons, probing for crevasses with their ice-axes. They cross the bergschrund and climb [...] "a few feet of easy rock". Carless suggests rappelling 200 feet (60 m) to the next glacier. They agree [...] "it would be difficult" [...] to get back if they did that. They return to their base camp and try again the next <b>morning,</b> <b>again</b> finding their way blocked. They wish the climbing waitresses from Wales were with them.|$|E
50|$|Gonzo {{worked at}} KVGS again in 2009, first hosting PM drive, then <b>mornings</b> <b>again.</b> The station changed formats to BOB-FM, and he {{continued}} to work mornings until his departure from the station in 2013.|$|R
60|$|The next <b>morning</b> Hilda <b>again</b> {{drove up}} with Netta to see Mr. Pettigrew.|$|R

500|$|On November 6, Mondale and Ferraro {{lost the}} general {{election}} in a landslide. They received only 41percent {{of the popular vote}} compared to Reagan and Bush's 59percent, and in the Electoral College won only Mondale's home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. The ticket even lost Ferraro's to congressional district, which had long been one of the more conservative districts in New York City; it tended to vote Republican in presidential races. Ferraro's presence on the ticket had little measurable effect overall. Reagan captured 55percent of women voters and about the same share of Catholic voters, the latter being the highest level yet for a Republican presidential candidate. Of the tenth of voters who decided based on the vice-presidential candidates, 54percent went to Mondale–Ferraro, establishing that Ferraro provided a net gain to the Democrats of 0.8percent. Reagan's personal appeal and campaign themes of prosperity and [...] "It's <b>morning</b> <b>again</b> in America" [...] were quite strong, while Mondale's liberal campaign alienated Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who usually voted Democratic. Political observers generally agree that no combination of Democrats could have won the election in 1984. Mondale himself would later reflect that [...] "I knew that I was in for it with Reagan" [...] and that he had no regrets about choosing Ferraro.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Paxton {{made his}} first tour of the United Kingdom. The tour was the {{beginning}} of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included yearly performances there. He met Bruce Woodley, one of the founding members of the Australian folk group The Seekers and they collaborated on the song [...] "Angeline (Is Always Friday)" [...] which The Seekers recorded and featured in their concerts, TV shows and a DVD. In 1967, the rock group Clear Light recorded a menacing and lengthy psychedelic version of Paxton's song [...] "Mr. Blue" [...] on their only album Clear Light. [...] Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton's recording of [...] "The Last Thing on My Mind" [...] reached the top ten on the U.S. country singles charts in December 1967. [...] Then in 1968, Paxton scored a Top 10 radio hit when The Fireballs recorded his song [...] "Bottle of Wine". [...] In the 1960s, Paxton licensed one of his songs, [...] "My Dog's Bigger than Your Dog", for use in a Ken-L Ration dog food commercial. [...] Not too fazed by the success of some of his songs, Paxton continued writing and performing. He was not interested in jumping on the folk rock (or, as he once joked, [...] "folk rot") bandwagon though, and continued his folk singer-songwriter style on albums like Outward Bound (1966) and <b>Morning</b> <b>Again</b> (1968). [...] On January 20, 1968, three months after the death of Woody Guthrie, Paxton and a number of other prominent folk musicians performed at the Harold Leventhal produced [...] "A Tribute to Woody Guthrie" [...] concert at New York City's Carnegie Hall.|$|E
60|$|In the <b>morning</b> <b>again</b> {{she must}} go to school. She {{got up and went}} without murmuring even to herself. She was in the hands of some bigger, stronger, coarser will.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Tedious traipsing {{enough with}} this one, Nat. Sit ye down. Well, little Freddy, you don't wish {{in the morning}} that 'twere evening, and at evening that 'twere <b>morning</b> <b>again,</b> do you, Freddy, trust ye for it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came chiefly because grandmamma was a {{good deal}} {{concerned}} at your not coming home to luncheon. You must not be out the whole <b>morning</b> <b>again</b> just at present. I have some sandwiches in my pocket for you." ...|$|E
60|$|In the <b>morning,</b> <b>again,</b> it was Bertha who betrayed {{an uneasy}} restlessness, and irrepressible desire to banish Miss Fennimore and Maria from the drawing-room, till the governess, in perplexity, {{began to think}} of {{consulting}} Phoebe whether a Jack Hastings affair could be coming over again.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the next}} <b>morning</b> he <b>again</b> {{went to his}} office, {{and in the course}} of the morning a note was brought to him from Undy. It ran as follows:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Unless I miss my guess, {{they have}} {{had some sort of}} quarrel among themselves,” remarked Phil. “They were disputing over {{something}} early this <b>morning</b> and <b>again</b> just before dinner.” ...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{learning}} about this, the bakers surround Tanya and yell abuse at her. After regaining her composure, she rebukes them. Afterwards, Tanya never stops {{by at the}} bakery for <b>morning</b> biscuits <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{balance of}} the night dragged so slowly that Tom thought it would never come <b>morning</b> <b>again.</b> With the first streak {{of light in the}} East he arose from the rock upon which he had thrown himself, and running to a higher point gazed eagerly around him.|$|E
60|$|This sub-Amanda was {{perceptible}} next <b>morning</b> <b>again,</b> flitting {{about in}} the background of a glad and loving adventuress, a pre-occupied Amanda who had put her head down while the real Amanda flung her chin up and contemplated things on the Asiatic scale, and who was apparently engaged in disentangling something obscure connected with Mr. Rathbone-Sanders that ought never to have been entangled....|$|E
60|$|We left Zermatt in a wagon--and in a rain-storm, too--for St. Nicholas {{about ten}} o'clock one <b>morning.</b> <b>Again</b> we passed between those grass-clad prodigious cliffs, specked with wee {{dwellings}} peeping over {{at us from}} velvety green walls ten and twelve hundred feet high. It did not seem possible that the imaginary chamois even could climb those precipices. Lovers on opposite cliffs probably kiss through a spy-glass, and correspond with a rifle.|$|E
60|$|The next <b>morning,</b> being <b>again</b> {{settled in}} my rooms in Walford, I went {{to call upon}} the Doctor and his {{daughter}}. The Doctor was not at home, but his daughter {{was glad to see}} me.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} (that present <b>morning),</b> being <b>again</b> in {{attendance}} as usual, the maid had found Lady Harry {{in a more}} indulgent frame of mind; still troubled by anxieties, but willing to speak of them now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now you can. You will work, I suppose," [...] she continued; [...] "you'll {{work all}} the <b>morning</b> and <b>again</b> after tea and perhaps at night. You won't have people always coming about you to interrupt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{else can}} you expect?' said Mrs. Lemon. 'Your stomach {{is the size of}} two. Go and take {{exercise}} directly. Mrs. Black, come here to me. Now, here is a child, Mrs. Orange, ma'am, who is always at play. She can't be kept at home a single day together; always gadding about and spoiling her clothes. Play, play, play, play, from morning to night, and to <b>morning</b> <b>again.</b> How can she expect to improve?' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wrote to}} her, therefore, begging her {{to pay all}} these debts, and promised myself on Monday <b>morning</b> <b>again</b> {{to be with my}} dear wife. Gus carried off the letter, and promised to deliver it in Bernhard Street after church-time; taking care that Mary should know nothing at all of the painful {{situation}} in which I was placed. It was near midnight when we parted, and I tried to sleep as well as I could in the dirty little sofa-bedstead of Mr. Aminadab's back-parlour.|$|E
60|$|Some {{weeks after}} the little home-breeze which I have just related, had died away into a perfect calm, I was accidentally witness of another {{domestic}} dilemma in which Margaret bore a principal share. On this occasion, as I {{walked up to the}} house (in the <b>morning</b> <b>again),</b> I found the front door open. A pail was on the steps--the servant had evidently been washing them, had been interrupted in her work, and had forgotten to close the door when she left it. The nature of the interruption I soon discovered as I entered the hall.|$|E
60|$|In the <b>morning</b> they <b>again</b> started. They {{were just}} issuing from the ravine when {{a party of}} ten armed men made their {{appearance}} from amongst some rocks, and shouted to them to halt. Dias rode in front.|$|R
6000|$|This statement, {{prepared}} after dinner, Mr. Gladstone took to Lord Granville {{that night}} (March 14). The next <b>morning</b> he <b>again</b> saw Lord Granville and Colonel Ponsonby, and despatched his {{statement to the}} Queen. “At 2.45,” he writes to Granville:— ...|$|R
60|$|That <b>morning</b> we <b>again</b> {{attended}} in the Throne Hall, and I {{could not}} help smiling to myself when I compared the visit to our last, and reflecting that, if walls could speak, they would have strange tales to tell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] and Bob spoke {{like one}} who has already decided the matter in his own mind, [...] "my idea is that they won't stop this side of Babcock, and I am certain they won't stop in the town. So I think we shall be safe to drive as far as there. The chances are that the thieves will drive through the town in the night, and stop in the first likely place they come to on the other side. We can start in the <b>morning</b> <b>again,</b> about as early as they can." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the general}} {{had given him}} three days' leave, Vincent was able to stay to see {{the close of the}} affair, and early next <b>morning</b> <b>again</b> rode down to Sewell's Point, as the Merrimac was to start at daybreak. At six o'clock the ironclad came out from the river and made for the Minnesota, which was still aground. The latter was seen to run up a signal, and the spectators saw an object which they had not before {{perceived}} coming out as if to meet the ram. The glasses were directed toward it, and a general exclamation of surprise was heard.|$|E
6000|$|December 1.--This <b>morning</b> <b>again</b> I was idle. But I must work, and so I will to-morrow {{whether the}} missing sheets arrive, ay or no, by goles! After Court I went with Lord Wriothesley Russell,[84] to Dalkeith House, {{to see the}} pictures; Charles K. Sharpe alongst with us. We {{satisfied}} ourselves that they have actually frames, and that, I think, was all we could be sure of. Lord Wriothesley, who is a very pleasant young man, well-informed, and with some turn for humour, dined with us, and Mr. Davidoff met him. The Misses Kerr also dined and spent the evening with us {{in that sort of}} society which I like best. Charles Sharpe came in and we laughed over oysters and sherry, ...|$|E
60|$|We {{spent an}} {{agreeable}} evening; and {{early on the}} following <b>morning</b> started <b>again</b> on our journey, having received an agreeable addition to our party {{in the person of}} Miss Jessie Russ, second daughter of Mr Russ, from whom we had just parted.|$|R
60|$|The next <b>morning,</b> he <b>again</b> {{went off}} to the Sutherland. He was in high spirits, for his name had {{appeared}} in orders as captain, and as appointed assistant quartermaster general on the headquarter staff. On entering the general's cabin, he thanked him for the promotion.|$|R
60|$|The king {{returned}} home at night, {{but his wife}} told him nothing of what had happened, and the next <b>morning</b> she <b>again</b> begged the prince to go out hunting with his father. Sigurd, however, replied as before, that he would much rather stay at home.|$|R
