5|$|Once food {{leaves the}} crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in {{numbered}} diagram), {{also known as}} the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called <b>microvilli,</b> increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the <b>microvilli</b> and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized <b>microvilli</b> producing digestive enzymes may more likely be {{near the end of the}} midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.|$|E
5|$|Strains that possess flagella are motile. The flagella have a peritrichous arrangement. It also {{attaches}} and effaces to the <b>microvilli</b> of {{the intestines}} via an adhesion molecule known as intimin.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and <b>microvilli.</b> The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are <b>microvilli</b> on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as <b>microvilli,</b> cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E

25|$|These choanoflagellates {{are able}} to attach to one another via the pairing of collar <b>microvilli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Distortions in {{the taste}} buds may {{give rise to}} dysgeusia. In a study {{conducted}} by Masahide Yasuda and Hitoshi Tomita from Nihon University of Japan, it has been observed that patients suffering from this taste disorder have fewer <b>microvilli</b> than normal. In addition, the nucleus and cytoplasm of the taste bud cells have been reduced. Based on their findings, dygeusia results from loss of <b>microvilli</b> and the reduction of Type III intracellular vesicles, all of which could potentially interfere with the gustatory pathway.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{alterations}} {{are also}} seen in necrosis. Plasma membranes appear discontinuous when viewed with an electron microscope. This discontinuous membrane {{is caused by}} cell blebbing {{and the loss of}} <b>microvilli.</b>|$|E
25|$|The goblet cell {{is highly}} {{polarized}} with the nucleus and other organelles concentrated {{at the base}} of the cell and secretory granules containing mucin, at the apical surface. The apical plasma membrane projects <b>microvilli</b> to give an increased surface area for secretion.|$|E
25|$|The mucosa, {{the outer}} {{portion of the}} {{gallbladder}} wall, consists of a lining of a single layer of columnar cells, with cells possessing small hair-like attachments called <b>microvilli.</b> This sits on a thin later of connective tissue, the lamina propria. The mucosa is curved and collected into tiny outpouchings called rugae.|$|E
25|$|In {{humans and}} other mammals, sucrose is {{broken down into}} its {{constituent}} monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, by sucrase or isomaltase glycoside hydrolases, which {{are located in the}} membrane of the <b>microvilli</b> lining the duodenum. The resulting glucose and fructose molecules are then rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. In bacteria and some animals, sucrose is digested by the enzyme invertase.|$|E
25|$|The {{gallbladder}} wall {{is composed}} {{of a number of}} layers. The gallbladder wall's innermost surface is lined by a single layer of columnar cells with a brush border of <b>microvilli,</b> very similar to intestinal absorptive cells. Underneath the epithelium is an underlying lamina propria, a muscular layer, an outer perimuscular layer and serosa. Unlike elsewhere in the intestinal tract, the gallbladder does not have a muscularis mucosae, and the muscular fibres are not arranged in distinct layers.|$|E
25|$|Satellite glial {{cells in}} sensory ganglia are laminar cells that most often an {{envelope}} of multiple SGCs completely surrounds each sensory neuron. The number of SGCs {{that make up}} the sheath increases proportionately with the volume of the neuron which it surrounds. Additionally, the volume of the sheath itself increases proportionately with the volume and surface area of the neuron’s somata. The distance of extracellular space between the sheath and the neuronal plasma membrane measures , allowing the neuron and its SGC sheath to form a single anatomical and functional unit. These individual units are separated by areas of connective tissue. However, there are some sensory neurons that occupy the same space within connective tissue and are therefore grouped together in a “cluster” of two or three neurons. Most often each individual neuron in a cluster is still surrounded by its own SGC sheath, but in some cases it is missing. Some sensory neurons have small projections called <b>microvilli</b> that extend outward from their cell surfaces. Due to their close proximity to the SGC sheath, these <b>microvilli</b> of the neuronal plasma membrane reach into the grooves of the sheath, allowing for possible exchange of materials between the cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} {{contains}} {{many types of}} cells and a human can be killed {{by the loss of}} a single type of cells in a vital organ. For many short term radiation deaths (3 days to 30 days), the loss of two important types of cells that are constantly being regenerated causes death. The loss of cells forming blood cells (bone marrow) and the cells in the digestive system (<b>microvilli</b> which form part of the wall of the intestines) is fatal.|$|E
25|$|Those {{afflicted with}} various {{gastrointestinal}} diseases {{may also be}} at risk for deficiency as a result of malabsorption. These diseases may affect production of intrinsic factor in the stomach, or of pancreatic bile. Diseases that involve disorders of the small intestine, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease and ileitis, may also reduce B12 absorption. For example, people with Celiac's disease may damage the <b>microvilli</b> within their small intestines through the consumption of gluten, thereby inhibiting absorption of B12 as well as other nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Boettcher's {{cells are}} found in the organ of Corti where they are present only in the lower turn of the cochlea. They lie on the basilar {{membrane}} beneath Claudius' cells and are organized in rows with the number of rows the number of which varies between species. The cells interdigitate with each other, and project <b>microvilli</b> into the intercellular space. They are supporting cells for the auditory hair cells in the organ of Corti. They are named after German pathologist Arthur Böttcher (1831-1889).|$|E
25|$|Each {{photoreceptor}} cell {{consists of}} two main sections, the cell body and the rhabdomere. The cell body contains the nucleus, while the 100-μm-long rhabdomere {{is made up of}} toothbrush-like stacks of membrane called <b>microvilli.</b> Each microvillus is 1–2 μm in length and about 60 nm in diameter. The membrane of the rhabdomere is packed with about 100 million rhodopsin molecules, the visual protein that absorbs light. The rest of the visual proteins are also tightly packed into the microvillar space, leaving little room for cytoplasm.|$|E
25|$|Convincing {{evidence}} {{to settle the}} debate was offered by Oberling et al. in 1959 who studied the ultrastructure of clear cells from eight renal carcinomas. They found that the tumour cell cytoplasm contained numerous mitochondria and deposits of glycogen and fat. They identified cytoplasmic membranes inserted perpendicularly onto the basement membrane with occasional cells containing <b>microvilli</b> along the free borders. They concluded that these features indicated that the tumours arose from the epithelial cells of the renal convoluted tubule, thus finally settling {{one of the most}} debated issues in tumour pathology.|$|E
25|$|A single {{taste bud}} is {{composed}} of four different types of cells, and each taste bud has at least 30 to 80 cells. Type I cells are thinly shaped, usually in the periphery of other cells. They also contain high amounts of chromatin. Type II cells have prominent nuclei and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple mitochondria and large vesicles. Type I, II, and III cells also contain synapses. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the taste bud. Every cell in the taste bud forms <b>microvilli</b> at the ends.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} of {{gastrulation}} is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ingression of primary mesenchyme cells into the blastocoel. Primary mesenchyme cells, or PMCs, {{are located in the}} vegetal plate specified to become mesoderm. Prior to ingression, PMCs exhibit all the features of other epithelial cells that comprise the embryo. Cells of the epithelium are bound basally to a laminal matrix and apically to an extraembryonic matrix. The apical <b>microvilli</b> of these cells reach into the hyaline layer, a component of the extraembryonic matrix. Neighboring epithelial cells are also connected to each other through apical junctions, protein complexes containing adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, linked to catenins.|$|E
25|$|An October 2014 {{publication}} {{by researchers}} from the University of Queensland stated that the compound eyes of mantis shrimp can detect cancer and the activity of neurons, because they are sensitive to detecting polarised light that reflects differently from cancerous and healthy tissue. The study claims that this ability can be replicated through a camera {{through the use of}} aluminium nanowires to replicate polarisation-filtering <b>microvilli</b> on top of photodiodes. In February 2016 it was also revealed that the shrimps are using a form of reflector of polarised light not seen in nature or human technology before. It allows the manipulation of light across the structure rather than through its depth, the typical way polarisers work. This allows the structure to be both small and microscopically thin, and still be able to produce big, bright, colourful polarised signals.|$|E
25|$|As PMCs {{begin to}} undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the lamina which binds them dissolves {{to begin the}} {{mechanical}} release of the cells. Expression of the membrane protein that binds laminin, integrin, also becomes irregular {{at the beginning of}} ingression. The <b>microvilli</b> which secure PMCs to the hyaline layer shorten, as the cells reduce their affinity for the extraembryonic matrix. These cells concurrently increase their affinity for other components of the basal matrix, such as fibronectin, in part driving the movement of cells inward. The apical junctions which bind PMCs to their neighboring epithelial cells become disrupted during this transition, and are absent in cells that have fully ingressed into the blastocoel. Because staining for cadherins and catenins in ingressing cells decreases and develops as intracellular accumulations, apical junctions are thought to be cleared by endocytosis during ingression.|$|E

These combinations of flame cells and tube cells are called protonephridia.|$|E

2500|$|Choanoflagellates, {{also called}} [...] "collar-flagellates" [...] are {{unicellular}} protists {{that exist in}} both freshwaters and oceans. Choanoflagellates have a spherical (or ovoid) cell body and a flagellum that {{is surrounded by a}} collar composed of actin <b>microvilli.</b> The flagellum is used to facilitate movement and food intake. As the flagellum beats, it takes in water through the <b>microvilli</b> attached to the collar, which helps filter out unwanted bacteria and other tiny food particles. Choanoflagellates are composed of approximately 150 species and reproduce by simple division.|$|E
2500|$|Feline enteric {{coronavirus}} {{is responsible}} for an infection of the mature gastrointestinal epithelial cells (see also enterocytes, brush border, <b>microvilli,</b> villi). This intestinal infection has few outward signs, and is usually chronic. The virus is excreted in the feces of the healthy carrier, and can be detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction or [...] "PCR" [...] of feces or by PCR testing of rectal samples.|$|E
2500|$|As few as 2 to 10 oocysts can {{initiate}} an infection. [...] The parasite {{is located}} in the brush border of the epithelial cells of the small intestine. [...] They are mainly located in the jejunum. [...] When the sporozoites attach the epithelial cells’ membrane envelops them. [...] Thus, they are “intracellular but extracytoplasmic”. [...] The parasite can cause damage to the <b>microvilli</b> where it attaches. [...] The infected human excretes the most oocysts during the first week. [...] Oocysts can be excreted for weeks after the diarrhea subsides from infections by C. parvum or C. hominis; however, immunocompetent individuals with C. muris infections have been observed excreting oocysts for seven months.|$|E
2500|$|Cryptosporidium spp. {{exist as}} {{multiple}} cell types which correspond to different stages in an infection (e.g., a sexual and asexual stage). As an oocyst – {{a type of}} hardy, thick-walled spore – it can survive in the environment for months and is resistant to many common disinfectants, particularly chlorine-based disinfectants. After being ingested, the sporozoites within oocysts excyst (i.e., are released) in the small intestine. [...] The released sporozoites subsequently attach to the <b>microvilli</b> of the epithelial cells of the small intestine. [...] From there they become trophozoites that reproduce asexually by multiple fission, {{a process known as}} schizogony. [...] The trophozoites develop into Type 1 meronts [...] that contain 8 daughter cells.|$|E
2500|$|CRISPR can be {{utilized}} to create human cellular models of disease. For instance, applied to human {{pluripotent stem cells}} CRISPR introduced targeted mutations in genes relevant to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). These CRISPR-modified pluripotent stem cells were subsequently grown into human kidney organoids that exhibited disease-specific phenotypes. Kidney organoids from stem cells with PKD mutations formed large, translucent cyst structures from kidney tubules. The cysts were capable of reaching macroscopic dimensions, up to one centimeter in diameter. Kidney organoids with mutations in a gene linked to FSGS developed junctional defects between podocytes, the filtering cells affected in that disease. This was traced to the inability of podocytes ability to form <b>microvilli</b> between adjacent cells. [...] Importantly, these disease phenotypes were absent in control organoids of identical genetic background, but lacking the CRISPR modifications.|$|E
2500|$|... 2. Mesenteron (midgut): Digestive enzymes in {{this region}} are {{produced}} and secreted into the lumen and here nutrients are absorbed into the insect’s body. Food is enveloped by {{this part of the}} gut as it arrives from the foregut by the peritrophic membrane which is a mucopolysaccharide layer secreted from the midgut’s epithelial cells. It is thought that this membrane prevents food pathogens from contacting the epithelium and attacking the insects’ body. It also acts as a filter allowing small molecules through, but preventing large molecules and particles of food from reaching the midgut cells. After the large substances are broken down into smaller ones, digestion and consequent nutrient absorption takes place at the surface of the epithelium. Microscopic projections from the mid-gut wall, called <b>microvilli,</b> increase surface area and allow for maximum absorption of nutrients.|$|E
2500|$|Digestion {{begins in}} the mouth with the {{secretion}} of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage {{the walls of the}} stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. [...] The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous <b>microvilli</b> to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine.|$|E
2500|$|Taste {{is a form}} of chemoreception {{which occurs}} in the {{specialised}} taste receptors in the mouth. To date, there are five different types of taste receptors known: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Each receptor has a different manner of sensory transduction: that is, of detecting the presence of a certain compound and starting an action potential which alerts the brain. It is a matter of debate whether each taste cell is tuned to one specific tastant or to several; Smith and Margolskee claim that [...] "gustatory neurons typically respond to more than one kind of stimulus, lthough each neuron responds most strongly to one tastant". Researchers believe that the brain interprets complex tastes by examining patterns from a large set of neuron responses. This enables the body to make [...] "keep or spit out" [...] decisions when {{there is more than one}} tastant present. [...] "No single neuron type alone is capable of discriminating among stimuli or different qualities, because a given cell can respond the same way to disparate stimuli." [...] As well, serotonin is thought to act as an intermediary hormone which communicates with taste cells within a taste bud, mediating the signals being sent to the brain. Receptor molecules are found on the top of <b>microvilli</b> of the taste cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microvilli</b> {{are covered}} in plasma membrane, which {{encloses}} cytoplasm and microfilaments. Though these are cellular extensions, there are little or no cellular organelles present in the <b>microvilli.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{retinula}} (literally, [...] "small retina") {{cells of}} the ommatidium of the compound eye contain areas from which membranous organelles of conceivable size (rhabdomeres) extend. Rhabdomeres have tiny <b>microvilli</b> (tiny tubes extending out of the retinula) that interlock with neighboring retinular cells. This forms the rhabdom, which contains the dendrite of the eccentric cell, and may also contribute some <b>microvilli.</b> The only other species with an eccentric cell is the silkworm moth. <b>Microvilli</b> are composed of a double layer, 7 nm each and with 3.5 nm space of two electron-deficient boundaries in between. Where the <b>microvilli</b> meet, these outer borders fuse and yield five membranes about 15 nm thick. In all arthropods, {{there is always a}} rhabdom below a crystalline cone, on or {{near the center of the}} ommatidium, and always aligned with the path of light. At right angles to the length of the rhabdome are the length of the <b>microvilli,</b> which are in line with each other. The <b>microvilli</b> are about 40-150 nm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|In structure, {{they are}} longer than typical <b>microvilli,</b> {{and have more}} of the {{characteristics}} of the cellular membrane proper. Like <b>microvilli,</b> they contain actin filaments, distinguishing them from microtubule-containing cilia.|$|E
