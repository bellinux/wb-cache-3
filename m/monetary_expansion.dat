5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated <b>monetary</b> <b>expansion</b> which will help the global economy.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} government consumption shocks on GDP using a panel of 21 developing economies. Our goal is {{to better understand the}} reasons for the low fiscal multipliers found in the literature by performing estimations for alternative exchange rate regimes, business-cycle phases, and monetary policy stances. In addition, we perform counterfactual simulations to analyze the possible gains from fiscal-monetary policy coordination. The results imply that government consumption shocks are usually followed by monetary policy tightening in developing economies with flexible regimes. Our simulations show that this reaction partially explains the presence of low fiscal multipliers in these economies. On the other hand, we find that government consumption shocks have better multipliers in developing economies during fixed regimes, economic booms and <b>monetary</b> <b>expansions.</b> In particular, implementing fiscal programs during <b>monetary</b> <b>expansions</b> seems to improve significantly their economic stimulus...|$|R

A mid February statement from the G7 affirmed the advanced economies commitment to avoid currency war. It was initially read by the markets as an endorsement of Japan's actions, though later clarification suggested the US would like Japan to tone down some of its language, specifically by not linking policies like QE to an expressed desire to devalue the Yen.

2500|$|This is {{one reason}} offered in support of free banking, a gold or silver standard, or at a minimum the {{reduction}} of political control over central banks. The latter could then take as their primary objective ensuring a stable value of currency by controlling <b>monetary</b> <b>expansion</b> and thus limiting inflation. Independence from government is required to reach this aim – indeed, {{it is well known}} in economic literature that governments face a conflict of interest in this regard. [...] In fact, [...] "hard money" [...] advocates argue that central banks have utterly failed to obtain the objective of a stable currency. [...] Under the gold standard, for example, the price level in both England and the US remained relatively stable over hundreds of years, though with some protracted periods of deflation. [...] Since the US Federal Reserve was formed in 1913, however, the US dollar has fallen to barely a twentieth of its former value through the consistently inflationary policies of the bank.

2500|$|..... he {{proximate}} {{cause of the}} world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard. ... For a variety of reasons, including a desire of the Federal Reserve to curb the US stock market boom, monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late 1920s—a contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard. What was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of 1931 instigated an international [...] "scramble for gold". Sterilization of gold inflows by surplus countries , substitution of gold for foreign exchange reserves, and runs on commercial banks all led to increases in the gold backing of money, and consequently to sharp unintended declines in national money supplies. Monetary contractions in turn were strongly associated with falling prices, output and employment. Effective international cooperation could in principle have permitted a worldwide <b>monetary</b> <b>expansion</b> despite gold standard constraints, but disputes over World War I reparations and war debts, and the insularity and inexperience of the Federal Reserve, among other factors, prevented this outcome. As a result, individual countries were able to escape the deflationary vortex only by unilaterally abandoning the gold standard and re-establishing domestic monetary stability, a process that dragged on in a halting and uncoordinated manner until France and the other Gold Bloc countries finally left gold in 1936. —Great Depression, B.
