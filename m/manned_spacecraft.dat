5|$|Several Gemini Ferry {{spacecraft}} were {{proposed to}} provide transportation of crews and cargo to NASA and USAF space stations in low Earth orbit. NASA contracted McDonnell {{to conduct a}} study into what modifications {{would be needed to}} allow the Gemini spacecraft to support this. Three spacecraft were envisioned; a <b>manned</b> <b>spacecraft</b> to transport crew to the stations, a <b>manned</b> <b>spacecraft</b> with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned spacecraft to resupply the station every three or four months.|$|E
5|$|The Manned Orbital Telescope was a {{proposal}} for a <b>manned</b> <b>spacecraft</b> for astronomical or solar observation. It would have used the larger reentry module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, and would have been launched on a Saturn IB. The enlarged reentry module was also considered for a spacecraft proposed at the same time, which would have been used to rescue the crews of <b>manned</b> <b>spacecraft</b> that were stranded in low Earth orbit. It would have launched atop a Titan IIIC, once in orbit it would have maneuvered by means of a Transtage integrated into the equipment module. The larger capsule would have been used to accommodate the crew of the spacecraft which required rescuing.|$|E
5|$|After {{the crew}} of Apollo 10 named their {{spacecraft}} Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center director George M. Low to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names Snowcone and Haystack were used {{and put in the}} news release, but the crew later decided to change them.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Space Race began, an early {{objective}} was to get a person into Earth orbit as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored. The US Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program considered many <b>manned</b> <b>spacecraft</b> designs, ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic space capsules. By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated {{in favor of the}} ballistic capsule.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft retired as a flight director to concentrate on management and mission planning. In 1972, he became director of the <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center (later Johnson Space Center), {{following in the footsteps of}} his mentor Robert R. Gilruth. He held the position until his 1982 retirement from NASA. During his retirement, Kraft has consulted for numerous companies including IBM and Rockwell International, and he published an autobiography entitled Flight: My Life in Mission Control.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Bond is {{dispatched}} to Japan after American and Soviet <b>manned</b> <b>spacecraft</b> disappear mysteriously in orbit.

The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld, who was previously a partially unseen character. SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power, implied to be the People's Republic of China, to provoke war between the superpowers.|$|E

5|$|Lunney worked {{both in the}} Control Center and at remote sites; {{during the}} flight of John Glenn, America's first orbital spaceflight, he was serving as the FIDO in Bermuda. In September 1961, NASA's Space Task Group was reorganized into the <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center and moved to Houston, Texas, and Lunney moved with it. In Houston, he became head of the Mission Logic and Computer Hardware section, where he defined and oversaw the {{computing}} and display requirements of the flight dynamics division within the new Mission Control Center.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 1972, US President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin {{signed an}} {{agreement}} calling for a joint manned space mission, and declaring intent for all future international <b>manned</b> <b>spacecraft</b> {{to be capable of}} docking with each other. This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus Apollo Command/Service Module with a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975. This was the last US manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the Space Shuttle in April 1981.|$|E
5|$|It {{became clear}} that {{managing}} the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities of Robert R. Gilruth's Space Task Group, which had been directing the nation's manned space program from NASA's Langley Research Center. So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center, the <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center (MSC). A site was chosen in Houston, Texas, on land donated by Rice University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961. It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida, so a new Mission Control Center would {{be included in the}} MSC.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 1967, {{the date}} of the Apollo 1 fire, Armstrong was in Washington, D.C., with Gordon Cooper, Dick Gordon, Jim Lovell and Scott Carpenter for the signing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. The astronauts chatted with the {{assembled}} dignitaries until 6:45p.m. when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center. During these telephone calls, they learned of the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. Armstrong and the group {{spent the rest of the}} night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened.|$|E
5|$|The third administrator, James E. Webb (1961â€“1968), {{appointed}} by President John F. Kennedy, was a Democrat who first publicly served under President Harry S. Truman. In order {{to implement the}} Apollo program to achieve Kennedy's Moon landing goal {{by the end of}} the 1960s, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President Lyndon Johnson kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and Republican President Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.|$|E
5|$|Administrator Webb {{realized}} {{that in order}} to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center (Gilruth) Marshall Space Flight Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.|$|E

5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} <b>manned</b> <b>spacecraft</b> to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might {{have been exposed to}} them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.|$|E

5|$|NASA's {{center in}} Houston has {{its origins in}} the Space Task Group which {{directed}} its first manned spaceflight program, Project Mercury. In 1961, it grew into a bigger organization as the <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center, and in 1962 moved into a newly built campus on land donated by Rice University. It was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in honor of Texas U.S. Senator, Vice President, and President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973, the year Johnson died. As Senate Majority Leader, Johnson played a decisive role in passage of the legislation which created NASA in 1958. JSC contains the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, which coordinates and monitors all human spaceflight for the United States, and directed all Space Shuttle missions and activities aboard the International Space Station. The visitor's center of JSC is Space Center Houston.|$|E
5|$|North American had {{originally}} suggested the hatch open outward and use explosive bolts {{to blow the}} hatch in case of emergency, as had been done in Project Mercury. NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 flight, so the <b>Manned</b> <b>Spacecraft</b> Center designers rejected the explosive design {{in favor of a}} mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to Donald K. Slayton's testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks {{and at the end of}} flight, rather than for emergency exit.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first <b>manned</b> <b>spacecraft</b> to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E
