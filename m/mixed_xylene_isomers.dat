40|$|A {{systematic}} and {{detailed analysis of}} adsorption and diffusion properties of <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers</b> over Beta zeolites with different mesoporosity was conducted. Adsorption isotherms of <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers</b> over microporous and mesoporous Beta zeolites through gravimetric methods were applied to investigate the impact of mesopores inside Beta zeolites on the adsorption properties of <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers</b> in the pressure range of lower 20 mbar. It is seen that the adsorption isotherms of three <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers</b> over microporous and mesoporous Beta zeolites could be successfully described by the single-site Toth model and the dual-site Toth model, respectively. The enhanced adsorption capacities and decreased Henry’s constants (KH) and the initial heats of adsorption (Qst) for the all <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers</b> are observed after the introduction of mesopores in the zeolites. For three <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers,</b> the order of Henry’s constant is o-xylene > m-xylene > p-xylene, whereas the adsorption capacities of Beta zeolite samples for <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers</b> execute the following order of o-xylene > p-xylene > m-xylene, due to the comprehensive effects from the molecular configuration and electrostatic interaction. At the same time, the diffusion properties of <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers</b> in the mesoporous Beta zeolites were also studied through the desorption curves measured by the zero length column (ZLC) method at 333 – 373 K. It {{turned out that the}} effective diffusion time constant (Deff/R 2) is a growing trend with the increasing mesoporosity, whereas the tendency of the activation energy is just the reverse, indicating the contribution of mesopores to facilitate molecule diffusion by shortening diffusion paths and reducing diffusion resistances. Moreover, the diffusivities of three <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers</b> in all Beta zeolites follow an order of p-xylene > m-xylene > o-xylene as opposed to KH, conforming the significant effects of adsorbate-adsorbent interaction on the diffusion...|$|R

One of the most well-studied systems in this context is UiO- 66 (Zr), which selectively adsorbs ortho-xylene over the other C 8 alkylaromatics. The mechanism behind this separation has remained unclear, however. In this work, we employ a wide range of computational techniques to explore both the equilibrium and dynamic behavior of the <b>xylene</b> <b>isomers</b> in UiO- 66 (Zr). In addition to correctly predicting the experimentally-observed ortho-selectivity, we demonstrate that the equilibrium selectivity is based upon the complete encapsulation of ortho-xylene within the pores of the framework. Furthermore the flexible nature of the adsorbent is crucial in facilitating xylene diffusion and our simulations reveal for the first time significant differences between the intracrystalline diffusion mechanisms of the three isomers resulting in a kinetic contribution to the selectivity. Consequently it is important to include both equilibrium and kinetic effects when screening MOFs for xylene separations...|$|R

The irregular shapes and wide size distributions of MOF particles have led to difficulty in column packing and low column efficiency or high back pressure. We describe here the preparation of MOF–silica microspheres as packing materials for fast and efficient liquid chromatography. Spheres-on-sphere (SOS) silica particles are prepared, modified with –COOH and –NH 2 groups, and then used as support to grow HKUST- 1. HKUST- 1 nanocrystals and films are formed and attached firmly onto the SOS particles with adjustable porosity. The composite microspheres, showing core–shell properties, are directly packed into columns to offer separation capability of MOFs and efficient packing and support of silica microspheres. These columns show separation of toluene/ethylbenzene/styrene and toluene/o-xylene/thiophene within 1. 5 minutes.
