Local workers cleared roads, and about 1,100people assisted in various relief efforts. The Jamaican Red Cross provided about 40,000meals each day to residents who lost food during the floods. Repairing damaged roads and bridges cost about $4.3million. For at least one day, all schools and <b>most</b> <b>businesses</b> on the island were closed.|$|E

5|$|Public {{holidays}} in Rhodesia, {{a historical}} region in southern Africa equivalent to today's Zimbabwe and Zambia—formerly Southern and Northern Rhodesia, respectively—were largely based around milestones in the region's short history. Annual holidays marked {{various aspects of}} the arrival of white people during the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the respective unilateral declarations of independence (1965) and of republican government (1970). On these days, <b>most</b> <b>businesses</b> and non-essential services closed. A number of Christian holidays were also observed according to custom, in the traditional British manner, and referred to in official documents by name—Christmas Day, for example, or Easter Monday.|$|E
5|$|Walters Cultural Arts Center was {{designed}} to be a bookend, along with the Hillsboro Civic Center, to increased downtown development. The center is the city’s first dedicated arts facility. City officials hoped to create a magnet for artists and aficionados in the downtown area with the center and other developments that include a renovated Venetian Theatre. The goal was to have the center encourage art studios to open and for art related festivals to develop to attract people to downtown after <b>most</b> <b>businesses</b> closed. Traditionally, shops and businesses closed by 6:00p.m. as workers in the county seat left for the day. The center also is rented out to groups for private functions.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{across the}} eastern Caribbean issued {{hurricane}} warnings {{as far south}} as Montserrat. In Anguilla, residents near the coast were advised to evacuate. Schools closed ahead of the storm, and the ferry between the island and Saint Martin was halted and moved to a safe location. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the National Emergency Management Agency was activated on November16. Officials there advised residents living near ghauts to evacuate, and one shelter was located in each district of the country. In addition, stores were open for longer hours to allow people to stock up on supplies. <b>Most</b> <b>businesses</b> and schools were closed in Antigua and Barbuda during the storm, while in Dominica, the airport was closed. Further south, there was little warning for the hurricane in Grenada, and most people left their boats in the water.|$|E

5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. <b>Most</b> <b>businesses</b> directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September28, reports {{indicated}} that Juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal Category1 hurricane. Weather broadcasts {{up to that time}} gave every indication that the storm would weaken prior to landfall. By 6 p.m. ADT (2100 UTC), additional warnings had been issued since Juan was expected to make landfall as a strong Category1 or weak Category2 hurricane. <b>Most</b> <b>businesses</b> in the areas affected were closed on Sundays, which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute. Although no large-scale evacuations were made, local evacuations for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of September 28. In all, several hundred people were affected by these evacuations. Utility workers also stood on standby before the storm hit, preparing for large-scale power outages.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of a large high pressure system and Jeanne produced rough seas over the northern Gulf of Mexico; wave heights reached 15feet (4.60m). On November 11, a ship reported sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h), although this reading was discarded and attributed to intense squalls. In Key West, the storm's outer fringes produced a record-breaking 24-hour rainfall total of 23.28inches (591mm); 13.58inches (345mm) fell within six hours. It remains the record 24-hour November rainfall total for the city as of 2012. The previous record was set in 1954. The heavy precipitation was attributed to a mesoscale feature; an inflow band intersected with an adjacent stationary front, which {{also contributed to the}} deluge. Schools and <b>most</b> <b>businesses</b> were closed, while flights were grounded at Key West International Airport; authorities urged residents to stay home. Telephone and power services were cut to some areas of the city.|$|E

5|$|The Oman Chairman of the National Committee for Civil Defence, General Malek Bin Sulaiman Al Ma'amari, remarked {{the nation}} had already {{developed}} a contingency plan, {{which included the}} activation of army and police personnel after the storm's passage. Significant damage was expected, especially in northeastern areas, along with up to 150mm (6in) of rainfall and very strong winds. Officials recommended citizens evacuate from potentially affected areas, and about 7,000people were forced to leave Masirah Island due {{to the threat of}} high surf and strong winds. Overall, more than 20,000people evacuated to emergency shelters. A state of emergency was declared for the nation. The Omani national weather service warned that the cyclone was expected to be worse than the destructive cyclone that hit Masirah Island in 1977. The Mina al Fahal oil terminal closed for over three days due to the threat of the storm. Omani officials closed government offices for two days and declared a five-day-long national holiday. <b>Most</b> <b>businesses</b> near the coastline were closed prior to the announcement. Authorities at the Muscat International Airport (then named as Seeb International Airport) canceled of all flights after 2000UTC on June 5 due to the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|The {{citizens}} left homeless by Omar {{resided in}} a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200tents holding more than 1,000people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by {{three days after the}} storm. The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and <b>most</b> <b>businesses</b> resumed their work {{by the end of the}} month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction, and another 15% developed early traumatic stress response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{well-established}} {{textile processing}} and trading infrastructure, and the ready {{supply of water}} from the River Irwell and its tributaries, attracted entrepreneurs who built cotton mills {{along the banks of the}} river in Pendleton and Ordsall. Although Salford followed a similar pattern of industrial development to Manchester, <b>most</b> <b>businesses</b> preferred to build their premises on the Manchester side of the Irwell, and consequently Salford did not develop as a commercial centre in the same way as its neighbour. Many of these earlier mills had been based on Arkwright-type designs. These relied on strong falls of water, but Salford is on a meander of the Irwell with only a slight gradient and thus mills tended to be built upstream, at Kersal and Pendleton. With the introduction of the steam engine in the late 18th century however, merchants began to construct mills closer to the centres of Salford and Manchester, where supplies of labour and coal were more readily available (the first steam-powered mill was built in Manchester in 1780). One of the first factories to be built was Philip's and Lee's Twist Mill in Salford, completed in 1801, the second iron-framed multi-story building to be erected in Britain. The large Salford Engine Twist Company mill was built to the west of Salford, between Chapel Street and the Irwell, and in 1806 was the first large cotton mill to use gas lighting. It was however outnumbered by the numerous smaller factories and mills throughout the area, including Nathan Gough's steam-driven mule spinning mill, near Oldfield Road, where a serious accident occurred on 13 October 1824 (see illustration).|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the eastern}} portion of West Virginia was {{declared}} a federal disaster area on November 7, 1985. Within {{two weeks of the}} declaration, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began clearing debris across the state, which was completed by July 1986. Widespread areas were under a boil-water advisory due to damage to water facilities, prompting officials to deliver trucks with bottled water through disaster areas. The state's highway department worked with FEMA and the USACE to clear destroyed buildings. Workers also buried killed animals, cleared blocked streams, and helped farmers regrow lost crops. FEMA opened 20disaster centers across the state to coordinate residents' requests for federal aid, and used 290 full or part-time employees. Overall federal assistance totaled $285million, including $171million for debris removal and repairing infrastructure, $90million for loans and temporary housing, and $24million through payments from the National Flood Insurance Program. This followed a six-week period when applications for such assistance were processed. After receiving complaints about inadequate funding, FEMA increased payments to 869people. FEMA also built 647temporary mobile homes, only about half of which were utilized. Residents complained that the money spent on the homes was misdirected and instead should have been given directly to victims. Many residents in Albright moved away after the main industry - river rafting - was washed away. In the city of Parsons, <b>most</b> <b>businesses</b> relied on small business loans to continue operating, although 18stores never reopened following the floods. Officials held a telethon on state television and radio on December7, 1985, that ultimately raised $1.7million for storm victims in the state. In the years after the flood, residents rebuilt houses farther away from flood plains, while officials rebuilt roads, bridges, and public buildings.|$|E
