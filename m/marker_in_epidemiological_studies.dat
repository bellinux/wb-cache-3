40|$|We {{subjected}} 16 Candida albicans clinical isolates to {{ultraviolet radiation}} and tested the survivors for auxotrophy. Six isolates displayed strongly biased auxotroph spectra: three yielded methionine auxotrophs, two yielded both isoleucine-valine and adenine auxotrophs, and one yielded lysine auxotrophs. We present evidence that auxotrophs arise by segregation from naturally occurring heterozygous states. The remaining isolates yielded {{few or no}} auxotrophs in an arbitrary sample (greater than 2, 500) of survivors of irradiation. Our experiments indicate that C. albicans is diploid, although aneuploidy (2 n + i) cannot be rigorously excluded.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The sperm {{chromatin}} structure assay (SCSA) {{provides an}} objective assessment of sperm chromatin integrity, which {{is essential for}} normal sperm function. SCSA is valuable as a fertility <b>marker</b> <b>in</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> and in the clinical situation. Little {{is known about the}} impact of testicular and post-testicular function on SCSA parameters. METHODS: Ejaculates from 278 military conscripts of median age 18. 1 (range 18 - 21) years were included. Levels of reproductive hormones, the length of the CAG repeat of the androgen receptor gene, sperm concentration, abstinence period and biochemical parameters of epididymal and accessory sex gland secretions were correlated to the SCSA parameters, DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and highly DNA stainable (HDS) cells. RESULTS: Negative correlations were found between sperm concentration and DFI (r = - 0. 119, P = 0. 049) and HDS (r = - 0. 513, P < 0. 0001). DFI was negatively correlated with levels of estradiol (r = - 0. 19, P = 0. 002) and free testosterone (r = - 0. 13, P = 0. 03). DFI also correlated positively with abstinence time (r = 0. 17, P = 0. 005), and with seminal concentrations of fructose (r = 0. 18, P = 0. 004) and zinc (r = 0. 12, P = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Sex steroid production, spermatogenic function, abstinence time and seminal vesicle function appear to impact on sperm chromatin integrity and thereby on sperm fertilizing capacity. These findings may improve present understanding of the pathophysiology of male infertility...|$|E

Little is known about the natural history of βPV infection and the aspects of infection that drive antibody responses. To investigate the relationship between these markers, this study assessed whether the presence or persistence of βPV DNA in eyebrow hairs and L 1 antibodies of the same βPV type co-occurred more frequently than would be expected by chance in both a cross-sectional assessment and a longitudinal study. βPV DNA in plucked eyebrow hairs and L 1 antibodies in serum were measured in 416 participants of the Australian community-based Nambour Skin Cancer Study in 1996. Similar data were available for a subset of 148 participants in 2003. Observed co-occurrence of βPV DNA and antibodies was compared with expected values based on prevalence. A case-wise concordance index was used to calculate the overall concordance of βPV DNA and antibodies of the same type. No significant associations were found between the presence or persistence of βPV DNA and antibody responses. The age and sex of the host did not influence the association, and nor did SCC status or a history of sunburns. It was concluded that βPV antibody responses in adults are not primarily driven by βPV infection as measured in eyebrow hairs.

The study of the tandemly repeated multilocus microsatellite EmsB allowed us to attain a high genetic diversity level where other classic markers have failed. Since 2006, EmsB data have been collected on specimens from various endemic foci of the parasite in Europe (in historic and newly endemic areas), Asia (China, Japan and Kyrgyzstan), and North America (Canada and Alaska). Biological data on the isolates and metadata were also recorded (e. g. host, geographical location, EmsB analysis, citation in the literature). In order to make available the data set of 1, 166 isolates from classic and aberrant domestic and wild animal hosts (larval lesions and adult worms) and from human origin, an open web access interface, developed in PHP, and connected to a PostgreSQL database, was developed in the EmsB Website for the Echinococcus Typing (EWET) project.

As such insertions {{can be used}} as epidemiological markers and for studying horizontal transfer of gene clusters, we investigated the distribution of IS 6770, IS 1542, IS 1216 V, IS 1476, and IS 1251 elements in 26 VanA Enterococcus faecium and 21 VanA Enterococcus faecalis from Brazil. PCR, using genomic DNA as a template, indicated that most of the isolates contained IS 6770 (97 %), IS 1216 V (87 %) and IS 1476 (72 %) elements. IS 1251 was also detected, but at a higher frequency in E faecium (80 %) than in E faecalis (14 %). None of the isolates harboured IS 1542. Only two of 47 isolates had IS elements within their Tn 1546 -like elements; one possessed IS 1251 between vanS and vanH, as reported in the United States; another possessed a novel IS element, designated ISEfa 5, located between vanX and van Y. This novel element was found in the genomic DNA of 25 (96 %) E faecium and 11 (52 %) E faecalis. in stability studies, no IS-mediated changes were detected in the Tn. 1546 -like elements of 25 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) monitored over 11 months. These results suggest that the occurrence of IS in Brazilian isolates is similar to that reported in American isolates, but that these elements occur rarely within the vanA gene clusters. As patterns of IS carriage did not correlate with the PFGE type of the VRE, the prevalence of IS elements in genomic DNA of VRE is not a useful epidemiological marker. However, the presence of IS-modified Tn 1546 -like elements, which appear to be rare in Brazil, could be a useful molecular <b>marker</b> <b>in</b> local <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> to monitor the evolution and horizontal transmission of VanA elements.

Looking for a surrogate <b>marker,</b> which <b>in</b> further <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> could replace the laborious and expensive HPV detection and typing we analyzed p 16 protein expression in 34 tonsillar carcinoma for correlation to HPV status and load of viral DNA. p 16 {{has been shown to}} be of diagnostic value for clinical evaluation of cervical dysplasia.

40|$|Methylmercury (MeHg) is a {{neurotoxic}} global pollutant that accumulates at {{high levels}} in predatory fish and marine mammals. The dietary intake of these animals is {{the main source of}} MeHg exposure in humans. At high levels, MeHg is known to damage the sensory and motor systems in both adults and children. Due to the complexity and inaccessibility of the central nervous system (CNS), early dysfunction is difficult to detect. Biochemical <b>markers</b> <b>in</b> the CNS have been used to identify MeHg neurotoxicity in animal models. Analogues of these biochemical targets are also present in peripheral blood tissue and may reflect early CNS dysfunction in human populations. The proposed peripheral biomarkers include (1) lymphocyte muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor, (2) serum cholinesterase (ChE) and (3) platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO). This thesis evaluates the effects of mercury (Hg) compounds on these CNS and peripheral biochemical <b>markers</b> <b>in</b> laboratory and <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies.</b> <b>In</b> vitro studies showed that inorganic Hg (HgCl 2) and MeHg inhibited mACh receptor binding in human, rat, and mouse brain tissue. Additionally, studies demonstrated that a low-level gestational exposure to MeHg reduced MAO activity in the developing embryo and in adult female offspring. Combined, these studies provide a framework for the assessment of biochemical targets of Hg compounds in humans. A cross sectional study was conducted to evaluate the association between peripheral biochemical markers and MeHg exposure in fish-eating adults (n= 129) from Lac St-Pierre, Quebec. Blood-Hg concentrations were used as a marker of exposure and ranged from 0. 2 to 17. 0 mug/L. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that both blood-Hg (p= 0. 011) and heavy smoking (p= 0. 001) were associated with reduced platelet-MAO activity. However, neither lymphocyte mACh receptor nor serum ChE was related to blood-Hg. These results suggest that exposure to MeHg may result in reduced pla...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) comprises those entities which {{result in}} obstruction to blood {{flow in the}} arteries, exclusive of the coronary and intracranial vessels. Although the definition of PAD technically includes problems within the extracranial carotid circulation, the upper extremity arteries, and the mesenteric and renal circulation, we will focus on chronic arterial occlusive disease in the arteries to the legs. Intermittent claudication, defined as pain in {{the muscles of the}} leg with ambulation, is the earliest and the most frequent presenting symptom in patients with lower extremity PAD. As the disease progresses in severity patients might have pain at rest, most prominent while the legs are elevated in bed at night, and relieved by dependency. Although claudication symptoms are typically localised in the calf or the thigh, “rest pain ” is characteristically in the foot. In the late stages of PAD, tissue hypoperfusion progresses to ischaemic ulceration and gangrene, and major amputation is eventually required in {{more than a third of}} these patients. 1 Importantly, mortality is closely linked with the presence of rest pain or tissue loss, so-called “critical limb ischaemia”, with a 1 -year mortality rate of about 20 % in several series. 2, 3 Epidemiology Intermittent claudication has been used as a <b>marker</b> of PAD <b>in</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies</b> to approximate the frequency of lower extremity PAD in a particular patient population. The estimate is dependent, however, on demographic factors of the specific population under study, including age, sex, and geographic area. In addition, the methods used to determine the frequency of intermittent claudication affects the estimate. 4 For instance, studies based on questionnaires tend to overestimate the frequency of PAD with symptoms; patients with complaints that resemble claudication but are unrelated to the vascular system will be erroneously classified as having PAD. Studies that use an objective method of diagnosis, such as measurement of doppler systolic ankle pressures, are most accurate. An “ankle-brachial index ” (ABI) can be calculated by dividing th...|$|R

The OGTT is less accurate than the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique (the [...] "gold standard" [...] for measuring insulin resistance), or the insulin tolerance test, but is technically less difficult. Neither of the two technically demanding tests can be easily applied in a clinical setting or used <b>in</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies.</b> HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment) is a convenient way of measuring insulin resistance in normal subjects, {{which can be used}} <b>in</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>studies,</b> but can give erroneous results for diabetic patients.|$|R
