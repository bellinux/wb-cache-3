500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her <b>mom</b> <b>was</b> going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident {{was the first time he}} saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E
500|$|Love {{spent her}} {{early years in}} the Haight-Ashbury {{district}} of San Francisco until her parents' 1969 divorce, after which her father's custody was withdrawn when her mother alleged that he had fed LSD {{to her as a}} toddler, which he denied. Love's mother, who was studying to be a psychologist, had her in therapy by the age of two. In 1970, her mother moved the family to the rural community of Marcola, Oregon, where they lived along the Mohawk River, while her mother completed her degree at the University of Oregon. She described her parents' household as being full of [...] "hairy, wangly-ass hippies running around naked [...] Gestalt therapy. My <b>mom</b> <b>was</b> also adamant about a gender-free household: no dresses, no patent leather shoes, no canopy beds, nothing." [...] Love was adopted by her then-stepfather, Frank Rodriguez. He and her mother had two daughters and a son who died in infancy of a heart defect when Love was ten. They also adopted a boy.

500|$|Dwyane Wade {{was born}} on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual {{spelling}} was decided by his own mother. In 1977, JoLinda, {{at the age of}} 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that [...] " [...] <b>mom</b> <b>was</b> on drugs and [...] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." [...] At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated – and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His <b>mom</b> <b>was</b> addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said [...] "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." [...] At the age of 6, he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him – by telling him they were going to the movies – into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois. After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.|$|E
