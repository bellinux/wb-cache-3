40|$|Despite {{advances}} in catheter ablation techniques anddevice-based therapies for cardiac arrhythmias, antiar-rhythmic drugs remain essential components of any compre-hensive therapeutic strategy. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy, however, {{has been limited}} by both incomplete efficacy and a substantial potential for cardiac and extracardiac toxicity. As a result, only a few new antiarrhythmic agents have success-fully completed clinical development programs and reached routine clinical usage over the past 20 years. Antiarrhythmic drugs may be indicated for ventricular tachycardia, sudden death prevention, or specific types of supraventricular arrhythmia.

40|$|BackgroundWe {{reported}} {{the outcomes of}} a single-institution experience using video-assisted thoracoscopic left cardiac sympathetic denervation as an adjunctive therapeutic technique in pediatric and young adult patients with <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> MethodsWe conducted a retrospective clinical review of all patients who underwent left cardiac sympathetic denervation by means of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery at our institution. From August 2000 to December 2011, 24 patients (13 with long QT syndrome, 9 with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and 2 with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia) were identified from the cardiology database and surgical records. ResultsThere were no intraoperative complications. The median postoperative length of stay was 2 days (range, 1 - 32 days). There were no major perioperative complications. Longer-term follow-up was available in 22 of 24 patients at a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 4 - 131 months). Sixteen (73 %) of the 22 patients experienced a marked reduction in their arrhythmia burden, with 12 (55 %) becoming completely arrhythmia free after sympathectomy. Six (27 %) of the patients were nonresponsive to treatment; each had persistent symptoms at follow-up. ConclusionsVideo-assisted thoracoscopic left cardiac sympathetic denervation can be safely and effectively performed in <b>most</b> patients with <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> This minimally invasive procedure is a promising adjunctive therapeutic option that achieves a beneficial response in most symptomatic patients.

40|$|SummaryVasospastic angina is a {{frequent}} and well-recognized pathology with {{a high risk of}} <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> and sudden cardiac death. The diagnosis of vasospastic angina requires the combination of clinical and electrocardiographic variables and the results of provocation tests, such as ergonovine administration. Smoking cessation {{is the first step in}} the management of vasospastic angina. Optimal medical treatment using calcium-channel blockers and/or nitrate derivatives can provide protection, but <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> may occur despite optimal medical treatment and several years after the start of treatment. In this review, we evaluate the role of implantable defibrillators as a complement to optimal medical management in patients with <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> due to vasospastic angina; this role is not well characterized in the literature or guidelines. We discuss the role of implantable defibrillators in secondary prevention in light of three recent cases managed in our departments and a review of the literature. An implantable defibrillator was implanted in two of the three cases of vasospastic angina with <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> that we managed. We considered secondary prevention by implantable defibrillator to be justified even in the absence of any obvious risk factor. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> recurred during implantable defibrillator follow-up in the two patients implanted.

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> in {{patients}} with heart failure (HF) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Background: It is thought that OSA is associated with cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. However, it remains unclear whether the presence of OSA increases the risk of <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> in patients with HF. Methods: We prospectively studied 71 consecutive HF patients who were followed for 180 days after a sleep study. All patients had an ICD for primary or secondary prevention. Baseline clinical characteristics and the frequency of appropriate ICD therapy for <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmia</b> were compared between patients with and without OSA. Results: OSA was diagnosed in 51 % of 71 patients. There were no statistical differences between patients with and without OSA in baseline cardiac functions. However, during follow-up, appropriate ICD therapies occurred more frequently in patients with OSA (42 %) than in those without OSA (17 %, p= 0. 041). On multivariate analysis, the presence of OSA was an independent predictor for appropriate ICD therapy (HR 3. 58, 95 % CI 0. 97 - 13. 3, p= 0. 045).

40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} case of torsades de pointes (TdP) induced by {{donepezil}} without QT prolongation. An 86 -year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of a syncopal attack. She had been treated for Alzheimer's disease with donepezil. Initial 12 -lead electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation and normal corrected QT interval. After admission, atrial fibrillation spontaneously recovered to normal sinus rhythm on electrocardiographic monitoring. On the second day, electrocardiographic monitoring documented TdP. We discontinued donepezil immediately. After washout of donepezil, TdP was not observed again. Corrected QT interval was normal throughout hospitalization. This case suggests that donepezil may cause <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> without QT prolongation.

40|$|Despite key {{advances}} in the clinical management of <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias,</b> culminating {{with the development of}} implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and catheter ablation techniques, pharmacologic/biologic therapeutics have lagged behind. The fundamental issue is that biological targets are molecular factors. Diseases, however, represent emergent properties at the scale of the organism that result from dynamic interactions between multiple constantly changing molecular factors. For a pharmacologic/biologic therapy to be effective, it must target the dynamic processes that underlie the disease. Here we propose a classification of <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> that is based on our current understanding of the dynamics occurring at the subcellular, cellular, tissue and organism scales, which cause arrhythmias by simultaneously generating arrhythmia triggers and exacerbating tissue vulnerability. The goal is to create a framework that systematically links these key dynamic factors together with fixed factors (structural and electrophysiological heterogeneity) synergistically promoting electrical dispersion and increased arrhythmia risk to molecular factors that can serve as biological targets. We classify <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> into three primary dynamic categories related generally to unstable Ca cycling, reduced repolarization, and excess repolarization, respectively. The clinical syndromes, arrhythmia mechanisms, dynamic factors and what is known about their molecular counterparts are discussed. Based on this framework, we propose a computational-experimental strategy for exploring the links between molecular factors, fixed factors and dynamic factors that underlie <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> The ultimate objective is to facilitate drug development by creating an in silico platform to evaluate and predict comprehensively how molecular interventions affect not only a single targeted arrhythmia, but all primary arrhythmia dynamics categories as well as normal cardiac excitation-contraction coupling...|$|R

BACKGROUNDMost studies of cardiac arrest report outcome following out-of-hospital resuscitation. In contrast, there are minimal data on long-term outcome following in-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODSThe AVID Study was a multicenter, randomized comparison of drug and defibrillator strategies to treat <b>life-threatening</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias.</b> A Registry was maintained of all patients with sustained <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmias</b> at each study site. The present study includes patients who had AVID-eligible arrhythmias, both randomized and not randomized. Patients with in-hospital and out-of-hospital presentations are compared. Data on long-term mortality were obtained through the National Death Index. RESULTSThe unadjusted mortality rates at one- and two-year follow-ups were 23 % and 31. 1 % for patients with in-hospital presentations, and 10. 5 % and 16. 8 % for those with out-of-hospital presentations (p < 0. 001), respectively. The adjusted mortality rates at one- and two-year follow-ups were 14. 8 % and 20. 9 % for patients with in-hospital presentations, and 8. 4 % and 14. 1 % for those with out-of-hospital presentations (p < 0. 001), respectively.
