25|$|Adding to {{the growing}} {{tensions}} between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted {{to give them an}} ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage or we will <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don’t get reelected. Burns stated “Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility.” She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his address to Congress. When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill. A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.|$|E

25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

He considers his approach [...] "anti-Nintendo", providing few to no additional {{instructions to the}} player in contrast with typical Nintendo games. In contrast to most games developed at the time, of which Blow believed [...] "treat [...] as the lowest common denominator", he wanted the audience for The Witness {{to be for the}} player that [...] "is inquisitive and likes to be treated as an intelligent person". He compared the approach he took with The Witness to that of Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, as the novel [...] "isn’t holding your hand the whole way through to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> understood every paragraph", and believed he could do the same within a video game. The game's timed challenge featuring randomly generated puzzles was purposely designed to be difficult, according to Blow, intended to be [...] "about testing how deeply a player has internalized the rules to the puzzles and how quickly they can react to new configurations".|$|E

500|$|It was {{following}} No.234 Squadron's move to Middle Wallop that Hughes began to score heavily against German fighters. On 15August, {{in one of}} the costliest engagements of the Battle of Britain, known thereafter to the Luftwaffe as [...] "Black Thursday", Hughes claimed victories (one of them shared) over two Messerschmitt Me110s.

500|$|Rangel rose {{rapidly in}} the House, due to his {{political}} skills, hard work, knowledge of legislative matters, and genial manner.

[...] In 1976, he was named to the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. [...] By 1979, Rangel {{was a member of the}} influential House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. [...] Rangel combined his solidly liberal views–interest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegation–with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. [...] Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican Guy Vander Jagt on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the Carter administration. [...] In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on natural gas deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem.
