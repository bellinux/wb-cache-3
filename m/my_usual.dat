500|$|... "Tom's Divorce" [...] {{was written}} by Harris Wittels and {{directed}} by Troy Miller. Although officially titled [...] "Tom's Divorce", it was referred to in some media reports by the name [...] "The Fourth Floor". Aziz Ansari said [...] "Tom's Divorce" [...] was his favorite episode of the series so far. He said, [...] "It was really fun because there was some serious acting for me to do, compared to <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> dick jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|I have {{demonstrated}} on myself in an injury occasioned by a fall, that it [...] {{did for me}} what surgeons could not do. Dr. Cushing of this city pronounced my injury incurable and that I could not survive three days because of it, when {{on the third day}} I rose from my bed and to the utter confusion of all I commenced <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> avocations and notwithstanding displacements, etc., I regained the natural position and functions of the body.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, LeMond won the Tour DuPont. It {{would be}} the last major win of his career. In the 1992 Tour de France he quit the race in the mountains, {{on the same day that}} his compatriot and former {{domestique}} Andrew Hampsten won atop Alpe d'Huez. While LeMond claimed a serious saddle sore caused him to abandon, he had earlier stated, [...] "My climbing is not like usual. I've climbed much better in the past Tours. This year I'm just not feeling <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> self." ...|$|E
500|$|David John, who {{had also}} worked on {{expansion}} packs for the original Neverwinter Nights, composed the score for Mysteries of Westgate, which took several months. In an interview soon after the game's release, Scull said [...] "Some of [...] tracks are so good, I actually listen to them alongside <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> eclectic mix." [...] Mysteries of Westgate's voice acting was recorded in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, with over 12,000 words of new voice-over material. [...] The cast included {{some of the same}} people who previously acted in [...] and other BioWare games. [...] Brian Dunn and Brian Watson, both of whom had also worked on Darkness over Daggerford, created the game's artwork and graphics.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Comic Book Resources, Wolfman stated that Santa Monica suggested the use of two time periods, with past events affecting the narrative in the present. He introduced new characters, including Kratos' wife—who appeared in the games but was never named. He stated the final script {{was a combination of}} his ideas and Santa Monica's character-appropriate dialog. Series artist Andrea Sorrentino stated, [...] "it was clear from the start that for this project Sony and DC [...] wanted something a bit different from a 'classical' comic. So I just took <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> style and added to it something new, like new colors from the videogame palette." [...] She stated that the games have strong, epic images, and that she easily adapted her style to Wolfman's writing as he [...] "did really good work showing both dramatic and epic scenes." [...] Sorrentino used color to give importance to each scene, adding hot colors (red, orange, or brown) in action scenes and cold ones (green or light blue) in others so that readers could immediately have an emotional reaction.|$|E
60|$|One sunny {{afternoon}} when I {{had come home}} from school with my books and portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was gliding upstairs to <b>my</b> room as <b>usual,</b> <b>my</b> godmother looked out of the parlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her, I found--which was very unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking gentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold watch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon his little finger.|$|R

500|$|The 1953 {{season began}} with a 27–0 win over the Green Bay Packers in which Graham passed for 292yards and ran for two touchdowns. It {{was the first of}} 11 {{straight}} victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season to the Philadelphia Eagles. Near {{the end of the season}} in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from Art Michalik that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic face mask, and he came back into the game; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask. Despite an 11–1 record, Cleveland lost in the championship game for the third year in a row, falling to the Detroit Lions 17–16. Two of Graham's passes were intercepted. He said after the game that he wanted to [...] "jump off a building" [...] for letting his teammates down. [...] "I was the main factor in losing", he said. [...] "If I had played <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> game, we would have won." [...] Still, Graham finished the season as the NFL's leading passer and again won the Most Valuable Player award.|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, Love debuted an art {{collection}} at Fred Torres Collaborations in New York titled [...] "And She's Not Even Pretty", which contained over forty drawings and paintings by Love composed in ink, colored pencil, pastels, and watercolors. Later in the year, she collaborated with Michael Stipe {{on the track}} [...] "Rio Grande" [...] for Johnny Depp's sea shanty album , and in 2013, co-wrote and contributed vocals on [...] "Rat A Tat" [...] from Fall Out Boy's album Save Rock and Roll; she also appeared in the music video for the track. After solo performances in December 2012 and January 2013, Love appeared in advertisements for Yves Saint Laurent alongside Kim Gordon and Ariel Pink. Love completed a solo tour of North America in mid-2013, which was purported to be in promotion of an upcoming solo album; however, it was ultimately dubbed a [...] "greatest hits" [...] tour, and featured songs from Love's and Hole's back catalogue. Love told Billboard {{at the time that}} she had recorded eight songs in the studio. [...] " [...] are not <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> (style)", Love said. [...] "I don't have any Fleetwood Mac references on it. Usually I always have a Fleetwood Mac reference as well as having, like, Big Black references. These are very unique songs that sort of magically happened." ...|$|E
500|$|So is Gabriel's first non-eponymous album. Gabriel {{has noted}} his dislike for titling albums, mainly because it distracts from the sleeve design. In an {{interview}} for Rolling Stone, he explained that his American label Geffen Records refused to release Peter Gabriel IV until it was retitled Security. He elaborated that for So [...] " [...] {{decided to go for}} the anti-title... It can be more a piece of graphic, if you like, as opposed to something with meaning and intention. And that's what I've done ever since". When the album was profiled in the Classic Albums documentary series, Gabriel quipped that its short title meant it could be enlarged and useful when marketing it. Before the album was eventually named So, {{it was meant to be}} entitled Good. The sleeve design is a portrait of Gabriel photographed by Trevor Key, who was then most famous for capturing the bell artwork for Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (1973). It was then designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens; Saville was most known for designing several sleeves for Factory Records artists. Saville was paid £20,000 for his design. Gabriel has since commented: [...] "the only compromise I made was to go with Peter Saville's idea for a retro-style portrait. I was told <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> obscure LP sleeves alienated women." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Norma {{opened on}} 26 December, {{it was a}} success but only because of Pasta; the other singers were not well received. This caused Bellini to fear for how Beatrice would turn out. Writing to his friend Santocanale in Palermo on 12 January, the {{composer}} was in despair, complaining of the short time to write his opera: [...] "whose fault is that? that of <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> and original poet, the God of Sloth!" [...] Their relationship quickly began to deteriorate: greetings including tu (the informal [...] "you") gave way to voi (the formal [...] "you") and they lived {{in different parts of}} Venice, unusual when they were working together outside their home city.|$|E
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with this policy, Allan was force-fed {{for a full}} week. Forcible feeding was an ordeal described by Pankhurst as a [...] "horrible outrage", and has been likened by women's history scholar June Purvis {{to a form of}} rape. In a later letter to a friend, Allan herself stated that [...] "I did not resist at all ... yet the effect on my health was most disastrous. I am a very strong woman and absolutely sound in heart and lungs, but it was not till 5 months after, that I was able to take any exercise or begin to feel in <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> health again – the nerves of my heart were affected and I was fit for nothing In the way of exertion ... There {{can be no doubt that}} it simply ruins the health." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Norma {{opened on}} 26 December, {{it was a}} success but only because of Pasta. The Adalgisa of Anna Del Serre and the Pollione of Alberico Curioni were mediocre; Bellini feared for how Beatrice would turn out. Writing to Santocanale on 12 January, Bellini was in despair, {{complaining}} of the short time to write his opera because [...] "Whose fault is that? that of <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> and original poet, the God of Sloth!" [...] Their relationship quickly began to deteriorate: greetings including tu (the informal [...] "you") gave way to voi (the formal [...] "you") and they lived {{in different parts of}} Venice.

2500|$|In 1977, Brando made a rare {{television}} {{appearance in}} the miniseries , portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni, a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha {{that focused on the}} life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil. Brando portrayed Superman's father Jor-El in the 1978 film Superman. He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and that his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. It was revealed in a documentary contained in the 2001 DVD release of Superman that he was paid $3.7million for two weeks of work. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage. [...] "I asked for <b>my</b> <b>usual</b> percentage," [...] he recollected in his memoir, [...] "but they refused, and so did I." [...] However, after Brando's death, the footage was reincorporated into the 2006 re-cut of the film, [...] and in the 2006 [...] "loose sequel" [...] Superman Returns, in which both used and unused archive footage of him as Jor-El from the first two Superman films was remastered for a scene in the Fortress of Solitude, and Brando's voice-overs were used throughout the film.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sir. And {{no later}} than this morning. I went to <b>my</b> work as <b>usual</b> at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of {{cardboard}} hammered on {{to the middle of}} the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself." ...|$|R
