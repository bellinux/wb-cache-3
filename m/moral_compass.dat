The Cooper family, left with little money, is forced {{to move into a}} trailer park. Julie Cooper-Nichol, once one of the richest women in all of Newport, struggles to {{put food on the table}} for her daughters. Marissa's life begins to spiral out of control, as she struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as dealing with the loss of her close friend Johnny. Similarly, Kirsten confronts her alcohol addiction and eventually leaves rehab, only to encounter more problems when she begins business with a con artist. The other characters look towards college, with Seth and Summer competing for a spot at Brown University. Sandy's <b>moral</b> <b>compass</b> becomes imperiled when a past love interest makes her way back into his life, and he takes over Caleb's old position as head of The Newport Group, pursuing a project to establish more low-income housing in Newport. Ryan also attempts to resolve his individual relationships with his mother, and with his childhood friend Theresa Diaz. He also pursues the idea of a post-secondary education, with encouragement from both Sandy and Kirsten to visit Berkeley. Ryan's life is quickly put on hold when, in the season 3 finale, Ryan decides to drive Marissa to the airport, and they are run off the road by Kevin Volchok, Marissa's most recent love affair gone wrong. In the last few minutes of the episode, Ryan pulls Marissa out from the burning car, only to watch her die in his arms.|$|E

Grounded within scholarship that examines the struggles of dealing with survival guilt (O???Connor, et. al., 2000) and impostor syndrome (Clance & Imes, 1978), my paper evaluates not only the internalized oppression among formerly incarcerated Asian American youth, but also the healing and transformation processes they experience. More specifically, I use the concept of transformative resistance (Solorzano & Delgado Bernal, 2001) to explore how many of these youth use education and community activism to resist criminalization in their life and create increased opportunities after they have done time in the system. Through a close examination of the relationship between survival guilt, impostor syndrome, and transformative resistance, I hope to demonstrate the complexity of issues among a group of Asian American youth who are rarely acknowledged within Asian American Studie...|$|R

40|$|Western {{law schools}} are {{suffering}} from an identity and moral crisis. Many of the legal profession's problems {{can be traced to}} the law school environment, where students are taught to reason and practice in ways that are often at odds with their own personalities and values and even with generally accepted psychologically healthy practices. The idealism, ethic of care, and personal <b>moral</b> <b>compasses</b> of many students become eroded and even lost in the present legal education system. Formalism, rationalism, elitism, and big business values have become paramount. In such a moment of historical crisis, there exists the opportunity to create a new legal education story. This paper is a conceptual study of both my own Canadian legal education and the general legal education experience. It examines core problems and critiques of the existing Western legal education organizational and pedagogical paradigm to which Canadian law schools adhere. New approaches with the potential to enrich, humanize, and heal the Canadian law school experience are explored. Ultimately, the paper proposes a legal education system that is more interdisciplinary, theoretically and practically integrated, emotionally intelligent, technologically connected, morally accountable, spiritual, and humane. Specific pedagogical and curricular strategies are suggested, and recommendations for the future are offered. The dehumanizing aspects of the law school experience in Canada have rarely been studied. It is hoped that this thesis will fill a gap in the research and provide some insight into an issue that is of both academic and public importance, since the well-being of law students and lawyers affects the interests of their clients, the general public, and the integrity and future of the entire legal system...|$|R
40|$|How can {{teaching}} values-based ethics influence {{behavior and}} decision making among professional in the accounting, financial management and auditing professions? Will a shift from historical examples of outcomes to a philosophically oriented evaluation of situational goals, personal values and cultural influences yield stronger <b>moral</b> <b>compasses</b> among accounting professionals? In what follows, I {{will argue that the}} standard approach to teaching ethics to accounting professionals is not just compromised by its antiquated administration but rests on unsound conceptual foundations as regards ethical pedagogy in general. For it turns out that all the core virtues (values) that underlie the decisions are missing from the prevailing approach to ethical education. Rather than rely on examples tainted by the sensationalized coverage they have received in the media, neutral material ought to be used to illustrate how to engage in ethical reflection and judgment without being constrained by mere facts or presumptive consequences. The professional community needs to be armed with a position from which to consider ethical inquiry, to transcend fears about how to define what is “right” and, most importantly, to engage others in intellectual conversation that leads to practiced habits that in turn reflect the people we desire to be rather than only the consequences we hope to promote or prevent. I conducted an exploration of fundamental behavioral values that can inform ethical behavior {{and decision making}} across a variety of situations, personalities and personal conflicts. Specifically, I incorporate philosophical texts by Aristotle, Aquinas and Anscombe. These fundamentals are connected to current professional ethics expectations in the contemporary business environment. Finally, I leverage time-tested children’s literature – specifically, Dr. Seuss message books – to design case studies to be used in teaching ethics fundamentals to practicing accounting, auditing and financial management professionals...|$|R
50|$|Originating in Chinese myths {{dating back}} centuries before being {{introduced}} to Korean mythology, the Korean kumiho shares many similarities to the Chinese huli jing and the Japanese kitsune. Classic of Mountains and Seas, an old Chinese text, claims a fox with nine tails live in an area called Qingqiu (靑丘). Although the kumiho and other versions of the nine-tailed fox myths and folklores originated from China, they all have a similar concept. All explain fox spirits as being the result of great longevity or the accumulation of energy, said to be foxes who have lived for a thousand years, {{and give them the}} power of shape-shifting, usually appearing {{in the guise of a}} woman. However, while huli jing and kitsune are often depicted with ambiguous <b>moral</b> <b>compasses,</b> possibly good or bad, the kumiho is almost always treated as a malignant figure who feasts on human flesh. It is unclear at which point in time Koreans began viewing the kumiho as a purely evil creature, since many ancient texts of the Chinese mention the benevolent kumiho assisting humans (and even make mentions of wicked humans tricking kind but naïve kumiho). In later literature, kumiho were often depicted as bloodthirsty half-fox, half-human creatures that wandered cemeteries at night, digging human hearts out from graves. The fairy tale The Fox Sister depicts a fox spirit preying on a family for their livers. However, according to Gyuwon Sahwa, kumiho is described as an auspicious fox spirit with a book in its mouth. Considering the text is thought to be written in 1675, some speculate that modern violent image of kumiho are influenced during the Japanese occupation in Korea. Nevertheless, foxes often contained negative image during Koryo Dynasty (Shin Don was described as an old fox spirit due to his love for women and drinks despite his being a buddhist monk), suggesting two different views could have co-existed in ancient Korea. Taiping Guangji claims Silla worshipped foxes as sacred beings.|$|R

500|$|Some of Heinlein's {{other works}} {{have also been}} {{described}} as racist, though Franklin argues {{that this was not}} unique to Heinlein, and that he was less racist than the U.S. government of the time. Heinlein's early novel Sixth Column was called a [...] "racist paean" [...] to a white resistance movement against an Asian horde derived from the Yellow Peril. In 1978, Moorcock wrote that Starship Troopers [...] "set the pattern for Heinlein's more ambitious paternalistic, xenophobic" [...] stories.

According to this theory, if man lacks a <b>moral</b> <b>compass</b> beyond the will to survive, and he was confronted by another species with a similar lack of morality, then the only possible moral result would be warfare.|$|E
40|$|The Indian {{residential}} school (IRS) system {{is part of}} Canada’s colonial history; an estimated 150, 000 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children attended IRS (Stout & Peters, 2011). Informed by Indigenous principles of respect, relevance, responsibility, reciprocity, and relationality (Deloria, 2004; Ermine 1995; Kirkness & Barnhardt, 2001; Wilson, 2008), this study uses classic grounded theory to explore how female IRS survivors or their female descendants are coping with the intergenerational transmission of trauma. Specifically, the general method of comparative {{analysis was used to}} generate theory and identify categories and conceptualizations. The emergent problem found that individual survivors and their descendants were dealing with kakwatakih-nipowatisiw, a Cree term used to identify learned colonial (sick) behaviours. These behaviours manifested first among the administrative staff of the schools, then eventually emerged as female generational violence between, for example, mothers and daughters. Indigenous women in this study aimed to resolve this, their ‘main concern’, in order to strengthen familial relations, especially between female family members. Analysis resulted in the identification of a theory derived from the social process of potentializing wellness, which was grounded in the real-world experiences of Indigenous women. Potentializing wellness involves three dimensions: building personal competencies, <b>moral</b> <b>compassing,</b> and fostering virtues. It was revealed that Indigenous women perceive the ongoing generational effects of IRS differently, and as a result, three behavioural typologies emerged: living the norm, between the norm, and escaping the norm. The “norm” refers to the belief that violence is accepted as a normal part of family life. The paradox, of course, is that this type of behaviour is not normal and Indigenous women in this study {{are looking for ways to}} eliminate aggressive behaviours between women. The discoveries made in this research, coupled with the final integrative literature review, suggest that Indigenous People’s cultural ways of knowing have a holistic component that addresses all wellness levels. Effective strategies to deal with intergenerational trauma can emerge when holistic health is followed by, or happens concordantly with, reclaiming cultural norms grounded in community and spiritual life. Indigenizing a Western intervention is not enough. Focusing on the spiritual as well as emotional, physical, intellectual, and social aspects of self is seemingly the best approach for Indigenous People who are dealing with the intergenerational effects of trauma...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{presence}} of Jewish ritual {{in the lives of}} otherwise nonobservant Jews, the Pfeffermans, in the Amazon original television series Transparent (Jill Soloway, USA, 2014 –). The secular Pfeffermans must confront all the tragedies and challenges of any contemporary American family—divorce, miscarriage, promiscuity, death, sexual confusion, and illness—but without an established <b>moral</b> or religious <b>compass</b> that might provide them with guidance and comfort in overcoming or at least accepting these adversities. The Pfeffermans therefore represent the ambivalence and confusion of many assimilated contemporary American Jews as they seek a meaningful spirituality to help traverse a contemporary landscape replete with circumstances that test their courage, faith, and resilience. Transparent thus offers a window into a world where secular Jews (and even their rabbi) struggle—sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing—to create a spiritual world of Jewish ritual living that will provide them with an opportunity to lech lecha, to go forth as courageous adults into a challenging world...|$|R
