5|$|Although 247Bk is {{the most}} stable isotope of berkelium, its {{production}} in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which does not allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk is the <b>most</b> <b>accessible</b> isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.|$|E
5|$|Research on Svalbard {{centers on}} Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, the <b>most</b> <b>accessible</b> {{areas in the}} high Arctic. The treaty grants {{permission}} for any nation to conduct research on Svalbard, resulting in the Polish Polar Station and the Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station, plus Russian facilities in Barentsburg. The University Centre in Svalbard in Longyearbyen offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate courses to 350 students in various arctic sciences, particularly biology, geology and geophysics. Courses are provided to supplement studies at the mainland universities; there are no tuition fees and courses are held in English, with Norwegian and international students equally represented.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} found on a clifftop {{immediately}} north of the village of Bruneval, which was itself twelve miles north of Le Havre, and was the <b>most</b> <b>accessible</b> German radar site that had been found so far by the British; several other installations were further inland in France, and others were {{as far away as}} Romania and Bulgaria. A request for a raid on the Bruneval site to capture a Würzburg system was passed on to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Combined Operations. Mountbatten in turn took the proposal to the Chiefs of Staff Committee, who approved the raid after a brief debate.|$|E
5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of curium, the <b>most</b> <b>accessible</b> are 242Cm and 244Cm; {{they are}} α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48 years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, {{but they also have}} a rather high rate of spontaneous fission. 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E
5|$|In Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, {{porpoises}} {{were regarded}} as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “Natural history”. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise {{was one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>accessible</b> species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales {{on the basis of a}} harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.|$|E

5|$|Marian devotion {{grew from}} the 13th century, mostly forming around the {{concepts}} of the Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. In a culture that venerated the possession of relics {{as a means to}} bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity. By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the <b>most</b> <b>accessible</b> intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth. The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the Man of Sorrows.|$|E
5|$|The BLM {{management}} of the herd has included improvements to the range to give the horses additional access to water, and numerous roundups that {{have resulted in the}} removal and adoption of hundreds of horses to private individuals, including over 50 horses in 2009, and another 44 in 2012. In 2015, a plan was approved to gather 6-12 one and two year old horses annually until the contraceptive vaccine the mares are given can lower birth rates more. This resulted in the most recent gather and removal of 17 horses and 1 foal. Once again, every horse captured was adopted. The Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range is one of the <b>most</b> <b>accessible</b> areas to view feral horse herds in the United States and tourism to the area has increased in recent years.|$|E
