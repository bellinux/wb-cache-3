500|$|The Strawberry Panic! {{short stories}} were {{initially}} panned by Erica Friedman as being [...] "distinctly derivative of Maria-sama ga Miteru". Friedman {{is the president}} of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the stories as, [...] "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else to support it". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that [...] " [...] turned out pretty good". She went on to say, [...] "There's no denying that Strawberry Panic! wasn't brilliant, but considering that {{it was meant to be}} trashy, it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of the trash heap." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the Strawberry Panic! manga as [...] "a nearly plotless cascade [...] everything seems rushed, and it is difficult to keep track of the characters and plot." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, describing it as [...] "gleefully grim". Handlen {{felt that the}} episode represented the series coming into its own, noting that [...] "Millennium, after weeks of hinting at possibilities without delivering <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything,</b> has finally started to give a real sense that yes, {{there is a lot}} of bad news happening, and it really does make a twisted kind of sense". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, noting that it shared similar themes with the direction the series would take in its second season. Gibron described the episode as [...] "spooky and somewhat surreal", adding that [...] "the entire installment [...] crackles with possibilities". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions" [...] four stars out of five, describing it as being [...] "surprising, intriguing, moody and pretentious". Shearman compared the episode thematically to Mann's earlier script for [...] "The Judge", and noted that while the story [...] "doesn't make for an especially comprehensible yarn, it does produce an episode that is genuinely uneasy viewing".|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} enthusiastic. The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Taylor found the protagonist [...] "a little too credulous." [...] She also found McEwan's [...] "wilful {{narrative}} sadism" [...] sadly {{missing from the}} work. The review in The Economist was even more scathing: referring to Sweet Tooth as [...] "not Mr McEwan's finest book", the reviewer concluded that by the end, [...] "it is hard to feel <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> for these heroes, who are all notions and no depth." [...] James Lasdun of The Guardian {{found that there were}} [...] "momentous political questions" [...] raised in the earlier parts of the novel, which were not fully addressed by the end. Stylistically, Serena found herself caught in exactly the kind of narrative she disliked, but, asked Lasdun, [...] "to what end?" [...] Particularly the ending of the book was polarising. Kellaway saw it as [...] "a good excuse {{to go back to the}} beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again", while another reviewer confessed that, though the ending [...] "might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back through the novel to see how he did it... it made me want to throw the book out the window." ...|$|E

500|$|Referring to {{the songs}} on the album, Jon Pareles of The New York Times said [...] "about half are worth the effort." [...] He {{observed}} that [...] "too often, [...] falls into American culture's Disney syndrome, idealizing childhood innocence above all." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying that while No Code [...] "cracks open their sound," [...] it [...] "becomes a collection of fragments that don't add up to <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything,</b> except {{a portrait of a}} musically disjointed band." [...] On the change in mood compared with the band’s previous releases, he said that [...] "the album leaves you with the vaguely unsettling feeling that Pearl Jam without pain are like a pretzel without salt, or Seattle without rain." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork called it [...] "a nice listen," [...] but stated that [...] "there's a ton of filler here. In fact, it's almost all filler." [...] Time reviewer Christopher John Farley said that the album [...] "makes it sound as if they're having a midlife crisis." [...] Farley added that [...] "too few of {{the songs on}} the Pearl Jam CD explore the musical possibilities they suggest in any kind of definitive or provocative manner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Successful {{marketing}} {{during the}} Industrial Revolution helped to firmly establish Champagne's reputation among {{the middle class}} and affluent elite of the time. The wine came to symbolize the [...] "good life" [...] to which all people could aspire. It also brought charges of decadence and indulgence. As the American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald once commented, [...] "Too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> is bad, but too much Champagne is just right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Confederation {{had evolved}} into a {{creation}} beyond John A. Macdonald's worst nightmare. [...] Powerful, independent provinces, sovereign within their own spheres, manipulated the rights of property, levied their own taxes—even income taxes, in a few cases—exploited their natural resources, and managed schools, hospitals, and relief for the poor, while a weak and ineffectual central government presided over not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> in the drab little capital {{on the banks of}} the Ottawa.|$|E
6000|$|To my immense surprise, Lady Meadowcroft rose to {{the height}} of the situation.

50|$|One of the G-15's primary {{output devices}} is the {{typewriter}} with an output speed of about 10 {{characters per second}} for numbers (and lower-case hexadecimal characters u-z) and about three characters per second for alphabetical characters. The machine's limited storage precludes <b>much</b> output <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> but numbers; occasionally, paper forms with pre-printed fields or labels were inserted into the typewriter. A faster typewriter unit was also available.|$|R
60|$|Two {{hours later}} the Foam got under way, and, after some heated {{language}} {{owing to the}} watchman mistaking Mr. Green’s urbanity for sarcasm, sailed slowly down the river. The hands were unusually quiet, but their behaviour passed unnoticed by the new skipper, who was too perturbed by the falsehoods he had told and those {{he was about to}} tell to take <b>much</b> heed <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> that was passing.|$|R
2500|$|Paolo Di Lazzaro, {{the lead}} researcher, {{indicated}} {{in an e-mail}} interview that '….it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier', but their study {{does not mean the}} Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web. [...] Professional skeptic Joe Nickell states that the latest findings are nothing new despite being [...] "dressed up in high-tech tests", and that they don't prove <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Howell {{made his}} Major League Baseball debut with the Royals on June 11, 2005. He started the {{game against the}} Arizona Diamondbacks and allowed one run in five innings, with eight strikeouts, to record the win. Diamondbacks outfielder Luis Gonzalez said of Howell, [...] "We didn't have <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> on him going in. It was like walking down a dark alley." [...] He made a total of 15 starts for the Royals in 2005 and was 3-5 with a 6.19 ERA. He began 2006 back with Omaha, where he was 3–2 with a 4.75 ERA in eight starts, missing the month of May {{as a result of}} {{shoulder}} stiffness.|$|E
2500|$|That Ellsworth {{promoted}} {{the federal government}} as a unified confederacy without the limitations imposed by the Articles of Confederation enhanced his popularity during the first several decades of America's history, especially in the South preceding the Civil War. In 1847, thirteen years before the Civil War, John Calhoun praised Ellsworth as the first of three Founding Fathers (including Sherman and Paterson) who gave the United States [...] "the best government instead of the worst and most intolerable on the earth." [...] However, rapid industrialization and the centralization of U.S. national government since the Civil War have led to the almost complete neglect of Ellsworth's pivotal contribution at the inception of U.S. government. [...] Few today know <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> about him.|$|E

60|$|Will {{followed}} {{her at a}} little distance, {{and leaned against the}} tall back of a leather chair, on which he ventured now to lay his hat and gloves, and free himself from the intolerable durance of formality to which he had been for the first time condemned in Dorothea's presence. It must be confessed that he felt very happy at that moment leaning on the chair. He was not <b>much</b> afraid <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> that she might feel now.|$|R
60|$|Stated very simply, it was this: Mr. Rasselyer-Brown drank. It was {{not meant}} {{that he was a}} {{drunkard}} or that he drank too <b>much,</b> or <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> that sort. He drank. That was all.|$|R
2500|$|I didn't feel {{at all as}} if I'd been {{watching}} a television show. For one, {{a number of the}} adaptations are feature-length, and the eye-catching cinematography, set design, and period costuming lean more towards a feature film than a basic cable television series. … I didn't watch Nero Wolfe so much as devour it, and that this is such a rewatchable series makes it especially worth owning on DVD. ... It's worth mentioning that these DVDs present the episodes as they appeared on A, and although longer versions aired overseas (several were literally twice as long), none of that additional footage is offered here. ... Expertly crafted, masterfully acted, and unlike <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> else on television, this collection of the entire two season run of Nero Wolfe is very highly recommended.|$|E
2500|$|In reality, the Old Crossing Treaties {{were simply}} {{a means of}} taking land away from the Indians and passing it on to white settlers. They were the {{culmination}} of a deliberate and sustained political, economic and military campaign that had no possible outcome other than capitulation by the Ojibwe, even if they had understood the nature of the bargain they had reached. This was a campaign coordinated and carried out by a small group of well-connected collaborators who dominated the trade and business development of Northwestern Minnesota while also controlling the state's political and military apparatus. The treaties imposed a [...] "peace" [...] only {{in the sense that they}} removed Indians from the continued contest for control of the country. [...] As with most treaties, they defined a [...] "peace" [...] which was constructed for and defined by the victors while providing not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> for the losers.|$|E
2500|$|Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone criticized Jones' performance, stating, Jones [...] "plays Danny {{as a case}} of {{a secret}} {{identity}} that might be just [...] well disguised – because he's so totally devoid of charisma, more cub than lone wolf. With his scruffy beard and dazed [...] "who, me?" [...] eyes, Jones {{could be one of the}} twinkling boy-men who populated Hollywood comedies a decade ago, except now the party's over and he can't understand why bad hombres keep trying to kill him... Iron Fist has no humor either, so it ends up just looking like a superhero drama where they forgot to invite the superhero.... Iron Fists hero can't seem to muster any inner turmoil beyond the occasional harshed vibe. There doesn't seem to be <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> going on his skull. His mystic Zen quotes go over like a Wayne's World set-up minus the punch line." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Herewith is {{a little}} sketch, as you requested. There is not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it, for the reason, I suppose, {{that there is not}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> me. If <b>anything</b> be made out of it, I wish it to be modest, and not to go beyond the material.

60|$|We were {{sorry to}} leave St. Augustine, {{but we had}} {{thoroughly}} done up the old place, and had seen everything, I think, except the Spring of Ponce de Leon, {{on the other side}} of the St. Sebastian River. We didn't care about renewing our youth,--indeed, we should have objected very <b>much</b> to <b>anything</b> <b>of</b> the kind,--and so we felt no interest in old Ponce's spring.|$|R
2500|$|As {{historian}} Richard Beeman put it, Henry {{was a man}} who [...] "did {{not bother}} to write <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> down", a handicap when being evaluated by history. The lack of primary source materials regarding Henry—only a handful of papers and a few of his speeches survive—has frustrated Henry's biographers from Wirt (1817) to Beeman (1974): Wirt commented two years before publishing his book, [...] "It is all speaking, speaking, speaking. 'Tis true he could talk—Gods! how he could talk! but... to make the matter worse, from 1763 to 1789... not [...] one of his speeches lives in print, writing or memory". Beeman, for his part, concluded, [...] "the Revolutionary firebrand, whatever his achievements, possessed a miserable sense of history". This was a deficiency not possessed by Jefferson, who not only survived Henry by a quarter century, but who got to fill the vacuum of information about Henry with his own recollections and opinions. Wirt did not print many of Jefferson's criticisms of Henry, which irritated the former president to such an extent he was still mentioning it to guests at Monticello in 1824. Nevertheless, Jefferson's negative assessments of Henry have sullied the latter's historical reputation.|$|E

50|$|Ugly Duckling's music {{demonstrates}} {{the contrast of}} {{having grown up in}} an area known for gangsta rap and inner-city themes while listening to a variety <b>of</b> music, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> which was <b>anything</b> but hardcore. The band's songs often incorporate themes such as love, forgiveness, and rejection of worldly values. Some songs include lyrics pertaining to the biblical end times, yet others express fondness for cannabis. They frequently use language reminiscent of early hip hop hyperbole, where the primary goal of lyrics was to brag and self promote in an exaggerated and often humorous fashion.|$|R
30|$|The Russian {{state has}} been far less effective. Few regions have become {{industrial}} centers, <b>much</b> less exporters <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> but raw materials. Simachev et al. (2014) suggest that the Russian state effort {{to compensate for the}} underdeveloped institutional space encourages firms to be excessively involved with the state, further inhibiting development of institutions. Tax incentives for R&D have accomplished little. They conclude that: “The state thus far has not developed the skills to introduce soft, motivating instruments. The emphasis on financing is excessive.” Russian government programs are “hard,” not “soft,” and have not encouraged genuine partnerships. 14 Chinese officials in some regions were far more flexible, giving rise to the phenomenon of formally socialist (Red Hat) enterprises that enjoyed substantial autonomy.|$|R
