40|$|The thesis aims {{to design}} a device for {{utilization}} of waste heat for heating and hot water in NETME Centre in area of FSI VUT in Brno. First of all there is summary of available sources of waste heat and evaluation of serviceability. Next there is design of a device for utilization of waste heat. Design incluades calculation of heat exchangers and selection of particular heat exchangers. It also incluades design of duct system which anables transportation of heated water from heat exchangers to <b>machine</b> <b>room.</b> In <b>machine</b> <b>room</b> is situated storage tank for accumulation of gained waste heat. This storage tank is conected to heating system and to consumption of hot water which anables utilization of waste heat. Finally there is economic evaluation based on amount of gained waste heat, consumption of heat and costs...|$|R

40|$|Industrial noise {{occurring}} {{within an}} enclosed <b>machine</b> <b>room</b> can {{be harmful to}} workers. Additionally, because of inefficient ventilation systems, equipment will breakdown. In order to protect workeros hearing {{and to ensure that}} machines run safely, the development of a remote system to monitor noise and temperature levels in a <b>machine</b> <b>room</b> is necessary. Here, an air compressor room will be introduced. The web-based remote system for monitoring noise and temperature levels of a <b>machine</b> <b>room</b> will be established by using the embedded JavaScript, the HTML, the web control unit and the ADAM 4118. The noise and temperature data in the <b>machine</b> <b>room</b> will be fed online to the remote PC via the web-based remote system. The user of the remote PC will monitor the status of the noise and temperature online. Both the warning light and video alarm at the remoteos PC interface will be triggered when noise and temperature go beyond the preset thresholds. Moreover, the detected noise and temperature will be continuously recorded onto the web control unit. The historical data will be retrieved by the user when analysis of the historical event is required. The experimental results reveal that the noise and temperature of the <b>machine</b> <b>room</b> will be obtained and shown online on the interface of the remote PC...|$|R
