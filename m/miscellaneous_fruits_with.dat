40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} the maned wolf were studied in {{southeast}} Brazil to understand its response towards changes in the environment and in relation to its prey. By occurrence, <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>fruits,</b> small mammals and wolf`s fruit were the most consumed items. Armadillos, small mammals and wolf`s fruit (Solanum lycocarpum) provided most of the ingested biomass.
