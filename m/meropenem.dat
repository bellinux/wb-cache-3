25|$|Intravenous <b>meropenem</b> is {{routinely}} used in Australia; outcomes {{appear to be}} good and <b>meropenem</b> is currently being tested with ceftazidime in a Thai clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|Intensive-care {{patients}} {{at risk for}} pseudomonas aeruginosa: These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, <b>meropenem</b> or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin. Another is an IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, <b>meropenem</b> or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or tobramycin, plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) or a nonpseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{randomized controlled}} trial that used <b>meropenem</b> 1gram intravenously every 8 hours for 7 to 21 days stated no benefit; however, 28% {{of patients in}} the group subsequently required open antibiotic treatment vs. 46% in the placebo group. In addition, the control group had only 18% incidence of peripancreatic infections and less biliary pancreatitis that the treatment group (44% versus 24%).|$|E
25|$|Without {{access to}} {{appropriate}} antibiotics (principally ceftazidime or <b>meropenem),</b> the septicemic form of melioidosis exceeds 90% in mortality rate. With appropriate antibiotics, {{the mortality rate}} is about 10% for uncomplicated cases but up to 80% for cases with bacteraemia or severe sepsis. It seems certain that access to intensive care facilities is also important, and probably at least partially explains why total mortality is 20% in Northern Australia but 40% in Northeast Thailand. Response to appropriate antibiotic treatment is slow, with the average duration of fever following treatment being 5 to 9 days.|$|E
25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, <b>meropenem,</b> etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.|$|E
2500|$|... carbapenems (<b>meropenem,</b> imipenem, doripenem, but not ertapenem) ...|$|E
2500|$|Theoretical {{reasons are}} given for believing {{mortality}} might be lower in patients treated with imipenem: first, less endotoxin is released by dying bacteria during imipenem treatment, and the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) for imipenem is lower than for ceftazidime. However, no clinically relevant difference was found in mortality between imipenem and ceftazidime treatments. [...] The MIC of <b>meropenem</b> is higher for B.pseudomallei than for many other organisms, and patients being haemofiltered will need more frequent or higher doses.|$|E
2500|$|For infections {{caused by}} ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species, {{treatment}} with imipenem or <b>meropenem</b> {{has been associated}} with the best outcomes in terms of survival and bacteriologic clearance. Cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam have been less successful. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime have failed even more often, despite the organism's susceptibility to the antibiotic in vitro. Several reports have documented failure of cephamycin therapy as a result of resistance due to porin loss. Some patients have responded to aminoglycoside or quinolone therapy, but, in a recent comparison of ciprofloxacin and imipenem for bacteremia involving an ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, imipenem produced the better outcome ...|$|E
2500|$|Intravenous {{ceftazidime}} is {{the current}} drug of choice for treatment of acute melioidosis and should be administered 10 to 14 days after getting the infection. <b>Meropenem,</b> imipenem and the cefoperazone-sulbactam combination (Sulperazone) are also active. [...] Intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate (co-amoxiclav) may be used if {{none of the above}} four drugs is available, but it produces inferior outcomes. Intravenous antibiotics are given for a minimum of 10 to 14 days, and are not usually stopped until the patient's temperature has returned to normal for more than 48 hours. Even with appropriate antibiotic therapy, fevers often persist for weeks or months, and patients may continue to develop new lesions even while on appropriate treatment. The median fever clearance time in melioidosis is 10 days: and failure of the fever to clear is not a reason to alter treatment. It is not uncommon for patients to require [...] treatment continuously for a month or more.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meropenem</b> is an {{antibiotic}} that is delivered {{into the body}} via injection. When produced <b>meropenem</b> is a crystalline antibiotic, {{so it must be}} mixed in with solution before injection can occur. During this process <b>meropenem</b> is mixed with sodium carbonate, then diluted in water after which it can be injected.|$|E
50|$|Intravenous <b>meropenem</b> is {{routinely}} used in Australia; outcomes {{appear to be}} good and <b>meropenem</b> is currently being tested with ceftazidime in a Thai clinical trial.|$|E
50|$|If the {{specific}} Klebsiella {{in a particular}} patient does not show antibiotic resistance, then the antibiotics used to treat such susceptible isolates include ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate, ceftazidime, cefepime, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, <b>meropenem,</b> ertapenem and ciprofloxacin. Some experts recommend the use of <b>meropenem</b> for patients with ESBL-producing Klebsiella. The claim is that <b>meropenem</b> produces the best bacterial clearing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects are {{diarrhea}} (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.6%), injection-site inflammation (2.4%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%) and thrombophlebitis (0.9%). Many of these adverse effects {{were observed in}} severely ill individuals already taking many medications including vancomycin. [...] One study showed Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea happened in 3.6% of <b>meropenem</b> patients. <b>Meropenem</b> has a reduced potential for seizures in comparison with imipenem. Several cases of severe hypokalemia have been reported. <b>Meropenem,</b> like other carbopenems, is a potent inducer of multidrug resistance in bacteria.|$|E

50|$|<b>Meropenem</b> {{is mixed}} with sodium {{carbonate}} post-production before being injected into the body, subsequent analysis of this mixture using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance has shown that a second form of <b>Meropenem</b> is produced. This second form has an additional carbon dioxide on it, and exists alongside the pure form. In {{order to ensure that}} <b>Meropenem</b> stays in the correct form a four-step process was developed wherein the crude form is mixed together with a base in water, a proper pH is established, the product is treated with alkanols, and then the pure form is isolated.|$|E

50|$|<b>Meropenem</b> {{is stable}} to {{mammalian}} dehydropeptidases {{and does not}} require co-administration of cilastatin. It was approved {{for use in the}} United States in 1996. In most indications it is somewhat more convenient to administer than imipenem, 3 times a day rather than 4. Doses of less than one gram may be administered as an IV bolus, whereas imipenem is usually administered as a 20-minute to one hour infusion. <b>Meropenem</b> is somewhat less potent than imipenem against gram-positive pathogens, and somewhat more potent against gram-negative infections. Unlike imipenem, which produced an unacceptable rate of seizures in a phase 2 trial, <b>meropenem</b> is effective for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. A systematic review performed by an employee of the company that markets <b>meropenem</b> concluded that it provides a higher bacterial response and lower adverse event rates than imipenem in people with severe infections, but no difference in mortality rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{carbapenem}} ertapenem is one {{of several}} first-line agents recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America for the empiric treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity. Agents with anti-pseudomonal activity, including doripenem, imipenem, and <b>meropenem</b> are not recommended in this population. Doripenem, imipenem, and <b>meropenem</b> are recommended for high-risk community-acquired abdominal infections and for abdominal infections that are hospital-acquired.|$|E
50|$|In {{the rare}} {{occurrence}} of infection, L. jensenii {{can be treated}} with teicoplanin and <b>meropenem.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Acinetobacter are {{becoming}} more common and may be resistant to carbapenems such as imipenem and <b>meropenem</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{imipenem}} and <b>meropenem,</b> ertapenem {{is highly}} protein-bound, {{which results in}} a longer half-life (4 hours).|$|E
50|$|The {{cephalosporin}} series includes intermediate 7-ACA, cefazolin sodium, cefazolin {{acid and}} ceftriaxone sodium. <b>Meropenem</b> API is also produced.|$|E
50|$|Intensive-care {{patients}} {{at risk for}} pseudomonas aeruginosa: These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, <b>meropenem</b> or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin.

50|$|The {{spectrum}} of activity of the carbapenems imipenem, doripenem, and <b>meropenem</b> includes most Enterobacteriaceace species, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens. Activity is maintained against most strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that are resistant to cephalosporins due {{to the production of}} extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Imipenem, doripenem, and <b>meropenem</b> also exhibit good activity against most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. The observed activity against these pathogens is especially valued as they are intrinsically resistant to many other antibiotic classes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meropenem</b> is {{administered}} intravenously {{as a white}} crystalline powder to be dissolved in 5% monobasic potassium phosphate solution. Dosing must be adjusted for altered kidney function and for haemofiltration.|$|E
50|$|Antimicrobial regimens for {{children}} include an aminoglycoside-based regimen, a carbapenem (imipenem, <b>meropenem,</b> or ertapenem), a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitor combination (piperacillin-tazobactam or ticarcillin-clavulanate), or an advanced-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or cefepime) with metronidazole.|$|E
50|$|The β-lactam {{family of}} {{antibiotic}} molecules {{consists of four}} groups: cephalosporins, monobactam, penicillins, and carbapenems. Different drugs, such as ertapenem, imipenem, <b>meropenem,</b> and doripenem, belong to the class of carbapenem antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{typically}} includes multiple {{antibiotics and}} may include ceftazidime, doxycycline, piperacillin, <b>meropenem,</b> chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole(co-trimoxazole). Although co-trimoxazole has been generally considered the {{drug of choice}} for B. cepacia infections, ceftazidime, doxycycline, piperacillin, and <b>meropenem</b> {{are considered to be}} viable alternative options in cases where co-trimoxazole cannot be administered because of hypersensitivity reactions, intolerance, or resistance. In April 2007, researchers from the University of Western Ontario School of Medicine, working with a group from Edinburgh, announced that they had discovered a potential method to kill the organism, involving disruption in the biosynthesis of an essential cell membrane sugar.|$|E
5000|$|The {{spectrum}} of action includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (including Pseudomonas) and anaerobic bacteria. The overall spectrum {{is similar to}} that of imipenem, although <b>meropenem</b> is more active against Enterobacteriaceae and less active against Gram-positive bacteria. It works against extended-spectrum β-lactamases, but may be more susceptible to metallo-β-lactamases. [...] <b>Meropenem</b> is frequently given in the treatment of febrile neutropenia. This condition frequently occurs in patients with hematological malignancies and cancer patients receiving anticancer drugs that suppress bone marrow formation. It is approved for complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and bacterial meningitis.|$|E
50|$|Using another {{antibiotic}} concomitantly with carbapenem {{can help}} prevent the development of carbapenem resistance. One specific study showed {{a higher rate of}} carbapenem resistance when using <b>meropenem</b> alone compared with combination therapy with moxifloxacin.|$|E
50|$|Doripenem has a {{spectrum}} of activity {{very similar to that}} of <b>meropenem.</b> Its greater stability in solution allows the use of prolonged infusions and it is somewhat less likely to produce seizures than other carbapenems.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Meropenem,</b> {{sold under}} the brandname Merrem among others, is an broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} {{used to treat}} {{a wide variety of}} infections. It is a β-lactam and belongs to the subgroup of carbapenems, similar to imipenem and ertapenem.|$|E
50|$|Ertapenem is a {{carbapenem}} antibiotic marketed by Merck as Invanz. It is structurally {{very similar}} to <b>meropenem</b> in that it possesses a 1-β-methyl group. Other members of the carbapenem group (imipenem, doripenem, and <b>meropenem)</b> are broadly active antibacterials that are used for infections caused by difficult to treat or multidrug-resistant bacteria (such as ESBL expressing Klebsiella pneumonia). They have very short serum half-lives and must be administered by intravenous infusion every 6 to 8 hours. Ertapenem differs from other carbapenems in having a somewhat less broad spectrum of activity (not against Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and in that its extended serum half-life allows it to be administered once every 24 hours.|$|E
50|$|A broad {{spectrum}} cephalosporin and <b>meropenem</b> {{are often used}} because of the good penetration into the central nervous system. If {{the response to the}} antibiotic is poor, the surgical aspiration of the collected pus reduces the mass effect and enhances the efficacy of the antibiotics.|$|E
5000|$|On July 25,2017 Tetraphase {{pharmaceuticals}} released {{top line}} data via press showing clinical cure {{rates in the}} micro-ITT population to be 90.8% and 91.2% for eravacycline (n=195) and <b>meropenem</b> (n=205), respectively (95% CI: -6.3%,5.3%). Primary analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin of the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) patient populations.  Clinical cure rates in the MITT population were 92.4% and 91.6% for eravacycline (n=250) and <b>meropenem</b> (n=249), respectively (95% CI: -4.1%,5.8%).  Clinical cure rates in the CE population were 96.9% and 96.1% for eravacycline (n=225) and <b>meropenem</b> (n=231), respectively (95% CI: -2.9%,4.5%). Eravacycline met the primary efficacy endpoints according to the FDA and EMA guidelines. The secondary analyses were consistent with, and supportive of, the primary outcome according to Tetraphase.There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) in the trial.  Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) rates were similar in both treatment groups with the most commonly reported drug-related adverse events (AEs) for eravacycline were infusion site reactions, nausea and vomiting, each occurring {{at a rate of}} less than 5%. The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides. Full data from IGNITE4 will become available as the company prepares to submit its New Drug Application (NDA) {{in the first quarter of}} 2018 for Eravacycline treatment of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections.|$|E
