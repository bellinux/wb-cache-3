For each integer m≥ 3, we {{show how}} to {{construct}} divergent q-continued fractions whose numerators and denominators {{in each of}} the m arithmetic progressions modulo m converge. In particular, we generalise a curious q-continued fraction of Ramanujan’s with three limit to a continued fraction with <b>m</b> <b>limit</b> points, where m≥ 3 is arbitrary. We evaluate the m limits in terms of ratios of certain unusual q series. Finally, we show how to use Daniel Bernoulli’s continued fraction in an elementary way to create analytic continued fractions with <b>m</b> <b>limit</b> points, for any positive integer m≥ 3. 1...|$|E

30|$|Here we {{are glad}} to {{highlight}} the work of Liu and Li [20], where a new definition of the focal value, quasi-Lyapunov constant, are given for the three-order nilpotent critical point. Meanwhile, the equivalence of quasi-Lyapuonv constant with focal value is proved. A linear recursive formula to compute quasi-Lyapunov constants is also presented. Afterward, they proved that if the three-order nilpotent origin is a m-order weakened focus, then, by a small perturbation for the unperturbed system, there exist <b>m</b> <b>limit</b> cycles in a neighborhood of the origin. At the same time, the origin becomes an elementary critical point and two complex singular points.|$|E
