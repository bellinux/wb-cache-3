Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>business,</b> and I got a phone call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when I read it in the scripts. I probably would have cried." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marcus {{probably}} {{began his}} {{education at the}} age of seven. He was taught at home, in line with contemporary aristocratic trends; Marcus thanks Catilius Severus for encouraging him to avoid public schools. Three of his childhood tutors are known: Euphoric, Geminus, and an unnamed educator. These three are otherwise unattested in the ancient sources, and would probably have been household slaves or freedmen. Since Euphoric had a Greek name, he probably taught Marcus the basics of that language. (He is said to have taught Marcus literature.) Geminus is described as an actor, and he may have taught Marcus Latin pronunciation and general elocution. The educator would have been Marcus' overall supervisor, charged with his moral welfare and general development. Marcus speaks of him with admiration in his Meditations: he taught him to [...] "bear pain and be content with little; to work with my own hands, to mind <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>business,</b> to be slow to listen to slander".|$|E

We need a very different kind of leadership and a powerful language to describe it. Several terms depict what I view as essential components of the contemporary leader: the Leader as 1) Explorer and Journeyer, 2) Creator of Personal and Organizational Coherence, 3) Healer, 4) Mentor-Teacher, and 5) Magus.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed {{a great deal from}} when he was younger. He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just {{want to be involved in}} the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything."
