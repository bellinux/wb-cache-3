From those data, we could not tell whether this effect should be attributed to excessive bed heating or to the electromagnetic fields pro-duced by the electric bed heaters. To sepa-rate the effects of bed-heating from effects that {{may be due to}} electromagnetic field exposure, we have here studied fetal loss in Oregon families living in homes with, or without, ceiling cable electric heat. Our measurements and calculations show that ceiling cable heat exposes room occupants to a magnetic field of about 10 <b>milligauss,</b> and an electric field in the range of 10 - 50 volts/meter when the heat is turned on.

40|$|Magnetic Feshbach {{resonances}} play {{a central}} role in experimental research of atomic gases at ultracold temperatures, as they allow one to control the microscopic interactions between ultracold atoms by tuning an applied magnetic field. These resonances arise due to strong hyperfine interactions between the unpaired electron and the nuclear magnetic moment of the alkali metal atoms. A major thrust of current research is to create an ultracold gas of diatomic alkali-metal molecules in the ground rovibrational state of the ground electronic ^ 1 Σ state. Unlike alkali metal atoms, ^ 1 Σ diatomic molecules have no unpaired electrons. However, the hyperfine interactions of molecules may give rise to magnetic Feshbach resonances.

40|$|The cores of Arp 220, {{the closest}} ultra-luminous {{infrared}} starburst galaxy, {{provide an opportunity}} to study interactions of cosmic rays under extreme conditions. In this paper, we model the populations of cosmic rays produced by supernovae in the central molecular zones of both starburst nuclei. We find that ~ 65 - 100 % of cosmic rays are absorbed in these regions due to their huge molecular gas contents, and thus, the nuclei of Arp 220 nearly complete proton calorimeters. As the cosmic ray protons collide with the interstellar medium, they produce secondary electrons that are also contained within the system and radiate synchrotron emission. Using results from chi-squared tests between the model and the observed radio spectral energy distribution, we predict the emergent gamma-ray and high-energy neutrino spectra and find the magnetic field to be at <b>milligauss</b> levels.

We found that 64 % of the sources are resolved into subcomponents, while 36 % are unresolved even at the highest frequency. Among the resolved sources, 7 have a morphology and a spectral index distribution typical of young radio sources, while in other 4 sources, all optically associated with quasars, the radio properties resemble those of the blazar population. The equipartition magnetic field of the single components are a few tens <b>milliGauss,</b> similar to the values found in the hotspots of young sources with larger sizes. Such high magnetic fields cause severe radiative losses, precluding the formation of extended lobe structures emitting at centimeter wavelengths.

These bounds depend on the unknown hadronic contribution to the gamma-ray background and the backgrounds' source redshifts.

The low intensity of the observed gamma-ray background is marginally inconsistent with a secondary e+/- origin for the radio background reported by ARCADE at ~ 3 GHz, unless the magnetic field strength in their sources is <b>milliGauss</b> or greater.
