25|$|In 1820, Godwin {{published}} Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind as a rebuttal to Malthus' essays. Godwin's main {{argument was}} against Malthus' notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted {{had occurred in}} the United States, due to the expanse of resources available there), every married couple {{would have to have}} at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:In reality, if I had not taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus’s book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might close <b>my</b> <b>argument</b> here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a register of marriages and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, can I have any just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.|$|E

500|$|Colin Clive and Boris Karloff reprised {{their roles}} from Frankenstein as creator and creation, respectively. Hobson {{recalled}} Clive's alcoholism had worsened since filming the original, but Whale did not recast the role because his [...] "hysterical quality" [...] {{was necessary for}} the film. Karloff strongly objected to the decision to allow the Monster to speak. [...] "Speech! Stupid! <b>My</b> <b>argument</b> was that if the monster had any impact or charm, {{it was because he}} was inarticulate– this great, lumbering, inarticulate creature. The moment he spoke you might as well... play it straight." [...] This decision also meant that Karloff could not remove his dental plate, so now his cheeks did not have the sunken look of the original film. Whale and the studio psychiatrist selected 44 simple words for the Monster's vocabulary by looking at test papers of ten-year-olds working at the studio. Dwight Frye returned to play the doctor's assistant, Karl, having played the hunchback Fritz in the original. Frye also filmed a scene as an unnamed villager and the role of [...] "Nephew Glutz", a man who murdered his uncle and blamed the death on the Monster. Boris Karloff is credited simply as KARLOFF, which was Universal's custom during the height of his career. Elsa Lanchester is credited for Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, but in a nod to the earlier film, the Monster's bride is credited only as [...] "?" [...] just as Boris Karloff had been in the opening credits of Frankenstein.|$|E
2500|$|Dershowitz {{responded to}} Finkelstein's reply {{by stating that}} such a mistake {{could not have been}} intentional, as it harmed his own side of the debate: [...] "Obviously, the phrase '2,000 to 3,000 Arabs' refers either to a sub-phase [...] or is a {{typographical}} error." [...] In this particular context, Dershowitz's argument is that Palestinians left as a result of orders issued by Palestinian commanders: [...] "If in fact, 200,000 were told to leave instead of 2,000, that strengthens <b>my</b> <b>argument</b> considerably." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alvin Rosenfeld {{was highly}} {{critical}} of The New York Times coverage, alleging that the article on the whole was misleading and incorrectly framed his argument, the admitted mischaracterization of the AJC was just one example. The mischaracterization, according to Rosenfeld, even includes {{the title of the}} article, which describes the targets of his critical essay as 'Liberal Jews' when, Rosenfeld wrote, [...] "I never referred to liberal Jews, if you read my piece carefully you simply won't find the phrase." [...] Gershom Gorenberg concurs with this criticism writing that the [...] "essay itself refers to 'progressives', a group that overlaps with liberals but is not synonymous". The misleading coverage, Rosenfeld wrote, [...] "reduced <b>my</b> <b>argument</b> to a kind of Left-Right, Conservative-Liberal face off" [...] and led to many people misreading the essay.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to [...] "Facing Facts About Race", the American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates accused Hanson {{of racism and}} stupidity. Referring to Hanson's [...] "Talk", Coates wrote: [...] "Let us be direct—in any other context we would automatically recognize this [...] "talk" [...] as stupid advice. If I were {{to tell you that}} I only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because [...] "Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT," [...] you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties. That is because you would understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I to tell you I wanted my son to marry a Jewish woman because [...] "Jews are really successful," [...] you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is...There is no difference between <b>my</b> <b>argument</b> above and the notion that black boys should be avoided because they are overrepresented in the violent crime stats. But one of the effects of racism is its tendency to justify stupidity." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. <b>My</b> <b>argument</b> about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{painting}} entitled, The Captive (1892), by Irving Couse, {{generated a}} lot of critical reviews. [...] Roger B. Stein writes, [...] "The much disputed critical reading of Irving Couse's The Captive (1892), an image of an old chief with his young white “victim,” raised explicit questions about the intersection of gender and race and {{the function of the}} gaze in constructing meaning in this troubled emotional and cultural territory in a way that shocked viewers because it had not been prepared for earlier." [...] Stein adds, [...] "The curatorial experiment failed not because what the textblock said was untrue (though it was partial, inadequate and rhetorically over-insistent) but because the significant verbal comment on gender had been withheld until the last room of the exhibit. [...] Visually, The West As America was a fascinating study of gender issues from the first Leutze images forward. [...] One may legitimately reply that gender was not the intellectual territory which this exhibition staked out in its verbal script, but <b>my</b> <b>argument</b> here is based upon the premise that a museum exhibition is – or ought to be – first and last a visual experience (the book or catalog is another and different mode of communication)." ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years or so, Hilary Putnam has {{developed}} a series of arguments which use basic theorems of model theory to undermine semantic realism. Here, I discuss two generalizations of these arguments. The first employs some new forms of model theory to generate substantially stronger conclusions than Putnam’s original arguments generated. The second illustrates a method for replacing the model theory in Putnam’s arguments with results from other branches of science—in particular, with results from astronomy. Now, I should say {{at the outset that}} neither of these new arguments is supposed to be persuasive: each of them fails, and fails rather badly, when regarded as a serious objection to realism. Nevertheless, the arguments serve three purposes. First, the parallels between <b>my</b> new <b>arguments</b> and Putnam’s original arguments help to highlight what’s really going on in the latter, and the obvious flaws in <b>my</b> <b>arguments</b> help to isolate the corresponding flaws in Putnam’s arguments. Second, these new arguments expose the inadequacy of several recent defenses of Putnam. (Very roughly, I argue that if these defenses saved Putnam’s arguments, then they would save <b>my</b> <b>arguments</b> as well. But, <b>my</b> <b>arguments</b> are unsalvageable. So, the defenses don’t save Putnam.) Finally, the arguments present a new challenge to Putnam and his defenders: to provide a formulation of the model-theoretic argument which makes that argument seem compelling without doing the same for mine...|$|R
