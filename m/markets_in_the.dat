On {{the example of the}} governmental agency, CzechInvest, it aims to generalize how <b>marketing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public sector works. It poses question whether <b>marketing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public sector can apply the same principles as <b>marketing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> private sector. The paper deals with the fact whether public sector uses the same marketing tools as private sector.

5|$|As {{the capital}} of Silla, {{commerce}} and trading in Gyeongju developed early on. Samguk Sagi has records on the establishment of Gyeongdosi (capital area market) in March, 490 during King Soji's reign, and Dongsi (East Market) in 509, during King Jijeung's reign. In the 1830s, Gyeongju had five five-day markets which remained very active until the late 1920s. Due to its size Gyeongju Bunaejang (Gyeongju village market) {{was referred to as}} one of the two leading <b>markets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yeongnam area, along with Daegu Bunaejang. Transportation developed in the late period of the Japanese occupation, as the Jungang Line and the Daegu Line and the connecting route between Pohang and the northwestern part of Japan were set up, leading to increasing population and developing commerce. After the 1960s, traditional periodic markets gradually transformed into regular markets as the city was flourishing. In periodic markets, agricultural and marine products, industrial products, living necessaries, wild edible greens, herbs, and cattle are mainly traded. As of 2006, Gyeongju had eight regular markets, nine periodic markets and the Gyeongju department store. Traditional periodic markets declined and have become token affairs these days.|$|E
5|$|Between 1960 and 1970, Soviet {{agriculture}} output {{increased by}} 3% annually. Industry also improved; during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1966–1970), {{the output of}} factories and mines increased by 138%, compared to 1960. While the Politburo became aggressively anti-reformist, Kosygin was able to convince both Brezhnev and the politburo to leave the reformist communist leader János Kádár of the People's Republic of Hungary alone because of an economic reform entitled New Economic Mechanism (NEM), which granted limited permission {{for the establishment of}} retail <b>markets.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> People's Republic of Poland, another approach was taken in 1970 under the leadership of Edward Gierek; he believed that the government needed Western loans to facilitate the rapid growth of heavy industry. The Soviet leadership gave its approval for this, as the Soviet Union could not afford to maintain its massive subsidy for the Eastern Bloc in the form of cheap oil and gas exports. The Soviet Union did not accept all kinds of reforms, an example being the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 in response to Alexander Dubček's reforms. Under Brezhnev, the Politburo abandoned Khrushchev's decentralisation experiments. By 1966, two years after taking power, Brezhnev abolished the Regional Economic Councils, which were organized to manage the regional economies of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Other {{new markets}} were to follow. In 1834 Tudor sent {{shipments}} of ice to Brazil along with chilled apples, beginning the ice trade with Rio de Janeiro. These ships typically returned to North America carrying cargos of sugar, fruit and, later, cotton. Ice from traders in New England reached Sydney, Australia, in 1839, initially selling at three pence (£0.70) per pound (0.5kg), later rising to six pence (£1.40). This trade was to prove less regular, {{and the next}} shipments arrived in the 1840s. The export of chilled vegetables, fish, butter and eggs to the Caribbean and to <b>markets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific grew during the 1840s, {{with as many as}} 35 barrels being transported on a single ship, alongside a cargo of ice. Shipments of New England ice were sent as far as Hong Kong, South-East Asia, the Philippines, the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Argentina and Peru.|$|E
