This previous work has highlighted the need for improvements in uniformity and the estimation and control of heating dosage. The aim of this work was to improve heating uniformity and control by numerically modelling the thermal characteristics of the existing <b>Microwave</b> <b>Applicator</b> and so gauge the effects of direct thermal feedback, surface cooling, temperature bias and small uncertainties in power delivery to the time and depth of ablation and so provide a guide to thermal dosage and maximum ablation depths achievable for 5. 8 GHz, 14. 5 GHz and 24. 125 GHz; and to produce a simple Electromagnetic numerical Model to identify methods of improving the uniformity of the heating profile at 14. 5 GHz. And finally, to use these results to guide the design of a New <b>Microwave</b> <b>Applicator</b> using a commercial modeller (CST Design Studio). This New <b>Microwave</b> <b>Applicator</b> operating at 14. 5 GHz incorporates an integral thermal camera viewing the target tissue which provides direct thermal feedback during the ablation process which is used to control the power delivery.

In contrast to most <b>microwave</b> <b>applicators</b> these cavities utilize single mode excitation of the plasma.

40|$|The use of {{numerical}} simulation {{to design a}} <b>microwave</b> <b>applicator</b> dedicated to foaming is presented. During foaming, the load characteristics change, {{both in terms of}} permittivity, thermal properties and size and shape. The use of a growth law able to describe size and characteristics variations of the load as microwave heating proceeds allowed to determine the most suitable microwave source arrangement able to provide both good energy efficiency and heat generation homogeneity. Load shape variations are neglected, assuming that expansion occurs with shape retention. Despite its simplified nature, the model allows to compare different scenarios of <b>microwave</b> <b>applicator</b> geometry, showing the advantages of the multi-physics approach adopted.

40|$|Microwave {{assisted}} extraction (MAE) is {{a relatively}} new class of extraction procedures which is gaining increasing interest mainly due to the smaller quantity of solvents employed, with respect to traditional techniques, together with microwave inherent advantages of being a rapid, volumetric and selective heating source, leading to considerable extraction time reduction and to a better extraction efficiency [1, 4] In the present work different MAE techniques, such as solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) and microwave hydro-diffusion and gravity (MHG), were exploited for the extraction of worn out plant matrices, such as grape marc (from the wine-making process) olive solide waste (from olive oil industry) and rose petals, leaves and stalks, (from rose syrup production). The aim was the development of an eco-sustainable microwave mediated extractive method to be applied to exhauste matrices in order to obtain new bioactive extracts with potential nutraceutical and cosmeceutical properties, leading to matrices with an added value as recycled sources. In order to optimise the MAE process employed to the particular target compounds, the design and development of customized <b>microwave</b> <b>applicators</b> is required. Numerical simulation and design of experiments (DoE) techniques will be highlighted as powerful tools in pursuing optimisation of extraction procedures, by allowing to achieve both highly efficient applicators design and proper processing condition with maximum yield.

40|$|The binder {{removal from}} 430 L-steel MIM parts was {{performed}} in a two-step procedure using chemical and thermal debinding. During the first step, almost 80 % of the binder is removed and a porous structure is created, which then favours the subsequent step. The second step {{was performed in}} a multi-mode <b>microwave</b> <b>applicator,</b> at 2. 45 GHz ISM frequency. Numerical simulation allowed to optimise the <b>microwave</b> <b>applicator</b> loading conditions, in terms of heating homogeneity and efficiency. Experimental validation confirmed that using microwaves {{it is possible to}} reduce conventional debinding times by a factor of 3, and that the resulting brown parts possess a 4 times higher compressive strength. This phenomenon can be ascribed to local over-heating of the regions surrounding neighbouring metal particles, triggered by the high frequency electric field. This promotes the formation of necks among the particles, leading to pre-sintering, despite the overall measured samples temperature, which never exceeded 600 Â°C...|$|E
40|$|The project {{summarized}} {{in this report}} dealt with an evaluation of new <b>microwave</b> <b>applicator</b> ideas for paper preheating and drying. The technical basis for success in this project {{is the fact that}} Industrial Microwave Systems has recently identified certain previously unrecognized wave guide ''design variables'' and hardware implementation concepts that can be employed to greatly improve the uniformity of microwave energy distribution for continuous flow processes. Two applicator concepts were ultimately evaluated, a Cross-Machine Direction (CD) oriented applicator and a Machine Direction (MD) oriented applicator. The economic basis for success is the result of several factors. Since 1985, the capital expenditure required for an industrial <b>microwave</b> <b>applicator</b> system has decreased by a factor of four. The maintenance costs have decreased by a factor of 10 and the life expectancy of the magnetron has increased by more than a factor of four to in excess of 8, 000 hours (nearly one year at 24 hours/day operation) ...|$|E

40|$|Microwave heating {{inside a}} cavity is not uniform and depends on various factors such as: cavity geometry, {{properties}} of treated material and frequency. In most applications of microwave (MW) heating {{there is only}} a small variation {{in the nature of the}} feed.
