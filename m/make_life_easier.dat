25|$|The {{treatment}} for post-polio syndrome is generally palliative {{and consists of}} rest, analgesia (pain relief) and utilisation of mechanisms to <b>make</b> <b>life</b> <b>easier</b> such as powered wheelchairs. There are no reversive therapies. Fatigue is usually the most disabling symptom; energy conservation can significantly reduce fatigue episodes. Such conservation can be achieved with lifestyle changes, reducing workload and daytime sleeping. Weight loss is also recommended if patients are obese. In some cases, the use of lower limb orthotics can reduce energy usage.|$|E

2500|$|Grace has a {{prominent}} feud {{with the character}} Freddie Roscoe. Freddie manages to secure his release after he receives a false alibi. Grace knows the alibi is false and is furious that Freddie has evaded justice. Wall told Withers that [...] "Grace has been bent on revenge ever since she found out that Freddie killed her dad." [...] She was willing to forget her vendetta on the condition Freddie was sent to prison. But his release makes Grace [...] "see red" [...] and she wants a [...] "showdown" [...] with her nemesis. The actress said {{that at this point}} in the story Trevor is fed up with Grace and Freddie's feud. He issues an ultimatum that if she wants to start a family, she must leave Freddie alone. Grace ignores Trevor's warnings and she goes to confront him at her night club where they brawl on the outside balcony. Writers included a [...] "deadly turn" [...] in the story, where there fight escalates and Freddie knocks Grace over the balcony and she falls to the ground. Wall said that writers made in unclear to her whether Freddie did it intentionally or accidentally, but noted [...] "it would certainly <b>make</b> <b>life</b> <b>easier</b> for Freddie if Grace were dead." [...] Hollyoaks hired a stunt double during filming as they could not expect Wall to perform a 12-foot fall.|$|E

Then he held her by her hands, and looked into her face, and she could see how strangely he was altered. She thought that she would hardly have known him, had she not been sure that it was he. She herself was also changed. Who can bear sorrow without such change, till age has fixed the lines of the face, or till care has made them hard and unmalleable? But the effect on her was as nothing to that which grief, remorse, and desolation had made on him. He had had no child with him, no sister, no friend. Bozzle had been his only refuge,--a refuge not adapted to <b>make</b> <b>life</b> <b>easier</b> to such a man as Trevelyan; and he,--in spite of the accusations made by himself against his wife, within his own breast hourly since he had left her,--had found it to be very {{difficult}} to satisfy his own conscience.

60|$|Yes, {{when things}} are put in an extreme way, most people think they know them; but, after all, they are {{comparatively}} few who see the small degrees by which those extremes are arrived at, or have the resolution and self-control to resist the little impulses by which they creep on surely toward a fatal end. Does anybody set out meaning to ruin himself, or to drink himself to death, or to waste his life so that he becomes a despicable old man, a superannuated nuisance, like a fly in winter. Yet there are plenty, of whose lot this is the pitiable story. Well now, supposing us all {{to have the best}} intentions, we working men, as a body, run some risk of bringing evil on the nation in that unconscious manner—half hurrying, half pushed in a jostling march toward an end we are not thinking of. For just as there are many things which we know better and feel much more strongly than the richer, softer-handed classes can know or feel them; so there are many things—many precious benefits—which we, by the very fact of our privations, our lack of leisure and instruction, are not so likely to be aware of and take into our account. Those precious benefits form a chief part of what I may call the common estate of society: a wealth over and above buildings, machinery, produce, shipping, and so on, though closely connected with these; a wealth of a more delicate kind, that we may more unconsciously bring into danger, doing harm and not knowing that we do it. I mean that treasure of knowledge, science, poetry, refinement of thought, feeling, and manners, great memories and the interpretation of great records, which is carried on from the minds of one generation to the minds of another. This is something distinct from the indulgences of luxury and the pursuit of vain finery; and one of the hardships in the lot of working men is that they have been for the most part shut out from sharing in this treasure. It can make a man’s life very great, very full of delight, though he has no smart furniture and no horses: it also yields a great deal of discovery that corrects error, and of invention that lessens bodily pain, and must at least <b>make</b> <b>life</b> <b>easier</b> for all.|$|E
