40|$|The {{ecological}} {{impacts of}} emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals {{are not well}} understood. The lack of experimental approaches for the identification of pollutant effects in realistic settings (that is, low doses, complex mixtures, and variable environmental conditions) supports the widespread perception that these effects are often unpredictable. To address this, we developed a novel screening method (GSA-QHTS) that couples the computational power of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) with the experimental efficiency of quantitative high-throughput screening (QHTS). We present a case study where GSA-QHTS allowed for {{the identification of the}} <b>main</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> pollutants (and their interactions), driving biological effects of low-dose complex mixtures at the microbial population level. The QHTS experiments involved the integrated analysis of nearly 2700 observations from an array of 180 unique low-dose mixtures, representing the most complex and data-rich experimental mixture effect assessment of <b>main</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> pollutants to date. An ecological scaling-up experiment confirmed that this subset of pollutants also affects typical freshwater microbial community assemblages. Contrary to our expectations and challenging established scientific opinion, the bioactivity of the mixtures was not predicted by the null mixture models, and the main drivers that were identified by GSA-QHTS were overlooked by the current effect assessment scheme. Our results suggest that current chemical effect assessment methods overlook a substantial number of ecologically dangerous chemical pollutants and introduce a new operational framework for their systematic identificatio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveOur {{objective}} is to review and assess the <b>main</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> cost-containment policies used in Ireland in recent years, and to highlight how a policy that improved fiscal sustainability but worsened economic sustainability could have improved both if an option-based approach was implemented. MethodThe <b>main</b> public <b>pharmaceutical</b> cost-containment policy measures including reducing the ex-factory price of drugs, pharmacy dispensing fees and community drug scheme coverage, and increasing patient copayments are outlined along with the resulting savings. We quantify the cost implications of a new policy that restricts the entitlement to free prescription drugs of persons older than 70 years and propose an alternative option-based policy that reduces the total cost to {{both the state and}} the patient. ResultsThis set of policy measures reduced public spending on community drugs by an estimated € 380 m in 2011. The policy restricting free prescription drugs for persons older than 70 years, though effective in reducing public cost, increased the total cost of the drugs supplied. The policy-induced cost increase stems from a fees anomaly between the two main community drugs schemes which is circumvented by our alternative option-based policy. ConclusionsOur findings highlight the need for policymakers, even when absorbed with reducing cost, to design cost-containment policies that are both fiscally and economically sustainable...|$|R

40|$|Neuraminidase inhibitors are the <b>main</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> agents {{employed}} for treatments of influenza infections. The neuraminidase structures typically exhibit a 150 -cavity, an exposed pocket that is {{adjacent to the}} catalytic site. This site offers promising additional contact points for improving potency of existing pharmaceuticals, as well as generating entirely new candidate inhibitors. Several inhibitors based on known compounds and designed to interact with 150 -cavity residues have been reported. However, the dynamics {{of any of these}} inhibitors remains unstudied and their viability remains unknown. This work reports the outcome of long-term, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of four such inhibitors, along with three standard inhibitors for comparison. Each is studied in complex with four representative neuraminidase structures, which are also simulated in the absence of ligands for comparison, resulting in a total simulation time of 9. 6 µs. Our results demonstrate that standard inhibitors characteristically reduce the mobility of these dynamic proteins, while the 150 -binders do not, instead giving rise to many unique conformations. We further describe an improved RMSD-based clustering technique that isolates these conformations – the structures of which are provided to facilitate future molecular docking studies – and reveals their interdependence. We find that this approach confers many advantages over previously described techniques, and the implications for rational drug design are discussed...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectivesOur {{objective}} was to identify evidence on the protection achieved by single-dose use of inactivated hepatitis A vaccines in order to evaluate the potential of a flexible booster administration {{in the form of}} a second dose. MethodsA search was conducted for evidence on single-dose administration of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine and its potential impacts on long-term seropositivity rates. The <b>main</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> vaccine manufacturer federations and the corresponding authors of manuscripts were approached for additional epidemiologic data. Correspondence was also sent to the Argentinean Ministry of Health. ResultsWe identified 15 data sources reporting on protection achieved by a single dose of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine. The consistent finding was that the immune and memory response to the booster dose, or post-booster geometric mean titer, was independent of the time since initial vaccination. The impact of the booster on seroprotection was the same across sexes and age-groups. The longest time interval between initial and booster dose was 10. 67 years, indicating that booster doses can be highly immunogenic for up to 10. 67 years after primary vaccination. ConclusionsProtective anti-hepatitis A virus antibody levels after a single dose of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine can persist for almost 11 years and increase or reappear after booster vaccination.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{implement}} a clinical pharmacy service {{focused on the}} comprehensive review of antineoplastic drugs used in therapy of hematological diseases. Methods: An interventional {{study was conducted in}} a Brazilian tertiary teaching hospital in two different periods, with and without a clinical pharmacy service, respectively. This service consisted of an antineoplastic prescription validation (analysis of patients' characteristics, laboratory tests, compliance with the therapeutic protocol and with pharmacotechnical parameters). When problems were detected, the pharmacist intervened with the physician or another health professional responsible for the patient. Inpatients and outpatients with hematological diseases were included. Results: We found an increased detection of drug-related problem by 106. 5 % after implementing the service. Comparing the two periods, an increase in patients' age (26. 7 years versus 17. 6 years), a predominance of outpatients (54 % versus 38 %), and an increase in multiple myeloma (13 % versus 4 %) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (16 % versus 3 %) was noted. The most commonly found problems were related to dose (33 % versus 25 %) and cycle day (14 % versus 30 %). With regard to clinical impact, the majority had a significant impact (71 % versus 58 %), and in one patient from the second period could have been fatal. The <b>main</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> interventions were dose adjustment (35 % versus 25 %) and drug withdrawal (33 % versus 40 %).

40|$|Allergen {{extracts}} for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) {{are currently}} marketed by several manufacturers, with administration schedules {{and amount of}} allergen(s) quite variable in the different products, although almost all are standardized biologically or immunologically. The allergen extracts for SLIT are available in two <b>main</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> forms: solution to be delivered by drop-counters, pre-dosed actuators (mini-pumps) or disposable single-dose vials; tablets with appropriate composition that allows a slow (1 - 2 minutes) dissolution in the mouth in contact with saliva. In Europe, SLIT is prescribed in general for {{one or a few}} allergens, and mixtures are less used, though there is no immunological contraindication to give multiple allergens. SLIT traditionally involves a build-up phase and a maintenance phase with the top dose. The build-up phase has usually the duration of 4 - 6 weeks. The patient must start with the lowest concentration and gradually increase, using the different dosage preparations, until the maintenance dose is reached. Rush and ultra-rush inductions have been introduced, based on the safety profile of SLIT that is very favorable. For these reasons {{it has been suggested that}} an updosing phase maybe even not necessary. The no-updosing approach would result in a treatment that is more patient-friendly and convenient to manage. Indeed, the most recent randomized trials were performed with the no-updosing regimen and their results in term of safety were as favorable as the studies performed with the traditional updosing approach.

Nevertheless, there is a dearth of information regarding their potential adverse effects on non-target organisms. Thus, the aim of this study was the evaluation of sub-lethal effects on the freshwater mussel Dreissena polymorpha of two antidepressants commonly found in the aquatic environment, namely Fluoxetine (FLX) and Citalopram (CT). D. polymorpha specimens were exposed to FLX and CT alone and to their mixture (MIX) at the environmental concentration of 500  ng/L for 14  days. We evaluated the sub-lethal effects in the mussel soft tissues by means of a biomarker suite: the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the activity of the phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The oxidative damage was evaluated by lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation (PCC), while genetic damage was tested on D. polymorpha hemocytes by Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, DNA diffusion assay and micronucleus test (MN test). Finally, the functionality of the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was measured in D. polymorpha gills. Our results highlight that CT, MIX {{and to a lesser extent}} FLX, caused a significant alteration of the oxidative status of bivalves, accompanied by a significant reduction of P-gp efflux activity. However, only FLX induced a slight, but significant, increase in apoptotic and necrotic cell frequencies.

Methods: The samples in this study were all pharmacy students studying in the College of Pharmacy, the Medical University of Ahvaz in the year 93 - 94. Moreover, standard questionnaires were used by this study for collecting data. In order to collect data with regard to hope, life satisfaction, motivation and academic satisfaction, the questionnaire of Snyder hope Scale (1991), Satisfaction with Life Scale questionnaire (SWLS), lepper motivation scale (2005) and Bahrani and Jokar questionnaire (1378) were used respectively. Moreover, data on Academic performance were acquired using the score of the students and the number of students dropping out in each entry and the data were analysed by using SPSS 20. Results: The results did not indicate any significant different in an investigation of five class of students and from four variables of hope, Academic motivation, academic achievement, life satisfaction. But contrast test for combined group showed that academic motivation and academic performance in freshmen students are significantly higher than the other four inputs. Third-year students possess less Academic motivation than other students. Senior students' Academic performance was also significantly lower than of students from other school years.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Obesity {{is often}} {{associated}} with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which refers to a large spectrum of hepatic lesions including fatty liver, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Different investigations showed or suggested that obesity and NAFLD are able to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity of different drugs. Some of these drugs could induce more frequently an acute hepatitis in obese individuals whereas others could worsen pre-existing NAFLD. AIM: The main objective of the present review was to collect the available information regarding the role of NAFLD as risk factor for drug-induced hepatotoxicity. For this purpose, we performed a data-mining analysis using different queries including drug-induced liver injury (or DILI), drug-induced hepatotoxicity, fatty liver, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (or NAFLD), steatosis and obesity. The main data from the collected articles are reported in this review and when available, some pathophysiological hypotheses are put forward. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Drugs that could pose a potential risk in obese patients include compounds belonging to different pharmacological classes such as acetaminophen, halothane, methotrexate, rosiglitazone, stavudine and tamoxifen. For some of these drugs, experimental investigations in obese rodents confirmed the clinical observations and unveiled different pathophysiological mechanisms which could explain why these pharmaceuticals are particularly hepatotoxic in obesity and NAFLD. Other drugs such as pentoxifylline, phenobarbital and omeprazole might also pose a risk but more investigations are required to determine whether this risk is significant or not. Because obese people often take several drugs for the treatment of different obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease, it is urgent to identify the <b>main</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> that can cause acute hepatitis on a fatty liver background or induce NAFLD worsening...|$|R
