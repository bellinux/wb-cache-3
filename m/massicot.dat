50|$|Lead(II) oxide (formula: PbO) {{can occur}} {{in one of two}} lattice formats, {{orthorhombic}} and tetragonal. The tetragonal form is called litharge. PbO can be changed from <b>massicot</b> to litharge (or vice versa) by controlled heating and cooling. At room temperature <b>massicot</b> forms soft (Mohs hardness of 2) yellow to reddish-yellow, earthy, scaley masses which are very dense, with a specific gravity of 9.64. <b>Massicot</b> can be found as a natural mineral, though it is only found in minor quantities. In bygone centuries it was mined. Nowadays <b>massicot</b> arises during industrial processing of lead and lead oxides, especially in the glass industry, which is the biggest user of PbO.|$|E

50|$|As {{determined}} by X-ray crystallography, both polymorphs, tetragonal and orthorhombic feature a pyramidal four-coordinate lead center. In the tetragonal form the four PbO− bonds {{have the same}} length, but in the orthorhombic two are shorter and two longer. The pyramidal nature indicates {{the presence of a}} stereochemically active lone pair of electrons. When PbO occurs in tetragonal lattice structure it is called litharge; and when the PbO has orthorhombic lattice structure it is called <b>massicot.</b> The PbO can be changed from <b>massicot</b> to litharge or vice versa by controlled heating and cooling. The tetragonal form is usually red or orange color, while the orthorhombic is usually yellow or orange, but the color is not a very reliable indicator of the structure. The tetragonal and orthorhombic forms of PbO occur naturally as rare minerals.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{fragments}} of painting are the heads of a heavenly general and bodhisattva, a cuirass, sections of robe, flowers, grasses, lotus petals, part of a decorated canopy, and a mountain with three peaks emerging from the clouds, the precursor of later landscape painting. The paintings were executed upon an earthen render, the lower layer comprising clay and chopped straw, the upper more sandy soil with finer vegetable fibres; the surface was prepared for painting with a white clay ground. The range of pigments {{as much as the}} subject matter shows the impact of foreign culture from the mainland: unlike the limited pallette of the decorated tombs before the introduction of Buddhism, the painting fragments show the use of vermilion, red ochre, minium, yellow ochre, <b>massicot,</b> malachite, azurite, white clay, and lampblack ink.|$|E
5000|$|Litharge (from Greek lithargyros, lithos (stone) + argyros (silver) λιθάργυρος) {{is one of}} {{the natural}} mineral forms of lead(II) oxide, PbO. Litharge is a {{secondary}} mineral which forms from the oxidation of galena ores. It forms as coatings and encrustations with internal tetragonal crystal structure. It is dimorphous with the orthorhombic form <b>massicot.</b> It forms soft (Mohs hardness of 2), red, greasy-appearing crusts with a very high specific gravity of 9.14-9.35. PbO may be prepared by heating lead metal in air at approximately 600°C (lead melts at only 300°C). At this temperature it is also the end product of oxidation of other lead oxides in air. [...] This is often done with a set of bellows pumping air over molten lead and causing the oxidized product to slip or fall off the top into a receptacle, where it quickly solidifies in minute scales.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} lead-tin-yellow can be dated back {{to at least}} the thirteenth century when Type II was applied in frescos, perhaps having been {{discovered}} as a by-product of crystal glass production. Until the eighteenth century Type I was the standard yellow used in oil painting. It was then almost completely replaced in use by Naples yellow. In the nineteenth century its existence had been forgotten and its application was only in 1941 rediscovered by the German scientist Richard Jakobi. That it faded from collective memory has been explained by a confusion with <b>massicot,</b> the name of which was also applied to lead-tin-yellow. The term [...] "lead-tin-yellow", a literal translation of German Blei-Zinn-Gelb, is therefore a modern designation, not the historical name of the pigment. In English {{it used to be}} called [...] "general" [...] after the Italian giallorino. After 1967, Hermann Kühn proved its general use in the traditional oil technique of earlier centuries, also distinguishing the Type I and Type II varieties.|$|E

30|$|A {{bright yellow}} colour {{is used in}} the map to {{indicate}} cities and ports. It is difficult to distinguish between the yellow pigments gamboge, orpiment and <b>massicot</b> (yellow pigments known to be used on East Asian paintings [23]) using the spectral reflectance data in the 400 – 900  nm range [14]. The yellow paint is highly transparent as the black ink remains clearly visible through the yellow paint. It is therefore likely to be an organic yellow such as gamboge, since orpiment and <b>massicot</b> are both highly scattering and relatively opaque. A portable XRF will easily distinguish between the three possibilities and a portable Raman can potentially identify these pigments with certainty as long as the laser-induced fluorescence does not mask the Raman signal.|$|E
30|$|Also in this case, as for litharge, {{nomenclature}} {{is complex}} and confusion may arise. <b>Massicot</b> corresponds to orthorhombic PbO, the high temperature polymorph of this compound [1]. It is reported as a pigment in Egyptian artefacts, mural paintings and manuscripts [1]. On wall paintings, the presence of water and of bicarbonate ions from atmospheric CO 2 dissolution causes the formation of hydrocerussite and cerussite, the latter being the most stable compound of the series, even when intermediate salts are formed according to the present anions in the saline solutions [123, 218]. As for other lead containing paint layers, humidity causes first a darkening of the colour, and finally the formation of leadwhite [64]. Upon exposure to H 2 S, black galena (PbS) is formed in a thin superficial layer [124]. <b>Massicot</b> is stable to laser irradiation, except to 10 mW of 514  nm laser, where a whitish degradation is observed [215]. The effect of infrared laser irradiation was investigated as well and it was found to cause reduction of the pigments, and discolouration due {{to the formation of}} metallic lead. This process is very intense for <b>massicot,</b> as the formed metallic particles are hardly subjected to re-oxidation, due to their bigger size [150].|$|E

30|$|In antique sources, {{the term}} {{litharge}} denotes {{a variety of}} compounds derived from lead oxidation, and other compounds. It is now recognized as the low temperature polymorph of PbO, which is tetragonal [1]. As a pigment, it was identified on manuscripts and mural paintings [1]. It is less stable than <b>massicot</b> to water and to saline solutions commonly found in wall paintings [218]. As a pigment, litharge is stable to infrared (1064  nm) and red lasers (632, 647  nm) irradiation for Raman spectroscopic studies [215, 233]. Using a 632  nm laser with a power above 9  mW (calculated fluence of approximately 45  kW/cm 2) degradation is recorded [215]. For shorter wavelengths, and laser fluence at the sample above 2  kW/cm 2, litharge degrades to <b>massicot</b> [215]. In oil and tempera binder, lead carboxylates are observed, showing stronger intensities compared to those formed from lead white [55]. This increased reactivity was probably well known to artists and artisans, as PbO was often used as a siccative for binders and varnishes [1]. Litharge was as well used for the preparation of other pigments [236]. It degrades to cerussite and hydrocerussite, {{as well as to}} lead sulphate and phosphate, in archaeological sites attributed to the production of painting materials in Thera, Greece [236].|$|E
30|$|The firing {{temperature}} {{was found to}} be higher than expected at the beginning by Jacobi, rather around 800 – 900 °C. At lower temperatures the presence of minium Pb 3 O 4 was detected in the final product (the reaction was incomplete). At higher temperatures the decomposition of final product can occur and the presence of PbO and SnO 2 can be expected in the mixture. However the presence of PbO as <b>massicot</b> can arise also from the improper ratio of primary substances even if the process is done at suitable temperatures [22, 25].|$|E

3000|$|Yellow Pigments Yellow Ochre (Ram Raj), Raw Sienna, Orpiment and Litharge (<b>Massicot)</b> are {{classified}} in yellow pigments {{due to their}} yellow color range. The color of the yellow ochre is on {{the account of the}} presence of various hydrated forms of iron oxide, particularly the mineral limonite (Fe 2 O 3 ·H 2 O). The pigment is prepared from natural earth by selection, grinding, washing, and lavigation. Raw sienna belongs to Sienna (Siena earth) class of earth pigments containing iron oxide and manganese oxide. Along with ochre and umber it is first pigment to be used in human cave paintings. It is considerably transparent and used in paintings as a glaze for its transparency. Orpiment (Hartal in Hindi) is a deep orange-yellow colored arsenic sulphide mineral and gives a brilliant rich lemon-yellow color. Chemically, it is yellow sulphide of arsenic (As 2 S 3). Besides being used as a pigment, it has been used to tint paper to make it yellow. This process also imparts an insecticidal property to paper. Litharge (<b>Massicot)</b> is natural secondary mineral forms of lead oxide (galena) and is made by gently roasting white lead. White lead, which is chemically lead carbonate (2 PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2), upon decarboxylation and dehydration gives on heating at a temperature of about 300  °C is converted into a pale yellow powder which is monoxide of lead (PbO).|$|E

Use of the electron localization function has permitted real-space visualization of the lone pair in these structures. We also discuss the electronic structure of the orthorhombic PbO (<b>massicot,</b> space group Pbma) which again has localized lone pairs, contrary to some earlier expectation.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{structural}} behavior of PbO at high pressure by powder neturon diffraction in a McWhan cell, and by energy-dispersive powder x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell. A phase (γ-PbO) occurs at room temperature between ∼ 0. 7 and ∼ 2. 5 GPa pressure, between the stability fields of litharge (< 0. 7 GPa) and <b>massicot</b> (2. 5 - 10. 1 GPa). There is presumably a triple point in the system at a few kbar and 0 - 200 °C. The phase is related to litharge by a reversible second-order transition. We infer that this {{is associated with the}} collapse of the eu acoustic mode. Unit-cell data at 1. 6 GPa are Pm 21 n, a= 4. 027 (3), b= 3. 950 (3), c= 4. 767 (4), and Z= 2. The pressure evolution of the spontaneous strain follows a simple Landau model. There are four distinct solid-state transformation paths between litharge and <b>massicot</b> that maintain the known topotactic relationship between the phases, maintain the translational symmetry common to both, and make use of continuous transitions between group-subgroup related structural intermediates. Both the γ phase and the modulated low-temperature phase of PbO are closely related to one step on one of these paths. Although there is evidence to suggest that the intermediate states do have a transient existence, several paths appear to be utilized. A transition to a γ-like phase also occurs in SnO, at 2. 5 GPa, although there is no evidence of a massicotlike polymorph of this compound. The orthorhombic phase is stable to at least 7. 5 GPa. 10 page(s...|$|E
30|$|An {{unidentified}} yellow pigment {{was found}} in a single yellow robe on one painting in the manuscript produced in Bukhara but altered in India, Table  1, # 28. XRF analysis showed this yellow contains high levels of lead and tin. FTIR analysis of a small sample did not produce a match for any yellow pigment, including the historic pigment lead–tin yellow. Despite widespread use in European painting from the 15 th to 17 th centuries [30], lead–tin yellow has not been reported in any Indian or Islamic work. An alternative possibility might be use of a yellow lead compound such as litharge or <b>massicot</b> mixed with a tin white. Further work is required to identify this yellow pigment and determine whether this was a Mughal alteration.|$|E
30|$|Shen Kuo [36] {{explained}} {{that there were}} a number of methods to correct writing errors: (1) scrapping (which damages the paper); (2) glue a piece of paper over the writing (which has the disadvantage of potential detachment); (3) painting over with a white paint fen (粉) (which has the disadvantage of not having a high hiding power and multiple layers would be needed); (4) paint over with orpiment (which has the best hiding power and one layer would be sufficient). Finally he stated that this was the reason why ancients prefer qian huang (铅黄 or literally ‘lead yellow’) for painting over error. In the context, one would assume that this meant a lead white and orpiment mixture, but <b>massicot</b> is also commonly referred to as qian huang.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of the heavy-mineral concentrates from the oxidized zones of the lead-zinc-silver deposits, their overlying soils, and the stream sediments of the Keno Hill area, Yukon (Gleeson & Boyle in press) have revealed the occasional occurrence of native lead. The mineral occurs as small ((50 microns) irre-gularly rounded masses and thin plates; rarely as microscopic dendrites and poorly formed crystals. The most intimate associate in some, but not all, occurrences is litharge which may occur as a thin coating on the lead. Other as-sociates are cerussite, <b>massicot(?),</b> wad, and limonite. Spectrographic analyses of the native lead indicate the presence of strong traces to minor amounts of arsenic and tin and traces of Ag,Ba,Bi,Co,Cu,Ni, and Sb.

30|$|The oldest {{references}} that {{mention the}} usage and preparation of lead tin yellow pigments {{can be found}} in medieval manuscripts [10 - 12], but the situation is complicated by the ambiguous denominations of the yellows in various sources. According to Marrifield [13] three types of lead yellows existed, one of them called in Italian literature giallolino or giallorino with attribution fino or di Fiandra [14, 15], in Western European literature it was called <b>massicot</b> [16, 17]. The second type was denoted as giallo di vetro and was probably of Italian origin, the third one was Naples yellow, which contained also antimony [18]. The first two types are supposed to be lead-tin yellows and the literature sources illustrate that the preparation was connected with glass production [19, 20]. From these literature sources we should mention the Bolognese Manuscript or more illustrative books of recipes of ancient glassmakers and the examples from the scientific literature that are preserved in transcriptions from the 16 th and 17 th century. These documents evidence the usage of lead and tin in preparation of yellow glass, enamels or ceramics and their connection with painting [21].|$|E
