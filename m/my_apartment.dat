Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: [...] "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done...

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B". Despite the moderate praise, however, Morgan {{did make a}} jest at the portrayal of the subway in the show, noting {{that it was not}} realistic; she wrote that the set was the [...] "cleanest, emptiest subway station in world [...] No urine. No trash. It's nicer than <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> really." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen gave the episode a mixed review and rated it two-and-a-half stars out of five. Despite writing that [...] "on paper [...] the right episode at the right time", the two criticized the episode, noting that [...] "the teaser never really makes sense in light of the relations offered, the appearance of the mute boy is a messy contrivance, and the ending is too abrupt." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] was {{directed}} by Alex De Rakoff in early November 2004. Clarkson told MTV that she conceived {{the idea of the}} video after assuming that revenge is what every girl wants to do when their boyfriend cheats on them. She added, [...] "You know, 'Why don't I just go trash her house? [...] And so I do it in the video. All I do is break stuff. It's a cool job. I could get used to this." [...] Clarkson expressed that in the music video, viewers would get to see her act out of character. She explained, [...] "In the beginning, I'm like tipping things over and smearing mud all over the walls and it seems like <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> but it ends up being the other girl's that he's with, so it's a humorous video." [...] The music video premiered on Total Request Live on November 16, 2004.|$|E
500|$|The {{book also}} found early success with book buyers {{and the general}} public. It sold 6,000 copies {{in its first year}} and 1,600 in its second. Frances Chrystie, the {{juvenile}} buyer for FAO Schwarz, wrote to Bennett Cerf, Geisel's publisher, [...] "I've been sitting alone in <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> reading Horton aloud to myself over and over again... It's the funniest book I've ever seen... merchandise manager thinks he can find an elephant in the store, and we can make a tree and lay an egg and have a very fine window for Book Week." [...] Mary Stix of James Book Store in Cincinnati, Ohio, noted the book's popularity with adults as well as children. Numerous booksellers invited Geisel to hold autographing events at their stores, and Cerf sent him on a tour across several U.S. cities to promote the book. However, the book was less well received in England, where it was rejected by seven publishers before Hamish Hamilton finally published it, to modest success, in 1947. This mirrored a general trend, as Dr. Seuss books were slow to catch on in England.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Want You" [...] was {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, who previously directed Jackson's music videos for [...] "All for You" [...] and [...] "Just a Little While". It debuted on March 16, 2004, on BET's Access Granted. Intended to resemble Brooklyn, New York, the video was shot in Los Angeles. It portrays Jackson traveling through the city at night to meet her boyfriend, interacting with the various people she encounters along the way. Jackson commented that the video was simple, {{and there was not}} a major production for wardrobe, hair and makeup. Explaining its concept, she stated [...] "I'm coming out of <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> building and walking down the street, and you see all the goings-on in the neighborhood." [...] Jackson praised Meyers as a director, saying [...] "I think he's a wonderful director and he's a good friend, we've been friends since the [...] "All for You" [...] video. He has a great eye." [...] Hollywood casting agents sought a wide variety of extras, ranging from teenage delinquents to mothers picking up her babies and children from day care, and other people commuting by bus to and from work. The video was desired to have an intimate [...] "community" [...] feel. Meyers stated: ...|$|E

It rose to number one the next week with total sales of 65,764 copies, and {{remained}} at the top for three weeks. In an interview with Daily Mail, Gaga explained her feelings on reaching number-one in the United Kingdom saying, [...] "It's been a long running dream {{to have a big}} hit in the UKâ€“ my fans there are so sexy and the people are so innovative and free in how they think about pop culture and music. I was in <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> in Los Angeles {{getting ready to go to}} dance rehearsal when they called and told me, and I just cried." [...] According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) the song was certified platinum, and in July 2016 it became Gaga's third song to pass one million combined sales in the United Kingdom based on streaming. By January 2017, it had been streamed 6.3 million times in the nation according to the Official Charts Company, and has sold 961,000 copies as of September 2017.

2500|$|When the Machado regime {{came to an}} end in 1933, Carpentier {{decided to}} make plans to return to his native land to visit, and in 1936 he made the trip back to Cuba. The time he had spent in Paris for over eleven years had enriched and [...] "oriented his {{expressive}} abilities". Carpentier himself indicated that he was tiring of Paris, and [...] "...in 1939 without any other reason than the nostalgia of Cuba, I vacated <b>my</b> <b>apartment</b> and started the return to La Havana".|$|E

2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production weâ€™ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was sitting in <b>my</b> <b>apartment,</b> wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat â€” it's called a shuffle beat â€” and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{have been}} using the photo of a young [...] "dizzy" [...] girl as mascot, which {{has been used in}} varying ways. Christensen explains: [...] "The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my {{grandmother}} on mother's side. She died around the age of 12â€“14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. I have one hanging in <b>my</b> <b>apartment.</b> The same photo hung in my home, and when we were searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), we felt it was a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo." [...] On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams coming from her eyes. The 2002 compilation album The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, Rotator. During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal {{on the front of the}} 2010 Dizzcography box set, which contained all previous albums of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD Live in Concert 2010 features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an anaglyph 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album Forward in Reverse and its singles.|$|E

5000|$|The album's title (as well as {{the names}} of the songs) is taken from the then-unpublished The Mummery Book by Lynch's spiritual teacher, Adi Da Samraj.
