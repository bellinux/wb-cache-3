The laptop computing era has changed to mobile computing; mobile devices are built with good number of useful applications. Cloud Computing is one such development which serves for many purposes like Software as a Service (SAAS), Platform as a service (PAAS) etc. Cloud computing is used for storing large amount of data, access and process the data from any {{corner of the world}} via internet [1][2]. We are proposing a concept with Cloud Technology and Mobile Computing, resulting in the services of Cloud Computing like SAAS, where the web application is deployed on the cloud which can facilitate storage also. We also focus on remote <b>mobile</b> <b>administration</b> if the device is misplaced or lost. These operations are performed through the web browser with the application installed on the mobile while the data can be stored on the remote server which is accessible through the Internet. The data which is been captured can be displayed on the web page...|$|E

Methods: A total of 4, 280 US endocrinologists were randomly selected from the CMS National Plan and Provider Enumeration System and were invited by mail to participate in a 20 -minute online survey. In order to qualify, respondents had to be the primary physician making treatment decisions for at least one patient for their acromegaly. Results: Results are based on responses from 126 physicians from primarily urban and suburban practices, with a median of five acromegaly patients. A total of 70 % of patients are currently receiving drug therapy; among these, 91 % are on octreotide (51 %), lanreotide (29 %), or pasireotide (11 %), alone or in combination with another therapy. Nearly half of the respondents thought that the impact of patient adherence on therapy outcome for acromegaly was either not very (40 %) or not at all (7 %) significant. Respondents who believe patient adherence significantly impacts treatment outcome {{were significantly more likely to}} discuss automated adherence reminders (50 % vs 26 %; P= 0. 015), <b>mobile</b> <b>administration</b> programs (57 % vs 35 %; P= 0. 029), and symptom tracking (72 % vs 42 %; P= 0. 002). Overall, 44 % of respondents routinely recommend education/emotional support programs, and 25 % routinely recommend financial assistance programs. Respondents who believe patient adherence significantly impacts treatment outcome generally were more familiar with individual education and emotional support programs compared to those who do not, although they were not more likely to routinely refer patients to any of these resources. Conclusion: There are unmet needs with respect to increasing awareness among physicians of the importance of patient adherence to therapy, resources available to patients, and how collaboration among patients, nurses, and physicians can improve adherence and overall treatment experiences.

The treatment was compared with a guided self-help treatment based on interpersonal psychotherapy (mIPT). The treatment platform could be accessed through smartphones, tablet computers, and standard computers. A total of 52 participants were diagnosed with SAD and randomized to either mCBT (n = 27) or mIPT (n = 25). Measures were collected at pre-treatment, during the treatment, post-treatment and 3 -month follow-up. On the primary outcome measure, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale - self-rated, both groups showed statistically significant improvements. However, mCBT performed significantly better than mIPT (between group Cohen's d = 0. 64 in favor of mCBT). A larger proportion of the mCBT group was classified as responders at post-treatment (55. 6 % versus 8. 0 % in the mIPT group). We conclude that CBT for SAD can be delivered using modern information technology. IPT delivered as a guided self-help treatment may be less effective in this format. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In general, Wireless {{communication}} {{is defined as}} sharing of information between one or more systems through wireless links. Wireless networks can be categorized into two different modes as infrastructure based and infrastructure less. Infrastructure based mode {{is the most common}} use wireless mode for the end user loop. Infrastructure fewer modes also called as the Ad hoc mode relies on wireless communications without any fixed infrastructure. Infrastructure based networks are characterized by their use of access points (AP), or base stations. The most known example of infrastructure based wireless network is GSM and more recently, Wi-Fi. Ad Hoc networks introduce a new way of communication. An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile nodes that dynamically functions as a network without the use of any existing infrastructure and centralized <b>administration.</b> <b>Mobile</b> Ad-hoc networking (MANET), an emerging field of wireless networking is an autonomous system of wireless mobile hosts, connected by wireless links that dynamically create a temporary network and establish an infrastructure less network.

A firewall {{can be set up}} to protect an entire network or just a single host. As it {{is becoming more and more}} popular to connect mobile phones and other hand held devices to the Internet, the big question is;"how to protect those devices from the perils of the Internet?" This work investigates issues with the implementation of a firewall system for protecting <b>mobile</b> devices. Firewall <b>administration</b> is an error prone and difficult task. Setting up a correctly configured firewall in a network setting is a difficult task for a network administrator. To enable an ordinary mobile phone user to set up a firewall configuration to protect his mobile phone it is important to have a system that is easy to understand and warns the user of possible mistakes. Generic algorithms for firewall rule-set sorting and anomaly discovery are presented. This ensures that the rule-set is error free and safe to use. This is a vital part of any firewall system. The prototype developed can be used to find errors in existing firewall rule-sets. The rule-set can be in either a native firewall configuration format (currently only IPF is supported) or in a generic XML format.

Enhanced data services through smart phones are raising expectations that governments will finally deliver services that are in line with a consumer ICT lifestyle. To date, it is not certain which form of technological standards will take the lead, e. g. enhanced m-services or traditional Internet-based applications. Yet, with the introduction of interactive applications and fully transactional services via 3 G smart phones, the currently untapped segment of the population (without computers) have the potential to gain access to government services at a low cost. E-government started officially in 2008. Our research in Turkey reflects the current market situation in an emerging country and presents an update on the resistance points encountered while engaging with mobile and traditional e-government interfaces.

The node in the network not only acts as hosts but also as routers that route data from/to source/destination node in the network. Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction which results in change of its links to other devices frequently. Each must forward traffic unrelated to its own use and therefore be a router. Routing in MANET has been a challenging task ever since the wireless networks came into existence. The major {{reason for this is}} the dynamic nature of network topology due to node mobility. A number of protocols have been developed for accomplishing this task.
