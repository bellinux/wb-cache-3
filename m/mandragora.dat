5|$|During {{the late}} 1860s, Tchaikovsky began to compose operas. His first, The Voyevoda, {{based on a}} play by Alexander Ostrovsky, premiered in 1869. The {{composer}} became dissatisfied with it, however, and, having re-used parts of it in later works, destroyed the manuscript. Undina followed in 1870. Only excerpts were performed and it, too, was destroyed. Between these projects, Tchaikovsky started to compose an opera called <b>Mandragora,</b> to a libretto by Sergei Rachinskii; the only music he completed was a short chorus of Flowers and Insects.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history {{mandrake}}s (<b>Mandragora</b> officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system depressant, and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management prior to and during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E

Alkaloids present included hyoscyamine, hyoscine, cuscohygrine, apoatropine, 3-alpha-tigloyloxytropane, 3-alpha,6-beta-ditigloyloxytropane and belladonnine. Non-alkaloid constituents included sitosterol and beta-methylesculetin (scopoletin).|$|E
25|$|In one treatment, <b>Mandragora</b> autumnalis is {{the main}} species of <b>Mandragora</b> found all around the Mediterranean, in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, {{southern}} Portugal, southern Spain, southern Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan, being absent in northern Italy and a region {{on the coast of}} former Yugoslavia, where it is replaced by M.officinarum.

25|$|Within the genus, {{studies have}} used {{different}} circumscriptions of the Mediterranean mandrakes. Two studies which separate plants {{found in the}} Levant (<b>Mandragora</b> autumnalis) from {{those found in the}} rest of the Mediterranean area (<b>Mandragora</b> officinarum) suggest that there are two clades in the genus: one based in the Mediterranean and beyond to Turkmenistan and Iran, and one in the Sino-Himalayan region. A simplified cladogram based on these studies is shown below. In one of the studies, M.chinghaiensis was embedded within M.caulescens.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many members}} of the Solanaceae, species of <b>Mandragora</b> contain highly biologically active {{alkaloids}}, tropane alkaloids in particular. Hanuš et al. reviewed the phytochemistry of <b>Mandragora</b> species. More than 80 substances have been identified; their paper gives the detailed chemical structure of 37 of them. The different parts of the plant contain different proportions and concentrations of alkaloids, with the roots having the highest concentration. Alkaloids present include atropine, apoatropine, belladonnine, cuscohygrine, hyoscyamine, scopolamine (hyoscine), 3α-tigloyloxytropane and 3α,6β-ditigloyloxytropane. M.caulescens and M.turcomanica are also reported to contain anisodamine.|$|E

500|$|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was {{met with}} near {{universal}} acclaim. In The Times, Deborah Loudon {{described it as a}} children's book that would be [...] "re-read into adulthood" [...] and highlighted its [...] "strong plots, engaging characters, excellent jokes and a moral message which flows naturally from the story". Fantasy author Charles de Lint agreed, and considered the second Harry Potter book as good as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, a rare achievement among series of books. Thomas Wagner regarded the plot as very {{similar to that of the}} first book, based on searching for a secret hidden under the school. However, he enjoyed the parody of celebrities and their fans that centres round Gilderoy Lockhart, and approved of the book's handling of racism. Tammy Nezol found the book more disturbing than its predecessor, particularly in the rash behaviour of Harry and his friends after Harry withholds information from Dumbledore, and in the human-like behaviour of the <b>mandragoras</b> used to make a potion that cures petrification. Nevertheless, she considered the second story as enjoyable as the first.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the team, lead by Bloom, head to Domino. Borrowing Daphne's mask, Bloom recalls Daphne's {{memories}} of when Domino was a paradise {{before it was}} covered with ice and snow. The group head towards the mountain where the book is hidden, but Tecna informs them of a mystical bird called the Roc that supposedly guards the library. The Specialists scale the mountain first but accidentally causes the Roc to awaken, who flies off with the boys hanging on for dear-life. The girls save the boys with Musa's harmonic spells and successfully allow the Roc to land. Inside the library, they meet Bartelby, Oritel's deceased scribe in spiritual form, who shows them the Book of Fate. In it, they discover that Bloom's parents {{were part of a}} good warrior group known as the Company of Light, that served to eradicate Evil {{in the form of the}} three Ancestral Witches and that Oritel as well as all the people of Domino are currently trapped in the Obsidian Circle. However, the team finds the remaining pages empty after chronicling the Company of Light's battle with the Ancestral Witches, with no clue on the outcome. Bartelby then foretells a prophecy where six legendary warriors will save Domino, and that a king without a crown will free the Sword of King Oritel. As the team celebrates this new discovery, Riven is bitten by one of <b>Mandragora's</b> spy bugs and becomes her puppet.|$|R

25|$|Traditionally, <b>Mandragora</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} to be closely related to Atropa and Lycium, being grouped {{together in the same}} tribe or subtribe as at least the first of these genera.

It has thus been placed in its own tribe, Mandragoreae.|$|E
25|$|Surrealism as a {{political}} force developed unevenly around the world: in some places more emphasis was on artistic practices, in other places on political practices, and in other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to supersede both the arts and politics. During the 1930s, the Surrealist idea spread from Europe to North America, South America (founding of the <b>Mandrágora</b> group in Chile in 1938), Central America, the Caribbean, and throughout Asia, as both an artistic idea and as an ideology of political change.|$|E
25|$|Other sources {{continue}} to divide Linnaeus's M.officinarum into two species, but differently. Plants {{from the western}} Mediterranean, from Turkey westwards to the Iberian peninsula and Morocco, are placed in M.officinarum; plants from the eastern Mediterranean, the Levant, are placed in M.autumnalis. One {{difference between the two}} species thus circumscribed is that seeds of M.autumnalis are more than twice the size of those of M.officinarum.

25|$|<b>Mandragora</b> is a {{plant genus}} {{belonging}} to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Members of the genus are known as mandrakes. There are between three and five species in the genus. The one or two species found around the Mediterranean constitute the mandrake of ancient writers such as Dioscorides. Two or three further species are found eastwards into China. All are perennial herbaceous plants, with large tap-roots and leaves {{in the form of}} a rosette. Individual flowers are bell-shaped, whitish through to violet, and are followed by yellow or orange berries.|$|E
25|$|Species of <b>Mandragora</b> are {{perennial}} herbaceous plants. They {{have large}} vertical tap-roots, sometimes forked. Their stems are short or virtually absent. The leaves form a rosette {{at the base}} of the plant. The flowers are sometimes borne on a short stalk (scape), and are solitary, with whorls of five parts. The sepals are joined at the base, as are the petals, both in the shape of a lobed bell. The stamens are shorter than the petals, joined to the floral tube towards the base. The ovary has two chambers (locules). After fertilization, a yellow or orange fruit forms (botanically a berry).|$|E

2500|$|Jackson and Berry (1979) and Ungricht et al. (1998) have {{documented}} the subsequent confusion over {{the number of}} Mediterranean species of <b>Mandragora</b> and their scientific names.

The size and shape of the fruit and the colour and time of appearance of the flowers have been used to distinguish possible species. In the 1820s, Antonio Bertoloni used flowering time to name two species as <b>Mandragora</b> vernalis, the spring-flowering mandrake, and <b>Mandragora</b> autumnalis, the autumn-flowering mandrake. Identifying the former as Linnaeus's M.officinarum, works such as Flora Europaea listed two Mediterranean species of Mandragora: M.officinarum and M.autumnalis. Using statistical analysis of morphological characters, Ungricht et al. found no distinct clusters among the specimens they examined and concluded that Linnaeus's M.officinarum is a single, variable species. Other sources divide M.officinarum sensu lato differently.
