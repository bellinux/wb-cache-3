40|$|Asymmetric {{information}} and {{conflicts of interest}} between equity and debt holders can force a distressed but efficient firm to liquidate and may enable a distressed <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm</b> to continue. In the extreme, if it is costless for an <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm</b> to mimic an efficient firm in a debt restructuring, efficient and <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> are equally likely to continue or liquidate. This article shows that Chapter 11 procedures impose costs on <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> that would otherwise mimic efficient firms. This separation induces voluntary filing for bankruptcy by <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> and consequently enables efficient firms to continue when they would otherwise be liquidated.

In this paper the <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm</b> may adopt the efficient technology at some cost. Government policy can be effective for an intermediate range of adoption costs. To induce adoption, the government should commit to favour the (initially) <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm,</b> despite both firms eventually having the same technology. Even with limited government commitment, optimal favouritism provides more incentives for technology adoption than a symmetric mechanism. Auctions; Procurement; Protection; Technology Adoption...|$|R

Within this context, this paper compares performance and process standards modeling the variability of industry-level compliance and therefore the resultant level of food safety. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted manipulating five factors: the variances of input use of efficient and <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms,</b> the proportion of <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> in the industry, {{the mean of the}} error term for <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms,</b> and the policymakers' level of risk aversion. Results suggest that process standards may be preferred over performance standards when <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> prevail in the industry, when input use is highly variable and when the regulator pays less attention to the variability of industry-level compliance and more {{to the level of the}} standard.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a direct {{estimate of the}} cost efficiencies of firms in the US solar energy industry. It suggests that the cost efficiency in the industry {{is associated with the}} risk-bearing behaviour of firms. Less efficient firms maintain low price-cost margins and high labour–capital ratios in order to compete with their efficient peers. The study then establishes the linkage between cost efficiency and stock returns. It shows that the change in cost efficiency, rather than cost efficiency itself, possesses a stronger explanatory power for stock returns. A buy-and-hold strategy for stock portfolios of different efficiency levels is then analysed. The 3 -year returns of the <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm</b> portfolios tend to outperform the efficient firm portfolios. The finding further shows that the improvement in cost efficiency of the <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> is larger than that of the efficient firms. Previous literature has indicated that <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> have higher failure rate, so they are forced to improve cost efficiency...|$|R

Borrowing an important tool that is widely used in the strategic trade policy literature, I employ a third country model {{to examine the effects}} of a specific policy initiative and a firm-specific advantage on individual firm configuration. The main findings are that taxes hurt the <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm</b> more, causing it to choose the exporting rather than the multinational method of serving markets. Consequently, multinational production is associated with cost-efficiency while the <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm</b> is more likely to be an exporter. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} {{national}} welfare of uneven technical progress and eli mination {{of a firm}} is analyzed under {{the existence of a}} Cournot oligopolistic sector. An increase in the share of an <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm,</b> owing to its innovations, results in a shift of production from more efficient <b>firms</b> to the <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm,</b> causing a less efficie nt allocation of production. It may decrease welfare even though the innovation itself is beneficial. Conversely, policies keeping ineffic ient firms from innovations or eliminating them may increase welfare, though they make the market structure more oligopolistic.

The analysis of the competition structure of Russian industrial sectors reveals that domestic concentration ratios remain high at regional level. We find that foreign entry has positive effect on the productivity of most efficient domestic firms. The effect of foreign entry on productivity of <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> is negative.

40|$|This article uses a game theoretic {{model of}} Chapter 11 {{bankruptcy}} and out-of-court debt restructuring {{to evaluate the}} economic efficiency of U. S. bankruptcy procedures. The model assumes {{that there are two}} types of failing firms: economically <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> that should liquidate and economically efficient firms that should be saved. From an efficiency standpoint, the goal of corporate bankruptcy procedures is to liquidate the former under Chapter 7 and save the latter by reorganization under Chapter 11 -that is, to filter out <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms.</b> However, it is difficult to identify which failing <b>firms</b> are <b>inefficient,</b> so bankruptcy procedures may operate with error. The model shows that a pooling equilibrium may occur in which both efficient and <b>inefficient</b> failing <b>firms</b> reorganize under Chapter 11. Adding restructuring as a bankruptcy alternative appears to make things worse, since the transactions cost savings in restructuring compared to reorganization makes the inefficient equilibrium more likely to occur...|$|R

Contrary {{to the findings of}} previous studies, competition is {{more likely to have a}} positive effect on the investments of the small firm than on those of the large firm.

40|$|A common {{argument}} against compulsory licensing {{of intellectual property}} maintains that it facilitates the entry of inefficient producers, which may reduce social welfare independently of any effects on R and D incentives. We study the issue in a model where the innovative firm, under the threat of compulsory licensing, react strategically by choosing between quantity and price competition. We show {{that the risk of}} a reduction in static welfare due to the entry of highly <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> is avoided if licensing entails a royalty per unit of output and zero fixed fee. The rationale behind this result {{lies in the fact that}} compulsory licensing threat works as a disciplining device to improve static social welfare, even when the applicant is a high cost <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm.</b> compulsory licensing, essential facilities, entry, welfare...|$|R
40|$|Brazil's trade {{liberalization}} between 1990 and 1993, and its partial re- versal in 1995, {{are used to}} study how reduced inward trade barriers affect productivity. The production function of Brazilian manufactur- ers is estimated at the ISIC 3 two-digit level under various alternatives, including an extension of Olley and Pakes' (1996) procedure. Firm-level productivity is inferred and then related to trade. Findings suggest that (1) foreign competition pressures firms to raise productivity markedly, whereas (2) the use of foreign inputs plays a minor role for produc- tivity change. (3) The shutdown probability of <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> rises with competition from abroad, thus contributing positively to aggre- gate productivity.

We confirm the joint pattern of capital in- flows and institutional decline in a large panel of countries. We show theoretically that this joint pattern naturally follows from a “soft budget constraint” syndrome wherein persistently cheap external funding undermines incentives to maintain good institutions –understood here as the degree of government commitment not to support <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms.</b> Low institutional quality ultimately raises the share of <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms,</b> which lowers average productivity and raises productivity dispersion across firms –the typical pattern of productivity in southern Europe over the period under consideration...|$|R

Secondly, an <b>inefficient</b> <b>firm</b> might be able to identify reference units.

In this study, we focus on how to detect these firm-relevant reference units. While applying the existing methods for identification of reference units, i. e. the intensity variable method and the dominance method, on a data set concerning booking centres in the Swedish taxi market, shortcomings in these methods were identified. This motivates {{the development of a new}} method. This new method, the sphere measure, enables an inefficient unit to identify existing and efficient units that have the largest similarity with itself.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an oligopolistic {{model of}} international trade with het-erogeneous firms and endogenous R&D to examine how trade liberalization affects firm and industry productivity, {{as well as social}} welfare. We identify four effects of trade liberalization on productivity: (i) a direct effect through changes in R&D investment; (ii) a scale effect due to changes in firm size; (iii) a selection effect due to <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> leaving the market; and (iv) a market-share reallocation effect as efficient <b>firms</b> expand and <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> reduce their output. We show how these effects operate in the short run when market structure is fixed, and in the long run when market structure is endogenous. Among the robust results that hold for any market structure are that trade liberalization (i) increases (decreases) aggregate R&D for low (high) trade costs; (ii) increases expected firm size if trade costs are high; and (iii) raises expected social welfare if trade costs are low.

40|$|The recent {{trade and}} {{productivity}} literature shows that trade liberalization {{can lead to}} productivity gains through increased competition and exit of <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> and reallocation of market shares {{in favor of more}} efficient firms. In this paper, an attempt is made to examine the impact of trade liberalization on firm productivity in the Philippines. The country presents an interesting case due to its adoption of selective protection amidst an incomplete trade liberalization process. Based on an unbalanced firm-level panel dataset covering an eight-year period from 1996 to 2006, the results provide some evidence in support of the hypothesis that trade liberalization leads to productivity gains and conversely, protection leads to productivity losses. This is confirmed by the negative and significant coefficient on EPR for the purely importable sector. The results tend to indicate that the selective protection policy undermined the process of output restructuring and reshuffling of resources from less productive to more productive firms as protection of selected industries allowed the survival of <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms.</b> trade liberalization, total factor productivity, Philippines, selective protection, Philippine manufacturing industry...|$|R

Lastly, we try to detect the common characteristics of the most <b>inefficient</b> <b>firms</b> and find that most of these firms are immature and low scale companies.
