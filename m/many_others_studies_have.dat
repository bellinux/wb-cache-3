40|$|Organizational {{structures}} of any agency determine {{the efficiency of}} that agency in the fulfillment of its mandate in service delivery since it galvanizes the operations therein. In an attempt to address the various environmental problems defacing the cities, the Nigerian government had set up environmental protection agencies with the sole mandate of protecting and developing the environment. This task seems so challenging to these agencies that despite what seem to be their spirited efforts over the years; the problems persist and even {{seems to be on}} the increase including erosion, flooding, traffic congestion, pollution and solid waste management problems among <b>many</b> <b>others.</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> established that factors such as manpower, funding, equipment, and even changes in administration among others do have significant influence on the performance of these agencies. It is evident that there had been an increment in government budgetary provisions for the services of these agencies to the tune of billions of naira and yet, there is little or nothing to show for it. This study therefore looks into the Organizational structure of the environmental management agency in the cities of Awka and Onitsha in Anambra State, Nigeria with a view to examining its composition and operations towards addressing the challenges of urban environmental problems of the cities. Findings show that the environmental management agency is engulfed in bureaucratic bottle neck and role conflict. The Anambra State Environmental Protection Agency (ANSEPA...|$|E
40|$|Recently, Birsen Cakir et al. {{have defined}} {{a role for}} the abscisic acid {{signalling}} ASR peptide in the regulation of heterotrophic sugar metabolism, highlighting the importance of cross-talk between these signal trans-duction pathways in a broad species range. Analyses of developmental changes in tomato fruit metabolism suggest that the import of hexoses is also similarly regulated in this species. Taken together with the pre-viously defined characteristics of ASR peptides, these findings should facilitate further dissection of the chan-ging sugar and hormonal signal circuitry during fruit development. Recent work by Birsen Cakir and colleagues [1] suggests a novel function for the ASR [abscisic acid (ABA), stress and ripening] protein family in fruit sugar metabolism. By means of a yeast one-hybrid approach, these authors isolated the grape ASR gene (VvMSA), a transcriptional regulator, using a proximal promoter region of the grape hexose transporter VvHT 1 [2] as bait. This genomic region compromises two ‘sugar boxes ’ (sucrose box 3 and SURE 1 sequences [3]) and its activity has previously {{been shown to be}} induced by sugars in tobacco plants [4]. The authors demonstrated specific binding of VvMSA to these elements at the VvHT 1 promoter. Moreover, regulation of VvHT 1 by VvMSA was shown in vivo by using promoter::reporter gene fusions to conduct co-expression experiments. These important findings, together with the unexpected absence of these proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, allow us to conceive new ways for studying the cross-talk between sugar metabolism and ABA signalling in fruits. Discovery of ASR genes To give historical perspective to the recent findings of Cakir et al. [1], we will briefly describe the key papers that preceded this work.

5000|$|<b>Many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> been {{conducted}} in this general vein.

30|$|The {{third and}} final {{modality}} we recommend is pre- and post-exercise intracompartmental pressure measurements.

Although there has been evidence of variance in normal compartment values, any significant rise in pressure post-exercise is highly indicative of CECS [2, 3, 6, 12, 15, 17, 19]. In fact, <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> concluded that the best method for diagnosing CECS is evaluation of intracompartmental pressures (ICPs) before and after exercise [2, 5, 12, 15, 17, 20].

In conclusion, we recommend a work-up of forearm CECS using all three modalities.|$|R

Since Putnam {{published}} Making Democracy Work, his seminal work on {{the effect}} of civic associationalism in promoting better institutional performance, <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> confi rmed the deleterious effects of civil society in promoting democratic breakdown and malperformance. To solve the empirical puzzle as to whether civil society is a bane or boon for democracies, this article examines the effect of the pre-transitional strength and post-transitional density of civil society on state institutional performance among more than 60 states since the third wave. The results show that the strength of civil society prior to transition and its density post-transition not only play a signifi cant role in the deepening of political freedoms and civil liberties among transitional citizens, but also lead to better institutional performance. Hence, Putnam’s major fi ndings can be extended in the context of third- and fourth-wave democracies...|$|R

50|$|Several {{alternatives}} to QWERTY {{have been developed}} over the years, claimed by their designers and users to be more efficient, intuitive, and ergonomic.

Economists Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis have noted that rigorous studies are inconclusive as to whether they actually offer any real benefits, and some studies on keyboard layout have suggested that, for a skilled typist, layout is largely irrelevant - even randomized and alphabetical keyboards allow for similar typing speeds to QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards, and that switching costs always outweigh the benefits of further training on whichever keyboard you already use.|$|R

Furthermore, the CDSS identified 26 DRPs that were overlooked in the manual medication review showing that the CDSS adds value to performing the medication review manually. Meulendijk et al.

Perhaps the best-known example of ant-plant mutualism is in bullhorn acacias (Acacia cornigera) and their tending Pseudomyrmex ants in Central America.

For many plants, including the bullhorn acacias, ants can significantly reduce herbivory from both phytophagous insects as well as larger organisms, such as large grazing mammals. Obligately associated ant species are some of most aggressive ants in the world, and can defend a plant against herbivory by large mammals by repeatedly biting their attacker and spraying formic acid into the wound.|$|R

Here we demonstrate constitutive expression of chemokine receptors CCR 3, CCR 5 and CXCR 4 in the A 549 cell line by Western blot and RT-PCR. The results of this study show that chemokine receptors are present on airway epithelial cells and that chemokines may act as a stimulus for epithelial cell mucin gene expression.
