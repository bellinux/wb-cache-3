40|$|The title compound, C 8 H 13 N 10 +&# 183;Cl&# 8722;, is the <b>monochlorhydrate</b> salt of an {{aromatic}} bis(diaminotriazole). The cation is centrosymmetric, {{lying about}} an inversion centre (Ci symmetry) because the acidic H atom is disordered over two centrosymmetrically related ring N atoms, with equal multiplicity. It {{is noteworthy that}} protonation occurs at an N atom of the ring, instead of at the C&# 8212;NH 2 or N&# 8212;NH 2 amino groups. The chloride anions are also in special positions, as they lie on binary axes, and so the crystallographically independent unit contains half of a formula unit. The N atom of the C&# 8212;NH 2 group is sp 2 -hybridized and the amino group is coplanar with the triazole ring [dihedral angle = 5 &# 8197;(3) &# 176;], while the N atom of the N&# 8212;NH 2 amino group is pyramidal. The C=C bonds are in E conformations and the cation is flat because the conformation of the carbon chain is fully extended. The chloride anions are hexacoordinated, in a distorted trigonal&# 8211;prismatic geometry, and they are involved, as acceptors, in six hydrogen bonds. Chains of hydrogen-bonded cations, running along c and a + c, are generated by c-glide and C 2 rotation, respectively. This combination of N&# 8212;H [...] . Cl and N&# 8212;H [...] . N hydrogen bonds leads {{to the formation of}} a three-dimensional network...|$|E
