40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} and empirical studies on Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> describing relationships between sizes and distances of an afterimage. The paper is divided into six main parts. The first part introduces {{the origin of the}} problem of Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> The second part describes three interpretations of Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> discussed previously: (1) the law as geometrical optics, (2) the law stating relationships of perceived size and physical distance, and (3) the law stating relationships of perceived size and perceived distance. The present paper adopts the third interpretation. The third part describes that Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> is equivalent to the size-distance invariance hypothesis when the third interpretation is valid. The forth part reviews various empirical studies of Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> The fifth part describes experiments to estimate the perceived distance by using Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> Finally, the sixth part reviews the results of studies examining the range of viewing distance to which Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> can be applied...|$|R

40|$|Hack 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> is reviewed, {{emphasizing}} {{its implications}} for the elongation of river basins {{as well as its}} connections with their fractal characteristics. The relation between Hack 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> and the internal structure of river basins is investigated experimentally through digital elevation models. It is found that Hack 2 ̆ 7 s exponent, elongation, and some relevant fractal characters are closely related. The self-affine character of basin boundaries is shown to be connected to the power law decay of the probability of total contributing areas at any link and to Hack 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> An explanation for Hack 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> is derived from scaling arguments.

40|$|This article {{takes an}} {{empirical}} {{approach to the}} issue of how the U. S. legal services market is responding to globalization. It begins by considering {{the ways in which the}} domestic legal services market has internationalized by focusing on changes in legal education and examines the disconnection between U. S. legal education and practice opportunities in the U. S. The article proceeds to consider the ways in which U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms have become global organizations by offshoring their international identities, through the staffing of their non-U. S. offices with non-U. S. lawyers. Based on a database of more than 5, 000 lawyers working in the offshore offices of 60 U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>law</b> firms, this article reveals this globalization strategy. Internationalization has been accomplished at local levels by most U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms. One consequence of this method of internationalization through offshoring is that the need for dual trained lawyers is minimal. While U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> schools attract increasing numbers of foreign lawyer students, U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms remain disinterested in hiring and training them. U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms have succeeded in going global by going local. As a result, the traditional power dynamics of most U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms, favoring domestic lawyers to the exclusion of those with foreign expertise and experience, has been preserved...|$|R
