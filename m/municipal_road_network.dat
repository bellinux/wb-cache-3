40|$|The potentially-adverse {{impact of}} {{salinity}} on paved roads is well-established {{in the engineering}} literature. The problem seems destined to grow, as climate-related changes in sea level and riverine flows drive future increases in groundwater salinity. However, data scarcity has prevented systematic analysis for poor countries. This paper assesses the impact of groundwater salinity on road maintenance expenditures in the coastal region of Bangladesh. The assessment draws on new panel measures of salinity from 41 stations in coastal Bangladesh, and road maintenance expenditures, income, <b>road</b> <b>network</b> length, and <b>road</b> surfaces from 20 coastal municipalities. In a model relating maintenance expenditure for paved roads to groundwater salinity, <b>municipal</b> income, and <b>road</b> <b>network</b> length, large and significant effects are found for salinity. The regression model is used to predict the effect of within-sample salinity variation on road maintenance expenditure share, holding <b>municipal</b> income and <b>road</b> length constant at sample mean values. Increasing salinity from its sample minimum to its sample maximum increases the predicted road maintenance expenditure share by 252 percent. The implied welfare impact may also be substantial, particularly for poor households, if diversion of expenditures to road maintenance reduces support for community sanitation, health, and other infrastructure related programs...|$|R

Since October 2012, electric cars are exempted from the driving restriction implemented by plate number to restrict access to downtown San José, the country's capital.In October 2015 a new bill was introduced into the Legislative Assembly, called, [...] "Incentives and Promotion of the Electric Transport", which would eliminate all taxation on all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles including import duties, consumption tax, and sales tax, which would result in a 44% reduction of the current retail price. The bill also proposes free parking at parking meters for electric vehicles, free designated parking at private and public facilities, and a five-year exemption from the annual road tax. The bill set a cap of 100,000 units to benefit from the law and the benefits would be in place for five-years, whichever comes first. Vehicles eligible for the tax exemptions includes passenger cars, passenger vans, motorcycles, buses and trains.The bill also promotes the development of charging infrastructure with goal to provide charging points every 80 km on national highways and every 120 km on the <b>municipal</b> <b>road</b> <b>network.</b> The proposed law also mandates all government agencies to replace 10% of their auto fleets with plug-in electric vehicles; and public transportation and taxi services are mandated to slowly replace their fleets with electric vehicles, with a minimum of 10% of plug-in electric cars for new taxi cab medallions ("ecotaxis"). In addition, the law would provide income tax incentives for corporations that replace with plug-ins at least 10% of their fleets, with a minimum of three company cars.|$|E

He lived there only for a short time, because after the successful teacher's certificate examination, he applied and won {{the position of the}} professor of economics of the Austrian federal government in the economics school of the Styrian town of Leoben, whereby the government intended to support the town school ("live subvention"). He was elected first representative of the faculty, then appointed school director in 1976. He filled this position until 1991. At the late 1980s, the Communist regime was heading to its fall. Hungary needed support especially in social and economic sciences. He tried to help by setting up the reception of academic tours for the interested Hungarian delegations in Austria. On the Hungarian side, the academic tours were organized by the Komunitas Enterprise and its director, Zoltán Pálfalvy. The academic tours benefited from support through the collaboration of staff from Leoben. They readily provided insight into the <b>municipal</b> <b>road</b> <b>network</b> maintenance, energy and water supply and funeral services, among others. He tried to extend the relationships also to the Hungarian institutions of higher education. This contact was established in 1991, thanks to input from István Bakos, head of department in the Ministry of Culture and Public Education. Afterwards, he was elected guest professor by the teaching staff of the Faculty of Commerce, Catering and Tourism of Budapest. This appointment was followed by invitations from other higher education institutions. Led by Miklós Horn, and later László Csizmadia, general directors of the Faculty of Commerce, Catering and Tourism, leading professors of the teaching staff visited Leoben and the competent minister in Vienna in Austria several times on academic and contact-making tours. In 1992, the Convention of Rectors from Hungarian Economic Teaching Universities and Colleges held a delegate meeting in Leoben, where the participants were hosted by the town of Leoben, the Montana University and him personally. At the joint session of the leading professors from the Montana University and the Hungarian Rectors Convention, Rudolf Andorka, Rector of the Budapest University of Economic Sciences, held a lecture on the impact of Hungarian changes on higher education.|$|E

As the port has {{expanded}} over time, freight and logistics developments have located {{in close proximity}} to the port, leading to the infiltration of trucking into all areas around the city, and this has affected businesses, residents, public transport and general traffic. The permeation of trucking throughout the municipal area impacts negatively on air quality, road safety, road maintenance and general business efficiency in the city. This paper commences with a status quo assessment which included a comprehensive literature review on port cities and innovative transport and logistics solutions. Interviews were held with key stakeholders. The analysis covered freight commodity flows, hazardous and abnormal goods movement, freight movements (including empty containers), container depots, impacts of truck overloading on the <b>municipal</b> <b>road</b> <b>network,</b> and assessment of freight accident records. The status quo analysis was followed by a 20 -year phased strategic framework which developed a vision for freight and logistics in the municipal area that identifies, describes and explains each intervention and the anticipated time frame over which interventions need to be implemented. Interventions were categorised into short-, medium- and long-term freight and logistics solutions for the eThekwini Municipal Area (EMA). Short-term interventions were taken through a more detailed planning process, the implementation of which will commence in the next five years.

40|$|This study {{concludes that}} the <b>municipal</b> <b>road</b> <b>network</b> in Nedre Eiker has a large {{maintenance}} backlog. There are many critical damages on the roads that should be repaired immediately. This study looked at the prevalence of damages in relation to ground conditions. Municipal roads in Nedre Eiker were used as a case in this work, and the study {{concludes that the}}re are four prominent types of injuries that occur in 4 different soil conditions. The 4 damage types are cracks, crazing, desiccation and patching. The 4 different zones with soil conditions are zone 41 (Ocean and fjord deposition, continuous cover, often with large thickness), 50 (River and stream deposition), 72 (Weathering Material, incoherent or thin cover over the bedrock) and 120 (Filling material (anthropogenic material)) from the maps from Norges Geologiske Undersøkelse. Through literature search, data collection and analysis, and evaluating results against the literature, this study shows that the proven damage {{is related to the}} ground where the road is built. Using the available literature, the study proposes what measures will be most sustainable, efficient and economical for the roads. The measures are as follows: Soil zone 41 : The zone contains frost hazardous materials, and the best action would be to build up the road again with a new substructure. The costs can be kept down if some work can be performed in combination with water and sewer upgrade. An effective drainage can extend the life of the asphalt surface, but will not eliminate problems with frost. Soil zone 50 : The zone contains a lot of sand and gravel, which suggests that a good drainage will be able to extend the road life. In addition, it will be effective to lower the groundwater level whenever possible. Soil zone 72 : The zone contains a thin incoherent layer weathering material. An efficient drainage system could extend its lifetime. Construction of a new thick substructure will probably have a poor benefit / cost. Alternatively, it could pay off with a thin supporting layer under the asphalt surface if the road will be dug up for other reasons. Soil zone 120 : This is a zone which may contain many different soil qualities. This area must be carried out geological surveys to determine the best actions. But drainage is an action that always will provide an improvement, so this will give (small) gains if there is no economy to greater improvements and sampling. This report concludes finally that there are effective solutions to road maintenance even though the road is built on a poor foundation. An extended study can find good solutions for several types of soils and ground conditions than is presented in this report. The Norwegian road network represents great values that require continuous monitoring and maintenance to maintain the desired quality. Since municipalities as road owner often have limited resources, it is important to prioritize measures where these provide the greatest economic benefit. Many of the municipal roads in Norway is in poor condition, probably both because of the bad economy and lack of expertise at the time these roads were established. The results presented in this thesis is arrived at through an extensive registration of damage to municipal roads in Nedre Eiker, study of maps from Norges Geologiske Undersøkelse, Statens Kartverk, Statens Vegvesen and from PMS RoSy.

40|$|Several {{scholars}} have defined {{the urgent need}} for more research to identify the precise relationship between speed and crash involvement more fully. In this paper, we present the first results of an exploratory study carried out in the Brabant Southeast police region in the Netherlands. Hourly speed measurement data over a period of two years were collected from loop detectors on the <b>municipal</b> and provincial <b>road</b> <b>network</b> and were related to crashes. Different aspects of traffic intensity, speed and their impact on crashes were studied, including absolute speed, speed variation and the proportion of excessive speeders, both for vehicles under and over 5. 2 meters long. The study also discusses a number of methodological aspects associated with this kind of analysis. The results show that although absolute speed plays a more important role on roads where speed limits are low, it is the variation in speed that correlates more with crashes when speed limits are higher. Given the limited study area, the results of this work cannot be generalized without risk.
