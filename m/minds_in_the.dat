5|$|His {{success in}} Gruban v Booth allowed Hastings to switch his {{practice}} {{from the county}} courts to the High Court, and {{at the beginning of}} Hilary term 1919 he applied to become a King's Counsel (KC). Becoming a KC was a risk; he would go from competing with other junior barristers to coming up against the finest <b>minds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> profession. Despite this he decided to take the risk, and he was accepted later that year.|$|E

Additionally, Edaniel and Edrear's other sister, Elala, is found dead. After Edaniel and Edrear lock down the mausoleum, they send Dinah home and she discovers that Maphohetka, a girl hanged for witchcraft and who now as a ghost can control <b>minds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real world, is manipulating Eniri and the townspeople. Unsuccessful in her attempt to stop her, Dinah flees to the mausoleum and receives a special outfit melted from the gold tolls that she and Vincent paid {{to gain access to}} the mausoleum. Returning, she confronts Maphohetka, who then orders Edaniel to kill her.|$|E
5|$|In October 2004, Tony Blair {{announced}} he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term. Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election, which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year. Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; {{he was the only}} candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become Prime Minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and <b>minds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war on terror as key priorities.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} the opposing groups, historians have assessed {{evidence of their}} hearts and <b>minds.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-20th century, historian Leonard Woods Labaree identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; opposite traits to those characteristic of the Patriots. Older and better established men, Loyalists tended to resist innovation.

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1920 Hopkinson {{was already}} making a {{reputation}} for being one of the best speakers and most independent <b>minds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House, although he was still officially sitting as a Coalition Liberal. He became increasingly involved in industrial topics in which he was critical of the trades unions (regarding them as having devoured the liberty of the workers) and of socialism to the level of distrusting the motives of those advocating socialist policies. He was a strong supporter of free trade. Hopkinson was much in demand as a speaker because of his unorthodox views and the frank and clear way in which he expressed them.|$|E
25|$|With the {{eventual}} outcome {{in terms of}} both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability to predict what was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company Survation claiming that 13% of voters made up their <b>minds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final days and 17% {{on the day of the}} election. The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they said they did not release the poll (commissioned by the Daily Mirror) on the concern that it was too much of an outlier with other poll results.|$|E

500|$|During {{the five}} years {{that led up to}} the purchase, the {{restaurant}} chain had a series of a half dozen ad programs accompanied by even more marketing directors, a situation that led Adweek to describe it as [...] "ill-conceived marketing and downright sloppy strategic planning" [...] in 1987. In order to reverse the trend, in December 1988 Grand Met set about reevaluating all aspects of the programs from the messages the company was sending to the customer through its commercials to the possibility of dropping its advertising agency of record, N. W. Ayer. After a six-month evaluation, BK dropped Ayer in favor of a two-way combination of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles (DMB) for overall programs and Saatchi & Saatchi for specific advertising programs such as the introduction of new products. The company hoped that the [...] "dual-agency partnership" [...] would provide a synergy that would bring together [...] "some of the best <b>minds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> advertising business" [...] to establish a brand identity, or as a company spokesman stated, [...] "what the consumers take away with them after they visit us--what we stand for..." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his later}} life Graham {{and his wife}} settled on the Gold Coast in Queensland and were {{involved}} in community activities and fundraising. He enjoyed swimming and fishing and was involved in work to help the blind. He died at his home on the Isle of Capri on 20 July 1996 and was survived by his widow and two sons. Despite the debate surrounding the laying of the barrier minefield, McNeill and Ekins later described Graham as a [...] "clever and imaginative" [...] commander, who was [...] "widely regarded as {{having one of the}} best <b>minds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army", and whose [...] "broad knowledge and fair approach earned him the respect of his subordinates." [...] Yet even in death Graham remained a controversial figure. In his book, The Minefield, published in 2007, author and former Army officer Greg Lockhart argued that the decision to establish the minefield had been [...] "reckless"; the product of a failure to understand the prevailing nature of the insurgency in Phuoc Tuy Province, it had ended in [...] "strategic disaster". Lockhart argued that the decision ultimately cost Graham the position of CGS, even though he had been seen by some as being the likely candidate to replace Daly. He went on to describe Graham as ambitious and career-driven, [...] "...a talented man who rose to a position of some importance and was undone by inescapable personal flaws." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their <b>minds.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
