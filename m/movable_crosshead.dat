40|$|Five samples {{tested in}} one cooldown. Holder mounted in testing machine. Submerged in {{cryogenic}} liquid held in cryostat. <b>Movable</b> <b>crosshead</b> of testing machine moves gradually downward. Samples placed under tension, one after another, starting with top one; each sample fails in turn before next is stressed...|$|E
30|$|Tensile {{tests were}} {{conducted}} at 20  °C and 65  % RH using a universal testing machine (RTC- 1150, Orientec Co., Ltd., Tokyo) according to JIS K 7113. Test specimens were dried under vacuum at 60  °C for at least for 24  h and then were loaded at a <b>movable</b> <b>crosshead</b> speed of 5  mm/min. Initial distance between clamps was 30  mm. Three replicates were tested for each condition. Tensile strength was calculated from the ultimate force on the dimensions of its cross-section (minimum breadth and thickness).|$|E
30|$|Three-point bending {{tests were}} {{conducted}} at room temperature using a universal testing machine (RTC- 1325, Orientec Co., Ltd., Tokyo) according to JIS K 7171. Test specimens were dried under vacuum at 60  °C for at least for 24  h before the test, and then were loaded at a <b>movable</b> <b>crosshead</b> speed of 2  mm/min. The distance between supports was 64  mm. Three replicates were tested for each condition. Bending strength {{was obtained from the}} ultimate force on the dimensions of its cross-section and the distance of supports. Bending modulus was calculated from the linear region of the load–deflection curve.|$|E
5000|$|Cross head - A <b>movable</b> {{cross head}} (<b>crosshead)</b> is {{controlled}} {{to move up}} or down. Usually this is at a constant speed: sometimes called a constant rate of extension (CRE) machine. Some machines can program the crosshead speed or conduct cyclical testing, testing at constant force, testing at constant deformation, etc. Electromechanical, servo-hydraulic, linear drive, and resonance drive are used.|$|R
