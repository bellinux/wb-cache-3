500|$|When two Canadian astronomers {{argued that}} they {{potentially}} discovered 234 extraterrestrial civilizations through analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database, Douglas Vakoch doubted their explanation for their findings, noting {{that it would be}} unusual for all of these stars to pulse at exactly the same frequency unless they were part a coordinated network: “If you take a step back,” he said, “that would <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> 234 independent stars that all decided to transmit the exact same way.” ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{credited}} {{the series}} for its bold premise {{and noted that}} the show provided some insight into eating disorders while offering [...] "a few flashes of clever dialogue and satire." [...] Ultimately, however, the Times found that [...] "Starved relies too heavily on sight gags and gross-out farce." [...] The Los Angeles Times found the show [...] "vexing" [...] for being [...] "at once assured and shallow, accomplished and unconvincing, well-acted and empty." [...] The review singles out Schaeffer's character Sam as [...] "especially unappealing" [...] and points to Schaeffer's roles as creator, producer, writer and director as [...] "an object lesson in the wisdom {{of a system of}} checks and balances." [...] Perhaps most damningly, in noting Schaeffer's experiences with addiction, the reviewer writes that [...] "just because you’ve had an experience doesn’t <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> anything interesting to say about it or are able to articulate whatever interesting thing you have to say." ...|$|E

500|$|NME {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} six out of ten: [...] "It tails off towards the end, and TBS never quite shake the feeling that other people are doing {{this sort of thing}} far more thrillingly elsewhere." [...] Now {{reviewer}} Evan Davies wrote that although the group's fans and label had expectations, it [...] "doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to put out the exact same fucking album twice in a row." [...] According to Davies, Taking Back Sunday writes two kinds of songs: [...] "energetic pop rock with whiny vocals, and midtempo power rock, again with whiny vocals." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone wrote that the group [...] "amped up their sound," [...] with Valentine [...] "delivering a turbocharged attack spiked with dark, catchy melodies and giant choruses." [...] Hoard called most of the album's songs [...] "skull-rattling slasher with enough pop smarts to keep the heartbroken agony from becoming too much to handle." [...] For Stylus Magazine, Ian Cohen wrote that the album [...] "tables the discussion" [...] of whether Taking Back Sunday [...] "embrace their arena destiny or disappear into the basement for cred that never really existed." [...] Cohen concluded, [...] "As was the case with pop-metal, 'albums' weren't the objective, so much as a few ace singles and album tracks that hold serve, which is Louder Now in a nutshell." ...|$|E

However, while reformists in Hungary and Poland were emboldened {{by the force of}} liberalization spreading from the east, other Eastern bloc countries remained openly skeptical and demonstrated aversion to reform. Believing Gorbachev's reform initiatives would be short-lived, hardline communist rulers like East Germany's Erich Honecker, Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov, Czechoslovakia's Gustáv Husák and Romania's Nicolae Ceauşescu obstinately ignored the calls for change.

On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, [...] "I loved it. I didn't have a trace of stage fright. I'm scared to death all the way through my own shows. But it was too much fun to get scared.

2500|$|Beaver's {{attitude}} toward girls is a thread that runs throughout the series, providing comic {{contrast to his}} brother's successful dating life and his parents' happy marriage. Beaver tells off his female classmates, telling Violet Rutherford she drinks gutter water, calling Linda Dennison a [...] "smelly old ape" [...] and threatening to punch Judy Hensler if she [...] "gets mushy" [...] on him. Though loathing girls his own age, Beaver develops crushes on schoolteachers Miss Canfield and Miss Landers, and in one episode says he's going to marry a [...] "mother" [...] when the time comes. Beaver disparages marriage saying, [...] "just because you're married doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to like girls."

2500|$|Tenpenny {{is quoted}} as saying, [...] "The anti-free-speech terrorists have voiced bomb threats and have {{threatened}} violence against venue owners and their families." [...] It was later revealed that one bomb threat actually came from an [...] "anti-vaccination advocate who was disturbed {{by the thought that}} Tenpenny’s event might not go ahead." [...] The pro-vaccination group Stop the AVN spokesman, John Cunningham, stated that he calls this a win for Australians: [...] "Australia should be proud that as a nation, {{we have the ability to}} recognise when someone is trying to mislead us, and react accordingly. Free speech in Australia does not <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the right to say anything you like without fear of criticism.

2500|$|In Silvestri's {{first meeting}} with Johnston, the latter raised his desire for a central theme. On this, Silvestri said, [...] "To {{have some kind of}} musical {{signature}} either for a character or some aspect of the film, truly holds the score together. A theme makes the music feel like one piece in a sense." [...] For this central theme, a fanfare for Captain America, Silvestri did not look to any past film scores in particular, instead looking to [...] "certain kinds of elements that we have, over time, associated with that kind of heroic statement", such as the percussive elements, intervals, and brass instrumentation of Aaron Copland's [...] "Fanfare for the Common Man". He noted that Captain America is a [...] "very bold and bombastic idea, so you don’t need to inflate that in any way. But that doesn’t <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to play those elements down either", adding that he felt Captain America was fleshed out more as a character simply by facing [...] "a really bad guy" [...] in the Red Skull in a similar way to Luke Skywalker's development in the presence of Darth Vader. On the Red Skull himself, Silvestri looked to take the character seriously and [...] "play him as bad", but allowed for more compassion for the character when he talks about his tortured past. He also introduced a theme for the Tesseract, Red Skull's energy source.|$|E
