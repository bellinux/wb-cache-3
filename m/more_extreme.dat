5|$|ATP {{is stable}} in aqueous {{solutions}} between pH6.8 and 7.4, {{but it is}} rapidly hydrolysed at <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> pH's. ATP hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate. Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium, with ATP concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of ADP.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{is used in}} vacuum tubes, {{high-voltage}} indicators, lightning arresters, {{wave meter}} tubes, television tubes, and helium–neon lasers.

50|$|The <b>more</b> <b>extremest</b> blaverist groups {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} provided by the tense political climate: the flags of the Valencia Town Hall were burnt by demonstrators on 9 October 1979, far from the only act of political violence that year.|$|R
50|$|Draper's {{climate is}} roughly {{identical}} {{to that of other}} Salt Lake City suburbs. However, due to being further away from the Great Salt Lake, varied elevation, and from the downtown urban heat island effect, Draper experiences a slightly drier winter, and <b>more</b> <b>extremes</b> in temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Horsham is {{classified}} as a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk) similar to Mildura although with less rain and drier {{for more of the}} year. As such, although its elevation makes it on average a degree cooler than Mildura, it can receive relatively <b>more</b> <b>extremes</b> of temperature.|$|R
5|$|Recorded {{temperatures}} during heat bursts {{have reached}} well above , sometimes rising by 20°F (11°C) or more within {{only a few}} minutes. <b>More</b> <b>extreme</b> events have also been documented, where temperatures {{have been reported to}} exceed , although such extreme events have never been officially verified. Heat bursts are also characterised by extremely dry air and are sometimes associated with very strong, even damaging, winds.|$|E
5|$|Since early 2016, seven <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> trans-Neptunian objects {{have been}} {{discovered}} with orbits that have a perihelion greater than 30AU and a semi-major axis greater than250 AU. These are {{also included in the}} orbital diagrams and tables below.|$|E
5|$|Tali was {{initially}} the only quarian in the series. In the sequels, <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> variations of her design were discarded {{in favor of}} revisions on her previous look. The Mass Effect 3 development team considered her removal from the squad, but ultimately chose to include her due to staff interest. The team also debated whether to reveal her masked face.|$|E
50|$|Covington {{features}} a climate {{nearly identical to}} Seattle's, but with <b>more</b> <b>extremes</b> throughout {{the day and the}} year. Summer days average a couple degrees hotter than Seattle because of its location away from the Puget Sound. Also, winter nights will be a couple degrees cooler than Seattle's. Everything else is nearly identical (sunshine, precipitation, snowfall, etc.).|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the variety}} of {{dependencies}} of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) in the atmosphere, its general peculiarity is its gradual decrease as the wavelength increases (Angstrom formula) : τ Α (λ) = β⋅λ −α. Anomalous situations are rare when the dependence τ Α (λ) in the range 0. 35 µm to 1 µm has a quasineutral shape with one or <b>more</b> <b>extremes</b> (Rodionov 1970; Barteneva and Nikitinskaya 1991; Kraukli...|$|R
5|$|There is a {{scientific}} consensus linking human activities {{to global warming}} due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a global rise in average sea levels.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if the aim was simply to harvest the crops, <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E
5|$|Henson's {{beliefs on}} {{doctrine}} were still forming, but he inclined to high-churchmanship and {{was influenced by}} Charles Gore and the Puseyites, though he was unattracted by <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> Anglo-Catholic forms of ritualism. With his suspicion of nonconformism he was a proponent {{of the principle of}} establishment– the maintenance of Anglicanism as the official state religion– and in 1886 he became secretary of the new Oxford Laymen's League for Defence of the National Church, to counter the threat of disestablishment proposed by politicians such as Joseph Chamberlain and Charles Dilke.|$|E
50|$|Lao cuisine {{is similar}} to Thai, but with several notable differences. The Lao meal as a whole {{generally}} appeals to <b>more</b> <b>extremes</b> of sourness, bitterness, and spice than in Thai cuisine. Lao cooking uses copious amounts of mak phaet (chilies), pa daek or fermented fresh water fish sauce, kaffir lime leaves, and galangal in greater amounts to add bolder flavors to most dishes. Glutinous rice is eaten almost exclusively in ethnically Lao areas.|$|R
50|$|Extreme Rock Climbing {{is part of}} the Extreme Sports {{series by}} Creative Carnage and Head Games. It was {{released}} on Microsoft Windows on November 1, 1999. The game received poor reviews, but is considered decent due to all the other Extreme Sports games being much <b>more</b> abysmal. <b>Extreme</b> Paintbrawl {{is an example of the}} much <b>more</b> worse <b>Extreme</b> games. The game sold poorly and is now rare and hard to find online. The objective of the game is to climb various different rock walls.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the rising musical styles, {{especially}} grunge, {{began to take}} their places as the dominant styles in the mainstream, which resulted in heavy metal music losing popularity and going underground for a decade. Many Christian metal musicians began to play extreme metal, and soon death metal replaced thrash metal in popularity. Audiences in many underground metal scenes began favoring <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> sounds and disparaging the popular styles. As with other glam metal acts of the time, Stryper lost popularity and split up in 1993.|$|E
5|$|It {{also led}} to the birth and {{diffusion}} of small independent record labels, often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios, which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases. Indie labels are considered important to the movement's evolution, because they removed the intrusion of corporate business which had hindered rock music in the late 1970s, giving local bands the chance to experiment with <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> forms of music.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{joined the}} Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace. By 1971, Shoup {{publicly}} endorsed the anti-war veteran group Vietnam Veterans Against the War. As Vietnamization had reduced {{the visibility of}} the anti-war movement, and Shoup's criticism was not as prominent in the public arena. Fulbright and other senators urged the White House {{to listen to his}} criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique of American society and militarism was seen as <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Lawrence Summers, then Harvard president, speculated {{over the}} {{preponderance}} of men over women in high-end science and engineering positions. He surmised that a statistical difference in the variance of innate abilities among male and female populations (male variance tends to be higher, resulting in <b>more</b> <b>extremes)</b> could play a role. His words immediately sparked a heated debate. Spelke was among the strongest critics of Lawrence Summers and in April 2005 faced Steven Pinker in an open debate over the issue. She declared that her own experiments revealed {{no difference between the}} mental capacities of male and female children ranging in age from 5 months to 7 years old.|$|R
5|$|The Stanley {{plan had}} the support of the <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> segregationists in Virginia as well. The first week of July, the Defenders {{promoted}} a plan that would withdraw the legal basis for lawsuits against school districts, permit state takeovers of school districts which integrated, and deny state funds to school districts which integrated. The Defenders opposed any pupil assignment plan as too moderate a response. Accommodating this extremist sentiment, the pupil assignment plan approved at the July 2 meeting was fairly weak. After the meeting, Gray independently asked Mays to draft a stronger pupil assignment proposal.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°, {{which is}} similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, Neptune {{experiences}} similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years. Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11hours. Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any <b>more</b> <b>extreme.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} objects (cubewanos) {{are very}} different from the scattered objects: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low-inclination, near-circular orbits whose eccentricities peak at 0.25. Classical objects possess eccentricities ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Though the inclinations of scattered objects are similar to the <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> KBOs, very few scattered objects have orbits as close to the ecliptic as much of the KBO population.|$|E

5000|$|According to Attila, {{the band}} {{wanted to make}} an album that [...] "sounded like Mayhem." [...] He said that [...] "After the Ordo album, which {{was a little bit}} progressive—maybe a little bit too much—almost like a fusion album where riffs were not {{repeated}} and the rhythm was always out or different or kind of twisted, we wanted to go back from there instead of going forward in that direction. Every Mayhem album has a kind of unique aspect, but we {{wanted to go back to}} a little bit <b>more</b> traditional <b>extreme</b> metal. Of course, there’s all these elements that Mayhem has built up for itself as a band, but we still wanted to go back to something that was straightforward musically and a little more brutal and <b>more</b> like <b>extreme</b> metal." ...|$|R
5|$|The first {{police to}} deploy to the Yukon {{equipped}} themselves with specialised cold-weather clothing, and subsequent detachments were equipped with deer-skin parkas, fur hats and boots. In the <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> {{conditions of the}} far north, the police adopted local Inuit clothing for use on their patrols, even though this required daily maintenance, often carried out by local Inuit women. Mounted police deployed to Siberia wore the standard army khaki uniform used by mounted forces.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} is endemic to the {{south-eastern}} forested areas of Australia, principally {{east of the}} Great Dividing Range. Its range extends approximately from Bundaberg in Queensland to Geelong in Victoria, with outlying colonies in Ingham and Finch Hatton in the north, and in Adelaide in the south. In the southern parts of its range it occupies <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> latitudes than any other Pteropus species.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Vlaams Blok seized {{the occasion of the}} ban to dissolve the party, and start afresh under a new name. Five days later, on 14 November, the Vlaams Blok disbanded itself, and a new party with the name Vlaams Belang was established. (Other proposed names included the Flemish People's Party and Flemish Freedom Front.) The new party instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating some of the <b>more</b> <b>extreme</b> positions of the former Vlaams Blok. Nevertheless, the party leadership {{made it clear that the}} party would fundamentally remain the same.|$|E
50|$|A related {{potential}} moderator is the outgroup {{membership of}} the message source. Reid found that <b>more</b> politically <b>extreme</b> Democratic students perceived less bias when a polemical assault on their group was attributed to a Democratic (ingroup) organization, but detected more bias when the attack was ascribed to a pro-Republican outgroup.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly enough, French {{musicians and}} composers never embraced the <b>more</b> florid <b>extremes</b> of the 18th-century Italian bel canto style. They disliked the castrato voice {{and because they}} placed a premium on the clear enunciation of the texts of their vocal music, they objected to the sung word being {{obscured}} by excessive fioritura.|$|R
50|$|Scott was {{replaced}} on drums by Ian McCutcheon. By {{the recording of}} their final album, Pygmalion, Halstead had moved Slowdive away from the dreamy guitar sound and warm yet solemn tone of earlier releases to a newer, <b>more</b> minimalist <b>extreme,</b> similar to heavily ambient bands such as Seefeel, A.R.
