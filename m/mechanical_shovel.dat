50|$|A team of officers, led by Detective Chief Superintendent Jack Mannings and Detective Superintendent Fred Chadburn, {{carried out}} a meticulous {{examination}} of the scene. Rees was naked except for a single stocking on her right leg, rolled down to the ankle. The body had been decapitated by the <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The body of Gwynneth Rees {{was found}} on 8 November 1963 at the Barnes Borough Council {{household}} refuse disposal site on Townmead Road, Mortlake. The dump was situated 40 yd from the Thames towpath, and approximately 1 mi from Duke's Meadows. Council workmen who were leveling the dump with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovel</b> excavated the body and called the Richmond police station when they saw Rees's legs hanging from the shovel.|$|E
50|$|Hanratty {{was sent}} to recuperate at an aunt's home in Bedford, a place {{he and his brother}} Michael had visited as {{children}} on holiday. Hanratty found a job there driving a <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovel</b> for the company of Green Brothers, which made breeze blocks, and remained with the firm for three years. It was about 1954 that Hanratty became attracted to Soho, where he frequented various clubs and other haunts of the criminal underworld. Significantly, he befriended Charles 'Dixie' France.|$|E

50|$|This was {{the period}} of noise and dust. C Block was {{constructed}} amid the din of pneumatic drills, <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovels,</b> and compressors, and in neighbouring B Block many staff ended up losing their voices! By 1962 most of the building work was complete, including St. George’s Church - latterly St. Barnabas’.|$|R
5000|$|Excavators {{are also}} called diggers, JCBs (a {{proprietary}} name, in {{an example of}} a generic trademark), <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovels,</b> or 360-degree excavators (sometimes abbreviated simply to 360). Tracked excavators are sometimes called [...] "trackhoes" [...] by analogy to the backhoe. In the UK, wheeled excavators are sometimes known as [...] "rubber ducks." ...|$|R

40|$|ID 106442 is an iron {{smelting}} {{site from}} the early iron age situated near the summer farm Hansvollen (farm id number 45 / 1) in Meråker municipality in Nord-Trøndelag county. The site contains several smelting pits and slag heaps, the latter damaged by erosion caused by a nearby stream. The report describes erosion prevention measures and archaeological surveys done at this site in autumn of 2015. This {{was one of the}} first surveys in Norway using electromagnetic induction to map an iron smelting site. Stabilising of soil masses was done by using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovel</b> and erosion control mats. In addition to this one test pit was excavated...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{construction}} of beach groins which keep water from eroding from the coast, 1953. One man in dark work clothes and thick gloves {{sits at the}} driver's seat on the left of a tank-like machine which reaches an appendage into the crater of sand at center. Three men work {{at the end of}} the appendage where three slaps of concrete are leaned against each other forming the beginnings of a beach groin. A fourth man can be seen on the right kneeling above the crater with trees standing in the background. Photoprint reads "With the aid of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovel,</b> engineers set huge blocks of concrete in a southern California beach. Thousands of such blocks make up the groins which build up the nation's beaches"...|$|E

5000|$|When mining {{commenced}} in 1931, {{the mine}} was mechanized {{to an extent}} not previously seen in Australia, with mechanized drilling and <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovels</b> rather than [...] "hammer and tap" [...] hand drilling and hand shovels. The initial mine production was 660,000 tonnes per year ("t/y") of ore and stayed at about this level until 1953.|$|R
2500|$|Navvy, {{a shorter}} form of {{navigator}} (UK) or navigational engineer (US), is particularly applied {{to describe the}} manual labourers working on major civil engineering projects and occasionally (in North America) to refer to <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovels</b> and earth moving machinery. The term was coined in the late 18th century in Great Britain when numerous canals were being built, which were also sometimes known as [...] "navigations", or [...] "eternal navigations", intended to last forever.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the model}} {{introduced}} {{in a previous}} work has been adopted as the basis. Several modifications have been applied to this, {{in order to produce}} a new model with enhanced applicabillity. It is then argued that, in practice, the daily output expected from a <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovel</b> is subject to variations caused by technical, operational and environmental factors. A model that uses fuzzy numbers for this impor-tant parameter would therefore optimize the process more realistically than those that are based on random numbers derived from probability distributions. Fuzzy logics have therefore been introduced into the model. The model was finally tested in Sarcheshmeh copper mine of Iran. It is concluded that, with an improved truck allocation system, prescribed by the model, the total output of the mine will increase by 15 %. The ore received by the processing plant would also have grade values that have lower deviations from the ideal grade value...|$|E

50|$|In total nearly 300 Sécurité civile {{personnel}} {{will eventually}} be in Haiti with several dozen tons of equipment. Two ships, the Siroco and the BATRAL Francis Garnier, were dispatched as part of Opération Séisme Haiti 2010. The Siroco, who was off the Senegalese coast, and has been ordered to head for Haiti. She is equipped with medical facilities (two operating theatres and 50 inpatient beds) and can carry 2,000 tonnes of cargo and 2,000 passengers, as well as four helicopters. A French Air Force Airbus A340 was dispatched to Fort-de-France carrying medical personnel to staff the Siroco {{and members of the}} Gendarmerie. A team of six people, including a TDF (State Radio & Television Company) engineer, was dispatched with the communications hardware required to reestablish UN radio transmissions of Haiti Minustah FM, and also to repair the large transmitters located on the heights of the city. Radio France also lent assistance to several private radio stations. The BATRAL Francis Garnier, a light transport and supply ship, left Fort-de-France (Martinique) Friday with 100 tons of freight and 60 soldiers. The boat carried 6 trucks, an ambulance, 4x4 vehicles, three <b>mechanical</b> <b>shovels,</b> food, bottled water, machines of building site, tents, humanitarian material and food. The ship does not require a dock to unload. Two C-130 Hercules belonging to the 2/61 Transport Squadron ('Franche-Comté'), were dispatched to Martinique. The first C130 from France arrived Sunday with reinforcements, medical equipment and communications equipment for Haïti. The second airplane arrived Sunday 17 January. Together with three CASA CN-235 planes, an Airbus A310 (from the Esterel Squadron), an Aérospatiale Puma Helicopter and a Bombardier Dash 8 from the civil security they allow up to 8 flights daily from the French Antilles to Haiti. The French government will contribute €10 million (US$14.4 million) for Haitian relief and rescue work, Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner announced on 18 January. The contribution was a response to the appeal for emergency funding launched by the United Nations on Saturday.|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{production}} blasts in two {{open pit}} mines were monitored, in rocks with medium to very high strength. Three different blasting agents (ANFO, watergel and emulsion blend) were used, with powder factors ranging between 0. 88 and 1. 45 kg/m 3. Excavators were front loaders and rope <b>shovels.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> {{properties of the}} rock, blasting characteristics and mucking rates were carefully measured. A model for the calculation of the productivity of excavators is developed thereof, in which the production rate results {{as a product of}} an ideal, maximum, productivity rate times an operating efficiency. The maximum rate {{is a function of the}} dipper capacity and the efficiency is a function of rock density, strength, and explosive energy concentration in the rock. The model is statistically significant and explains up to 92 % of the variance of the production rate measurements...|$|R
