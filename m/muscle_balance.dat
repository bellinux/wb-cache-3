40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of balance training frequency on functional improvement in elderly people over 75 years of age. The subjects comprised 14 institutionalized elderly people aged 84. 9 ± 5. 8 years (mean±SD). The training program consisted of balance training, five times a week, for 1 year. <b>Muscle</b> strength, <b>balance,</b> agility, mobility and flexibility were assessed at the beginning and the end of the 1 -year intervention period. The ratio of attended to scheduled sessions was used as an index of training frequency. The training frequency showed significant correlations to the improvement rate of knee extension strength (r= 0. 59) and modified SLR test (r= 0. 63). Discriminant analysis revealed correct prediction frequency of 43. 3, 54. 8 % and 57. 2 %, for the maintenance of <b>muscle</b> strength, <b>balance</b> and flexibility, respectively. In conclusion, balance training frequency significantly affects the improvement of physical performance in frail elderly people.

40|$|Introduction: Some losses {{resulting}} from aging can be minimized with {{the practice of}} resistive exercises. Objective: To analyze the effects of resistive exercises on flexibility, mobility, <b>muscle</b> strength and <b>balance</b> in the elderly. Method: Twenty elderly individuals were divided between an activity group (AG, n= 10; 66. 1 ± 6. 35 years) and a control group (CG, n= 10; 65. 4 ± 7. 54 years). Mobility, flexibility, <b>muscle</b> strength and <b>balance</b> were evaluated. The AG participated in the training for 13 weeks (one-hour sessions, twice a week). The Wilcoxon non-parametric test (intra-group analysis) was {{used to analyze the}} data. A significance level of 5 % (p< 0. 05) was adopted. Results: After training, the AG presented better mobility, lower limb <b>muscle</b> strength, and <b>balance,</b> but no difference in flexibility.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} the near phoria measurement using the Bernell <b>muscle</b> <b>balance</b> card {{with and without}} prism neutralization, using both trial frame and phoropter correction, and compared with the conventional Maddox rod method. Methods: Forty young normal Chinese adults had their near phoria measured with trial frame correction using the conventional <b>muscle</b> <b>balance</b> card method (method 1). Any deviation was compensated with a prism bar as an alternative approach (method 2). The conventional Maddox rod method (method 3) was also carried out for comparison. These three methods were repeated with phoropter correction and considered as methods 4, 5 and 6. Results: The phorias obtained from these six methods {{were not significantly different}} from each other (repeated measures ANOVA, p > 0. 05). More than half of the subjects were exophoric. Although the difference in phoria was not significant, phoria measurement using phoropter correction yielded a greater coefficient of variation. Conclusions: Near phoria measurement using the <b>muscle</b> <b>balance</b> card conducted with trial frame correction was less variable, and was also more natural and similar to a real reading situation. The use of prism for compensation did not affect the phoria results. Exophoria seems to be more common than esophoria in young Chinese adults. School of Optometr...|$|E

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease common to this population, the seriousness of articular degeneration has been associated to the increase in some cytokines, IL- 6 among them. the aim {{of the present study was}} to correlate IL- 6 plasma levels with muscle strength, endurance, <b>muscle</b> <b>balance</b> hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) and physical function in 80 elderly women (71. 2 +/- 5. 3) with knee OA. IL- 6 was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, endurance and hamstring-quadriceps <b>muscle</b> <b>balance</b> were assessed using a Biodex system 3 pro (R) isokinetic dynamometer. Physical function was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationship between the outcomes at the significance level of alpha = 0. 05. IL- 6 was inversely correlated to the endurance of the hamstring muscles 180 degrees/s (r = - 0. 232; p = 0. 03) and <b>muscle</b> <b>balance</b> (H/Q) on the lower right side at 180 degrees/s (r = 0. 254; p = 0. 023). No significant correlation between IL- 6, muscle strength and physical function was found.

40|$|Background: Strengthening {{exercises}} for the scapular muscles {{are used in}} the treatment of scapulothoracic dysfunction related to shoulder injury. In view of the intermuscular and intramuscular imbalances often established in these patients, exercises promoting lower trapezius (LT), middle trapezius (MT), and serratus anterior (SA) activation with minimal activity in the upper trapezius (UT) are recommended. Hypothesis: Of 12 commonly used trapezius strengthening exercises, a selection can be performed for <b>muscle</b> <b>balance</b> rehabilitation, based on a low UT/LT, UT/MT, or UT/SA muscle ratio. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Electromyographic activity of the 3 trapezius parts and the SA was measured in 45 healthy subjects performing 12 commonly described scapular exercises, using surface electromyography. Results: For each intramuscular trapezius ratio (UT/LT, UT/MT), 3 exercises were selected for restoration of <b>muscle</b> <b>balance.</b> The exercises side-lying external rotation, side-lying forward flexion, prone horizontal abduction with external rotation, and prone extension were found to be the most appropriate for intramuscular trapezius <b>muscle</b> <b>balance</b> rehabilitation. For the UT/SA ratio, none of the exercises met the criteria for optimal intermuscular balance restoration. Conclusion: In cases of trapezius muscle imbalance, some exercises are preferable over others because of their low UT/LT and UT/MT ratios. Clinical Relevance: In the selection of rehabilitation exercises, the clinician should have a preference for exercises with high activation of the LT and MT and low activity of the UT...|$|E

Objectives: To evaluate the effects of the Bad Ragaz Ring method on functional recovery in chronic stroke patients. Methods: Twenty-two chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a Bad Ragaz Ring method group (the experimental group) or a control group. Stroke patients in the experimental group underwent Bad Ragaz Ring exercise and comprehensive rehabilitation therapy, whereas patients in the control group underwent comprehensive rehabilitation therapy alone. The participants in both groups received therapy 3 days per week for 6 weeks. <b>Muscle</b> activations, <b>balance</b> indices, and Timed Up and Go test results were assessed before and after the 6 -week therapy period. Results: The experimental group showed significant improvements in activations of tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius <b>muscles,</b> <b>balance</b> index, and Timed Up and Go test results as compared with preintervention results (p < 0. 05), whereas the control group showed significant improvement in Timed Up and Go test (p < 0. 05). Significant differences in posttraining gains in the activations of tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius <b>muscles</b> and in <b>balance</b> index were observed between the experimental and control groups (p < 0. 05).

Balance performance was measured using the sharpened Romberg and one-legged stance tests. Younger subjects performed significantly better than older subjects on all <b>muscle</b> and <b>balance</b> performance variables (P = 0. 05 to P = 0. 0001), except the sharpened Romberg test with the eyes open.
