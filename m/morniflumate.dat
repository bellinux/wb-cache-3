40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{for the management}} of pain in osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases is well documented. The role of NSAIDs is less clear in the treatment of conditions involving soft tissue inflammation, including the airways, ear– nose–throat (ENT) system and urogenital tract. These conditions are often treated inappropriately with antibiotics. <b>Morniflumate,</b> the ß-morpholinoethyl ester of niflumic acid, {{is a member of the}} fenamate family of NSAIDs indicated for the treatment of inflammatory conditions (with or without pain) affecting airways, the ENT system, urogenital tract and the osteoarticular system. <b>Morniflumate</b> has a 30 -year history of clinical use, particularly for the treatment of pain associated with paediatric ENT infection. This article reviews evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of <b>morniflumate.</b> Based on available evidence and the favourable tolerability profile emerging from extensive clinical use, <b>morniflumate</b> appears to be a valid and well-tolerated alternative to other NSAIDs, or to antibiotics, for the treatment of pain and other symptoms of soft tissue inflammation...|$|E
40|$|The pressure-temperature {{phase diagram}} of <b>morniflumate</b> (niflumic acid ß-morpholinoethyl ester) has been {{obtained}} by high-pressure thermal analysis. In addition, calorimetric melting data (TI¿L = (348. 1 ± 0. 4) K and ¿HI¿L = (89 ± 2) J·g- 1) {{and the specific}} volumes of the solid and the liquid state have been obtained under normal pressure. Comparison of the measured high-pressure melting data with the equilibrium curve obtained through the Clapeyron equation indicates that the initial slopes are the same (dP/dT = (2. 96 ± 0. 06) MPa·K- 1) at the melting point under normal pressure. The fact that the Clapeyron equation {{can be used to}} construct topological phase diagrams may be of interest for the food and pharmaceutical industries.
