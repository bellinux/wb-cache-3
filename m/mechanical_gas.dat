Realized based on a novel scalable and modular microfabrication technology, the micropump reported here utilizes an unwanted secondary pumping effect, valve pumping, as the main pumping principle, eliminating the need for any pumping membrane. This reduces down the entire pumping structure to a collection of active microvalves, and hence, significantly simplifies the configuration and operation of <b>mechanical</b> <b>gas</b> micropumps and minimizes their dead volume (often the Achilles heel for gas micropumps).

40|$|Poly-lactic acid (PLA) {{nanocomposite}} {{film was}} prepared with untreated and silane treated sepiolite through solution casting method. Sepiolite {{is found to}} be promising nano inorganic filler used to prepare biodegradable PLA nanocomposite films. The effect of sepiolite loading on the thermal, <b>mechanical,</b> <b>gas</b> permeability, and water vapor permeability (WVP) properties of the films was investigated. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the crystallinity index and well dispersed sepiolite in PLA/sepiolite thin films.

PLA/sepiolite films exhibited improved gas barrier and WVP properties compared to neat PLA. The scanning electron microscope results demonstrated that there is a good interface interaction between sepiolite and PLA. The surface treatment of sepiolite increased the adhesion of the PLA matrix to the sepiolite nanoclay which yielded better mechanical properties of the films as compared to pure PLA.

40|$|We {{present a}} study on {{a new type of}} flow field channel design for polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane fuel cells PEMFCs. Small barriers have been implemented into the flow field channels that force the gas flow to move through the gas diffusion layers in order to improve the supply of the catalyst with reactant gases. We investigated the water distribution in the PEMFC with neutron imaging during operation and compared the results with a comparable reference cell without barriers. We found strong hints for an increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>gas</b> flow resistance by the barriers caused by additional liquid water agglomerations. Furthermore water distribution in the barrier flow field is much more homogenous compared to the reference cell.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the second year's effort towards a 3 -year program to develop micropilot ignition systems for existing pipeline compressor engines. In essence, all Phase II {{goals and objectives}} were met. We intend {{to proceed with the}} Phase III research plan, as set forth by the applicable Research Management Plan. The objective for Phase II was to further develop and optimize the micropilot ignition system for large bore, slow speed engines operating at low compression ratios. The primary elements of Micropilot Phase II were to evaluate the results for the 4 -cylinder system prototype developed for Phase I, then optimize this system to demonstrate the technology's readiness for the field demonstration phase. In all, there were twelve (12) tasks defined and executed to support objectives in a stepwise fashion. Task-specific approaches and results are documented in this report. Research activities for Micropilot Phase II were conducted with the understanding that the efforts are expected to result in a commercial product to capture and disseminate the efficiency and environmental benefits of this new technology. Commercially-available fuel injection products were identified and applied to the program where appropriate. Modifications to existing engine components were kept to a minimum. This approach will minimize the overall time-to-market requirements, while meeting performance and cost criteria. The optimized four-cylinder system data demonstrated significant progress compared to Phase I results, as well as traditional spark ignition systems. An extensive testing program at the EECL using the GMV- 4 test engine demonstrated that: (1) In general, the engine operated more stable fewer misfires and partial combustion events when using the 3 -hole injectors compared to the 5 -hole injectors used in Phase I. (2) The engine had, in general, a wider range of operation with the 3 -hole injectors. Minimum operational boost levels were approximately 5 ''Hg lower and the minimum pilot quantity that the engine would operate on was roughly cut in half. (3) A successful concept demonstration of engine lube oil pilot injection was performed where the minimum operational boost was reduced by another 5 ''Hg to a boost level of 3 ''Hg; this is, depending on altitude, in the range of boost levels of many blower and piston scavenged low BMEP engines. (4) Micropilot ignition compares very favorably to other ignitions systems. The performance of micropilot ignition with <b>mechanical</b> <b>gas</b> admission valves is very similar to the performance of precombustion chamber ignition with high pressure fuel injection. Compared to spark ignition with <b>mechanical</b> <b>gas</b> admission valves the lean limit of operation is extended by about 5 ''Hg.

These three methods included the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), dynamic modal analysis using finite element analysis (FEA), and a stress analysis method also using FEA. The CFD analysis focuses primarily on the fuel mixing in the combustion chamber of a TLA engine. Results indicate {{a significant increase in}} the homogeneity of the air and fuel using high-pressure fuel injection (HPFI) instead of standard low-pressure <b>mechanical</b> <b>gas</b> admission valve (MGAV). A modal analysis of three engine crankshafts (TLA- 6, HBA- 6, and GMV- 10) is developed and presented. Results indicate that each crankshaft has a natural frequency and corresponding speed that is well away from the typical engine operating speed. A frame stress analysis method is also developed and presented. Two different crankcases are examined. A TLA- 6 crankcase is modeled and a stress analysis is performed. The method of dynamic load determination, model setup, and the results from the stress analysis are discussed. Preliminary results indicate a 10 %- 15 % maximum increase in frame stress due to a 20 % increase in HP. However, the high stress regions were localized.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that perfluorochemical (PFC) liquid ventilation (LV) can be used as a vehicle to deliver halothane and induce and maintain analgesia. Seven hamsters were paralysed and stabilized with <b>mechanical</b> <b>gas</b> ventilation, ventilated in alternating cycles with gas and either neat oxygenated PFC liquid or oxygenated PFC liquid mixed with liquid halothane (PFC:hal) 1 · 50 % (volume/vapour); arterial pressure and blood gases were monitored throughout the protocol. After each cycle, the animal was stimulated with a foot clamp for 2 s. Mean arterial pressure (MAP:mmHg) response to this stimulation (percent change from the resting MAP) was used as an index of analgesia. Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower during ventilation with PFC:hal (73 ± 7 se) as compared with MAP during neat PFC (113 ± 5 se) or gas ventilation (107 ± se). Mean arterial pressure response (% change in MAP from baseline) to foot-clamp stimulation was significantly lower with PFC:hal ventilation (+ 12 ± 5 % se) as compared with neat PFC (+ 28 ± 8 % se) and gas ventilation (+ 29 ± 9 % se). There was no statistically significant difference in resting MAP or MAP response to foot-clamp stimulation between cycles of ventilation with neat PFC alone or gas ventilation; arterial blood gases were not significantly different between modes of ventilation or levels of analgesia. The data indicate that halothane can be administered during LV while supporting gas exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility of inducing analgesia while using PFC LV techniques...|$|E
40|$|After air {{and water}} mixing, the process of gas {{compression}} in the downcomer shaft or pipe of a hydraulic air compressor is considered nearly isothermal due to (i) the mass {{flow rate of water}} being typically of three orders higher than that of the gas it compresses, (ii) water having a heat capacity approximately four times that of air, and (iii) the intimate contact and large heat transfer area between the gas phase and the liquid phase of the bubbly flow. A formulation for estimation of the efficiency of a closed-or open-loop hydraulic air compressor, expressed in terms of the principal hydraulic air compressor design variables, is presented. The influence of a hitherto underappreciated factor affecting the performance of these installations, such as the solubility of the gas being compressed in the water, is explored. A procedure for estimating the yield of compressed gas, accounting for these solubility losses, is explained and used to determine the mechanical efficiency of historical hydraulic air compressor installations from reported performance data. The result is a significant downward revision of hydraulic air compressor efficiency by approximately 20 % points in comparison to most reported efficiencies. However, through manipulation of cosolute concentrations in the water, and the temperature of the water (through regulation of the ejection of compression heat), the mechanical efficiency can be increased to the formerly reported levels. The thermoeconomic implication of these efficiency determinations is that in a modern context, hydraulic air compressors may be able to outperform conventional <b>mechanical</b> <b>gas</b> compression equipment...|$|E
40|$|The coating {{technology}} is a strategic solution to improve the properties of flexible packaging films. Indeed, additional functional layers are often designed and added as coating on the substrate, {{in order to improve}} the characteristic of the flexible packaging and to meet the requirements for the desired gas or vapour barrier, for adhesion and sealing, or for improving the film printability, its aesthetics and durability. Moreover, this technology allows to functionalize a polymeric substrate applying materials with different chemistry, rheology, thermal and structural characteristics. BOPET films are widely used for food packaging applications thanks to their good gas barrier and mechanical properties, high transparency and for the excellent printability. In regard to sealing performance, BOPET films show poor sealing properties so they are mostly submitted to lamination processes with polyethylene. Nevertheless, this solution compromises the PET recyclability and influences the gas permeability of the multilayer PET based structures. The aim of this work is to investigate on the effect of nanocomposite biodegradable coatings for BOPET substrates in enhancing the heat sealing strength of eco-compatible PET/PLA films. At this regards, different percentages of Cloisite C 30 B (0 %, 2 % and 4 %wt/wt) have been added to PLA by solution intercalation technique and the nanocomposite biodegradable materials produced have been applied on BOPET commercial films by casting. The BOPET coated films have been characterized in order to evaluate the heat sealing strength and the <b>mechanical,</b> <b>gas</b> permeability and surface properties. The results have shown that the addition of nanoclay in PLA coating significantly enhance the hot tack properties of the PET/PLA system produced, while the oxygen and water vapour permeability are slightly increased if compared to pure BOPET films...|$|E
