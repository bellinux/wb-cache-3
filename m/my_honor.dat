5|$|Another epic film, On <b>My</b> <b>Honor,</b> was {{conceived}} and begun by Cecil B. DeMille. It was {{to document the}} founding of the Scouting movement but was left unfinished after DeMille died in January 1959. The screenplay, by Jesse Lasky, Jr., focused on Baden-Powell, Burnham and other pioneers who were to have a major influence on Scouting. After DeMille's death, associate producer Henry Wilcoxon continued to work on the film until 1962, hiring Sydney Box to assist with the script. Starting in 2001, producers Jerry Molen and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, using an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box.|$|E

500|$|Sanford {{announced}} in late December 1997 {{that he had}} been diagnosed with inoperable esophageal cancer and that his doctors said he had a few months to live. After his release from the hospital, his condition slowly deteriorated. He died in his sleep while surrounded by his family at his Durham home. He was 80years old. At his funeral, he was eulogized by a childhood friend who said Sanford [...] "took [...] oath when he was twelve years old and kept it. It started out, 'On <b>my</b> <b>honor,</b> I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country,' and included such things as 'help other people at all times.' He believed it. He was the eternal Boy Scout." [...] Sanford is entombed in the crypt of Duke University Chapel.|$|E
500|$|Yancey, {{like most}} members of the planter class, was a strong believer in a {{personal}} code of honor. [...] In September 1838, Yancey returned for a brief return visit to Greenville. [...] A political slur by Yancey in a private conversation was overheard by a teenage relative of the aggrieved party. [...] Yancey was confronted by another relative (and his wife’s uncle), Dr. Robinson Earle. [...] Conversation turned to violence, and the always-armed Yancey ended up killing the doctor in a street brawl. [...] Yancey was tried and sentenced to a year in jail for manslaughter. [...] An unrepentant Yancey was pardoned after only a few months, but while incarcerated he wrote for his newspaper, [...] "Reared with the spirit of a man in my bosom — and taught to preserve inviolate <b>my</b> <b>honor</b> — my character, and my person, I have acted as such a spirit dictated." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Balzac did {{not draw}} {{specifically}} {{from the women}} in his life to create Valérie, parallels have been observed in some areas. The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is {{similar in some ways}} to Valérie's manipulation of Steinbock. Critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska's pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Valérie conceives and loses her child. Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Valérie's treacherous character, he felt a devotion similar to that of Hulot. He once wrote to her: [...] "je fais pour mon Eve toute les folies qu'un Hulot fait pour une Marneffe, je te donnerai mon sang, mon honneur, ma vie" [...] ("I commit for [...] all the follies that a Hulot commits for Madame Marneffe; I give you my blood, <b>my</b> <b>honor,</b> my life").|$|E

500|$|During {{the next}} few months, Pedro {{attempted}} to maintain a semblance of unity with Portugal, but the final rupture was impending. Aided by an able minister, José Bonifácio de Andrada, he searched for support outside Rio de Janeiro. The prince traveled to Minas Gerais in April and on to São Paulo in August. He was welcomed warmly in both Brazilian provinces, and the visits reinforced his authority. While returning from São Paulo, he received news sent on 7 September that the Cortes would not accept self-governance in Brazil and would punish all who disobeyed its orders. [...] "Never one to eschew the most dramatic action on the immediate impulse", said Barman about the prince, he [...] "required no more time for decision than {{the reading of the}} letters demanded." [...] Pedro mounted his bay mare and, in front of his entourage and his Guard of Honor, said: [...] "Friends, the Portuguese Cortes wished to enslave and persecute us. As of today our bonds are ended. By my blood, by <b>my</b> <b>honor,</b> by my God, I swear to bring about the independence of Brazil. Brazilians, let our watchword from this day forth be 'Independence or Death! ...|$|E
500|$|Bataan {{surrendered}} on 9 April, and Corregidor on 6 May. George Marshall {{decided that}} MacArthur would be awarded the Medal of Honor, a decoration {{for which he}} had twice previously been nominated, [...] "to offset any propaganda by the enemy directed at his leaving his command". [...] Eisenhower pointed out that MacArthur had not actually performed any acts of valor as required by law, but Marshall cited the 1927 award of the medal to Charles Lindbergh as a precedent. Special legislation had been passed to authorize Lindbergh's medal, but while similar legislation was introduced authorizing the medal for MacArthur by Congressmen J. Parnell Thomas and James E. Van Zandt, Marshall felt strongly that a serving general should receive the medal from the President and the War Department. MacArthur chose to accept it on the basis that [...] "this award was intended not so much for me personally as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was <b>my</b> <b>honor</b> to command." [...] Arthur and Douglas MacArthur thus became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. They remained the only pair until 2001, when Theodore Roosevelt was awarded posthumously for his service during the Spanish–American War, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. having received one posthumously for his service during World War II.
