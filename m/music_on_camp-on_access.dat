However, {{the transition to}} Internetbased telephony services also provides an opportunity to create new services more rapidly and with lower complexity than in the existing {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol that creates, modifies and terminates associations between Internet end systems, including conferences and point-to-point calls. SIP supports unicast, mesh and multicast conferences, as well as combinations of these modes. SIP implements services such as call forwarding and transfer, placing calls <b>on</b> hold, <b>camp-on</b> and call queueing by a small set of call handling primitives. SIP implementations can re-use parts of other Internet service protocols such as HTTP and the Real-Time Stream Protocol (RTSP). In this paper, we describe SIP, and show how its basic primitives can be used to construct a wide range of telephony services. ...|$|R

As a result, the significant difference in the cortisol responses among the condition was observed; the salivary cortisol was decreased after the music treatment. This result plausibly demonstrated the effects of <b>music</b> <b>on</b> human hormonal secretion and might imply the power of music...|$|R
