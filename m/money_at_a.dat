5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples {{sold his}} {{rights to the}} Kingdom of Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice and retreated from the Balkans in 1409, many local nobles allied {{themselves}} with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and accepted Ostoja as the King of Bosnia. This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hranić, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazarević. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena {{at the end of}} the same year. Jelena married Sandalj because she wanted to strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of Balša III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazarević family. Although Jelena was in her forties, Sandalj hoped they would have children and in 1413 deposited some <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> transactional account with the city of Dubrovnik for the child they would eventually have.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, to {{evaluate}} the real worthiness of an amount of money today after a given period of time, economic agents compound the amount of <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> given interest rate. Most actuarial calculations use the risk-free interest rate which corresponds the minimum guaranteed rate provided the bank's saving account, for example. If one wants to compare their change in purchasing power, then they should use the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate).|$|E
25|$|South Tyneside Council faced {{significant}} {{criticism from}} British media, who {{focused on the}} use of taxpayer <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time of severe budget cuts across the government services throughout the country. The Council have said the amount spent on the case was around £75,000 (US$123,712 as of 31 May) or less, while media reports indicate the true cost is closer to US$400,000. As of 24 November 2011, the council had failed to identify who their critic was.|$|E

25|$|Another cross-site {{vulnerability}} is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser {{into taking}} actions the user didn't intend at a target site (like transferring <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> bank). It works because, {{if the target}} site relies only on cookies to authenticate requests, then requests initiated by code on the attacker's site will carry the same legitimate login credentials as requests initiated by the user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and {{not only in the}} cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the sense}} of the Constitution, bills of credit signify a paper medium of {{exchange}} intended to circulate between individuals, and between the Government and individuals, for the ordinary purposes of society. It is immaterial whether the quality of legal tender is imparted to such paper. Interest-bearing certificates in denominations up to ten dollars that were issued by loan offices established by the State of Missouri and made receivable in payment of taxes or other moneys due to the State, and in payment of the fees and salaries of state officers, were held to be bills of credit whose issuance was banned by this section. The States are not forbidden, however, to issue coupons receivable for taxes, nor to execute instruments binding themselves to pay <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> future day for services rendered or money borrowed. Bills issued by state banks are not bills of credit; it is immaterial that the State is the sole stockholder of the bank, that the officers of the bank were elected by the state legislature, or that the capital of the bank was raised by the sale of state bonds.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, The Devil Inside, a low-budget {{found footage}} horror film {{following}} in the steps of Cloverfield, opened the weekend after New Year's Day. Critics, for whom {{it had not been}} screened, reviewed it harshly if and when they did see it, and audiences reacted angrily to the film's abrupt ending, which directed them to a website for more information. Yet, as Cargill notes, its success was proof that even on that low-potential weekend, a disengaged audience will [...] "throw <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> terrible movie if it looks like it's good." [...] The film's opening weekend take of $33.7 million ranks in the top ten for January.

500|$|George Elsworth Smith (1862–1905) was an American gambler and Thoroughbred {{horse racing}} enthusiast {{who became a}} multi-millionaire during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century. Smith was given the {{nickname}} [...] "Pittsburgh Phil" [...] in 1885 by Chicago gambler William [...] "Silver Bill" [...] Riley to differentiate him from the other Smiths that also frequented Riley's pool halls. Pittsburgh Phil is considered by many handicappers to have been an expert strategist, winning large sums of <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when racing statistic publications, such as The Daily Racing Form, were not widely available. At the time of his death from tuberculosis in 1905, he had amassed a fortune worth $3,250,000, which is comparable to $US [...] today. His racing Maxims, published posthumously in 1908, are considered to be the foundations of many modern handicapping strategies and formulas.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Right Round" [...] {{uses the}} {{recurring}} pop rap themes of Flo Rida's music; specifically, similarities were noted between {{the song and}} [...] "Low" [...] (2007), with Allmusic reviewer David Jeffries calling [...] "Right Round" [...] its [...] "heir apparent". The song is [...] "" [...] and [...] "bass-heavy", according to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly. The lyrics discuss being in a strip club with friends and tossing <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> woman performing a striptease. Additionally, the chorus line [...] "You spin my head right round, right round / When you go down, when you go down, down" [...] {{can be interpreted as}} a reference to fellatio. Bruno Mars, co-writer of the song confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that the song's chorus was referring to oral sex. Philip Lawrence, also co-writer, confessed the song was [...] "almost something we had accidentally written in the car one night just hanging out." [...] It was him, Bruno Mars, and Aaron Bay-Schuck. Bay-Schuck was playing to Bruno and Philip some tracks and wanted {{to come up with something}} big for Flo Rida, and they were just throwing out 80's ideas.

Homer {{initially}} intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny calls {{to tell him that}} Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down due to health violations and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it much worse than before. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart (who bond after Homer humiliates Bart) discover the creature before the EPA captures it. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, presents five [...] "unthinkable" [...] options to U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep the town's pollution contained. The slow-witted president picks option 3 without reading it, and Springfield is enclosed in a large glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, and his responsibility for sealing Springfield in the dome, the townspeople of Springfield except for the Flanders family form an angry mob and advance on the Simpsons' home to kill Homer, but the family escapes the town through a sinkhole, which then destroys their house. With the EPA on their trail, the Simpsons flee to Alaska. On the way, Homer tries to make some <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> carnival by riding a motorcycle around the inside of a metal cage.|$|E

5000|$|Stoozing is {{the act of}} {{borrowing}} <b>money</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> interest rate of 0%, a rate typically offered by credit card companies as an incentive for new customers.

The borrower does not typically have a real debt to service, but instead uses the money loaned to them to earn interest. Stoozing can also be viewed as a form of arbitrage.|$|R
