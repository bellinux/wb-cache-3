As a result of the trials the Royal Navy showed an interest in ordering the type for carrier duties. In August 1956 the second prototype was leased to British European Airways for evaluation.

Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS.

To achieve this control objective, we design and stabilize a virtual holonomic constraint expressing a relationship between the angles of the actuated and unactuated links. Such relationship guarantees that the unactuated link does not fall over. Then, in order to stabilize the energy level corresponding to the high-high equilibrium while preserving the invariance of the virtual constraint, we dynamically change the geometry of the constraint. 1...|$|R

He arrived on a team which had legend Jerry West, who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in him becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo. Washington admits that he was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him.

40|$|Abstract. Ten years later, {{astronomers are}} still {{puzzled by the}} stellar {{evolution}} that produced SN 1987 A — a blue supergiant. In single star models, the new OPAL opacities make blue solutions more difficult to achieve, though still possible for certain choices of convection physics. We also consider rotation, which has the desirable effect of producing large surface enhancements of nitrogen and helium, but the undesirable effect of increasing the helium-core mass {{at the expense of}} the envelope. The latter makes blue solutions more difficult. Still, we seek a model that occurs with high probability in the LMC and for which <b>the</b> timescale for <b>making</b> <b>the</b> last <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> red to blue, ∼ 20000 years, has a physical interpretation — the Kelvin-Helmholtz time of the helium core. Single star models satisfy both criteria and might yet prove to be the correct explanation for Sk- 69 202, provided new rotational or convection physics can simultaneously give a blue star and explain the ring structure. Some speculations on how this might be achieved are presented and some aspects of binary models briefly discussed. 1...|$|R
