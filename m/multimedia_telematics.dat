40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the design and}} the {{implementation}} of an interactive environment for cooperative teleworking. Telemathea offers tools that support the communication and the teleworking between tutor and trainee, who may reside in remote geographical regions. This environment offers audio communication over the network as well as support for joint editing of text documents and still images. It supports different audio coding techniques so as {{to adjust to the}} available bandwidth, and makes use of the RTP protocol in order to facilitate the exchange of audio and, in the future, video packets. 1 Introduction <b>Multimedia</b> <b>telematics</b> applications for communication and cooperative teleworking give the opportunity for creative joint-work independently of geographical locations. Applications of this kind provide tutors and trainees with the ability of continual, close and efficient cooperation without any need for transportation and personal meetings. Furthermore, the environments [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Physics {{is said to}} be a {{difficult}} subject. Among the reasons for the learner’s difficulties, one has been subject to intense research: the naive conceptual framework in which students insist to explain the world around them. Nevertheless, there have been more questions arising than answers provided to solve these kinds of problems. We point out the role of computational techniques, namely Simulations, <b>Multimedia,</b> <b>Telematics,</b> Virtual Reality, and Computer Based Labs which may deal with those difficulties and increase the learning success. We describe our ongoing experience in the field Anyone interested in this problem should deal with two types of questions: • how students learn Physics and Mathematics; • how to use computers to improve learning. These aspects are of course intimately related, i. e., the best use of modern interactive mediashould be based on our best knowledge on the way students learn. Alfred Bork and Seymourt Papert, a physicist and a mathematician, were pioneers in this type of approach. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} approach to automotive safety systems The industry strategy for automotive safety systems has been evolving {{over the last}} 20 years. Initially, individual passive devices and features such as seatbelts, airbags, knee bolsters, and crush zones were developed for saving lives and minimizing injuries when an accident occurs. Later, preventive measures such as improving visibility, headlights, windshield wipers, and tire traction were deployed to reduce the probability of getting into an accident. Now {{we are at the}} stage of actively avoiding accidents as well as providing maximum protection to the vehicle occupants and even pedestrians. Systems that are on the threshold of being deployed or under intense development include collision detection/warning/intervention systems, lane departure warning, drowsy driver detection, and advanced safety interiors. In this article, Delphi researchers discuss the concept of the safety state diagram, a unified view of the automotive safety system, and the technologies required to implement this vision. Advanced ideas such as pre-crash sensing, anticipatory crash sensing, X-by-wire systems, advanced safety interiors, integrated vehicle electrical/electronics systems, data networks, and mobile <b>multimedia</b> (<b>telematics)</b> are also addressed...|$|E

40|$|A {{major element}} of mobile <b>multimedia,</b> <b>telematics</b> is the {{convergence}} of telecommunication and information technology which provides various services {{to and from the}} vehicle or mobile communication devices. Telematics is also a new technology which accelerates the rate of technological evolution in the automotive electronics industry. Similar to the United States and Europe, Japan is one of the nations which have advanced automotive technologies. Japanese telematics, however, doesn't have a long history. On the other hand, Japan has unique business circumstances such as highly developed mobile communication technology and contents business. The {{purpose of this study is}} to unlock the industrial structure and dynamics of the telematics industry in Japan. In addition, providing indications for building business strategies for telematics players such as automakers, auto suppliers and other industries is another objective. According to the "clockspeed" analysis, telematics clockspeed is much faster than that of automobiles. This situation creates a boundary called clockspeed collision between these two industries. Clockspeed collision will increase market pressure on automakers to provide updated electronic features and to reduce exposure of obsolescence. Clockspeed collision will also significantly affect the business strategies that each player involved in the telematics industry must consider. Value chain analysis illustrates that the telematics industry has a horizontally disintegrated structure. Also the fact that automakers have advantages in the industry is presented. In such situation, the "business double helix" explains that automakers' advantages will be unstable in the future. Namely, the supplier sector in the industry will have significant(cont.) power. My research shows that telematics industry has already started to move toward a much more vertically integrated structure. These analyses lead to conclusions that each player in the telematics industry must recognize a principle of temporary advantage and that the automotive industry is moving from automobile production to maximizing customer's LTV (Life Time Value). by Norihito Shimizu.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In recent years, {{there is}} an {{ever-increasing}} demand and interest {{in the use of}} multimedia technology and applications in industry, government and academia. Multimedia is often seen by researchers as the next step forward in interfacing science, technology and community. Yet, the terminology of multimedia bears several meanings. It may refer to Compact Disc (CD), moving pictures or video-conferencing. The multimedia technology referred in this paper is the World Wide Web (WWW) hypertext publishing information system which was developed by and started at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. Since the introduction of WWW, its use has increased dramatically within a couple of years in a widely diverse community including government departments, university and research establishments, and commercial organisations. It has significant influence to our communities and our daily lives. Yet, in most cases, applications of WWW services are largely restricted to electronic library referencelcatalogue search facilities, electronic mail systems, electronic conference and discussion systems, electronic news and publishing agents, and remote access to computing resources on the Internet. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} exploit the potential of this multimedia technology as a simple, easy-to-use and effective means of telematics application in transportation research. It is hoped that initiatives are highlighted via this study and hence encourage participations and collaborations from different sectors of industries. In this paper, a brief history of WWW is given in section (2). An overview of the technical aspects in providing a WWW service is presented in section (3) in terms of computer hardware requirements, software installation, network connections, application maintenance and administration, and system security. Compared to most commercially available multimedia software in the market, WWW services are cheap to run, userfriendly and readily available to the public on the Internet. In order to exploit the potential of WWW on transportation research, a study was carried out and results of the findings are reported in section (4). To further substantiate the level of usefulness, two particular WWW applications were chosen amongst other web services and they are reported in section (5) for illustrative purposes. The selected applications are the 'Transportation Resources on the Internet' developed in mid- 1994 in the Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) at the University of Leeds in England, and the 'Southern California Real-Time Traffic Report' developed by Maxwell Laboratories, Inc. in collaboration with the California State Department of Transportation in the US. Finally, a set of issues are raised in section (6), highlighting the directions of future development of WWW as an easy-touse, cheap and effective <b>multimedia</b> <b>telematics</b> application on transportation...|$|E

40|$|Working in the {{information}} society is undergoing radical changes. <b>Multimedia</b> and <b>telematics</b> based tools and content services are widely considered as central ingredients for evolving new ways and means of working. Teleworking {{is the key to}} a more flexible design of working time and places of work. To reach the flexibility for working anywhere and anytime a virtual working environment is needed which is reached from any place having a browser and internet access, at home, on the road or in the office. This document first describes a set of requirements for teleworking services. These requirements are intended to guide the development of a reference architecture and provide a set of measurable constraints on implementations by which conformance can be determined. In the second part a short overview of the technology of Web Services is given and the possibilities of using Web Services to build a teleworking environment are presented...|$|R

This article {{deals with}} the problem of the didactic (or 'pedagogical') design of {{educational}} software. An object-oriented design method and a supporting tool (called 'Shoctool') are presented. The method and the tool both stimulate the re-use of existing design and code segments. Resulting designs can be accessed for completeness, allow for comparisons among designs and are relatively easy to read for others than the designer himself. The idea is that the use of such a method and tool can make the development process more efficient and can lead to a more professional approach of the didactic design of educational software in general. Shoctool is described along with several examples from real practice. The article concludes with a discussion of the experience we had with the introduction and use...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{educational}} multimedia resources, varying in both type and quality, is now available. The course tutor faces {{the problem of}} how to evaluate multimedia artefacts and integrate them into course delivery. This paper sets out a principled framework to guide and inform the choice. The task can be approached from two different directions. The first is technologically driven: we survey the latest developments in <b>multimedia</b> and <b>telematics,</b> and query how we can adapt educational practice. The second line of approach is driven by an educational vision: we establish educational goals and principles, and examine how the technology can help implement these goals. In the early multimedia era, developments have often been driven from the first direction. There has been an opportunistic rush to exploit the new technology which has often led to poor-quality systems. This paper follows the second line of approach. It starts with educational aims and principles and finishes with the technology. The paper develops in this way to emphasize the priority of the issues. In a real decision-making context, the issues have to be considered in parallel in order to match educational principles and technological possibilities...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{growth of}} {{interest}} of teachers {{to introduce the}} use of computer as educational tool encourages the development of didactic environments so {{that the use of}} computer classrooms and the resources of the web become daily tools. An aspect of distance education not currently supported by most support environments – commercial and experimental – is related to the possibility of performing laboratory exercises remotely. In the present paper, we illustrate on-going research activities and experimentations within the project LABNET 2 of the Italian Interuniversity Computer Science Consortium (CINI) in the National Laboratory for <b>Multimedia</b> and <b>Telematics</b> (ITEM) in Naples. ITEM runs a set of projects, called LABNET, for the experimentation of technologies of remote access to laboratories. Such projects foresee the creation of laboratories, into which real technical-scientific equipments are remotely accessible to teachers and students. Such objective is achieved through the realization of a suitable computer and network infrastructure and the development of necessary software applications. The research activities described here are aimed at remote management of a physics laboratory. By taking advantage of <b>telematics</b> and <b>multimedia</b> technologies, some experiments available in the Physics laboratory (called LAFIDIN) of the Engineering Faculty of the Federico II University of Naples have been made controllable remotely over the Internet. The remote management allows students to perform experimentations, control equipments and visualize the results of the experiments as if these were performed locally. The access to a real laboratory, even if realized through remote control, aims at a greater didactic effectiveness when compared to conventional techniques of virtual laboratories, supported by advanced environments for distance learning. In this paper, we discuss also results of trials run in cooperation with 10 high school institutes of the district of Naples and Avellino. Students performed physics experiments on remote equipments through Internet connection from their schools. During the execution of the experiments, students had the possibility to have a complete vision of what happens in the laboratory through a remote controlled video camera. The camera helps to improve the pedagogical effectiveness of the experiments, remarking the difference with computer simulated experiments...|$|R
