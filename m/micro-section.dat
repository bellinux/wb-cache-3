A <b>micro-section</b> on the nanohybrid obtained using focused ion beam (FIB) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was employed to observe {{the orientation of the}} nanoclay inside a polycarbonate (PC) matrix in the cross-section FIB-milled face. A micro-scratch tester was used to measure the scratch resistance in terms of residual (healing) depth Rh under progressive load and in sliding wear. Effects of the number of scratches, normal load and scratch velocity have been evaluated as a function of nanoclay orientation. In sliding wear (multiple scratching along the same groove), our nanohybrid reaches residual depth values that remain constant after a certain number of scratches, a manifestation of strain hardening. The number of scratches to induce strain hardening decreases as the normal applied load increases. SEM was used to characterize deformation and wear mechanisms that operate on contacts and the results related to the wear data...|$|E

However, the multiple directional dependencies involved result in an anisotropic material behavior. The raw material under investigation {{in this study was}} the precipitation-hardenable AlSi 10 Mg alloy, with the main focus on the positioning and inclination effects, which were studied on six characteristic orientations. In addition, the superimposed effects based on the surface condition and thermal post-treatments were taken into account. The examination contained: comprehensive tensile tests with strain gauges, detecting strains in two directions; detailed surface hardness investigations in various conditions; and <b>micro-section</b> investigations. Major direction dependencies were revealed and the tensile strength and the surface hardness results, coupled with annealing procedures, exhibited consistent results, explaining the encountered findings. The Young’s modulus varied between 62. 5 GPa to 72. 9 GPa with the Poisson’s ratio fluctuating between 0. 29 and 0. 36.

40|$|Abstract The {{international}} {{community at large}} knows little of the Karen struggle. They are much {{more familiar with the}} pro-democracy movement within Burma and the National League for Democracy’s (NLD) leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. It {{is for this reason that}} it was decided to conduct this research on the Karen – to make the invisible visible, the inaudible audible, the unsayable sayable to the {{international community}}. The thesis sought to explore the impact of organized violence, displacement and resettlement has had on the identity of a <b>micro-section</b> of the displaced Karen people – those professing to be Christian and either living in a displaced persons’ camp on the Thai side of the Thai-Burma border or having migrated to a third country under the UNHCR Resettlement Scheme with a special emphasis on Australia. The reason for choosing this particular <b>micro-section</b> of the Karen people is that, though not the predominant faith practiced by the Karen, the Christian Karen are a synecdoche for the Karen internationally. The thesis was informed by theories of organized violence, displacement and resettlement and explored their relationship to the central construct of identity. A transitional ecosystems model was used to explore the interrelationship of these theories and concepts for Christian Karen, displaced from their homeland by organized violence perpetrated by the ruling power of their country. Two studies were conducted. The first study comprised of interviews with sixteen people aged between nineteen and sixty-four living in Mae La Displaced Persons’ Camp, Thailand. The second study was conducted in Sydney and its environs, Australia and involved two focus groups of displaced Karen who had resettled in Australia within the last three years and ten interviews with Karen community leaders. Translators were used in the majority of the interviews conducted in the camp and in both focus groups in Australia. Interviews involving a translator were transcribed in both Karen and English and back-translated for rigor and trustworthiness of the data. One set of interviews was conducted in Burmese and transcribed in both Burmese and English and subsequently back-translated. All other interviews were transcribed in English. A thematic analysis using the general inductive approach advocated by Addison (1989); Strauss and Corbin (1998); Miller and Crabtree (1999) and Thomas (2006) revealed themes that answered the research questions. v The stories shared in the interviews resonated common themes that had impacted on participants’ lives and shaped their identity. They are culture, Christian faith, education, nationalism, oppression, displacement and resettlement. Each of these themes is a link in a chain that revealed insights into how the participants perceived their identity. In this way, the seven themes are intertwined and interdependent. Amongst the Christian displaced Karen, a dual identity was evident, encompassing a strong superordinate identity as being Karen (identifying as a nation) together with a sub-group identity rooted in their faith and community. Both seemed to maintain cohesion for both those living their displaced lives within Mae La Camp and those who had resettled to the third country. With the majority of Karen national leadership identifying as Christian, these findings lend an understanding into why they have maintained their struggle for recognition of their homeland Kawthoolei, in what has become the longest civil war in world history. They also have the potential to assist agencies working with Karen resettling to third countries to develop culturally competent practices by lending an understanding into the identity of these people...|$|E

Based on the layer-wise fabrication, with its distinctive orientations in translations and thermal influences within this additive manufacturing process, the obtained material properties and the microstructure are anticipated to be anisotropic. The {{selective laser}} melting process involves: the laser movement pattern in plane and rotation between single layers; recoater movement; substrate plate heating and movement; laser irradiation from the top; and inert gas flow. In order to gain insight into the process and its related characteristics, different sets of prismatic specimens in terms of orientation and inclination were produced and evaluated. The evaluation contained surface quality investigations with two independent measurement approaches, i. e. tactile and optical, density measurements based on the Archimedes principle and <b>micro-section</b> evaluation. Furthermore, ultrasonic analyses were conducted to study the feasibility of determining the mechanical properties, i. e. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, in accordance with the recorded longitudinal and transversal sonic velocities. The chosen raw material for these investigations was AlSi 10 Mg and the fabricated parts exhibited a high relative density of at least 99. 5 %. Remarkable deviations were evident in the obtained surface quality and clear trends could be determined based on the inclination and orientation condition of the sample during manufacturing.

Cracks were induced into the solder joints of chip resistors on FR 4 substrates, and studied using metallographic <b>micro-sectioning,</b> dye penetration, mechanical test and thermal conductivity techniques. The work has shown that those techniques traditionally used to study lead-based solder joints can readily be used for assessing lead-free solder joints The traditional <b>micro-sectioning</b> method is suitable for locating and imaging the solder joint crack, especially when the section is examined in a SEM. However, it is not very suitable for quantitative analysis of cracks or their detection in small surface mount resistors. Dye penetration techniques allow a better characterisation of cracks in the horizontal plane and can provide a quantitative measure of the cracked surface area. Shear testing is a proven destructive method for evaluating not only the degree of crack propagation and damage to the solder joint, but also the general strength of the joint.

One of the many issues associated with Pb-free implementation that concerns electronic assemblers is the possibility of increased voiding in the solder joint. Voiding may indicate that the assembly process is not fully optimized for the metallurgical and chemical soldering system being employed. Excessive voiding may affect solder joint mechanical properties, decreasing the strength, ductility and fatigue life of essential interconnections. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the factors and the interactions between surface finishes and solder-alloy systems that affect voiding in order to make the necessary process recommendations to reduce or eliminate the occurrence and size of the voids. A study was conducted to identify the most significant parameters related to voiding for Pb-free and tin-lead Ball Grid Array (BGA) packages assembled with Pb-free solder paste. Several factors were compared, namely: surface finish, reflow profile, reflow atmosphere and solder ball alloy (Pb-free or Sn-Pb).

However, shrub-based dendrochronology has so far resulted {{in only a few}} long and climate-responsive ring-width chronologies at such stressful sites, particularly above the alpine tree line. A previous study on an alpine Rhododendron shrub species resulted in 0. 85), thus representing the longest shrub chronology available to date. A principal component analysis (PCA) converted the total variability of all six site chronologies into PCs. Then, the six site chronologies and the PC 1, accounting for 65. 9 % of the total variance of the tree-ring width, were correlated with time series of monthly climate data. Based on this, the year-to-year variability of the ring-width indices was positively correlated with July temperature, which thus {{turned out to be the}} dominant factor controlling growth. Accordingly, such long shrub-ring chronologies may act as climatic and ecological proxies in treeless environments of the Tibetan Plateau. © 2015 Collegium Boreas.

Results from reliability tests under harsh automotive-like environmental conditions are presented, involving {{a number of different}} BGA packages, including OMPACS, Super BGAs and Tape BGAs, as well as fine-pitch quad flatpacks serving as a reference. All packages were mounted to standard gold-plated FR- 4 test boards, specifically designed for the tests. Parameters such as pad design, BGA substrate thickness, and use of underfill or conformal coating, were varied in order to study their influence on the reliability. Daisy Chain packages were used to check the electrical performance of the solder joints whereas <b>micro-sectioning</b> and the use of a dye penetrant were employed to study the joint quality. The environmental tests comprised temperature cycling from- 40 to 100 °C, with and without simultaneous exposure to vibration (8 G, 10 - 500 Hz) during the high temperature phase, as well as humidity cycling from 25 to 65 °C at 93 % RH.

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{associated}} with enhanced synchronization of neuronal network activity in the beta (15 - 30 Hz) frequency band across several nuclei of the basal ganglia (BG). Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) appears to reduce this pathological oscillation, thereby alleviating PD symptoms. However, direct stimulation of primary motor cortex (M 1) has recently {{been shown to be}} effective in reducing symptoms in PD, suggesting a role for cortex in patterning pathological rhythms. Here, we examine the properties of M 1 network oscillations in coronal slices taken from rat brain. Oscillations in the high beta frequency range (layer 5, 27. 8 +/- 1. 1 Hz, n= 6) were elicited by co-application of the glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid (400 nM) and muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (50 mu M). Dual extracellular recordings, local application of tetrodotoxin and recordings in M 1 <b>micro-sections</b> indicate that the activity originates within deep layers V/VI. Beta oscillations were unaffected by specific AMPA receptor blockade, abolished by the GABA type A receptor (GABAAR) antagonist picrotoxin and the gap-junction blocker carbenoxolone, and modulated by pentobarbital and zolpidem indicating dependence on networks of GABAergic interneurons and electrical coupling. High frequency stimulation (HFS) at 125 Hz in superficial layers, designed to mimic transdural/transcranial stimulation, generated gamma oscillations in layers 11 and V (incidence 95 %, 69. 2 +/- 7. 3 Hz, n= 17) with very fast oscillatory components (VFO; 100 - 250 Hz). Stimulation at 4 Hz, however, preferentially promoted theta activity (incidence 62. 5 %, 5. 1 +/- 0. 6 Hz, n= 15) that effected strong amplitude modulation of ongoing beta activity. Stimulation at 20 Hz evoked mixed theta and gamma responses.

However, despite the importance of rays for tree carbon and water relations, methodological challenges hamper knowledge about ray intra- and inter-tree variability and its ecological meaning. In this study we provide a methodological toolbox for soundly quantifying spatial and temporal variability of different ray features. Anatomical ray features were surveyed in different cutting planes (cross-sectional, tangential, and radial) using quantitative image analysis on stem-wood <b>micro-sections</b> sampled from 41 mature Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris). The percentage of ray surface (PERPAR), a proxy for ray volume, was compared among cutting planes and between early- and latewood to assess measurement-induced variability. Different tangential ray metrics were correlated to assess their similarities. The accuracy of cross-sectional and tangential measurements for PERPAR estimates as a function of number of samples and the measured wood surface was assessed using bootstrapping statistical technique. Tangential sections offered the best 3 D insight of ray integration into the xylem and provided the most accurate estimates of PERPAR, with 10 samples of 4 mm 2 showing an estimate within ± 6. 0 % of the true mean PERPAR (relative 95 % confidence interval, CI 95), and 20 samples of 4 mm 2 showing a CI 95 of ± 4. 3 %. Cross-sections were most efficient for establishment of time series, and facilitated comparisons with other widely used xylem anatomical features. Earlywood had significantly lower PERPAR (5. 77 vs. 6. 18 %) and marginally fewer initiating rays than latewood. In comparison to tangential sections, PERPAR was systematically overestimated (6. 50 vs. 4. 92 %) and required approximately twice the sample area for similar accuracy. Radial cuttings provided the least accurate PERPAR estimates. This evaluation of ray parenchyma in conifers and the presented guidelines regarding data accuracy as a function of measured wood surface and number of samples represent an important methodological reference for ray quantification, which will ultimately improve the understanding of the fundamental role of ray parenchyma tissue for the performance and survival of trees growing in stressed environments...|$|R
