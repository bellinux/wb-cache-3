2500|$|The current City of Dubuque {{was named}} after Julien Dubuque, settled at the {{southern}} end of a large flat plain adjacent to the Mississippi River. The city was officially chartered in 1833, located in unorganized territory of the United States. The region was designated as the Iowa Territory in 1838, and was included in the newly created State of Iowa in 1846. After the lead resources were exhausted, the city became home to numerous industries. Dubuque became a center for the timber industry because of its proximity to forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and was later dominated by various <b>millworking</b> businesses. [...] Also important were boat building, brewing, and later, the railroad industry. In 1874, the Diamond Jo Line moved its company headquarters to Dubuque. Diamond Jo Line established a shipyard at Eagle Point in 1878. Just two years later, the company was the largest employer in Dubuque, putting 78 people to work, 75 of whom worked at the shipyard while earning $800$1,000 per week in wages.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the term}} {{millwork}} applied to building elements made specifically from wood. [...] During the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of <b>millworking</b> (1880-1910), virtually {{everything in the}} house was made from wood. [...] During this time, the millwork produced in the United States became standardized nationwide.|$|E
5000|$|The Dubuque <b>Millworking</b> Historic District is {{a nationally}} {{recognized}} historic district located in Dubuque, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. [...] At {{the time of its}} nomination it consisted of 24 resources, which included 19 contributing buildings, and five contributing structures. [...] Made up of large industrial buildings, the district represents the period of transition when Dubuque went from lumber production to millwork production. The buildings are associated with two local <b>millworking</b> firms, Carr, Ryder & Adams and Farley Loetscher. All of the buildings are brick construction, and are between two and five stories in height. Decorative features include pavilions, pilasters, large entry arches, decorative pediments and parapets. Two of the buildings fill an entire block, while three cover a half block. The most substantial buildings were built between 1881 and 1924.|$|E
5000|$|June 1838, Wilson and Josiah Henson {{called a}} {{convention}} of Canadian blacks to discuss the possibility of building a school {{and what should be}} taught. [...] Henson said “Our children could gain those elements of knowledge which are usually taught in a grammar-school.” Henson also thought in addition to this, boys should be taught the practice of a mechanical art, <b>millworking,</b> carpentry, and blacksmithing; and girls be instructed in the domestic arts. [...] The process of constructing a school would be very long as approval and funding would have to be found.|$|E

50|$|Allen's son-in-law, Cornelius Blois, {{is often}} {{credited}} with discovering gold in Waverley. Two major gold mining periods ensued between 1861 {{through the early}} 20th century. Waverley became a boom town with highly skilled gold miners coming from Germany and England. Saloons, hotels, camp followers and the usual trappings of a gold town sprang up quickly, and there were even instances of murders and riots. A third attempt to restart the gold industry occurred years later in the 1930s, but it proved unprofitable and lasted only a few years. Other industries in Waverley have included <b>millworking</b> and forestry. It is also worthy of note that the Shubenacadie Canal system runs through Waverley, between Lake William and Lake Thomas.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{permanent}} settler {{in what is}} now Dubuque was Quebecois pioneer Julien Dubuque, {{who arrived}} in 1785. In 1788, he received permission from the Spanish government and the local Meskwaki of American Indians to mine the area's rich lead deposits. Control of Louisiana and Dubuque's mines shifted briefly back to France in 1800, then to the United States in 1803, following the Louisiana Purchase. Dubuque died in 1810. The Meskwaki continued to mine with full support of the U.S. Government until 1830, when the Meskwaki were illegally pushed out of the mine region by American prospectors.The current City of Dubuque was named after Julien Dubuque, settled {{at the southern end of}} a large flat plain adjacent to the Mississippi River.
