50|$|The Liquid Elastomer Molding (LEM) gasket {{consists}} of a metallic core, coated in selected areas {{on both sides with}} a thin layer of silicone with molded-in sealing beads. These beads have differing heights and widths dependent on the clamping load distribution and application requirements. The base elastomer coating provides a good overall micro-seal with the silicone beads ensuring optimum sealing in the critical areas. LEM can also include molding on its edge either for sealing of high pressure fluids or for T joints between <b>mating</b> <b>flanges.</b>|$|R
40|$|Investments in gas {{distribution}} networks are very high, exceeding worldwide {{hundreds of billions}} of euros. The replacement of pieces too early results loss of capital. However, by too late replacement safety and security of supply may be in serious danger. This project is focused in distribution pipelines, composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters and low pressure, used to take the products to the final consumer. More specifically union joints and flange gaskets are studied. In the field of gasket and seals, gaskets are generally associated with <b>mating</b> <b>flanges</b> of a mechanical joint while seals are generally associated with moving parts. Some designers refer to gaskets as static seals but this is not really true since the relationship between a gasket and its <b>mating</b> <b>flanges</b> is dynamic in nature due to the dynamic deformations associated with internal pressure, vibration, external forces and thermal expansion or contraction. The main objective of this project is the study of low pressure gaskets for gas pipelines. Some gas companies are continuously spending money and resources on improve the lifetime of their installations and achieve the regulations required. The first part of this paper is an analysis and description of gasket design, including calculation of union joints, styles of flanges and factors that affect the performance. Then a description of the common gasket materials and gasket configurations is done, complemented with installation advices and troubleshooting. Following, a complete description of standardized test procedures for determination of leakage, creep and stress relaxation of gasket materials is done, using information from different sources like ASTM, DIN, EN and ISO standards. A compilation of test equipment found in standards and other references is another important part of this study, with a mechanical analysis of the schematic sketches related to each tester, and possible developments in machine design following the knowledge obtained in this topic. Finally takes the processing of data obtained experimentally in laboratory with the comparison of two common gasket materials used in gas pipelines and how to present the obtained results in a useful report addressed to potential consumers...|$|R
5000|$|Flanges {{are flat}} rings {{around the end}} of pipes which mate with an {{equivalent}} flange from another pipe, the two being held together by bolts usually passed through holes drilled through the flanges. A deformable gasket, usually elastomeric, placed between raised faces on the <b>mating</b> <b>flanges</b> provides the seal. Flanges are designed to a large number of specifications that differ because of dimensional variations in pipes sizes and pressure requirements, and because of independent standards development. In the U.S. flanges are either threaded or welded onto the pipe. In the European market flanges are usually welded onto the pipe. In the US flanges are available in a standard 125 lb. bolt pattern as well as a 250 lb (and heavier) bolt pattern (steel bolt pattern). Both are usually rated at [...] A flanged joint is rigid and can bear both tension and compression as well as a limited degree of shear and bending. It also can be dismantled after assembly. Due to the rigid nature of the joint and the risk of excessive bending moment being imposed, it is advised that flanged pipework is not buried.|$|R
500|$|TE0n modes should not, in theory, {{be excited}} in the waffle-iron filter {{because of its}} {{vertical}} symmetry about the centre-line. [...] However, in practice they {{can be caused by}} poorly <b>mating</b> waveguide <b>flanges</b> or misaligned teeth. [...] These spurious modes can be suppressed by fitting thin wires across the width of the filter in the space between the teeth on the vertical centre-line of the waveguide. [...] This can be a better solution than over-engineering the components to high precision and results in a more robust design.|$|R

40|$|Modern turbochargers {{typically}} {{comprise a}} body in three parts; the turbine and compressor housings and the bearing housing. The preferred method of joining these three parts, in automotive applications, {{is to use a}} band clamp with a flat bottomed V-shaped cross section <b>mating</b> with appropriate <b>flanges</b> on the body sections. This method of clamping allows for rapid assembly and infinitely variable relative rotational orientation of the body parts. In this paper finite element analyses are carried out to predict the influence of different flange geometries to the ultimate axial load capacity (UALC), which show a significant dependency on the flange thickness...|$|R
50|$|A choke {{connection}} is formed by <b>mating</b> one choke <b>flange</b> and one cover (or gasket/cover) flange. The central {{region of the}} choke flange face is very slightly recessed {{so that it does}} not touch the face of the cover flange, but is separated from it by a narrow gap. The recessed region is bounded by a deep choke trench (or ditch or groove) cut into the face of the flange. Choke flanges are only used with rectangular waveguide, and are invariably pressurizable, having a gasket groove encircling the choke ditch. The presence of these two concentric circular grooves makes choke flanges easily recognizable. The left-hand flange in figure 2 is a choke flange.|$|R
5000|$|Several vacuum flange {{standards}} exist, and {{the same}} flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and standards organizations.CF (ConFlat) flanges use a copper gasket and knife-edge flange to achieve an ultrahigh vacuum seal. The term [...] "ConFlat" [...] is a registered trademark of Varian, Inc., so [...] "CF" [...] is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two <b>mating</b> CF <b>flanges</b> has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10−13 Torr (10−11 Pa) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during bake-out. For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450 °C can be achieved; the temperature {{is limited by the}} choice of gasket material. CF flanges are sexless and interchangeable. In North America, flange sizes are given by flange outer diameter in inches, while in Europe and Asia, sizes are given by tube inner diameter in millimeters. Despite the different naming conventions, the actual flanges are the same.|$|R
5000|$|At 9:50 that evening, {{the crew}} mated the bell to the {{entrance}} lock as planned, but during the lock‑on procedure a gas leak developed between the <b>mating</b> <b>flanges.</b> The bell was removed, the flange surfaces were cleaned, and on the second attempt the bell was successfully sealed to the system. After Holmes and Baldwin equalized the bell {{with the rest of}} the complex, they opened the inside door and were in the process of transferring in{{to the entrance}} lock when the gas leak suddenly returned. With the needle on the Heise gauge dropping, an attempt was made to isolate the divers from the leak by sealing the door of the entrance lock that led to the bell, but according to the dive log this effort was “abandoned.” To protect Holmes and Baldwin from further pressure loss, the supervisor ordered them to climb into chamber one. There, they leaned against the inside hatch while the supervisor injected a small amount of helium inside the chamber to seal the door. At this point—perhaps due to the distractions of the emergency—the supervisor made the kind of nightmarish mistake that all supervisors who bear such enormous responsibilities fear; he forgot to reset the valves to reconnect the Heise gauge with chamber one. And because chamber one was not equipped with a dedicated depth gauge, Holmes and Baldwin were now in a part of the system not being monitored by any gauge at all. Meanwhile, the Heise gauge was still recording a pressure drop, which the supervisor erroneously believed was reading chamber one. Had he glanced down at his console and examined the telltale positions of the valve handles, he would have instantly realized that his divers were safe and that the Heise gauge was merely reading the continuing bell/entrance lock gas leak. But the supervisor thought that he had failed to achieve a seal on chamber one’s hatch, and so he began to feed large quantities of pure helium into the chamber where the two divers were stationed. By the time he realized his error, Holmes and Baldwin had been pressurized from 310 feet to 650 feet over the course of several minutes. The rapid compression, combined with the high thermal transfer property of helium, plus the high humidity factor of the atmosphere, turned the chamber into an oven, sending the temperature of the atmosphere soaring from an estimated 90 degrees F to 120. Frantic, the two divers began pulling desperately on the chamber hatch to escape the inferno, but nothing they could do would budge the door. The only minimal relief they received was to take the mattresses off their bunks and lie spread-eagled on the somewhat cooler aluminum surfaces. With no place to flee to, and forced to breathe an intolerable atmosphere, the men died several hours later of hyperthermia.|$|R
40|$|A {{coupling}} device for tubular members of large truss structures with {{a locking collar}} being the only moving part is described. Each tubular member is constructed with an end bell section that has a belled <b>flange</b> with a <b>mating</b> face, and a necked area which is smaller in diameter than the tubular members to be joined. A split ring is affixed to each tubular member and is constructed so that when two tubular members are laterally moved into axial alignment and the collar is rotated over it, the split ring loads the joint with axial forces by pressing the belled <b>flange</b> <b>mating</b> surfaces together, and a preloading force {{is provided by the}} collar mating with a taper {{on the outside of the}} split rings. All free play is thereby removed by preloaded force. A major object is to provide an ability to remove and replace individual tubular members without disturbing other structural parts of a truss structure. An additional anticipated use of this joint is to couple high pressure fluid lines...|$|R
