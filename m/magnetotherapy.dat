Magnetostimulation (Viofor Jaroszyk, Paluszak, Sieroń (JPS) system, M 2 P 2 program) was applied to 10 patients for 12 min each day. The third group (10 patients) underwent magnetostimulation (Viofor JPS system, M 3 P 3) for 12 min each day using a different machine. All groups had 15 rounds of applications at approximately 10 : 00 a. m. with intermissions on the weekends. Blood serum was taken four times in a 24 -hour period, before applications, the day after applications and a month later. Chemiluminescence micromethod was used to indicate hormone concentrations. Data was statistically analyzed with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. Results: The statistically signifi cant gains in the circadian cortisol profi le at 4 : 00 p. m., before and after application, were observed as a decrease in concentration during <b>magnetotherapy.</b> In magnetostimulation, with the M 2 P 2 program, a signifi cant increase in the cortisol concentration was observed in circadian profi le at 12 : 00 p. m. one month after the last application. After magnetostimulation with the M 3 P 3 program, a signifi cant increase in concentration at 6 : 00 a. m. and a decrease in concentration at 12 : 00 p. m. were observed one month later.

Pasechnik, V. I. Lungu, P. A. Lozenko Odessa National Medical University, Odessa Summary Despite of success of dental implantation, there are often complications at the early post-operative period of implant placing associated with wound damage and aseptic inflammation. Purpose of the work is studying clinical efficiency of combined local application of new mucosal gel “Apior” and <b>magnetotherapy</b> at the early post-operative period after dental implantation. Combined local application of the mucosal gel “Apior” and pulsating low-frequency electromagnetic field in the complex medical treatment of patients after conducting an operation of setting dental implants favourably affects the common state of patients and clinical symptoms of inflammation in the area of operating wound. As compared with patients who had traditional anti-inflammatory therapy, the patients treated with local application of apigel and magnetoterapy had decline of edema incidence, of gingival mucosa hyperemia, of discomfort in the area of conducted operation. There occurred more rapid improvement of inflammation painfulness, which correlated with the improvement of hygienic state of oral cavity and promoted to prevention of bacterial content of damaged mucous surfaces. Estimation of microvasculatory blood stream by the method of ultrasonic doppler flowmetry revealed more rapid normalization of volume and linear high systole speed of blood stream in the periimplant tissues in case of use of new complex local rehabilitation method, that testified to the less pronounced inflammation of oral mucosa after the operation. The authors came to conclusion that the local application of the offered method of medical treatment of early post-operative complications of dental implantation reduces terms of renewal of structural-functional integrity of oral mucosa, helps in preventing development of inflammatory complications and strengthening endosseus implant. The inclusion in the treatment management of a new combined method of application of mucosal gel “Apior” and <b>magnetotherapy</b> at the early post-operative period of dental implantation improves the hygienic state of oral cavity, positively affects nonspecific resistance of oral liquid, renders the regenerative action on oral mucosa tissues, which improves efficiency of medical treatment and quality of life of patients.

40|$|Herpes zoster (HZ) is a disease {{caused by}} {{varicella}} zoster virus (VZV), where the initial contact leads to varicella. The low immunity of the patient might reactivate the virus and provoke symptoms of HZ, which is characterized by vesicles and blisters localized unilaterally and accompanied by pain. The greatest diagnostic problems occur in Zoster sine herpete and painless HZ. A significant complication of acute HZ infection is chronic postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which manifests as dull and burning pain persisting for more than 3 months after {{the beginning of the}} rash. Senility, female gender, presence of prodromal pain, more severe skin lesions, dysaesthesia, and more intense acute PHN predispose to chronic PHN. Early diagnosis and treatment of HZ infection with antiviral medications prevent PHN. Use of local anesthetics is a very good choice in acute PHN treatment. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) are conventional drugs which alleviate subacute PHN. Immunomodulatory drugs such as gabapentin help prevent or reduce the severity of PHN.

40|$|The {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} ill effects of electromagnetic fields began in 1979 when Nancy Wertheimer and Ed Leeper {{claimed to have}} found a connection between childhood leukemia and power lines. In 1997, a group of researchers led by Martha Linet, M. D., attempted to provide evidence that there was no link between cancer and electromagnetic fields. The study showed that the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia did not escalate with increasing electromagnetic field levels in the children 2 ̆ 7 s homes. When compared to the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s static magnetic field of 0. 5 Gauss, these fields were extremely small. Within the past decade, magnets have been used to treat various medical conditions including arthritis and migraines. <b>Magnetotherapy</b> is the term coined for this alternative approach to medicine which requires placing medical magnets on painful areas to reduce soreness and accelerate healing. The actual mechanism by which, and to what extent, magnets affect the body is unclear. Recent experiments involving Xenopus embryos indicate that huge magnetic fields of approximately 17 Tesla 1 can change the second and third cleavage planes of development. These planes will orient, vertically or horizontally, to the direction of the applied magnetic field (Denegre, et. al. 1998). The potential effects of magnetic fields on the growth of human fibroblast cells were investigated in this study. Cell cultures were split and the new cultures were exposed to a one-TesIa magnetic field for approximately thirty-six hours during their growth phase. Half of the exposed cultures were counted for proliferation rate and the remainder of the cultures were analyzed for patterns of growth. An F test indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} in the growth rates between experimental and control cultures. A Chi square test was used to examine whether cells aligned themselves with the magnetic field during growth. The statistics showed that the data for the control and experimental groups were both significantly different from a random pattern. Since both the control and experimental groups had significant results, it can be concluded that the growth patterns of fibroblasts from the experimental group were no different than those in the control group. The results of this study indicate that magnets do not appear to have an effect on fibroblast growth rates or patterns. This work supports the contention that the reports of positive responses to <b>magnetotherapy</b> are due to a placebo effect.

40|$|Nanotherapy {{applied to}} cancer {{treatment}} is constantly evolving, and {{new approaches to}} current techniques, such as magnetohyperthermia, are being implemented to solve and minimize the limitations of conventional therapeutic strategies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the action of polyphosphate-coated maghemite nanoparticles (MNPs) on oral squamous cell carcinoma. Human oral cancer cells (UM-SCC 14 A) were incubated with MNPs at various concentrations and subjected to cell proliferation tests (MTT), apoptosis assays and transmission electron image analysis. Viability and apoptotic events were time and dose dependent. These in vitro tests showed that at the intermediate concentration tested there is no significant toxicity, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. For this reason this MNPs concentration was chosen for the subsequent in vivo tests. Oral tumor induction was performed by applying the carcinogen DMBA to Syrian hamsters. Animals were then treated by magnetohyperthermia using MNPs. No signs of general clinical symptoms of toxicity or abnormal behavioral reactions were observed. However, animals treated with MNPs and exposed to the alternating magnetic field in the hyperthermia procedure exhibited a significant and time dependent cancer regression, as confirmed by histopathological analyses and immunohistochemistry. Actually, in quantitative terms of the <b>magnetotherapy</b> efficacy involving these polyphosphate-coated MNPs, 100 % recovery (12 / 12) was observed in the oral cancer tumor bearing Syrian hamsters seven days after the treatment with the magnetohyperthermia procedure. Data supports the suggestion that the MNPs-mediated hyperthermia represents a promising strategy for the treatment of oral cancer...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Rheumatic {{diseases}} are nonsurgical {{diseases of the}} locomotor system and connective tissue. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease of connective tissue of unknown cause, with progressive chronic or subacute course. The {{aim of the research}} is to determine whether stationary spa treatment leads to improvement of the functional status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: We included 35 patients with diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, referred for treatment at the spa " Ilidža " Gradačac from February to April 2014. Patients not adhering to treatment protocols were excluded. We used Visual analogue pain scale (VAS), HAQ questionnaire and assessment of the clinical condition before and after the treatment based on the scores 1 - 5. Results: There were 32 female and 3 male patients. The average age was 62. 28 ± 8. 31 years. Based on the HAQ, 12 patients had no difficulties, 9 of them perform activities with little difficulties, 10 with many difficulties, and 4 patients cannot perform certain activities. Before treatment VAS was 6. 63 ± 2. 36, and after treatment the 2. 51 ± 2. 27. Ratings of clinical condition before treatment was 2. 38 ± 0. 74, and after the treatment 3. 64 ± 0. 98. The most frequently used therapies were kinesitherapy, <b>magnetotherapy</b> and interferential electricity.

40|$|<b>Magnetotherapy</b> {{has been}} {{receiving}} increased attention as an attractive strategy for modulating cell physiology {{directly at the}} site of injury, thereby providing the medical community with a safe and non- invasive therapy. Yet, how magnetic eld in uences tendon cells both at the cellular and molecular levels remains unclear. Thus, the in uence of a low-frequency static magnetic eld (2 Hz, 350 mT) on human tendon-derived cells was studied using di erent exposure times (4 and 8 h; short-term studies) and di erent regimens of exposure to an 8 h-period of magnetic stimulation (continuous, every 24 h or every 48 h; long-term studies). Herein, 8 h stimulation in short-term studies signi cantly upregulated the expression of tendon-associated genes SCX, COL 1 A 1, TNC and DCN (p < 0. 05) and altered intracellular Ca 2 + levels (p < 0. 05). Additionally, every 24 h regimen of stimulation signi cantly upregulated COL 1 A 1, COL 3 A 1 and TNC at day 14 in comparison to control (p < 0. 05), whereas continuous exposure di erentially regulated the release of the immunomodulatory cytokines IL- 1 Î² and IL- 10 (p < 0. 001) but only at day 7 in comparison to controls. Altogether, these results provide new insights on how low-frequency static magnetic eld ne-tune the behaviour of tendon cells according to the magnetic settings used, which we foresee to represent an interesting candidate to guide tendon regeneration. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of an approach combining thermal therapy (mud pack and spa bath treatment) and underwater exercising (TT-UE) with conventional therapy, in patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. Design: Single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Thermal-rehabilitation center. Participants: 63 outpatients randomly assigned to the TT-UE (n= 34) and conventional therapy (n= 29). Intervention: The TT-UE group underwent a 12 -day cycle of mature mud pack application, bathing in natural mineral thermal water rich in bromine-iodine, massage therapy according to the standard protocol, and underwater exercises (eg, mobilization, hip traction, muscle strengthening), in a spa pool (≈ 50 min/d), at a thermal facility of the Euganean Basin (Padua, Italy). The conventional therapy group was treated for {{the same number of}} sessions with traditional rehabilitation that included <b>magnetotherapy,</b> electrotherapy, and therapeutic exercises (mobilization, axial traction of the hip, functional re-education). During the treatment period, all patients stayed in the treatment center. Main Outcome Measures: Range of motion (ROM) (with IncliMed goniometer), Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index, and nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption. Results: Findings were based on comparison of 2 groups matched for clinical and initial degree of impairment. In the TT-UE group, ROM significantly increased for flexion, abduction, and internal rotation (P range,. 040 −. 011), WOMAC pain, stiffness, and physical function scores were significantly lower (P range,. 001 −. 001) at the end of treatment, and the effects persisted at 3 -month follow-up. In addition, analgesic and NSAID consumption during follow-up was higher in the TT-UE group, but not significantly so (P=. 09). Conclusions: The patients with OA of the hip who received thermal therapy in combination with underwater exercising showed greater reductions in pain, motor impairment, and improvements in functional abilities, and these benefits persisted over tim...|$|E
40|$|Background: Free {{radicals}} are atoms, molecules or their fragments, whose excess {{leads to the}} development of oxidative stress, the cause of many neoplastic, neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases, as well as aging of organisms. Industrial pollution, tobacco smoke, ionizing radiation, ultrasound and magnetic fields are the major exogenous sources of free radicals. The low frequency magnetic field is commonly applied in physiotherapy. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect of extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) on the concentration of sulfhydryl groups (–SH) and proteins in liver tissues of experimental animals depending on the time of exposure to the field. Material and Methods: Twenty one Sprague-Dawley male rats, aged 3 – 4 months were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups (each containing 7 animals) : controls (group I), the rats exposed to ELF-MF of 40 Hz, 7 mT (this kind of the ELF-MF is mostly used in <b>magnetotherapy),</b> 30 min/day for 2 weeks (group II) and the rats exposed to 40 Hz, 7 mT for 60 min/day for 2 weeks (group III). The concentrations of proteins and sulfhydryl groups in the liver tissues were determined after exposure to magnetic fields. Results: Exposure to low magnetic field: 40 Hz, 7 mT for 30 min/day and 60 min/day for 2 weeks caused a significant increase in the concentration of –SH groups and total protein levels in the liver tissues. Conclusions: The study results suggest that exposure to magnetic fields leads {{to the development of}} adaptive mechanisms to maintain the balance in the body oxidation-reduction and in the case of the studied parameters does not depend on the time of exposure.
