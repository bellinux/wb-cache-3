25|$|In 2015, Getrag {{introduced}} a new seven-speed, wet-clutch DCT, the 7DCT300, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> of 300 Nm. The first application was the Renault Espace with a 1.6 L, Turbo GDI engine.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} if isolated <b>maximum</b> joint <b>torques</b> and joint <b>torques</b> during a <b>maximum</b> polyarticular task (i. e. cycling at maximum power) are correlated despite joint angle and velocity discrepancies, and to assess if an isolated joint-specific torque production capability at slow angular velocity is related to cycling power. Nine cyclists completed two different evaluations of their lower limb <b>maximum</b> joint <b>torques.</b> <b>Maximum</b> Isolated <b>Torques</b> were assessed on isolated joint movements using an isokinetic ergometer and <b>Maximum</b> Pedalling <b>Torques</b> were calculated at the ankle, knee and hip for flexion and extension by inverse dynamics during cycling at maximum power. A correlation analysis was made between <b>Maximum</b> Isolated <b>Torques</b> and respective <b>Maximum</b> Pedalling <b>Torques</b> [3 joints x (flexion + extension) ], showing no significant relationship. Only one significant relationship was found between cycling maximum power and knee extension <b>Maximum</b> Isolated <b>Torque</b> (r= 0. 68, p< 0. 05). Lack of correlations between isolated joint torques measured at slow angular velocity and the same joint torques involved in a polyarticular task shows that transfers between both are not direct due to differences in joint angular velocities and in mono-articular versus poly articular joint torque production capabilities. However, this study confirms that maximum power in cycling is correlated with slow angular velocity mono-articular <b>maximum</b> knee extension <b>torque...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{study of}} {{coupling}} parameters {{shows that the}} <b>maximum</b> adhesion <b>torque</b> and coupling damping have a large influence on the dynamic behavior of DCW. With the increasing of the <b>maximum</b> adhesion <b>torque</b> and the coupling damping, the DCW {{tends to be a}} conventional wheelset. The <b>maximum</b> adhesion <b>torque</b> of the clutch-type limited slip device depends on the wheel/rail adhesion conditions.|$|R
30|$|However, in {{this paper}} we have only {{discussed}} the dynamic performance of single bogies, through which the <b>maximum</b> adhesion <b>torque</b> could not be determined and hence we cannot investigate how to control the <b>maximum</b> adhesion <b>torque</b> to adapt to different track conditions. Therefore, in the future research, the creep control will be studied to determine the <b>maximum</b> adhesion <b>torque</b> of clutch-type limited slip device with the full railway vehicle.|$|R
25|$|Steam {{engines and}} {{electric}} motors tend to produce <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> {{close to zero}} rpm, with the torque diminishing as rotational speed rises (due to increasing friction and other constraints). Reciprocating steam engines can start heavy loads from zero RPM without a clutch.|$|E
25|$|Once {{this is done}} {{a figure}} {{relating}} the current to the torque {{can be used as}} a useful parameter for motor selection. The <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> for a motor will depend on the maximum current although this will usually be only usable until thermal considerations take precedence.|$|E
25|$|The WRIM is used {{primarily}} {{to start a}} high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.|$|E
40|$|Geometrical design {{characteristics}} of orthodontic mini-implants predicting <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> Objective: To determine the unique contribution of geometrical design cha-rac teristics of orthodontic mini-implants on <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> while {{controlling for the}} influence of cortical bone thickness. Methods: Total num ber of 100 cylindrical orthodontic mini-implants was used. Geo met-rical design {{characteristics of}} ten specimens of ten types of cylindrical self-drilling orthodontic mini-implants (Ortho Easy®, Aarhus, and Dual TopTM) with diameters ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 0 mm and lengths of 6 and 8 mm were measured. <b>Maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> was recorded during manual insertion of mini-implants into bone samples. Cortical bone thickness was measured. Retrieved data were analyzed in a multiple regression model. Results: Significant predictors for higher <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> included larger outer diameter of implant, higher lead angle of thread, and thicker cortical bone, and their unique contribution to <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> was 12. 3 %, 10. 7 %, and 24. 7 %, respectively. Conclusions: The <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> values are best controlled by choosing an implant diameter and lead angle according to the assessed thickness of cortical bone.

40|$|Introduction: In this {{systematic}} review, {{we analyzed}} whether recommended <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> values of 5 to 10 Ncm {{were associated with}} higher success rates of orthodontic mini-implants compared with mini-implants inserted with <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> values beyond this range. Objective assessments of stability, variables that influence <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> values, and adverse effect of interventions were also assessed in the studies selected for our PICO (patient problem or population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes) question. Methods: Computerized and manual searches of the literature were conducted up to February 24, 2012, for human studies that assessed these objectives. Our eligibility criteria selected studies that (1) used sample sizes of 10 or more, (2) recorded <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> during the insertion of orthodontic mini-implants, (3) inserted implants with a diameter smaller than 2. 5 mm, and (4) applied orthodontic forces for a minimum duration of 4 months. Confounding was assessed through the analysis of risk of bias, and the validity of outcomes was rated according to the GRADE approach. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was our main guideline for the methodology. Results: Seven nonrandomized studies met the eligibility criteria. All associations between specific <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> values and success were based on literature rated as having low quality. The reasons for these judgments included subjective definitions of success, poor-quality torque sensors, and high risks for selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases. A risk of multiple publication bias was also suspected. All associations between <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> and factors related to implant, patient, location, and surgery were rejected; few studies reported on adverse effects. Conclusions: Currently, no evidence indicates that specific <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> levels are associated with higher success rates for orthodontic mini-implants. Additional research on this topic is therefore necessary. The following guidelines for future studies are suggested: (1) systematically review the animal and laboratory literature, (2) perform <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> tests on artificial bone, (3) test associations in animal studies before conducting clinical trials, (4) test associations between <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> and the stability of orthodontic mini-implants with objective quantitative recordings rather than subjective qualitative measures, (5) measure <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> with digital sensors rather than with mechanical devices, (6) assess the stability of orthodontic mini-implants at preestablished times, (7) consult our risk-of-bias analysis, and (8) analyze the adverse effects of interventions.

40|$|Objective: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect that <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> has on force resistance and stability of titanium screws in cadaver maxillae and mandibles. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight cadaver maxillary and mandibular jaw quadrants were obtained Two titanium mini-screws were placed in each jaw quadrant and <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> was measured. Each mini-screw was subjected to tangential force application oriented perpendicular to placement of the mini-screw and parallel to the occlusal plane. The force applied at each deflection was measured up to 1. 5 mm, but only the first 0. 60 mm of movement was investigated. This amount of displacement was selected to represent the amount of movement that would result in a clinically mobile mini-screw and potential failure. Results: The post-hoc Tukey-Kramer 2 ̆ 7 s test showed that mean anchorage resistance for screws placed with <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> of less than 5 Ncm was significantly lower than those observed for 5 - 10 Ncm and greater than 10 Ncm. No significant difference was found between 5 - 10 Ncm and greater than 10 Ncm. Conclusions: In vitro, mean anchorage resistance for screws placed with <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> of less than 5 Ncm was significantly lower than those placed with <b>maximum</b> insertion <b>torque</b> between 5 Ncm and 10 Ncm at deflections ranging from 0. 12 mm to 0. 60 mm.
