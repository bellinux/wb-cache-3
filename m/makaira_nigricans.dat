5000|$|<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans</b> {{is listed}} as a {{threatened}} species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In 2010, Greenpeace International added the blue marlin to its seafood red list.|$|E
50|$|Although {{they are}} {{traditionally}} listed as separate species, recent {{research indicates that}} the Atlantic blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans)</b> and Indo-Pacific blue marlin (Makaira mazara) may be disjoint ranges of the same species.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic {{blue marlin}} (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans)</b> is {{a species of}} marlin endemic to the Atlantic Ocean. It is closely related to, and usually {{considered}} conspecific with, the Indo-Pacific blue marlin, then simply called blue marlin. Some authorities still consider both species distinct.|$|E
50|$|The larger species {{include the}} Atlantic blue marlin, <b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans,</b> which can reach 5 m {{in length and}} 818 kg in weight and the black marlin, Istiompax indica, which can reach in excess of 5 m in length and 670 kg in weight. They are popular {{sporting}} fish in tropical areas.|$|E
50|$|Tuna and {{tuna-like fishes}} are highly migratory, and stocks cross {{numerous}} international boundaries. ICCAT {{is involved in}} management of 30 species, including the Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus thynnus), yellowfin (T. albacares), albacore (T. alalunga) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus); from the billfishes, swordfish (Xiphias gladius), white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans),</b> sailfish (Istiophorus albicans); mackerels such as spotted Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) and king mackerel (S. cavalla); and, small tunas like skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis).|$|E
50|$|Big game {{fishing is}} an {{activity}} {{practiced in the}} Azores essentially during the summer, aboard vessels properly equipped {{for this type of}} fishing with pole-and-line. The target species are the large pelagic fish such as Blue Marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans),</b> swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and various tuna. Usually after the fight given by the fish, they are subsequently released, unless they constitute potential records. The occurrence of these species {{in the vicinity of the}} Condor Bank has been considered a preferred location for this type of fishing, since the 80's, when it became more popular in the Azores.|$|E
40|$|Indices of {{abundance}} of blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans)</b> and white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus) from the Venezuelan Pelagic Longline fishery are presented {{for the period}} 1991 - 2001. The index of number of fish per number of hooks (thousand) was estimated from numbers of marlins caught and reported in the Observer data forms recorded by scientific observers aboard longline (Venezuelan Pelagic Longline Observer Program) vessels since 1991. The standardization analysis procedure included the following variables: year, area, season, fishing operation characteristics (main line length, hook density, target species), fishing time, and fishing depth. The standardized index was estimated using Generalized Linear Mixed Models under a delta lognormal model approach.

40|$|Diet {{composition}} of the blue marlin, <b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans,</b> from the southwestern equatorial Atlantic Ocean was analyzed between October 2004 and November 2005.

This study concern blue marlins (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans,</b> Lacepede 1802) landed by sea artisan fishers in Abidjan port (Ivory Coast) from February 2006 to January 2007. During the Great Warm Season (GWS) March-April-May, {{the surface}} {{temperature}} average is 28. 61 °C. With a Fishing Effort (FE) of 3, 874 canoes; 285 blue marlins have been landed. Their weigh average is 77. 70 kg with a Capture by Unit Effort (CPUE) of 5. 62 kg. During this warm season, 187 blue marlins (65. 61 %) have their sizes between 105 and 200 cm against only 98 (34. 39 %) which exceeds 200 cm. During the Great Cold Season (GCS) july-august-september, the average temperature is 25. 58 °C.

Purified DNA from mucous was comparable to muscle and was suitable for conventional polymerase chain reaction, random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, and mitochondrial and nuclear locus sequencing.

40|$|Abstract. —The biomass {{levels of}} several target {{species of the}} Atlantic pelagic {{longline}} fishery, including various tunas of the genus Thunnus and swordfish Xiphias gladius, {{are estimated to be}} close to those required to support the maximum sustainable yield. In contrast, several species captured incidentally are severely depleted. Live release of incidental catch is one means of reducing the fishing mortality of these species without sacrificing the target catch, but the efficacy of such a measure is predicated on the assumption that postrelease survival is relatively high. Prior work has evaluated postrelease survival from pelagic longline gear for the larger istiophorid billfishes, such as blue marlin <b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans</b> and white marlin Kajikia albida, but survival rates are unknown for sailfish Istiophorus platypterus. To estimate the postrelease survival of sailfish caught on pelagic longlin...|$|E
40|$|A large fossil {{skull and}} several rostra of <b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans</b> Lacépède, 1802 (Perciformes: Istiophoridae), {{as well as}} some less {{diagnostic}} istiophorid remains, have been recovered from the middle facies of the Trinidad Formation near Rancho Algodones, San José del Cabo Basin, Baja California Sur, México. These are the only bill fish specimens known from fossiliferous deposits located between southern California and Panama. Based on published accounts of the presence of nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera, and additional field work, we conclude that the age of the study area is late Miocene to late Pliocene. Based on the habitat preferences of recent M. nigricans and on the type of sediments, we conclude that the middle facies of the Trinidad Formation was deposited far offshore at a water depth of at least 100 m in a bottom environment that was poorly oxygenated and without currents...|$|E
40|$|A nearly {{complete}} fossil skull, including the rostrum, of blue marlin, <b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans</b> Lacapède, 1802 (Perciformes: Xiphioidei: Istiophoridae), was {{collected from the}} Oso Member (latest Miocene) of the Capistrano Formation, Mission Viejo, Orange County, California. The specimen is compared with extant and fossil istiophorids, and 19 of its 20 morphological variables are {{within the range of}} values observed for extant M. nigricans, whereas only 13 or less variables are within the observed range of other extant istiophorids. Because extant M. nigricans usually inhabits a water column with a height of about 200 m or more and is the most tropical of all xiphioid species, its presence supports the hypotheses that the Oso Member was deposited at upper bathyal depths or greater and that the coastal paleoclimate of southern California was warmer during the late Miocene than at present...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{characterize}} {{the production of a}} fishery associated with an offshore buoy anchored in the western equatorial Atlantic, by identifying the species caught, and their length-frequency distributions patterns. Data were obtained between May 2010 and May 2011 in the landings on Areia Branca fishing piers and on board two cruises made in February 2011 and April 2011. The fleet is composed of wooden motor boats with average length of 14 m. A total of 31 landings from 6 vessels, totaling 114. 774 kg of fish were monitored. The main target species in this fishery was yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares); bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and are also caught due their relative commercial price, as well as species such as marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans),</b> wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), skipjack (Katswuonus pelamis), rainbow-runner (Elegatis bipinulata), some shark specie...|$|E
40|$|Size {{frequencies}} of catches represent a useful adjunct to catch, effort and abundance information for stock assessment. Size {{frequencies of}} blue and white marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans,</b> and Tetrapturus albidus, respectively) have been collected at U. S. recreational tournaments since 1972. The U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Marine Recreational Fishery Statistics Survey (MRFSS), and the NMFS Large Pelagic Survey have made limited additional observations of the U. S. recre-ational marlin catch during dockside interviews of fishermen since 1982 and 1984, respectively. Other size data for marlin are available for U. S. and Venezuelan longline fisheries. These include measurements taken by observers on Venezuelan longline vessels since 1987, and on U. S. vessels since 1989. These data are supplemented with dockside samples of Venezuelan longline and artisanal gillnet billfish landings beginning in 1987. Length frequencies constructed from these data showed increasing mean sizes in the U. S. recreational fisheries in recent years. This trend {{is the result of}} the implementation of minimum size regulations that truncated the size distribution of fish landed by U. S. recreational fishermen. This trend is not reflected in the samples from the other fisheries. Sex ratios for both species change from predominately male, or unknown sex at smaller sizes to predominantly female at larger sizes. The examination of the size frequency data from these surveys emphasizes the need too address the sexual dimorphism issue in any analyses that attempt to interpret changes in observed size frequencies in the context of stock assessment RESUMEN Las frecuencias de tallas de las capturas representan una información añadida a la captura, esfuerzo y abundancia que resulta útil para evaluar el stock.

40|$|ABSTRACT The feeding {{habits of}} <b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans,</b> Kajikia audax, Istiophorus platypterus (Istiophoridae), and Xiphias gladius (Xiphiidae) in the {{southeast}} Pacific Ocean were examined in Manta and Santa Rosa, Ecuador. This study describes the diets of these billfish species, evaluates dietary differences between species, and assesses seasonal differences in diet. A total of 274 M. nigricans, 321 K. audax, 267 I. platypterus, and 252 X. gladius were collected between February 2014 and April 2015. The scombrid Auxis spp. {{was the most important}} prey for M. nigricans, K. audax and I. platypterus, while the squid Dosidicus gigas was the most important prey for X. gladius. The results of the ANOSIM confirmed significant differences in feeding habits between the members of the family Istiophoridae and X. gladius. Seasonal differences for I. platypterus also were observed. Billfishes are specialist consumers with a narrow niche breadth (B a: M. nigricans and K. audax= 0. 1, I. platypterus= 0. 05, and X. gladius= 0. 04) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} {{movements of}} Atlantic blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans)</b> from the Gulf of Mexico based upon 42 pop-up archival transmitting (PAT) tags. Long deployments (including one 334 -day track) revealed diverse movement patterns within the Gulf of Mexico. North–south seasonal changes in blue marlin distribution showed strong correspondence with established seasonal patterns of sea surface temperature and primary production. During the summer spawning season, blue marlin utilized outer shelf and shelf edge {{waters in the}} northern Gulf of Mexico, and longer duration tracks indicated overwintering habitats in the Bay of Campeche. Egress occurred throughout the year and was difficult to determine because some tracks ended in the Straits of Florida (n = 3) while other tracks recorded movement through it or the Yucatan Channel (n = 4). Our results indicate that Atlantic blue marlin have a more restricted geographic range of habitats than previously recognized and that the Gulf of Mexico provides spatially dynamic suitable habitat that is utilized year-round through seasonal movements...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of larval istiophorid billfishes {{from the western}} North Atlantic Ocean has long been problematic. In the present study, a molecular technique was used to positively identify 27 larval white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), 96 larval blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans),</b> and 591 larval sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) from the Straits of Florida and the Bahamas. Nine morphometric measurements were taken for a subset of larvae (species known), and lower jaw pigment patterns were recorded on a grid. Canonical variates analysis (CVA) was used to reveal {{the extent to which}} the combination of morphometric, pigment pattern, and month of capture information was diagnostic to species level. Linear regression revealed species-specific relationships between the ratio of snout length to eye orbit diameter and standard length (SL).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} several equations for converting among {{measures of}} size (length and weight) for swordfish (Xiphias gladius), black marlin (Makaira indica) and blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans)</b> caught by Indonesian longliners in the Indian Ocean. The equations use for transforming non-standard measurement i. e. eye fork length (EFL) and pectoral fork length (PFL) to standard measurement, lower jaw fork length (LJFL). The paper also discussed about the length-weight relationship, including converting from non-standard length (EFL and PFL) to round weight. The result showed that both PFL and EFL were {{positively related to}} LJFL {{but there were no}} significant differences existed between females and males among length measures for swordfish, blue marlin, and black marlin (ANCOVA, P> 0. 05). All regression equation models were considered to be valid (P< 0. 01) with coefficient of determinations (r 2) ranged from 0. 81 - 0. 99. Allometric growth pattern was statistically observed for all swordfish (b= 2. 94, r 2 = 0. 94), black marlin (b= 3. 12; r 2 = 0. 90) and blue marlin (b= 3. 30; r 2 = 0. 91) ...|$|E
40|$|The blue marlin, <b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans</b> (Istiophoridae), is a large, top {{predator}} with {{a worldwide}} distribution whose feeding ecology is still {{unknown in the}} northeast Atlantic. The stomach contents of 24 Atlantic blue marlin, caught by the Big Game fishing fleet (between 2007 and 2010) off the south coast of Portugal, were studied. All marlin fed exclusively on pelagic fish, {{with a total of}} 180 prey items recorded, belonging to 6 identified species. The most important family in the blue marlin diet was Scombridae, representing 70 % of the total prey items. Among the Scombridae, the chub mackerel, Scomber colias, was the most important prey species (47. 9 % by weight, 51. 1 % by number, 58. 3 % by frequency of occurrence). The length of prey found in the stomachs ranged from 136 to 727 mm in length, and a significant positive correlation was found between prey and blue marlin size.

40|$|Assessments of {{sailfish}} and marlins usually rely {{on application}} of surplus–production models, because size and age composition of catches are not known. However, even annual catches {{of these species}} are unreported in some Atlantic fisheries where they are taken primarily as bycatch. Past ICCAT billfish assessments have omitted the missing data, an ad hoc approach that reduces credibility of an assessment. In theory, if recent catch and effort data are available for fisheries lacking historical catch data, {{it should be possible}} to fit a surplus–production model by estimat-ing historical catches from corresponding data on fishing effort. Enhancements to ASPIC (the computer program used for non-equilibrium surplus-production modeling in previous ICCAT assessments) for this task were evaluated on simulated fisheries data generated by a computer program constructed around life history characteristics of Atlantic blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans).</b> The resulting simulated population included sex, size, and age structure on a monthly basis; growth was sexually dimorphic, with females attaining larger asymptotic mean sizes; and size at age was variable.

40|$|Fishery {{management}} {{based on}} {{maximum sustainable yield}} (MSY), e. g., management at ICCAT, usually considers “yield ” as biomass rather than numbers of fish, and often uses surplus-produc-tion models, either alone or {{in conjunction with other}} models, to estimate MSY and stock status. Recent ICCAT assessments of billfishes have used a nonequilibrium, age-aggregated, logistic surplus-production model, fit using an observation-error estimator (as implemented in the ASPIC software). An assumption of such models is that indices of population abundance used in fitting are measured in the same metric, either biomass or numbers, as the catch data. Because of avail-able data, however, ICCAT billfish assessments have used indices of abundance (CPUE) in num-bers but removals in biomass. This discrepancy is expected to bias estimates of MSY and related benchmarks. The impact of the discrepancy on estimates of management benchmarks was evaluated using simulated fishery data. The simulation model for generating data was constructed around the life history characteristics of Atlantic blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans),</b> and explicitly included sex, size, and age structure on a monthly basis. Growth was sexually dimorphic, with females attaining larger asymptotic mean sizes, and size varied about mean size at age. Simulations and analyse...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the conservation {{benefits of the}} use of circle hooks compared with standard J hooks in the recreational fishery for Atlantic istiophorid billfishes, noting hooking location and the presence of trauma (bleeding) for 123 blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans),</b> 272 white marlin (Kajikia albida), and 132 sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) caught on natural baits rigged with one of the two hook types. In addition, we used pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) to follow the fate of 61 blue marlin caught on natural baits rigged with circle hooks or on a combination of artificial lure and natural bait rigged with J hooks. The frequencies of internal hooking locations and bleeding were significantly lower with circle hooks than with J hooks {{for each of the three}} species and were significantly reduced for blue marlin caught on J hooks than for white marlin and sailfish taken on the same hook type. Analysis of the data received from 59 PSATs (two tags released prematurely) indicated no mortalities among the 29 blue marlin caught on circle hooks and two mortalities among the 30 blue marlin caught on J hooks (6. 7...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of satellite tags for tracking purposes has shown success in tracking certain large pelagic species. However, the diel movements of swordfish prevent light-based geolocation from effectively locating their position. Advances in geolocation methods have allowed coordinate estimates of swordfish {{to be within}} 0. 3 ° longitude and 0. 7 ° latitude. To produce more accurate tracks of swordfish, a mathematical model was created to analyze temperature and pressure data recorded by archival tags rather than light data. This model applies empirical orthogonal function analysis to project the most probable movement between the initial location of release {{and the location of}} the tag pop-off. Data from three pop-off satellite archival tags (Microwave Telemetry) attached to swordfish and blue marlin, <b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans,</b> was used to generate daily coordinate estimations. The blue marlin data provided enough light information to create accurate geolocation estimates using the ‘TrackIt’ model. Comparison analyses of the two models results in lower root mean square error than error estimated from the most precise geolocation methods. This demonstrates an improvement in accuracy using our analysis. This study shows the feasibility of using temperature and depth data instead of light levels to allow effective tracking of swordfish...|$|E
40|$|The large {{eyes and}} {{well-developed}} visual system of billfishes suggest that vision {{is an important}} sense for the detection and interception of prey and lures. Investigations of visual abilities in these large pelagic fishes are difficult, however anatomical studies of billfish eyes and retinas allow prediction {{of a number of}} visual capabilities. From the density of ganglion cells in the blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans)</b> retina, visual acuities of less than 10 cycles per degree were derived, a surprisingly low visual resolution given the absolute size of the marlin eye. Cone photoreceptors, on the other hand, were present in high densities, resulting in a presumed summation of cones to ganglion cells at a ratio of 40 : 1, even in the area of best vision. The optical sensitivity of the marlin eye was high owing to the large dimensions of the cone photoreceptors. These results indicate that the marlin eye is specifically adapted to cope with the low light levels encountered during diving. Since the marlin is likely to use its vision at depth, it is suggested that this line of research could help estimate the limits of vertical distribution based on light level...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of {{the stock}} {{structures}} of blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans)</b> and white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus) within the Atlantic Ocean using analyses of mitochondrial (mt) DNA, single copy nuclear (scn) DNA, and microsatellite DNA are summarized. The levels of variation revealed by the different molecular methodologies varied between species and across molecular markers. In general, variation was very high for both mtDNA and the microsatellite loci. ScnDNA loci were less variable, but sufficiently polymorphic for analyses of population structure. With one excep-tion, analyses of samples from the same location taken in different years did not reveal significant heterogeneity {{for any of the}} molecular markers, and allowed us to pool temporal samples, thereby increasing the power of subsequent analyses of spatial heterogeneity. Significant heterogeneity in the distribution of allelic variants among Atlantic sampling locations of either species was not detected for any of the molecular markers. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that among-location variation was negligible within the Atlantic and that essentially all of the variance was maintained within samples. Inclusion of Pacific sampling locations for blue marlin resulted in a significant between-ocean variance component. We were not able to reject the null hypothesis of a common Atlantic-wide genetic stock for either blue marlin or white marlin based on the results o...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBlue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans)</b> {{are among}} {{many species of}} tunas and {{billfishes}} that require pelagic longline catch-effort statistics for stock assessments. Major controversies about stock status have arisen because of issues concerning habitat influences on catch rates, but models to describe how the species is distributed throughout its entire habitat are lacking. A habitat suitability model (HSM) of the size and spatial distribution of blue marlin habitat by month using habitat weighted-volume (H) is presented. It is estimated from oceanographic data partitioned by 1 ° of latitude and 1 ° of longitude in 50 layers from the surface {{to a depth of}} 1200 m using dissolved oxygen tolerances and temperature preferences compiled from electronic tagging. The physical habitat is an amorphous 3 -dimensional space whose boundaries are constantly changing with seasonal and longer-term variations in climate. Fluctuations in habitat volume likely contribute to fluctuations in CPUE that are independent of population abundance and add unrecognized uncertainty to abundance indices used to estimate population benchmarks. The results highlight the need to expand stock assessments to include seasonal and annual climatology. The HSM-based habitat weighted volume model offers a way to validate analytical methods for using longline CPUE to monitor population health...|$|E
40|$|Historically, stock {{assessments}} of Atlantic blue marlin (<b>Makaira</b> <b>nigricans)</b> and white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), conducted {{under the auspices}} of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), have been restricted to production modeling approaches. Pro-duction models are used due to the unique fisheries and biological as-pects of the species which result in a paucity of detailed information on the size or age structure of the catch. These analyses have evolved from single index equilibrium, to multiple index non-equilibrium models, as the ICCAT Enhanced Research Program for Billfish improved the Atlantic-wide data and new non-equilibrium multifishery production models be-came available. Analyses of these fisheries data have been conducted over the last two decades through a series of intersessional billfish workshops held by ICCAT, under various stock structure hypotheses, to provide esti-mates of historical relative biomass, fishing mortalities, and maximum sustainable yield. Among the difficulties in modeling stock biomass, there have been conflicting indices of abundance for several fisheries, difficul-ties in modeling the dynamics of precipitous drops in CPUE through non– age structured approaches, and typically flat solution surfaces which cause difficulty in searches for optimal, unconstrained model solutions. How-ever, in each case various assumptions were made, or certain parameter...|$|E
