The hardness of the fur enables the Gascon to tolerate cold weather better than other cows. Plus it is very thick meaning it is able to shed water well. The ease of calving is another. Unlike other cows, Gascon cows are in labor for a much shorter time period. Also, cows that have an easy time giving birth will settle to the bull more quickly which would give the <b>mother</b> <b>cow</b> a longer productive life. Another characteristic of the Gascon is that their calves get stronger and gain more weight faster than other types of cows.|$|E
