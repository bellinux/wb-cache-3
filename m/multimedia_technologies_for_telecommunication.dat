The aims of this research are to identify the readiness of using <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> teaching English in primary school and to investigate their level of acceptance towards this new way of education. The research began by distributing questionnaires to the Year 1 English teachers in primary schools located in Shah Alam.

The survey shows that there were 73. 33 % of the respondents knew about computer and able to operate it. They were familiar about the functions and {{knew how to use}} them. There were 73. 33 % of the teachers referred to computer software in order to help them to teach English. Majority of the respondents agreed to accept the <b>multimedia</b> <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> teaching based on their motivation. It indicated that 50 % of the respondents had moderate acceptance level while another 50 % stated that they were strongly agree to accept the technology and had high level of acceptance. It is also found out that the respondents who had a high acceptance level were those who referred to other software to help them in teaching English language, had attended computer courses before and also those who had their own computer. It is concluded that the teachers were ready to accept the multimedia application for teaching English.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} building network protocols for migrating mobile agents over a network. The framework allows network protocols for agent migration to be naturally implemented within mobile agents and to be constructed in a hierarchy as most data transmission protocols are. These protocols are given as mobile agents and they can transmit other mobile agents to remote hosts as first-class objects. Since they can be dynamically deployed at remote hosts by migrating the agents that carry them, these protocols can dynamically and flexibly customize network processing for agent migration {{according to the requirements}} of respective visiting agents and changes in the environments. A prototype implementation was built on a Java-based mobile agent system, and several practical protocols for agent migration were designed and implemented. The framework can make major contributions to mobile agent <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> <b>telecommunication</b> systems. ...|$|R
