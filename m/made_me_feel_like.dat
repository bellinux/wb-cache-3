500|$|The album's {{guitar and}} bass {{ensemble}} was primarily dictated by Frusciante, {{rather than a}} collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore, the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on By the Way, using tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band's subsequent studio album, Stadium Arcadium, Flea reflected on the composition of By the Way, stating: [...] "John went to this whole level of artistry. But he <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I had nothing to offer, like I knew shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Finn and Rachel's date in New York was praised, {{though not}} {{everyone}} {{was happy with}} its ending. Gonzalez liked LuPone's short guest spot, and {{hoped it would be}} [...] "a lesson to producers in how to deal with guest appearances in the future". Canning said the date had a [...] "sweet comical tone", and thought the episode was [...] "the best the series has done so far with this couple". Reiter felt Rachel was making a [...] "false" [...] choice in her refusal of Finn {{at the end of the}} date, and wondered [...] "couldn't she at least have asked him" [...] if he would consider coming to New York. At the competition performance, Poniewozik said of the end of [...] "Pretending", [...] "I may not be that invested in Finn/Rachel, but the startling moment where the audience disappeared in the middle of their kiss <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I was." [...] Benigno called the moment [...] "awesome", and VanDerWerff was also pleased.|$|E

[...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I wasn't even in the room." [...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you should do the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [...] is so hot right now”. Nevertheless, Mars used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to [...] "avoid being stereotyped".|$|E

500|$|When [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] {{was being}} showed to {{different}} [...] "music industry decision-makers", {{one of those}} individuals tried to give the song to a [...] "blue-eyed blonde" [...] artist instead of Mars, due to his race. That experience made the singer feel like a [...] "mutant", reaching his lowest point so far in his career. Mars concluded, [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like {{that are coming out}} of people's mouths. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I wasn't even in the room." [...] According to American record producer Jim Jonsin, Atlantic Records' chairman, Craig Kallman, wanted him to work on the track for Lupe Fiasco. However, Jonsin pressured Kallman to give the song to B.o.B. Lupe stated that Kallman told him his lyrics and performance on the record were [...] "wack". Lupe claimed that this repeated denigration from the label drove him to a breaking point, and to feel [...] "suicidal". Afterwards, his verses were removed and new ones were written by Mars and B.o.B. An unmixed version of the song with Fiasco's verses and Mars' vocals leaked later in the same year.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E

No album was released in 2001, but Lohan had begun recording demo tracks with Emilio Estefan, Jr.. He and his wife, Gloria Estefan, signed Lohan to a five-album production deal in September 2002. [...] "I am extremely excited to be working with Emilio. I am surrounded by a group of very talented people whom have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> part of their family," [...] Lohan said to the press. Also in September, Lohan landed the role as the daughter in Disney's remake, Freaky Friday, which required her to learn how to play the guitar and to sing. Lohan recorded a song for the film, [...] "Ultimate," [...] which was released to Radio Disney to help promote the film. The song peaked at #18 on Radio Disney's Top 30. Lohan announced that the song was separate from her singing career, since many teen idols such as Hilary Duff and Raven-Symoné were expanding their careers from acting to singing. In 2003, Lohan recorded four songs including a Radio Disney hit, [...] "Drama Queen (That Girl)," [...] that were released for the soundtrack to Lohan's film, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.|$|E

The detectives had indeed used ruses to convince {{the suspects}} to confess, with Salaam confessing to having been present only after he was told that fingerprints were found on the victim's clothing. According to Salaam, [...] "I would hear them beating up Korey Wise in the next room", and [...] "they would come and look at me and say: 'You realise you're next.'

500|$|Drake then {{contacted}} Songz, who {{had been}} working with Drake back since 2007 on mixtapes. Songz said that Drake originally called him on advice of segueing his singing into rapping on interludes, then the terms of what records he would be featured on the mixtape, as he sent him the [...] "Successful" [...] track. After Drake still could not settle on the direction for the track, Songz came up with the his hook. He explained to MTV News, [...] "The first thing that came to mind was 'I want the money, money and the cars/ Cars and the clothes/ The ho's/ I suppose I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful.' When I'm saying all that, conceptually for me, the deepest part of the record was when I say, 'I suppose.' I supposed that's what success is about. That's what [...] led to believe." [...] After hearing the hook, Drake called it [...] "powerful", commenting, [...] "And it's like, it's almost like it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it may not be right what I want, you know? All these things, it's like it made me feel young. It kind of made me feel ignorant to the game. But it was an exciting record even though the tempo is slow. That's what I want... The 'I suppose' moment in there is like, it's almost like you're doubting yourself for a second. But {{at the end of the}} day, I just want to be successful. So that's what the record meant to me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the recording of their fourth album, as the group was taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Sessions proved to {{be difficult for the}} band as Wentz started taking LSD when Zach Blair lead guitarist for Rise Against made him try it at a party in April 2008. The goal in Wentz using LSD was to hope it would influence his songwriting, but it just made him distracted from writing songs, which annoyed Stump, so he stopped using LSD in August 2008. Wentz later said he had taken LSD over 50 times. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, Trohman felt he and Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff I was reading. It's hard to hear, 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie à Deux. [...] "It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I owned the songs a lot more. It made me really excited about contributing to Fall Out Boy and made me find my role in the band," [...] Trohman recalled.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
30|$|Some {{participants}} (girls n =  4; boys n =  3) also {{explained that}} {{the condition of the}} uniform made them <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> outsiders. They felt that the coaches or teachers issued the newer uniforms to the skinnier children and the older, more worn uniforms to the overweight children. Michelle said, “It’s not fair because the skinny ones they get new ones and the chubby ones get the old ones”. Darren had a similar experience and explained, “Yeah it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> not <b>like</b> everybody else. Since they are better they get the newer, better uniforms”. Presley described a similar situation where her uniform was not older, but different than the other kids: “Yeah there’s about three of us, me and two other people. They did not have our size so we’d have to go and get the green ones”. The process of having to obtain the uniform in a different location made her feel different than the other kids in a negative way.|$|R

500|$|The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff {{gave it a}} [...] "B", {{and wrote}} that he [...] "finally got a sense that, yes, this second season has been {{building}} toward something and {{has been trying to}} tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I could say I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet". He continued: [...] "The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E
5000|$|Xero {{played their}} first shows as a band on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, {{with the first}} one taking place on November 14, 1997 at the Whisky A Go Go, playing before SX-10 and System Of A Down. Mike said, [...] "I {{remember}} that gig. I was wearing the most ridiculous thing ever. I had this white beanie hat on with blue goggles and white gloves, I think because it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> more <b>like</b> a performer and not the normal dude that I knew I was. So I had to get into costume {{in order to get}} psyched up and get into character. We were awful, just horrible but we survived."The club was packed with A&R scouts that had all fled by the third song. Jeff Blue said, [...] "The place was empty. You could hear crickets." [...] However, he saw that the group had potential but were pretty far from actually [...] "making it", so he gave them a development deal with a little financial support from Zomba Music Group. With the help of a publishing company, the self-managed band was able to buy new instruments and equipment, get a decent recording and a better show.|$|R
60|$|Cats {{have the}} credit of being more worldly wise than dogs--of looking more after their own {{interests}} and being less blindly devoted to those of their friends. And we {{men and women are}} naturally shocked at such selfishness. Cats certainly do love a family that has a carpet in the kitchen more than a family that has not; and if there are many children about, they prefer to spend their leisure time next door. But, taken altogether, cats are libeled. Make a friend of one, and she will stick to you through thick and thin. All the cats that I have had have been most firm comrades. I had a cat once that used to follow me about everywhere, until it even got quite embarrassing, and I had to beg her, as a personal favor, not to accompany me any further down the High Street.

[...] cameo is just one more pleasant surprise on an album full of them." [...] Brandon Soderberg from The Village Voice was also impressed with the artistic creation. He said [...] "Once you hear Pariss mish-mash (Diddy’s word) of sounds, all that producer-genius experimentalism makes some sense. Every song is full of swift change-ups and jarring musical detours; Diddy often interrupts these jagged dance tracks to emote... It’s lots of fun, and though confessional in parts, it’s overall far from the self-serious, petulant complaint-raps of say, Drake or Kanye. Paris looks back to dance music as soulful catharsis and emotionalism, not the cold thump that’s taken over as of late." [...] Nitsuh Abebe from New York magazine said [...] "Last Train to Paris {{is one of the first}} records that's really <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> [...] sounds clever. [...] makes what seems to me to be an aesthetic error, which is that if you want to put sleek, rainy-sounding synths everywhere ... this album hits its mood right, though — gray skies, Eurorail, and drama — it's excellent stuff. The hectic format fades away, and the music actually becomes the hypnotic cruise it aspires to be." ...|$|E

There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement."

40|$|Thank you, I feel so {{much more}} like a person now,' I told the ICU nurse after the morning bathing. The words came out spontaneously, and she was startled. What <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> 'more <b>like</b> a person' {{at a time when}} my life was at risk, and I was tied to {{machines}} and entirely dependen on others' care? If becoming a patient entails the experience of vulnerability and ultimately the exposure to one's mortality, how does a patient remain a person in the midst of acute illness? Can a patien remain a person if she is regarded primarily as a mal-functioning body and/or mind? To what extent is the patient's self-perception shaped by others' perceptions of her? Can she contribute to the reshaping of those that prove harmful? By arguing for the need to listen to the patient's 'biological and biographical stories' in the interest of good clinical practices, John Launer pinpoints the limitations of a biomedical approach that splits the body from the person, and argues for the need to reconnect biologu and biography within the therapeutic relation. Yet, {{one of the most striking}} conclusions of Robert Klitzman's study on doctors who became patients is the stigmatisation of patienthood among the medical profession. Not only did doctor-patients feel diminished as patients and experienced the dissociation between body and person, but they also complained of the split between body and person thus seems to find a correlate in the physician's split between the professional and the personal, and both may be symptomatic of pervasive cultural practices. This chapter considers the intra- and interpersonal processes whereby the patient seeks to remain a person, and the extent to which this may be facilitated by nurturing therapeutic relationships. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
