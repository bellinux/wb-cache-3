500|$|Episodic Falling causes [...] "exercise-induced {{paroxysmal}} hypertonicity" [...] {{meaning that}} there is increased muscle tone in the dog and the muscles cannot relax. Previously {{thought to be a}} <b>muscular</b> <b>disorder,</b> it is now known to be neurological. EF is caused by a single recessive gene, and a genetic test is available. Except for severe cases, episodes will be in response to exercise, excitement or similar exertions. Although EF is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy, which typically results in loss of consciousness, the dog remains conscious throughout the episode. Severity of symptoms can range from mild, occasional falling to freezing to seizure-like episodes lasting hours. Episodes can become more or less severe as the dog gets older and there is no standard pattern to the attacks. The onset of symptoms usually occurs when a dog is between 4 months and 4 years of age. It is similar to Scotty Cramp, a genetic disorder in Scottish Terriers. About 1% of Cavaliers are affected by the condition, with 19% being carriers. Dogs with whole coloured coats {{were more likely to be}} affected than dogs with parti-coloured coats.|$|E

40|$|Eukaryotic {{cells from}} yeast to human {{primarily}} use two distinct major mechanism for intracellular degradation/recycling system: the autophagy and proteasome. Autophagy {{contributes to the}} turnover of cellular components by delivering portions of the cytoplasm and organelles to lysosomes, where they are digested. Moreover, autophagy is involved in programmed cell death (PCD) and is called type II PCD, which differs from apoptosis (type I PCD). By mostly morphological studies, autophagy {{has been linked to}} disease processes: cancer, liver diseases, neurodegeneration, <b>muscular</b> <b>disorders,</b> and so on. Actually, lysosomes or autophagic vacuoles are morphologically unremarkable in normal muscle.

50|$|A test of {{strength}} {{is often used}} during a diagnosis of a <b>muscular</b> <b>disorder</b> before the etiology can be identified.

True weakness is substantial, while perceived rather is a sensation of having to put more effort to do the same task. On the other hand, various topic locations for muscle weakness are central, neural and peripheral. Central muscle weakness is an overall exhaustion of the whole body, while peripheral weakness is an exhaustion of individual muscles. Neural weakness is somewhere between.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the diagnostic criteria for <b>muscular</b> <b>disorders</b> in tension-type headache, pericranial muscle tenderness and pressure pain thresholds were studied in a random sample population of 735 adults aged 25 - 64. In addition, quantitative EMGs were recorded in 547 of these subjects. The correlation between the three diagnostic tests was assessed and the discriminality and cut-off points were analysed using Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis. Local tenderness from the temporal muscles was {{closely related to the}} total tenderness scores from 14 pairs of muscles. In chronic tension-type headache, tenderness was positively related to EMG and inversely related to pain thresholds. In the episodic form the total tenderness score was inversely related to pain thresholds, whereas no significant relation to EMG was noted. The Receiver Operating Characteristics curves indicated that tenderness recorded by manual palpation was the most specific and sensitive test, whereas EMG and pain thresholds were of limited diagnostic value. Eighty-seven percent of subjects with the chronic, and 66 % of subjects with the episodic form were found to have a “muscular disorder ” defined as increased tenderness recorded by either manual palpation or pressure algometry and/or increased EMG levels. However, muscle tenderness increased significantly during pain, so the headache state should be considered in future studies.

40|$|Autophagy is a catabolic {{process of}} the {{degradation}} of cellular components by lysosomal enzymes. It is essential for cellular homeostasis by maintaining thebalance between the synthesis, degradation and turnover of intraceliular constituents. Its primary role is cytoprotective. It protects the cells against the accumulation of damaged organelles or protein aggregates and it ensures cell survival in extreme conditions like during starvation or oxidative stres. Three major forms of autophagy are known: chaperone-rriediated autophagy, rnicroautophagy and macroautophagy. In macroautophagy, long-lived proteins, organels and even specific nuclear"regions could be eliminated. In this paper, macroautophagy is mostly in focus. Many human diseases like <b>muscular</b> <b>disorders</b> and neurodegenerative disorders appear {{as a consequence of}} autophagic malfunctioning. Excessive autophagy is celi-destructive and could lead even into autophagic (type II) programmed cell death. Autophagy participates also in celi defense against infectious disease. Autophagy has special role in cancer, where activated or inactivated benefit tumoral cells in different stages of cancer. New discoveries about mechani sms and regulation of autophagy would enable scientists to develop in future new methods for manipulating the activity of the autophagic path way as new therapeutic tools against some diseases, particularly <b>muscular</b> <b>disorders,</b> neurodegenerative disorders and cancer...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{neurological}} and <b>muscular</b> <b>disorders</b> {{are characterized by}} the accumulation of aggregate-prone proteins and {{are referred to as}} protein deposit or protein conformation diseases. Besides some sporadic forms, most of them are genetically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although recessive forms also exist. Although genetically very heterogeneous, some of these diseases are the result of mutations in some members of the mammalian small heat shock protein family (sHSP/HSPB), which are key players of the protein quality control system and participate, together with other molecular chaperones and co-chaperones, in the maintenance of protein homeostasis. Thus, on one hand upregulation of specific members of the HSPB family can exert protective effects in protein deposit diseases, such as the polyglutamine diseases. On the other hand, mutations in the HSPBs lead to neurological and <b>muscular</b> <b>disorders,</b> which may be due to a loss-of-function in protein quality control and/or to a gain-of-toxic function, resulting from the aggregation-proneness of the mutants. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about some of the best characterized functions of the HSPBs (e. g. role in cytoskeleton stabilization, chaperone function, anti-aggregation and anti-apoptotic activities), also highlighting differences in the properties of the various HSPBs and how these may counteract protein aggregation diseases. We also describe the mutations in the various HSPBs associated with neurological and <b>muscular</b> <b>disorders</b> and we discuss how gain-of-toxic function mechanisms (e. g. due to the mutated HSPB protein instability and aggregation) and/or loss-of-function mechanisms can contribute to HSPB-associated pathologies.

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} {{influence of}} variables gender, diagnosis {{and severity of}} types of Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) {{on the quality of}} life of the individual. METHODS: The sample consisted of one hundred one individuals seeking TMD treatment at the Faculdade de Odontologia/ Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora. The TMD diagnosis was done through the RDC/TMD: Axis I (Research Diagnostic Criteria/Temporomandibular Disorder). The severity of TMD was established by the Temporomandibular Index (TMI) and the impact on quality of life by the OHIP- 14 (Oral Health Impact Profile). The data was tabulated and analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test, T student test and Spearman correlation analysis (α= 0, 05). RESULTS: Most patients had diagnosis of <b>muscular</b> <b>disorder,</b> followed by diagnoses of arthralgia and disk displacement, respectively. All patients had a negative impact on at least one question from OHIP- 14. CONCLUSIONS: Women presented worse quality of life when compared to men. The presence of <b>muscular</b> <b>disorder</b> was related to greater impact on quality of life (p< 0, 05).
