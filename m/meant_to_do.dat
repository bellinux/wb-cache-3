[...] Cubitt {{went on to say that}} [...] "mine did everything that the Microsoft one is <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons". The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at Brunel University. In an interview with The Inquirer, he noted [...] "As it was designed at the university, they own the partial rights to the product so they will be watching the Microsoft 'invention' very closely." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} redone by the Will & Grace cast as [...] "He's Hot" [...] for the sitcom's soundtrack in 2004 and even {{includes}} vocal samples from Madonna herself. Almost {{all of the}} instrumental part of the song [...] "He's Hot!" [...] uses samples from the original song. The Canadian teen drama , which is known for naming each episode after an 80s hit song, named a two-part episode after [...] "Holiday". In 2006, critics noted strong similarity between [...] "Holiday" [...] and American singer Jessica Simpson's single [...] "A Public Affair". When criticized for its unoriginality, Simpson told MTV: [...] "I think people are ready to hear something that Madonna used to do. We all need to hear that every now and again. It wasn't a sample or something I <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but she did influence me and still does today." [...] In 2008, [...] "Holiday" [...] appeared on the video game [...] Kelis often performs a mash-up of her own hit [...] "Milkshake" [...] with [...] "Holiday" [...] live.

A writer of Black Entertainment Television noted, [...] "She dazzled fans {{with an assortment}} of high-energy performances of her upbeat hits like... 'Run the World (Girls).'" [...] Caryn Ganz of Spin magazine praised the [...] "swaggy" [...] march, while Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote that Beyoncé's choreography during the performance of [...] "Run the World", [...] "is <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same: a series of sensual quickstep moves that revolve around the hips and legs." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times mentioned the song in the [...] "almost continuous high point" [...] of the concert. The song also acted as the opening number of her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. After a video intro of Beyoncé imitating Mary Antoinette, Beyoncé rises from beneath the stage along with sparks and flames, leading into the opening performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)". The song was part of the set list of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's co-headlining On the Run Tour (2014).|$|E

500|$|Heywood {{opened his}} defence on 17 September {{with a long}} {{prepared}} statement read {{by one of his}} lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to [...] "appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent. First, Heywood pleaded his [...] "extreme youth and inexperience" [...] as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that [...] "...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears." [...] Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard Bounty: Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured [...] "by the least addition to their Number". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: [...] "...on hearing it suggested that I should be deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, I went down directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which at that time I <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but was afterwards prevented." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Crowley, every {{individual}} has a True Will, to {{be distinguished from}} the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one's [...] "calling" [...] or [...] "purpose" [...] in life. Some later magicians have taken this to include the goal of attaining self-realization by one's own efforts, {{without the aid of}} God or other divine authority. This brings them close to the position that Crowley held just prior to 1904. [...] Others follow later works such as Liber II, saying that one's own will in pure form is nothing other than the divine will. [...] Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law for Crowley refers not to hedonism, fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting in response to that calling. [...] The Thelemite is a mystic. [...] According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them. [...] In order for the individual to be able to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning. [...] Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a daimon unique to each individual. [...] The spiritual quest to find what you are <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and do it is also known in Thelema as the Great Work.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E

2500|$|In early 1996 Skunkhour {{embarked}} on a 10-week tour of Europe. However, by March they had written only one new song for their third album, which bothered Aya: [...] "I was saying to Del that we've really got to get going on this new stuff. We might lose momentum if we don't keep creating. So I [...] 'What have you got, man?' And he said, 'Mate, I've got nothing'. He'd been saying {{for a couple of}} years that he wasn't sure this is what he was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He didn't feel like a rapper any more. He didn't feel like a lyricist any more. He wanted to go back to his artwork, which is his first love. I said, 'I understand. You should leave the band'". Del completed the tour, then quit to become an in-house artist at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Australia. Aya told Dino Scatena of The Daily Telegraph that [...] "What was best for him was best for us because his malaise might permeate the band and I would much rather he leave and we be strong and revitalised rather than try to perpetuate an old chemistry that wasn't working".|$|E
2500|$|Zeus {{starts the}} fight by {{knocking}} Atom down with its first punch, but Atom gets up, and Zeus continues its assault, knocking Atom down multiple times, {{but each time}} Atom gets back up, and eventually is able to land his first punch, a right uppercut. Atom survives the first round, stunning the audience. Ricky, who had made a bet {{with a friend of}} Charlie's of $100,000 that Atom would not last the round, tries to slip away, but is cornered by the fight's bookmakers. The two opponents go back and forth through the fight, Atom landing multiple punches but also getting knocked down many times, getting back up for each of them. Late in the fourth round, Atom's vocal-respond controls are damaged, forcing Charlie to use its [...] "shadow function" [...] to make it mimic his boxing skills. This, and the fact that Zeus starts running out of power from its constant offense, tip the odds in Atom's favor, forcing Zeus' programmer to manually control it. Zeus is given a sound beating, once even hitting the ground and barely avoiding losing by knockout, and Max and Bailey both watch Charlie doing what he was <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and are touched by seeing him literally fighting for his son. Despite the continued beating, Zeus manages to survive the final round and wins the match by the decision of the judges. Zeus remains [...] "undefeated", but with the shame that it only avoided the loss by the decision, and Atom is labelled the [...] "People's Champion".|$|E
