50|$|Many Old World salami {{are named}} after their region or country of origin—such as Arles, Genoa, Hungarian, and <b>Milano</b> <b>salami.</b> Many are flavored with garlic. Some types—including some {{varieties}} from Spain (salchichón), Hungary (pick salami), and Italy (such as Neapolitan varieties {{that led to}} American pepperoni) include paprika or chili powder. Varieties also differ by coarseness or fineness of the chopped meat and size and style of the casing.|$|E
5000|$|Salami is a raw-fermented sausage {{consisting}} of raw comminuted pork and/or beef meat, fat, and additives, such as curing salt, spices, sugar, and a starter culture. There are multiple {{different types of}} Salami meat in various markets around the world. In northern and central Europe, smoked salamis are preferred, and ripening {{is controlled by the}} addition of lactic acid-producing starter cultures, whereas in southern Europe, salami is slowly air-dried and mostly mold-ripened. Therefore, different preservation and drying methods are used around the world to prepare salami. Hungarian-type salami is a specialty in salami production, because it is first slightly smoked and mold-ripened afterward. The salami that is of Hungarian origin, the so-called [...] "Hungarian Winter salami", is made of raw pork, bacon, salt, spices, sugars, and sodium nitrite. Szegedi téliszalámi (winter salami) is made of mangalitsa pork breed, with horse large intestine used as its casing to preserve and serve it. This type acquires a grey mold cover on it and has a firm texture and excellent keeping quality after a 30% weight loss reached in 3 to 4 months. [...] Hungarian salami is one of the world's two trade names for salami, <b>Milano</b> <b>salami</b> being the other. These fermented sausages combine smoke and mold application in one. The traditional technology used to produce them is based on the Italian pre-drying technique developed during the nineteenth century, but they are smoked and their pH does not drop below 5.5, so the final flavor of the product is not acidic.|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of native starter cultures on the microbiological, physicochemical and sensorial characteristics of <b>Milano</b> <b>salami</b> type was studied. Two batches of <b>Milano</b> <b>salami</b> type were produced: Batch A, {{with the addition of}} Staphylococcus xylosus U 5 and Batch B (control) without the starter culture. The <b>Milano</b> <b>salami</b> type was characterized by an important microbial activity of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) that resulted in substantial growth in Batch A during the ripening with an initial count of 7. 60 log cfu. g- 1 and reached 9. 84 log CFU. g- 1 after 14 days. Bacterial enzymes that showed efficient activity under the conditions found in <b>Milano</b> <b>salami</b> type were catalase, nitrite and nitrate reductase, contributing for sensory and physicochemical properties of the product. There {{were no significant differences in}} general free fatty acids composition among the batches, while the color parameters (L *, a * and b *) in the Batch A presented significantly higher values in relation to Batch B.

2500|$|Season-related {{pastries}} include chiacchiere (flat fritters {{dusted with}} sugar) and tortelli (fried spherical cookies) for Carnival, colomba (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for Easter, pane dei morti ("bread of the (Day of the [...] ) Dead", cookies flavoured with cinnamon) for All Souls' Day and panettone for Christmas. The salame <b>Milano,</b> a <b>salami</b> {{with a very}} fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy. Renowned Milanese cheeses are gorgonzola (from the namesake village nearby), mascarpone, used in pastry-making, taleggio and quartirolo.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{most cities}} in Italy, Milan and its {{surrounding}} area has its own regional cuisine, which, as it is typical for Lombard cuisines, uses more frequently rice than pasta, and features almost no tomato. Milanese cuisine includes [...] "cotoletta alla milanese", a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (which some claim to be of Austrian origin, as it is similar to Viennese [...] "Wienerschnitzel", while others claim that the [...] "Wienerschnitzel" [...] derived from the [...] "cotoletta alla milanese"). Other typical dishes are cassoeula (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with Savoy cabbage), ossobuco (stewed veal shank with a sauce called gremolata), risotto alla milanese (with saffron and beef marrow), busecca (stewed tripe with beans), and brasato (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes). Season-related pastries include chiacchiere (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and tortelli (fried spherical cookies) for Carnival, colomba (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for Easter, pane dei morti ("Deads' Day bread", cookies aromatized with cinnamon) for All Soul's Day and panettone for Christmas. The salame <b>milano,</b> a <b>salami</b> with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy. The best known Milanese cheese is gorgonzola from the namesake town nearby, although today the major gorgonzola producers operate in Piedmont.|$|R

A análise da influência de culturas iniciadoras nativas nas características microbiológicas, físicoquímicas e sensoriais de salame tipo Milano foi o objeto deste estudo. Foram produzidos dois grupos de salame tipo Milano: Grupo A - com aplicação de linhagem Staphylococcus xylosus U 5 enquanto o controle, Grupo B, foi produzido sem culturas iniciadoras. O salame tipo Milano foi caracterizado pela importante atividade microbiana de estafilococos coagulase negativo (SCN), que resultou significativo crescimento no Grupo A durante a maturação, com contagem inicial de 7, 60 ufc. g- 1 e alcançando um crescimento de 9, 84 cfu. g- 1 depois de 14 dias. As enzimas bacterianas que mostraram eficiente atividade sob as condições encontradas no salame tipo Milano foram catalase, nitrito e nitrato redutase, contribuindo para as propriedades físicoquímicas e sensoriais do produto. Não houve diferenças significativas na composição geral dos ácidos graxos livres entre as amostras, enquanto os parâmetros de cor (L*, a* e b*) obtidos no salame inoculado (Grupo A) diferiram significativamente em relação ao controle (Grupo B) e foi o grupo preferido pelos degustadores...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between extracted volatiles of <b>Milano</b> <b>salami,</b> {{one of the}} main dry-cured sausages produced in Italy, and their olfactory properties was studied. Volatile compounds were extracted by a purge-and-trap method, quantified using a flame ionization detector and identified by mass spectrometry.
