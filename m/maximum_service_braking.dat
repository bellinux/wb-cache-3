50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> concurrently with the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes,</b> resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers.

50|$|With a <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{relay valve}} installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers, and quickly applies the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes.</b> The pressure delivered to the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers.|$|R

50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|R

50|$|Unlike the original, the new {{funicular}} {{used two}} separate haulage systems (one for each car), {{with the two}} systems connected to each other, the drive motor, and the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> by a gear train; it was the failure of this gear train that was the immediate cause of the accident since it effectively disconnected Sinai both from Olivet’s balancing load and from the <b>service</b> <b>brake.</b> There were emergency brakes that acted {{on the rim of}} each haulage drum, but due to inadequate maintenance, the emergency brakes for both cars were inoperative, which left Sinai without any brakes once its physical connection to the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> was lost. Contrary to what might be expected, the new funicular was constructed with neither safety cable nor track brakes, either of which would have prevented the accident; the NTSB was unable to identify another funicular worldwide that operated without either of these safety features.|$|R

25|$|In normal {{operation}} for locomotive/carriage trains, on descending and level running, {{the train is}} normally <b>braked</b> (<b>service</b> <b>braking)</b> using the locomotive. This uses compression braking – the energy is absorbed by using the cylinders as pumps, then dumping the pressure, similar to a Jake brake – on steam locomotives, hydraulic braking on the diesel locomotives. The diesel-electric railcars were <b>service</b> <b>braked</b> using hydraulic brakes and dynamic braking, during which power was dissipated in roof-mounted resistors, creating a distinct heat shimmer when the vehicles were descending and shortly afterwards. The hand brakes are used to bring a train to a complete stand from low speed, and as a parking brake.|$|R
50|$|The <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{consists}} of hydraulically operated drum brakes, which are same size {{on the front}} and the rear axle. Initially a dual-circuit system with vacuum servo was optional; later servo became standard. The handbrake works mechanically.|$|R
50|$|Brakes were {{air over}} {{hydraulic}} with drum brakes on all wheels. Air brake connections at the rear were used for trailer brakes. The M815, M818, and M819 had separate controls to apply the trailer brakes separately from the <b>service</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} control the trailer <b>service</b> <b>brakes,</b> the merged outputs (i.e., merged via 2 two-way check valves {{connected}} in-series to give three inputs) of the foot-valve and trailer-hand-valve (if applicable) are directed through the tractor-protection valve, and onward towards the trailer relay valve via the blue service line. In tractors that are not equipped with a trailer hand valve, only the merged outputs of the foot-valve (i.e., via a single two-way check valve) are directed towards the trailer relay valve; however, {{the fact that the}} foot-valve's delivery-port outputs are still merged enables the trailer's <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> to still be controlled even if there is failure within one braking circuit of the tractor.|$|R

50|$|A {{spring brake}} relay valve {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> relay valve, although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|R

The coverage level {{for a given}} configuration represents the percentage of users {{that are not in}} outage for this configuration. Finally, the <b>maximum</b> <b>service</b> data rate is defined as the higher data rate that presents a coverage value greater than 95 %. Both coverage level and <b>maximum</b> <b>service</b> data rate are computed for each metric.|$|R
