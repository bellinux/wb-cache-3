500|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured from aluminium or steel alloys, and are normally fitted {{with one of}} two common types of cylinder valve for filling and connection to the regulator. Other accessories such as manifolds, cylinder bands, protective nets and boots and carrying handles may be provided. Various configurations of harness {{may be used to}} carry the cylinder or cylinders while diving, depending on the application. Cylinders used for scuba typically have an internal volume (known as water capacity) of between [...] and a <b>maximum</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> rating from [...] Cylinders are also available in smaller sizes, such as 0.5, 1.5 and 2 litres, however these are often used for purposes such as inflation of surface marker buoys, drysuits and buoyancy compensators rather than breathing. Scuba divers may dive with a single cylinder, a pair of similar cylinders, or a main cylinder and a smaller [...] "pony" [...] cylinder, carried on the diver's back or clipped onto the harness at the sides. Paired cylinders may be manifolded together or independent. In some cases, more that two cylinders are needed.|$|E

SILs allow access to a live subsea well without the requirement of a Blow Out Preventer stack or a marine riser. The deployment of a SIL from a dynamically positioned multi-service vessel (MSV) is significantly less expensive than using a traditional drilling rig for intervention operations.

40|$|Abstract. Through {{changing}} <b>working</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{the crushing}} tests of bauxite {{were made by}} using laboratory high pressure grinding roller. The results indicated that, with <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> increased, high pressure grinding roller capacity first increased and then decreased. High pressure grinding roller capacity reached <b>maximum</b> when <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> was 9 MPa, and reduced deeply and then gradually slowed down when <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> was more than 11 MPa. The particle size of bauxite crushing product P 80 gradually reduced when <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> increased from 7 MPa to 15 MPa, and gradually increased when <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> was more than 15 MPa. The <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of 11 MPa was appropriate when bauxite crushed by laboratory high pressure grinding roller...|$|R
50|$|A {{separator}} handling corrosive fluid {{should be}} checked periodically {{to determine whether}} remedial work is required. Extreme cases of corrosion may require {{a reduction in the}} rated <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of the vessel. Periodic hydrostatic testing is recommended, especially if the fluids being handled are corrosive. Expendable anode can be used in separators to protect them against electrolytic corrosion. Some operators determine separator shell and head thickness with ultrasonic thickness indicators and calculate the <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> from the remaining metal thickness. This should be done yearly offshore and every two to four years onshore.|$|R
2500|$|The steam {{generated}} in the boiler fills the space above {{the water in the}} partially filled boiler. Its <b>maximum</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> is limited by spring-loaded safety valves. It is then collected either in a perforated tube fitted above the water level or by a dome that often houses the regulator valve, or throttle, the purpose of which is to control the amount of steam leaving the boiler. The steam then either travels directly along and down a steam pipe to the engine unit or may first pass into the wet header of a superheater, the role of the latter being to improve thermal efficiency and eliminate water droplets suspended in the [...] "saturated steam", the state in which it leaves the boiler. On leaving the superheater, the steam exits the dry header of the superheater and passes down a steam pipe, entering the steam chests adjacent to the cylinders of a reciprocating engine. Inside each steam chest is a sliding valve that distributes the steam via ports that connect the steam chest {{to the ends of the}} cylinder space. The role of the valves is twofold: admission of each fresh dose of steam, and exhaust of the used steam once it has done its work.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the resting and <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> associated to a restrain mechanism, in patients suffering from lymphedema of the upper limbs, postbreast cancer treatment, whilst performing occupational and day-to-day self-care activities. Six female patients under treatment of lymphedema due to surgical, radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic treatment of breast cancer, in the age group between 32 and 76 years (mean 54 years old, ± 31. 11) were selected. A compression sleeve of “gorgurão” (cotton-polyester material) was applied as a restrain mechanism. The occupational and daily personal care activities evaluated were those common to all participants. These activities included washingup, cooking in a small pan, sweeping the floor using the affected arm, brushing the teeth, brushing the hair, washing small items of clothes, ironing clothes and making the bed. For statistical analysis, mean and standard deviation between resting pressures and minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> were determined. The two-tailed student t-test and variance analysis were used for repeated measurements. The Bonferroni limit was used in the analysis of the variables to calculate the alpha error, with a value of 5 %, considered statistically significant. All of the analyzed activities associated to the “gorgurão” compression sleeve generated both resting and <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> (p < 0. 005). In conclusion, the occupational daily life tasks used in the present study generate resting and <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> and can be used as a form of treatment of the lymphedema...|$|R
50|$|Buried high {{pressure}} {{oil and gas}} pipelines are tested for strength by pressurising them to at least 125% of their <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> (MAWP) at any point along their length. Since many long distance transmission pipelines are designed to have a steel hoop stress of 80% of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) at Maximum allowable operating pressure MAOP, {{this means that the}} steel is stressed to SMYS and above during the testing, and test sections must be selected to ensure that excessive plastic deformation does not occur.|$|R

The test fire was a complete success and the 611 blew her Hancock three-chime long-bell whistle {{for the first time}} in 20 years. However, 611 did not run sporting her original whistle in 2015 due to a disagreement between the whistle's owner and the FireUp611 committee. An original Hancock three chime long bell whistle was procured and installed for the 2016 and subsequent seasons to the delight of 611's fans.|$|R
50|$|Surge {{control is}} the use of {{different}} techniques and equipment in a hydraulic system to prevent any excessive gain in pressure (also known as a pressure surge) that would cause the hydraulic process pressure to exceed the <b>maximum</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of the mechanical equipment used in the system.|$|E

40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the pressure relief devices. The most critical characteristics of a pressure relief device are its set pressure and the related relieving capacity. The Set Pressure of a pressure relief device is defined as that value of increasing inlet static pressure at which the discharge becomes continuous (ASME PTC 25 - 1994, Performance Test Codes). To preclude an unsafe overpressure situation, the set pressure of the pressure relief device must not exceed the <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of the equipment or system being protected. Because of testing facility limitations, size or pressure, pressure relief valves intended for elevated temperature service are often set using ambient temperature air. Adjustments are made to the ambient valve opening pressures {{to compensate for the}} temperature differences. The extent of the adjustments to the pressure relief valve set pressure is important to ensure the valve will provide the required overpressure protection at the elevated in-service temperature...|$|R

50|$|The ANSTI Breathing Simulator {{is rated}} to a <b>maximum</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of 100 msw.

It has adjustable tidal volume and breathing rate settings which can providing ventilation rates from 10 to 180 litres per minute.|$|E
50|$|An {{exhaust brake}} is a valve which {{essentially}} creates a back-pressure in the exhaust system, which applies enough force onto the engine's pistons {{to slow the}} engine. In most cases, an exhaust brake is so effective that it can slow a heavily-loaded vehicle on a downgrade without ever applying the vehicle’s service brakes. Under these conditions, the exhaust flow from the cylinders is bottlenecked and rapidly builds pressure in the exhaust system upstream from the exhaust brake. Depending on engine speed, this pressure can easily reach up to 60 PSI <b>maximum</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure.</b> <b>Maximum</b> <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> is limited {{as part of the}} design of an exhaust brake. In this example, that same 60 PSI also remains in the cylinder for the entire exhaust stroke (exhaust valve open) and exerts 60 PSI on the piston top to resist its upward movement. The produces a negative torque, slowing the engine for a braking effect. Thus, simply restricting the exhaust flow can generate substantial braking.|$|E
40|$|The D 0 {{instrument}} air system for cryo controls has an emergency backup supply of nitrogen gas. The backup system {{consists of a}} high pressure tube trailer (38 tubes - 2400 psig MAWP), piping, valves, regulators and pressure monitoring instrumentation. The trailer is located south of DAB alongside the LN{sub 2 } Dewar. Fixed piping ties to the trailer with a flex-hose. The piping follows the cryo piping bridge entering the south wall of DAB. where it passes through the pipe chase and into the cryo pump room (Rm 315). The high pressure gas is regulated down to 90 psig before tying into the compressor supplied {{instrument air}} system. Check valves are installed at the tee for the primary air and the backup N{sub 2 }. Normal operating pressure for instrument air is 100 - 120 psig. With the backup supply pressure set to 90 psig, 'emergency air' is supplied whenever primary air pressure falls below 90 psig. There are two additional, outside connections to the system: one is a connection for repumping the trailer after a minimum backup volume is reached {{and the other is}} an auxiliary flex-hose connection for another trailer. All manual valves at system connections will be locked closed when not in use. The system's <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> (MAWP) is 2400 psi, which is the trailer MAWP. All piping and components have a minimum 2400 psi <b>working</b> <b>pressure.</b> Actual component <b>working</b> <b>pressures</b> are included in the component list...|$|R
50|$|Maximum {{allowable}} {{operating pressure}} or MAOP {{refers to the}} wall strength of a pressurized cylinder such as a pipeline or storage tank and how much pressure the walls may safely hold in normal operation. The MAOP {{is less than the}} MAWP (<b>maximum</b> allowable <b>working</b> <b>pressure).</b> MAWP being the maximum pressure based on the design codes that the weakest component of a pressure vessel can handle. Commonly standard wall thickness components are used in fabricating pressurized equipment, and hence are able to withstand pressures above their design pressure. Design pressure is the maximum pressure a pressurized item can be exposed to. Due to the availability of standard wall thickness materials, many components will have a MAWP higher than the required design pressure. Relief valves are set at the design pressure of the pressurized item and sized to prevent the item under pressure from being over-pressurized. Depending on the design code that the pressurized item is designed, an over-pressure allowance can be used when sizing the relief valve. This is +10% for PD 5500, and ASME Section VIII div 1 & 2 (with an additional +10% allowance in ASME Section VIII for a fire relief case). ASME have different criteria for steam boilers.|$|R
5|$|Cylinder <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{specified}} at {{a reference}} temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified <b>maximum</b> safe <b>working</b> temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} burning {{characteristics of}} a laminar flame comprise the fuel vapour pressure, the laminar burning velocity, ignition delay times, Markstein numbers for strain rate and curvature, the stretch rates for the onset of flame instabilities and of flame extinction for different mixtures. With the exception of ignition delay times, measurements of these are reported and discussed for ethanol–air mixtures. The measurements were in a spherical explosion bomb, with central ignition, in the regime of a developed stable, flame between that of an under or over-driven ignition and that of an unstable flame. Pressures ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 4 MPa, temperatures from 300 to 393 K, and equivalence ratios were between 0. 7 and 1. 5. It was important to ensure the relatively large volume of ethanol in rich mixtures at high pressures was fully evaporated. The maximum pressure for the measurements was the highest compatible with the <b>maximum</b> safe <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> of the bomb. Many of the flames soon became unstable, due to Darrieus–Landau and thermo-diffusive instabilities. This effect increased with pressure and the flame wrinkling arising from the instabilities enhanced the flame speed. Both the critical Peclet number and the, more rational, associated critical Karlovitz stretch factor were evaluated {{at the onset of}} the instability. With increasing pressure, the onset of flame instability occurred earlier. The measured values of burning velocity are expressed in terms of their variations with temperature and pressure, and these are compared with those obtained by other researchers. Some comparisons are made with the corresponding properties for iso-octane–air mixtures...|$|R
40|$|These {{internal}} coils {{are used}} to condense and cool the gaseous argon contained in the LAr storage dewar at D 0, at a rate not to exceed 40 KW. The coolant is LN{sub 2 }, piped in from another, similar, dewar of 36 -feet higher elevation (see Diagram A). The specific design of the coils are outlined in Process Engineering drawing C- 32545, attached. The material components are as follows. The internal coil piping material is constructed of 165 -feet of 1 1 / 2 -inch NPS schedule 40 pipe, of type 5083 aluminum. 3 -inch NPS schedule 80 type 5086 aluminum pipe {{is used for the}} headers of the triple hairpin coil welded assembly. The coils are supported by a series of aluminum brackets fixed to the roof of the dewar. Note 35 on the drawing points out the brackets which hold the coils to the roof of the dewar. They are not connected in any way to the coils, and act only as supports. This feature allows for contraction of the coils, and avoids any longitudinal thermal contraction stresses at the vessel nozzles that might have occurred. A stress analysis of the internal coil feed lines is outlined in DO engineering note 239. The analysis shows that the stresses experienced by the nodes where the coil feed lines pierce the inner vessel are on the order of one fifth of the stresses allowable for this design. The coils have been pressure tested at Process Engineering at 200 psi, which is above the accepted percentage for pressure tests of vessels of 125 % of <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>working</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>maximum</b> pressure which could theoretically develop in the condenser coil is 150 psi.

50|$|When diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} the gas inside them warms {{as a result}} of adiabatic heating. When the gas cools by losing heat to the surroundings, the pressure will drop as described by the general gas equation and Gay-Lussac's law. Divers, to maximise their dive time, generally want their cylinders filled to their safe capacity, the <b>working</b> <b>pressure.</b> To provide the diver with a cylinder filled to the <b>working</b> <b>pressure</b> at the nominal temperature of 15 or 20 °C, the cylinder and gas must be kept cool when filling or filled to a pressure such that when it cools it is at the <b>working</b> <b>pressure.</b> This is known as the developed pressure for the filling temperature. Health and safety regulations and pressure vessel design standards may limit the working temperature of the cylinder, commonly to 65 °C, in which case the cylinder must be filled slowly enough to avoid exceeding the <b>maximum</b> <b>working</b> temperature. Cylinders are often filled at a rate of less than 1 bar (100 kPa or 15 lbf/in²) per second to allow time for heat transfer to the surroundings to limit this increase in temperature. As a method to remove heat faster when filling the cylinder, some filling stations “wet fill” cylinders immersed in a bath of cold water. There is an increased risk of internal cylinder corrosion caused by moisture from the wet environment entering the cylinder due to contamination during connection of the filling hose during wet filling.|$|R
