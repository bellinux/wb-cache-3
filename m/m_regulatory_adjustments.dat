40|$|A complex {{relationship}} exists among EU regulations, current national practices and rules, institutional capacities to implement <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> {{and the legacy}} of past health and regulatory policy and traditions. However, there is little empirical information on medical devices policy, the medical devices industry, and the assurance of medical device safety and usage. Drawing on a review of the secondary literature and on-going field work, the evidence suggests that the current mix of statecentric and self-regulatory traditions will be as important in determining the implementation and final outcomes of EU-rules as the new rules themselves. EU directives redesign rules, but they do not necessarily lead to institutional change, create institutional capacities, or alter old practices in the short term.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of carbon sources and the <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> to recognized changes {{are of particular}} importance for bacterial survival in fluctuating environments. Despite a thorough knowledge base of Escherichia coli’s central metabolism and its regulation, fundamental aspects of the employed sensing and <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, using a differential equation model that couples enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of E. coli’s central metabolism, we show that the interplay of known interactions explains in molecular-level detail the system-wide adjustments of metabolic operation between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. We show that these adaptations are enabled by an indirect {{recognition of}} carbon sources through a mechanism we termed distributed sensing of intracellular metabolic fluxes. This mechanism uses two general motifs to establish flux-signaling metabolites, whose bindings to transcription factors form flux sensors. As these sensors are embedded in global feedback loop architectures, closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling) to fluctuating carbon sources. ...|$|R

These attributes make an analysis of their impacts on electricity generation system operation and design particularly interesting. This paper reviews how a strong presence of intermittent renewable generation will change how future power systems are planned, operated and controlled.

In fact, there have been three <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the period from 2000 to 2005. However, this effort has not been accompanied by studies that accurately estimate both the size of the irregular population and its characteristics. The reason for this paucity of studies is that illegal immigrants avoid any participation in surveys that may reveal their irregular status. However, the National Immigrant Survey 2007, National Statistics Institute (INE) allows to know if an immigrant has the necessary documentation to reside in Spain as well as personal characteristics. Thus, in this work we try to analyze the determinants of regular and irregular immigration in Spain, following the theoretical framework by Chiswick (1988). Also, we analyzed the influence of labor supply variables, variables related to personal characteristics of immigrant labor demand variables, and institutional variables (effects of regularization processes). And since the characteristics of immigrants are very different depending on their country of origin, we have also estimated models by country of origin. illegal immigration, labor supply, regularization...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the economic rationale for limited entry as a method of fishery management and discusses general advantages and disadvantages of license limitation and catch rights as the two primary methods of restricting access to marine fisheries. Traditional open-access methods of regulation (e. g., gear restrictions, size limits, trip limits, quotas, and closures) can be temporarily effective in protecting fish populations, but they generally fail to provide lasting biological or economic benefits to fishermen because they do not restrict access to the fishery. The general result of regulation with unrestricted access to a fishery is additional and more costly and complex regulations as competition increases for dwindling fishery resources. Regulation that restricts access to a fishery in conjunction with selected traditional methods of regulation would encourage efficient resource usage and minimize the need for future <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustments,</b> provided that enforcement and monitoring costs are not too great. In theory, catch rights are superior to license limitation as a means of restricting access to a fishery...|$|R

40|$|Cells grow on a {{wide range}} of carbon sources by {{regulating}} substrate flow through the metabolic network. Incoming sugar, for example, can be fermented or respired, depending on the carbon identity, cell type, or growth conditions. Despite this genetically-encoded flexibility of carbon metabolism, attempts to exogenously manipulate central carbon flux by rational design have proven difficult, suggesting a robust network structure. To examine this robustness, we characterized the ethanol yield of 411 regulatory and metabolic mutants in budding yeast. The mutants showed little variation in ethanol productivity when grown on glucose or galactose, yet diversity was revealed during growth on xylulose, a rare pentose not widely available in nature. While producing ethanol at high yield, cells grown on xylulose produced ethanol at high yields, yet induced expression of respiratory genes, and were dependent on them. Analysis of mutants that affected ethanol productivity suggested that xylulose fermentation results from metabolic overflow, whereby the flux through glycolysis is higher than the maximal flux that can enter respiration. We suggest that this overflow results from a suboptimal <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the cells to this unfamiliar carbon source...|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{transmission}} {{pricing and}} transmission grid expansion have received increasing regulatory and analytical attention in recent years. Since electricity transmission {{is a very}} special service with unusual characteristics, such as loop flows, the approaches have been largely tailor-made and not simply taken from the general economic literature or from the more specific but still general incentive regulation literature. An exception has been Vogelsang (2001), who postulated transmission cost and demand functions with fairly general properties and then adapted known <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> processes to the electricity transmission problem. A concern with this approach has been that the properties of transmission cost and demand functions are little known but are suspected to differ from conventional functional forms. The assumed cost and demand properties in Vogelsang (2001) may actually not hold for transmission companies (Transcos). Loop-flows imply that certain investments in transmission upgrades cause negative network effects on other transmission links, so that capacity is multidimensional. Total network capacity might even decrease due to the addition of new capacity in certain transmission links. The transmission capacity cost function can be discontinuous.

Despite this extra incentive, empirical evidence seems to indicate that database production in the European Community remains largely unchanged while that in the United States is increasing, {{at least in the short}} term.

In order to determine the best method of regulation, three factors are explored in this Ph.

A major insight that emerges is that the productive potential of secondary producers, what the author terms re-users, is being undervalued in Europe. A greater emphasis on access could harness their economic potential. However, this conclusion comes with a twist based upon the American experience. A reduction in statutory protection could result in a switch to production models that emphasize access. But it could also result in models that reduce access even more than at present.

40|$|Most organisms {{can choose}} their {{preferred}} carbon source from {{a mixture of}} nutrients. This process is called carbon catabolite repression. The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis uses glucose as the preferred source of carbon and energy. Glucose-mediated catabolite repression is caused by binding of the CcpA transcription factor to the promoter regions of catabolic operons. CcpA binds DNA upon interaction with its cofactors HPr(Ser-P) and Crh(Ser-P). The formation of the cofactors is catalyzed by the metabolite-activated HPr kinase/ phosphorylase. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that malate is a second preferred carbon source for B. subtilis that also causes catabolite repression. In this work, we addressed the mechanism by which malate causes catabolite repression. Genetic analyses revealed that malate-dependent catabolite repression requires CcpA and its cofactors. Moreover, we demonstrate that HPr(Ser-P) is present in malate-grown cells and that CcpA and HPr interact in vivo in the presence of glucose or malate but not in the absence of a repressing carbon source. The formation of the cofactor HPr(Ser-P) could be attributed to the concentrations of ATP and fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate in cells growing with malate. Both metabolites are available at concentrations that are sufficient to stimulate HPr kinase activity.

The physiological basis of differential growth was analyzed in experiments in June 2010, where components of energy gain (clearance and ingestion rates and absorption efficiency), energy loss (metabolic rates) and resulting scope for growth (J h(- 1)) were compared for groups of F and S oysters fed three different ration levels (a parts per thousand 0. 5, 1. 5 and 3. 0 mg of total particulate matter L- 1). In both F and S oysters, a higher food ration promoted asymptotic increases in energy gain rates through <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> to clearance rates, which maintained similar absorption efficiencies across the food concentrations. No {{significant differences were found}} between growth groups in mass-specific physiological rates (i. e., per unit of body mass).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare and {{contrast}} the corporate governance standards of Cyprus, Russia, and Kazakhstan to those of the UK to facilitate investment decisions. The paper aims to discover governance gaps creating a potential for alignment to UK standards. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is a qualitative case study of four countries based on the OECD criteria of 118 corporate governance measures. Findings – The findings indicate that the corporate governance standards in Cyprus match 92 per cent of the UK standards, Russian standards match 75 per cent, and Kazakhstan ones 63 per cent. The greatest contrast to the UK standards were for Cyprus in the area of disclosure and transparency category, Russia's was in the area of responsibilities of the board, and Kazakhstan's was highest in the two areas mentioned above and low overall. Research limitations/implications – The paper identifies areas of governance that could be aligned to UK standards. Further research is needed to compare the governance standards of the countries studied to international standards other than those of the UK's. Practical implications – The paper provides insight on governance for investors in the three countries and aids effective investment decisions. Social implications – The paper identifies areas of governance needing <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the three countries and could influence government and industry policy. Originality/value – The originality of the paper lies in identifying gaps in governance among the four countries.

Temporal alterations of different ecophysiological, biochemical and structural parameters were investigated in order to test if this species can be considered as an O 3 -bioindicator regarding changes in background concentrations. At the end of ozone exposure, the plants did not exhibit any visible foliar symptoms, as only at microscopic level a small number of dead cells were found. Photosynthetic processes, however, were significantly affected. During and after the treatment, ozone induced a reduction in CO 2 fixation capacity (up to 52 % after 12 h {{from the beginning of the}} treatment) due to mesophyllic limitations. Intercellular CO 2 concentration significantly increased in comparison to controls (+ 90 % at the end of the post-fumigation period). Furthermore impairment of carboxylation efficiency (- 71 % at the end of the post-fumigation period compared to controls in filtered air) and membrane damage in terms of integrity (as demonstrated by a significant rise in solute leakage) were observed. A <b>regulatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> of photosynthetic processes was highlighted during the post-fumigation period by the higher values of qNP and (1 -q(P)) and therefore suggests a tendency to reduce the light energy used in photochemistry at the expense of the capacity to dissipate the excess as excitation energy. In addition, the chlorophyll a/b ratio and the de-epoxidation index increased, showing a rearrangement of the pigment composition of the photosynthetic apparatus and a marked activation of photoprotective mechanisms...|$|R
