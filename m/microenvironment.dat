25|$|SGCs {{role as a}} {{regulator}} of neuronal <b>microenvironment</b> {{is further}} characterized by its electrical properties which {{are very similar to}} those of astrocytes. Astrocytes have a well studied and defined role in controlling the <b>microenvironment</b> within the brain, therefore researchers are investigating any homologous role of SGCs within the sympathetic ganglia. An established mode of controlling the <b>microenvironment</b> in sensory ganglia is the uptake of substances by specialized transporters which carry neurotransmitters into cells when coupled with Na+ and Cl−. Transporters for glutamate and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been found in SGCs. They appear to be actively engaged in the control of the composition of the extracellular space of the ganglia. The enzyme glutamine synthetase, which catalyzes the conversion of glutamate into glutamine, is found in large amounts in SGCs. Additionally, SGCs contain the glutamate related enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase, and thus can supply the neurons not only with glutamine, but also with malate and lactate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{prevalent}} disease amongst women worldwide and metastasis is {{the main cause of}} death due to breast cancer. Metastatic breast cancer cells and embryonic stem (ES) cells display similar characteristics. However, unlike metastatic breast cancer cells, ES cells are nonmalignant. Furthermore, embryonic <b>microenvironments</b> have the potential to convert metastatic breast cancer cells into a less invasive phenotype. The creation of in vitro embryonic <b>microenvironments</b> will enable better understanding of ES cell-breast cancer cell interactions, help elucidate tumorigenesis, and lead to the restriction of breast cancer metastasis. In this article, we will present the characteristics of breast cancer cells and ES cells as well as their <b>microenvironments,</b> importance of embryonic <b>microenvironments</b> in inhibiting tumorigenesis, convergence of tumorigenic and embryonic signaling pathways, and state of the art in bioengineering embryonic <b>microenvironments</b> for breast cancer research. Additionally, the potential application of bioengineered embryonic <b>microenvironments</b> for the prevention and treatment of invasive breast cancer will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to: i) measure {{personal}} exposure in the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) 900 MHz downlink (DL) frequency band with two systems of exposimeters, a personal distributed exposimeter (PDE) and a pair of ExpoM-RFs, ii) compare the GSM 900 MHz DL exposures across various <b>microenvironments</b> in Australia and Belgium, and iii) evaluate the correlation between the PDE and ExpoM-RFs measurements. Personal exposure data were collected using the PDE and two ExpoM-RFs simultaneously across 34 <b>microenvironments</b> (17 each in Australia and Belgium) located in urban, suburban and rural areas. Summary statistics of the electric field strengths (V/m) were computed and compared across similar <b>microenvironments</b> in Australia and Belgium. The personal exposures across urban <b>microenvironments</b> were higher than those in the rural or suburban <b>microenvironments.</b> Likewise, the exposure levels across the outdoor were higher than those for indoor <b>microenvironments.</b> The five highest median exposure levels were: city centre (0. 248 V/m), bus (0. 124 V/m), railway station (0. 105 V/m), mountain/forest (rural) (0. 057 V/m), and train (0. 055 V/m) [Australia]; and bicycle (urban) (0. 238 V/m), tram station (0. 238 V/m), city centre (0. 156 V/m), residential outdoor (urban) (0. 139 V/m) and park (0. 124 V/m) [Belgium]. Exposures in the GSM 900 MHz frequency band across most of the <b>microenvironments</b> in Australia were significantly lower than the exposures across the <b>microenvironments</b> in Belgium. Overall correlations between the PDE and the ExpoM-RFs measurements were high. The measured exposure levels were far below the general public reference levels recommended in the guidelines of the ICNIRP and the ARPANSA...|$|R

Brucite encrusts microbial filaments of endobionts (i. e., fungi, green algae, cyanobacteria) growing under organic biofilms; the brucite distribution is patchy both within interseptal spaces and within coralla.

40|$|Although ambient {{particulate}} matter {{has been associated}} with a range of health outcomes, the health risks for individuals depend in part on their daily activities. Information about particle mass concentrations and size distributions in indoor and outdoor <b>microenvironments</b> can help identify high-risk individuals and the significant contributors to personal exposure. To address these issues in an urban setting, we measured particle count concentrations in four size ranges and {{particulate matter}} (3 / 4) 10 microm (PM(10)) concentrations outdoors and in seven indoor <b>microenvironments</b> in Boston, Massachusetts. Particle counts and PM(10) concentrations were continuously measured with two light-scattering devices. Because of the autocorrelation between sequential measurements, we used linear mixed effects models with an AR- 1 autoregressive correlation structure to evaluate whether differences between <b>microenvironments</b> were statistically significant. In general, larger particles were elevated in the vicinity of significant human activity, and smaller particles were elevated in the vicinity of combustion sources, with indoor PM(10) concentrations significantly higher than the outdoors on buses and trolleys. Statistical models demonstrated significant variability among some indoor <b>microenvironments,</b> with greater variability for smaller particles. These findings imply that personal exposures can depend on activity patterns and that microenvironmental concentration information can improve the accuracy of personal exposure estimation...|$|R

25|$|While {{genetic and}} {{epigenetic}} alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes change {{the behavior of}} cells, those alterations, in the end, result in cancer through their effects on the population of neoplastic cells and their <b>microenvironment.</b> Mutant cells in neoplasms compete for space and resources. Thus, a clone with a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene will expand only in a neoplasm if that mutation gives the clone a competitive advantage over the other clones and normal cells in its <b>microenvironment.</b> Thus, the process of carcinogenesis is formally a process of Darwinian evolution, known as somatic or clonal evolution. Furthermore, {{in light of the}} Darwinistic mechanisms of carcinogenesis, it has been theorized that the various forms of cancer can be categorized as pubertarial and gerontological. Anthropological research is currently being conducted on cancer as a natural evolutionary process through which natural selection destroys environmentally inferior phenotypes while supporting others. According to this theory, cancer comes in two separate types: from birth to the end of puberty (approximately age 20) teleologically inclined toward supportive group dynamics, and from mid-life to death (approximately age 40+) teleologically inclined away from overpopulative group dynamics.|$|E
