25|$|In September 2008, the Department of the Army {{authorized}} {{a miniature}} <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> {{to be worn}} on the new Army Service Uniform. This is a scaled-down replica of the President's Hundred full-color embroidered tab.|$|E
25|$|The {{brake pads}} must usually be {{replaced}} regularly (depending on pad material, and drivestyle), {{and some are}} equipped with a mechanism that alerts drivers that replacement is needed, such as a thin piece of soft metal that rubs against the disc when the pads are too thin causing the brakes to squeal, a soft <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> embedded in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a warning light when the brake pad gets thin, or an electronic sensor.|$|E
25|$|Rural areas, {{as well as}} the {{smallest}} towns, had manual service and signaling was accomplished with magneto telephones, which had a crank for the signaling generator. To alert the operator, or another subscriber on the same line, the subscriber turned the crank to generate ringing current. The switchboard responded by interrupting the circuit, which dropped a <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> above the subscriber's line jack and sounded a buzzer. Dry cell batteries, normally two large N°. 6 cells in the subscriber's telephone, provided the direct current for the transmitter. Such magneto systems were in use in the US as late as 1983, as in the small town, Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine.|$|E
50|$|Some {{plates were}} revalidated for {{multiple}} years. For example, the 1947-dated plate was revalidated with <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> until 1950.|$|R
2500|$|Components were {{mechanically}} redesigned to {{have small}} <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> or end caps {{that could be}} soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes. [...] Components became much smaller and component placement {{on both sides of}} the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities.|$|R
50|$|The top metal {{plates in}} Model F {{keyboards}} {{are prone to}} corrosion and the internal foam can also rot from age, which often requires cleaning and a coating to prevent further corrosion. All Model F internal assemblies are held together with <b>metal</b> <b>tabs,</b> unlike the Model M which uses melted rivets requiring more rivets to be melted on or modified with bolts.|$|R
50|$|A TO-220 {{package that}} is heatsinked, dissipating 1W of heat, {{will have an}} {{internal}} (junction) temperature typically 2 to 5 °C higher than the package's temperature (due to the thermal resistance between the junction and the <b>metal</b> <b>tab)</b> and the <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> of the TO-220 package will typically have a temperature of 1 to 60 °C higher than the ambient temperature, {{depending on the type}} of heatsink (if any) used.|$|E
50|$|TO-220F, {{which has}} an {{insulated}} tab and body, and typically has a higher thermal resistance than the <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> versions.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An early 1980s [...] "Pepsi Challenge" [...] 12 oz. (355 ml.) promotional can, and a <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> button publicizing the challenge.|$|E
5000|$|The lance rest is {{typically}} {{bolted to the}} side of the breastplate or secured through the use of <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> known as staples. [...] The majority of the time, the lance rest is hinged so that it can be folded upward to prevent an obstruction of the wearer's sword arm once the lance has been abandoned in favor of a sword.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Rosemount ski boots, c. 1968. The boot on {{the left}} is open; it closes by pulling the flap across the front of the boot and locking small <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> into buckles. The buckles are visible on the closed boot, on the extreme right. The large metal hinges are not visible on either boot, it is under the fabric on the right, and behind the open flap {{on the left}}.|$|R
50|$|The {{outer edge}} of the shield has been folded back and {{hammered}} down to form a strong rim. A handle is riveted across the open bowl of the boss, made from a thicker piece of sheet bronze folded over; also attached are a pair of <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> for a carrying strap. Rivet heads are on the front for fitting attachments, but are similar to the decorative raised bosses and difficult to identify.|$|R
50|$|In September 2008, the Department of the Army {{authorized}} {{a miniature}} <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> {{to be worn}} on the new Army Service Uniform. This is a scaled-down replica of the President's Hundred full-color embroidered tab.|$|E
5000|$|... 'lock-tab DC coaxial connector' (also called 'bayonet lock') {{offers a}} {{compromise}} that resists unplugging, but which will disengage when pulled hard enough. This connector uses small <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> protrusions on the connector barrel to lock the plug in place, requiring a special push-and-rotate motion to engage the locks.|$|E
50|$|Multi-leaded power {{packages}} are heatsinkable, {{and thus can}} be used in projects where a large amount of power is being drawn. The top of the package has a <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> with a hole used in mounting the component to a heatsink. Thermal compound is also used to provide greater heat transfer.|$|E
50|$|The Flechas {{received}} combat uniforms {{identical to}} those worn by the Portuguese Armed Forces, in the Portuguese vertical lizard pattern camouflage. With this uniform, they wore a beret with the same camouflage pattern. This non standard camouflage beret became their most distinctive uniform item. In parade, the Flechas also wore neck scarves and <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> in the left shoulder {{with the name of}} the unit. Allegedly, in some operations, they wore enemy uniforms in order not to be identified.|$|R
2500|$|Most duplex {{receptacles}} have <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> {{connecting the}} top and bottom receptacles. These tabs are pre-scored {{so that they can be}} broken off to allow {{the top and}} bottom receptacles to be wired onto separate circuits. This may allow for one switched receptacle for a lamp, or for two separate supply circuits when heavy loads are anticipated. Two branch circuits may optionally share a common neutral wire terminating on duplex receptacles, a condition sometimes referred to as [...] "split-wiring", [...] "split-receptacle", or [...] "half-split".|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{plates were}} issued in pairs 1908 to present except for 1944, 1945, and 1946. New plates were issued every year until 1943 due to wartime restrictions. From 1943 until 1952 plates were issued yearly. Between 1953 and 1956 <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> were issued for re-{{validation}} of plates. In 1956 re validation began with front windshield stickers. In 1999 the state tried re-validating plates with stickers, but that scheme ended in 2004 with stickers issued to expire in 2005. Since then passenger plates have been re-validated {{with just the}} registration card issued to the driver.|$|R
5000|$|In {{mechanical}} design, the prototypical [...] "male" [...] {{component is}} a threaded bolt, but an alignment post, a mounting boss, or a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> connector {{can also be}} considered as male. Correspondingly, a threaded nut, an alignment hole, a mounting recess, or sheet metal slot connector is considered to be female.|$|E
50|$|Variants {{with higher}} voltage ratings (e.g. 2N3055HV, with a 100Vceo rating), {{different}} case material or type (e.g. steel, aluminium, or plastic with <b>metal</b> <b>tab),</b> and other variations exist, {{in addition to}} the minor variations in ratings (such as a power dissipation of 115 or 117 Watts) between 2N3055-marked devices from various manufacturers since RCA's original.|$|E
50|$|Before {{launching}} the L type {{it is necessary}} to remove the <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> security {{at the base of the}} cylinder containing the explosive charge, then, firmly holding the handle, remove the pin at the base of the handle. Make sure that the wire rewind safely. When the grenade is thrown, the wire releases the second safety pin.|$|E
50|$|Stone Veneer: Stone veneer {{is used as}} a {{protective}} and decorative covering for interior or exterior walls and surfaces. The veneer is typically 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick and must weigh less than 15 lb per square foot (73 kg m&minus;2) so that no additional structural supports are required. The structural wall is put up first, and thin, flat stones are mortared onto the face of the wall. <b>Metal</b> <b>tabs</b> in the structural wall are mortared between the stones to tie everything together, to prevent the stonework from separating from the wall.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{electric}} toothbrushes run on low voltage, 12v or less. A few units use a {{step-down transformer}} {{to power the}} brush, but most use a battery, usually but not always rechargeable and non-replaceable, fitted inside the handle, which is hermetically sealed to prevent water damage. While early NiCd battery toothbrushes used <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> {{to connect with the}} charging base, modern toothbrushes use contactless inductive charging: the brush unit and charger stand each contain a coil of wire; when placed in proximity, the powered coil from the stand transfers power by induction to the handle, charging the battery.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{people have}} {{successfully}} documented replacing the built-in Lithium ion battery with a higher-capacity battery, increasing time the T3 {{can be used}} without charging[...] Batteries of 1100mAh are available that fit just fine. However, disassembling the case is complicated by 5 small <b>metal</b> <b>tabs,</b> not mentioned by most online instruction pages: two on each side, {{and one on the}} back just above the docking connector, which must be released {{as one of the first}} disassembly steps (for example, by inserting a very thin shim and pushing it gently down, while pulling the bottom panel down enough to clear it).|$|R
50|$|Since 1916, buttons {{have also}} been {{produced}} by lithographing the image directly onto the metal disk. A celluloid-type button is fastened to a garment using a pin {{on the back side}} of the button (in recently produced buttons, the pin generally fits into a safety-pin-style catch). A lithographed button may fasten with a pinback or with a <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> which folds over a lapel or pocket.|$|E
50|$|The commandos are {{distinguished}} by their insignia of maroon berets, a common color for airborne troops, {{with a silver}} <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> on a light blue felt square with a dagger and lightning bolts, and a wing {{on the right side}} of the chest. The combat uniform of the SSG is similar to the US woodland pattern camouflage coat and pants. Other uniforms include camouflage and black dungarees (for the CT team).|$|E
5000|$|A {{stall warning}} is an {{electronic}} or mechanical device that sounds an audible warning as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain {{some form of}} this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a stall warning horn, which consists of either a pressure sensor or a movable <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> that actuates a switch, and produces an audible warning in response.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A cheater plug, with <b>metal</b> {{grounding}} <b>tab</b> (lower right). The ground tab {{is designed}} to be attached to the outlet faceplate screw, which is supposed to be connected to the building electrical ground.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force service uniform {{version of}} <b>tab</b> (<b>metal</b> miniature) ...|$|R
5000|$|Drinks: Aluminum {{and steel}} {{beverage}} cans, crowns, <b>metal</b> closures, promotional <b>tabs,</b> shaped containers and specialty containers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> {{is often}} {{connected}} electrically {{to the internal}} circuitry. This does not normally pose a problem when using isolated heatsinks, but an electrically-insulating pad or sheet {{may be required to}} electrically isolate the component from the heatsink if the heatsink is electrically conductive, grounded or otherwise non-isolated. Many materials may be used to electrically isolate the TO-220 package, some of which have the added benefit of high thermal conductivity.|$|E
5000|$|On May 27, 1958, The National Rifle Association {{requested}} the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel's {{approval of a}} tab for presentation to {{each member of the}} [...] "President's Hundred." [...] NRA's plan was to award the cloth tab together with a <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> during the 1958 National Matches. The cloth tab was of high level interest and approved for wear on the uniform on March 3, 1958.|$|E
50|$|The D2PAK or DDPAK, {{standardized}} as TO-263, {{refers to}} a semiconductor package type intended for surface mounting on circuit boards. They {{are similar to the}} earlier TO-220-style packages intended for high power dissipation but lack the extended <b>metal</b> <b>tab</b> and mounting hole, and also represent a larger version of the DPAK SMT package.As with all SMT packages, the pins on a D2PAK are bent to lie against the PCB surface.|$|E
50|$|Downstream {{of the air}} handler, {{the supply}} air trunk duct will {{commonly}} fork, providing air to many individual air outlets such as diffusers, grilles, and registers. When the system is designed with a main duct branching into many subsidiary branch ducts, fittings called take-offs allow {{a small portion of}} the flow in the main duct to be diverted into each branch duct. Take-offs may be fitted into round or rectangular openings cut into the wall of the main duct. The take-off commonly has many small <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> that are then bent to attach the take-off to the main duct. Round versions are called spin-in fittings. Other take-off designs use a snap-in attachment method, sometimes coupled with an adhesive foam gasket for improved sealing. The outlet of the take-off then connects to the rectangular, oval, or round branch duct.|$|R
5000|$|The {{offerings to}} Senuna include silver plaques with gold highlights, seven gold plaques and a superb set of jewellery, {{including}} a brooch and cloak clasps. The plaques {{still have the}} <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> which allowed them to be set upright, and are so thin that they would then have shivered and glittered in any draught. Some votive plaques were punched out in tiny holes, some incised. The jewellery incorporated older gems and glass beads, including a superb carved cameo of a lion trampling an ox skull which was already old and worn before it was set into the brooch. All of the jewellery shared intricate decoration in minutely coiled wire, and the set may have been specially made as an offering. An exhibit of offerings to Senua {{may be seen in}} Room 49 of the British Museum, labelled [...] "Near Baldock Hoard".|$|R
50|$|The {{single cable}} from the handlebar's rear brake lever divides into two cables which are routed to {{opposite}} sides of the stem or fork steer tube and into cable stops. The inner cables connect to <b>metal</b> <b>tabs</b> on a disc attached to the upper side of a thrust bearing placed around the stem or steer tube. Squeezing the brake lever pulls the inner cables and causes the bearing assembly to rise. A second disc is attached {{to the bottom of the}} thrust bearing such that the entire assembly moves together up and down the steering axis while each disc can rotate independently around the axis. A second set of cables are attached to tabs on this lower disc and pass through cable stops mounted on the either side of the head tube. The two lower cables merge back into one and then are routed to the rear brake. The cables are split in this way to ensure that the detangler mechanism moves equally on both sides.|$|R
