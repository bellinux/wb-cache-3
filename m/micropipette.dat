25|$|Patch clamp {{recording}} is used {{to measure}} electrical activity in neurons. The technique uses a one micrometer diameter open tip glass <b>micropipette</b> to suction the membrane of a cell. The pipette is filled with ionic solution, and a silver wire {{is placed in the}} solution to conduct and amplify electrical signals. The ion solution can be varied and drugs can be delivered through the <b>micropipette</b> to study the effects of current under various conditions. Receptor and voltage-gated channel antagonists are often applied (i.e. nickel used to block NMDA receptors) in order to study the effects of ion channels on dendritic spike initiation. Current injection is often paired with patch clamp recordings in order to observe current modulation due to various experimental factors.|$|E
25|$|Chimeric mice: hESCs {{naturally}} reside {{within the}} {{inner cell mass}} (embryoblast) of blastocysts, and in the embryoblast, differentiate into the embryo while the blastocyst’s shell (trophoblast) differentiates into extraembryonic tissues. The hollow trophoblast is unable to form a living embryo, and thus {{it is necessary for}} the embryonic stem cells within the embryoblast to differentiate and form the embryo. iPSCs were injected by <b>micropipette</b> into a trophoblast, and the blastocyst was transferred to recipient females. Chimeric living mouse pups were created: mice with iPSC derivatives incorporated all across their bodies with 10%–90% chimerism.|$|E
25|$|In {{somatic cell}} nuclear {{transfer}} ("SCNT"), {{the nucleus of}} a somatic cell is taken from a donor and transplanted into a host egg cell, which had its own genetic material removed previously, making it an enucleated egg. After the donor somatic cell genetic material is transferred into the host oocyte with a <b>micropipette,</b> the somatic cell genetic material is fused with the egg using an electric current. Once the two cells have fused, the new cell can be permitted to grow in a surrogate or artificially. This is the process {{that was used to}} successfully clone Dolly the sheep (see section on History in this article).|$|E
40|$|<b>Micro{{pipettes}}</b> or piston pipettes {{are used}} to make most volume measurements in fields such as health, chemistry, biology, pharmacy and genetics. Laboratories must ensure that results obtained using these instruments are reliable; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} calibrate <b>micropipettes.</b> Before the start of the calibration process, we must check the precision of measurements. The objective of this work is to compare several methods for calculating the precision of three kinds of <b>micropipettes</b> according to the reference value in ISO 8655 - 6. The medical tests will not have accurate results, if the volume of the liquid doesn’t transfer precisely by <b>micropipettes.</b> Thus, the physician might potentially face problems in the disease diagnosis and its control. In the NCCLS EP 5 -A 2, there is a method to specify and assess the precision of <b>micropipettes</b> by using CV (Coefficient of Variation). Also there are other methods to estimate and test the CV theory, in the formal statistics texts which could be applied to assess the <b>micropipettes</b> precision. In this research we evaluate the precision of lab <b>micropipettes.</b> Three brands of <b>micropipettes,</b> A, B and C are assigned to measure the distilled water mass by using accurate scale which is accurate up to 10 - 6 to measure 50 -gram weights.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of microelectrodes used for single-unit recordings: glass <b>micropipettes</b> and metal electrodes. Both are {{high-impedance}} electrodes, but glass <b>micropipettes</b> are highly resistive and metal electrodes have frequency-dependent impedance.

2500|$|In some experiments, the <b>micropipette</b> tip {{is heated}} in a microforge {{to produce a}} smooth surface that assists in forming a high {{resistance}} seal with the cell membrane. To obtain this high resistance seal, the <b>micropipette</b> is pressed against a cell membrane and suction is applied. A portion of the cell membrane is suctioned into the pipette, creating an omega-shaped area of membrane which, if formed properly, creates a resistance in the 10–100 gigaohms range, called a [...] "gigaohm seal" [...] or [...] "gigaseal". The high resistance of this seal {{makes it possible to}} isolate electronically the currents measured across the membrane patch with little competing noise, as well as providing some mechanical stability to the recording.|$|E
2500|$|During a patch clamp recording, {{a hollow}} glass tube {{known as a}} <b>micropipette</b> or patch pipette {{containing}} an electrolyte-containing solution and a recording electrode [...] connected to an amplifier is brought {{into contact with the}} cell membrane.

40|$|Single human {{red blood}} cells {{suspended}} in buffered Ringer's solution were rapidly drawn, at recorded pressures, into glass <b>micropipettes</b> of diameter 0. 6 - 3. 2 μm. Cells could enter <b>micropipettes</b> of diameter ≥ 2. 9 μm with minimal pressure. In <b>micropipettes</b> of 0. 9 - 2. 9 μm, the pressure required increased linearly with decreasing diameter. For diameters 2. 5 - 2. 9 μm, pressures ranged up to 7 cm Hg, and the cells returned to normal biconcave shape on release. For diameters 1. 9 - 2. 5 μm, the required pressures ranged from 7 to 17 cm Hg. The released cells were crenated. In <b>micropipettes</b> 0. 9 - 1. 9 μm, the pressures required ranged from 17 to 34 cm Hg. The cells hemolyzed on entry. As diameter decreased from 0. 9 to 0. 6 μm, cells were drawn into dumbbell shapes {{and parts of the}} cells were pinched off without complete hemolysis of the cell. Using an accepted value of 138 μm 2 for the mean cell area, the mean volume of the human red cell was calculated to be 94 μm 3.

50|$|Intracellular {{single unit}} {{recordings}} require electrodes be inserted through the cell membrane to record {{from within the}} cell. Glass <b>micropipettes</b> or metal electrodes {{may be used for}} intracellular single unit recordings, but glass <b>micropipettes</b> are preferred because their high input resistance allows more precise recordings for measurement of resting potentials. Additionally, very fine glass tip <b>micropipettes</b> are much better at successfully penetrating and retaining neurons. Intracellular single unit recordings provide much more information on single neuron discharges. They can give information on steady and resting membrane voltage, postsynaptic potentials, and spikes (action potentials) from both the axon and cell body. Limitations of intracellular recording are that one can only record from cell bodies of, usually, the largest cells. There is little information obtained on neural information transfer from further dendrites or axons. Recordings from small neurons are quite difficult and usually must be supported with extracellular single unit recordings.|$|R

50|$|José del Castillo and Bernard Katz used ionophoresis to {{determine}} the location and density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. With this technique, a microelectrode was placed inside the motor endplate of the muscle fiber, and a <b>micropipette</b> filled with acetylcholine (ACh) is placed {{directly in front of}} the endplate in the synaptic cleft. A positive voltage was applied to the tip of the <b>micropipette,</b> which caused a burst of positively charged ACh molecules to be released from the pipette. These ligands flowed into the space representing the synaptic cleft and bound to AChRs. The intracellular microelectrode monitored the amplitude of the depolarization of the motor endplate in response to ACh binding to nicotinic (ionotropic) receptors. Katz and del Castillo showed that the amplitude of the depolarization (excitatory postsynaptic potential) depended on the proximity of the <b>micropipette</b> releasing the ACh ions to the endplate. The farther the <b>micropipette</b> was from the motor endplate, the smaller the depolarization was in the muscle fiber.

Compared to the traditional glass <b>micropipettes</b> FluidFM probes are much more gentle to soft samples such as cells.

5000|$|Glass <b>micropipettes</b> {{are filled}} with an ionic {{solution}} to make them conductive; a silver-silver chloride (Ag-AgCl) electrode is dipped into the filling solution as an electrical terminal. Ideally, the ionic solutions should have ions similar to ionic species around the electrode; the concentration inside the electrode and surrounding fluid should be the same. Additionally, the diffusive characteristics of the different ions within the electrode should be similar. The ion must {{also be able to}} [...] "provide current carrying capacity adequate for the needs of the experiment". And importantly, it must not cause biological changes in the cell it is recording from. Ag-AgCl electrodes are primarily used with a potassium chloride (KCl) solution. With Ag-AgCl electrodes, ions react with it to produce electrical gradients at the interface, creating a voltage change with respect to time. Electrically, glass microelectrode tips have high resistance and high capacitance. They have a tip size of approximately 0.5-1.5 µm with a resistance of about 10-50 MΩ. The small tips make it easy to penetrate the cell membrane with minimal damage for intracellular recordings. <b>Micropipettes</b> are ideal for measurement of resting membrane potentials and with some adjustments can record action potentials. There are some issues to consider when using glass <b>micropipettes.</b> To offset high resistance in glass <b>micropipettes,</b> a cathode follower must be used as the first-stage amplifier.
