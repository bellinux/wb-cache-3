After removal of nonspecific inhibitors by this procedure, an excess of <b>manganous</b> <b>chloride</b> may remain. This may cause the cells to agglutinate, thus obscuring the reading at low serum dilutions. This disadvantage can be overcome by the addition of sodium carbonate, which forms an insoluble compound with <b>manganous</b> <b>chloride</b> and does not interfere with antibody determination.

40|$|SUMMARY <b>Manganous</b> <b>chloride</b> and Congo red {{incorporated}} into blotting paper discs {{have been used}} to differentiate gonococci from meningococci. The new technique is simple and reliable; the materials for the test are inexpensive. The method will increase the efficiency of distinguishing between the pathogenic Neisseria in any clinical bacteriology laboratory and especially in those in the tropical areas. Clinically, the most important Neisseria are the gonococcus and the meningococcus. Gonorrhoea and other gonococcal infections are now the most common bacterial communicable diseases in the world. Meningococcal infections, although less widespread, cause pyogenic meningitis and meningo-coccal septicaemia, serious and often fatal con-ditions in many countries, especially in tropical areas. In recent times, gonococci have been isolated with increasing frequency from extragenital sites...|$|E

The cytidine diphosphate diglyceride: myoinositol, phosphatidyl transferase activity is particulate-bound, and the highest specific activity {{is found in the}} membrane fraction. The production of phosphatidylinositol is decreased by sulfhydryl-binding agents, and the addition of thiols to the platelet homogenates increases the enzymatic activity. The reaction exhibits a pH optimum of 8. 5 - 9. 0. Divalent cations stimulate the reaction, and <b>manganous</b> <b>chloride</b> was the most effective of those investigated. The Km of the enzyme for myoinositol is 0. 27 mM, and the Km for cytidine diphosphate diglyceride is 0. 53 mM.

The lattice-spacing-composition curve disagrees with that previously constructed by Olander {{on the basis of}} his fewer determinations. The new curve indicated that ordered phases PbTl_ 3 and PbTlTl_ 6 probably occur. Part II: The Investigation of the Crystal Structure of the Complex of Hexamethylenetetramine with <b>Manganous</b> <b>Chloride.</b> Suitable crystals of the complex of hexamethylenetetramine with <b>manganous</b> <b>chloride</b> were grown in a 1 : 1 mixture of alcohol and acetone. By chemical analysis the composition was shown to correspond to the formula, 2 (CH_ 2) 6 N_ 4 •MnCl_ 2 • 2 H_ 20. The crystal has a pseudo unit cell with a_ 1 = 11. 80 Å., a_ 2 = 22. 00 Å., a_ 3 = 7. 21 Å., and Z = 4. The pseudo space group is C^ 9 _(2 v) -P 2 _ 1 nb. A few weak reflections indicate that the a_ 1 axis should be doubled, but no account was taken of this in the present determination. A trial structure derived from steric considerations and the intensities of reflections h 00 led to a satisfactory interpretation of the Patterson distribution function. The approximate structure based on the Patterson syntheses was confirmed by the Fourier projections ρ(x) and ρ(y,x), and by calculation of structure factors for reflections h 00 and Okℓ. The structure has the following important features. A manganese atom lies on the common three-fold axis of two hexamethylenetetramine molecules at the center of symmetry of a complex molecule, and the Mn-Cl bonds are approximately perpendicular to the Mn-N bonds. Both the Patterson syntheses andthe Fourier projections indicate that two molecules of water are present in each complex molecule, and the Mn-O bonds are approximately normal to the plane of the Mn-Cl and Mn-N bonds. ...|$|E

In this study, we investigated the effects of the slow-channel inhibiting agents verapamil, D 600, <b>manganous</b> <b>chloride,</b> and lanthanum chloride on sinus node automaticity and AV nodal conduction in open-chest dogs treated with atropine (0. 5 mg/kg) and propranolol (1. 0 mg/kg). The arteries to the sinus node and the AV node were cannulated and perfused with agents that inhibit the slow current. These agents slowed sinus node discharge rate, depressed AV nodal con-duction, and lengthened the effective and the functional AV nodal refractory period. Effects were dose related and reversed with time. His-Purkinje conduction remained nor-mal. Isoproterenol and epinephrine reversed the effects of slow-channel inhibiting agents, but calcium, sodium, glucagon, and phenylephrine did not. Concentrations of propranolol which produced beta-receptor blockade prevented isoproterenol-induced reversal of the effects of slow-channel inhibitors. We concluded that (l) agents which in...|$|E

40|$|Manganese {{toxicity}} can evoke neuropsychiatric and neuromotor symptoms, {{which have}} frequently {{been attributed to}} profound oxidative stress in the dopaminergic system. However, the characterization of manganese as a pro-oxidant remains controversial because antioxidant properties also {{have been associated with}} this metal. The current study was designed to address these disparate findings concerning the oxidative properties of manganese. The apparent ability of manganese in its divalent form to promote formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within a cortical mitochondrial-synaptosomal (P 2) fraction was completely abolished by the addition of one five hundredth of its molarity of desferroxamine (DFO), a trivalent metal chelator. This large ratio and the high specificity of DFO for trivalent metal ions discounted the possibility of inhibition of ROS generation by direct sequestration of divalent manganese, and implied the trace presence of a trivalent metal. Further analysis suggested that this trace metal was manganic rather than ferric ion. Ferric ion was able to dampen the reactive oxygen species-generating capacity of <b>manganous</b> <b>chloride,</b> whereas manganic ion markedly promoted this property attributed to manganous ion. Such findings of the potent effects of trace amounts of trivalent cations upon Mn 2 + -related free radical generation offer resolution of earlier disparate findings concerning the oxidative character of manganese. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|E

Approximately 1, 000 -fold purification of the bacteriocin was achieved by <b>manganous</b> <b>chloride</b> precipitation, differential centrifugation, and chromatography on hydroxyapatite columns. The purified syngacin was homogeneous on hydroxyapatite columns and sucrose density gradients; it also sedimented as a single entity in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The buoyant density of purified syringacin in cesium chloride was 1. 294 g/ml. The sedimentation coefficient was calculated as 120 S, and the diffusion coefficient was 6. 49 × 10 − 8 cm 2 /s. The molecular weight was calculated as 1. 6 × 107 from physical data and 1. 7 × 107 from biological data. The syringacin was composed of about 88. 4 % protein, 8. 5 % arabinose, 2. 2 % galacturonic acid, and 0. 7 % glucosamine. Amino acid analysis indicated a predominance of leucine (12. 1 %), aspartic acid (12. 2 %), and glutamic acid (12. 7 %). The ultraviolet spectrum showed a maximum absorbance peak at 276 nm.

40|$|The elucidation of many {{biological}} and meta-bolic processes has been {{facilitated by the}} use of microbial mutants. Studies concerning the ef-fects of radiations, the relation between killing and mutations, and the effects of different muta-genic agents on genetic material have been made with the prospect of correlating this information with that of more complex multicellular or-ganisms. In studies of this type it is desirable that the method employed for measuring induced mutations be simple yet reliable. MIethods devised for measuring in(luced muta-tion rates have as a basis the fluctuation test (Luria and Delbruck, 1943), the average number of mutants per culture in a series of parallel cul-tures (Newcombe, 1948), clonal systems and population dynamics (Lea and Coulson, 1949), and serial dilution methods (Pratt et al., 1954). It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to report a method for measuring induced mutationis which will eliminate many of the time consuming processes employed in some of the above methods, allow complete phenotypic expression and recovery of induced mutants, permit the assay of large populations, and measure many different types of mutations by use of the appropriate selective media.

In this study, the binding characteristics of receptors for LH-RH in membrane fractions from rat anterior pituitaries were investigated after a single injection of Cetrorelix at {{a dose of}} 100 microg per rat. To determine whether the treatment with Cetrorelix can affect the concentration of measurable LH-RH binding sites, we applied an in vitro method to desaturate LH-RH receptors by chaotropic agents such as <b>manganous</b> <b>chloride</b> (MnCl 2) and ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN). Our {{results show that the}} percentages of occupied LH-RH receptors at 1, 3, and 6 h after administration of Cetrorelix were approximately 28 %, 14 %, and 10 %, respectively, of total receptors. At later time intervals, we could not detect occupied LH-RH binding sites. Ligand competition assays, following in vitro desaturation, demonstrated that rat pituitary LH-RH receptors were significantly (P < 0. 01) down-regulated for at least 72 h after administration of Cetrorelix. The lowest receptor concentration was found 3 - 6 h after Cetrorelix treatment and a recovery in receptor number began within approximately 24 h. The down-regulation of LH-RH binding sites induced by Cetrorelix was accompanied by serum LH and testosterone suppression. Higher LH-RH receptor concentrations coincided with elevated serum hormone levels at later time intervals. Our results indicate that administration of LH-RH antagonist Cetrorelix produces a marked down-regulation of pituitary receptors for LH-RH and not merely an occupancy of binding sites...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{fermentation}} of lactose by Shigella sonnei {{has been}} associated with the presence of mutants. We observed that lactose-fermenting (lactose) mutants of Sh. sonnei could be isolated from all lactose broth cultures which had become acid within about ten days of incubation. However, lactose mutants could not be isolated from cultures which had become acid after this time. It was thought that the absence of lactose-fermenting organisms in these cultures might be due to the death of the mutants because of increased acidity produced by lactose fermentation. The pH of all acid cultures was measured but no apparent difference was found between those from which lactose mutants were isolated and those in which lactose mutants could not be detected. The possibility existed that acid production might have been caused by lactose mutants present in numbers too few to be detected by loopful sampling. By the method described by Kacoyanis and Baker (Proc. Bact., 1935, p. 103) entire bacterial cultures were screened for lactose mutants. However, lactose mutants could not be detected. The fact that Sh. sonnei did not produce acid in the same medium containing no lactose established that acid production was due to utilization of lactose. In the hope of explaining the apparent production of acid by normal Sh. sonnei, the effect of various cultural conditions on both the production of lactose mutants and the apparent production of acid by normal organisms was examined. Increased concentrations of lactose, meat extract or peptone in the medium; neutralized filtrates of acid cultures of lactose cells; and aging of ctutures in nutrient broth to which lactose was added did not increase the rate of lactose mutant production. Aeration of normal organisms in lactose broth favored the production of lactose mutants. Nearly all cultures became acidified within five days and then became alkaline again. Lactose mutants could be isolated for several days afterward. Eventually, the lactose mutants disappeared in the aerated cultures and only normal cells could be isolated. Lactose mutants could not be isolated from cultures of normal organisms when aerated in lactose-free nutrient broth. The stimulatory effect of aeration on the production of lactose mutants is apparent only when lactose is present. When lactose broth cultures of Sh. sonnei were grown under anaerobic conditions, all cultures became acid on the sixth day of incubation, but lactose mutants were not detected. The possibility that this phenomenon might be due to reduction of the indicator or to accumulation of carbon dioxide was examined and ruled out experimentally. Acid did not occur in cultures grown anaerobically in nutrient broth without lactose indicating that the presence of lactose was required for the production of acid in these cultures. When lactose cells were inoculated into lactose: broth and grown anaerobically, acid appeared within forty-eight hours. Under these conditions the lactose mutants produced considerably more acid than did normal organisms. Furthermore, lactose mutants could be isolated from these cultures. It is apparent that anaerobic conditions inhibit the production of lactose mutants. Furthermore, it seems probable that the production of acid by normal Sh. sonnei growth under anaerobic conditions occurs by some unknown mechanism different from that used by lactose-fermenting mutants. Relative growth rates of lactose mutants and normal organisms were studied. Lactose mutants grew at a better rate in lactose synthetic broth than normal organisms when subcultured from cultures grown in nutrient broth. However, the lactose mutants did not grow as well in lactose as in glucose synthetic broth, a lag occurring in the rate of growth. Lactose mutants subcultured from lactose broth medium into fresh lactose synthetic broth did not grow significantly better than lactose organisms which were subcultured from nutrient broth. Therefore, it appeared that enzymatic adaptation did not occur in this mutant. It seems that this lactose mutant may differ from mutants described by other investigators. Ultraviolet irradiation of normal Sh. sonnei neither increased nor decreased the rate of production of lactose mutants. In addition, chemical mutagenic agents (<b>manganous</b> <b>chloride,</b> formaldehyde, phenol and sodium desoxycholate) were used in an effort to induce an increase in the rate of production of lactose mutants. Under these experimental conditions, the physical and chemical agents used had a lethal but not a mutagenic action on Sh. sonnei. Preliminary work suggested that aeration of lactose mutants in nutrient broth induced the rise of lactose mutants. This was confirmed in detailed studies which also indicated that these lactose mutants are favored by aeration in the absence of lactose. The results seem to point to the selective action of lactose in the rise of lactose mutants. However, the possibility of a stimulatory effect of lactose cannot be eliminated...|$|E
