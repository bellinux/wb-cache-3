40|$|To be able {{to provide}} {{uninterrupted}} high quality of experience to the subscribers, operators must ensure high reliability of their networks while aiming for zero downtime. With the growing complexity of the networks, there exists unprecedented challenges in network optimization and planning, especially activities such as cell outage detection (COD) and mitigation that are labour-intensive and costly. In this paper, we address the challenge of autonomous COD and cell outage compensation in self-organising networks (SON). COD is a pre-requisite to trigger fully automated self-healing recovery actions following cell outages or network failures. A special case of cell outage, referred to as sleeping cell, remains particularly challenging to detect in state-of-the-art SON, because it triggers no alarms for operation and <b>maintenance</b> <b>entity.</b> Consequently, no SON compensation function can be launched unless site visits or drive tests are performed, or complaints are received by affected customers. To address this issue, our COD solution leverages minimization of drive test functionality, recently specified in third generation partnership project Release 10 for LTE networks, in conjunction with state-of-the art machine learning methods. Subsequently, the proposed cell outage compensation mechanism utilises fuzzy-based reinforcement learning mechanism to fill the coverage gap and improve the quality of service, for the users in the identified outage zone, by reconfiguring the antenna and power parameters of the neighbouring cells. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can detect cell outage situations in an autonomous fashion and also compensate for the detected outage in a reliable manner...|$|E

40|$|The current {{practice}} of bridge maintenance decision-making {{is informed by}} subjective visual inspection data with a long time interval between measurements, which creates inefficiencies and possible loss of value in the <b>maintenance</b> <b>entity’s</b> capabilities. New opportunities from technology-related innovations for measurement devices are available for better-informed decision-making and for improved knowledge {{on the condition of}} a bridge. Even though, the adoption and use of these opportunities seems to be disregarded by the market and the main focus of innovation pushing organisations is mostly on the technical capabilities of these systems. This research presents a study on the effects of using technology-related opportunities on maintenance decision-making from a usercentric perspective. It performed a serious gaming experiment where bridge maintenance decision-making professionals were questioned to set up maintenance advices based on different types of data. No previous similar research was found through extensive literature search. Bridge deterioration scenarios were presented to experts throughout a within-subject fractional factorial experiment design. The experiment treatment groups consisted of data presentation from new innovative or potential bridge condition assessment mechanisms and the experiment control group consisted of the current data source, which is visual inspection. To observe the effects, the experiment used a quantitative and qualitative approach that considered expert judgement, maintenance decisions, and explanations of the experts for observing whether differences occurred between the different settings. It was indicated that significant differences were present if new data sources were added to the current visual inspection data, but no significant differences were observed between different types of data sources. It is expected that the differences are caused by the ability to observe quantified values of important performance indicators better, and that they provided indicative values that can be used during decision-making. It is expected that the latter described indifferences were caused by a lack of guidance by the market on how to use new data sources properly and consistently. These outcomes mean that for efficient and effective adoption of new data sources, more standards and guidelines about threshold values and causal links between deterioration parameters and possible deterioration causes are needed for practical guidance during maintenance decision-making. It suggests that in order to provide a broad facilitation for adoption of new data sources, long-term strategy behaviour must be considered by the market in order to provide a safe space for pilots and trials to learn about these innovations.

40|$|Automatic {{detection}} of cells {{which are in}} outage {{has been identified as}} one of the key use cases for Self Organizing Networks (SON) for emerging and future generations of cellular systems. A special case of cell outage, referred to as Sleeping Cell (SC) remains particularly challenging to detect in state of the art SON because in this case cell goes into outage or may perform poorly without triggering an alarm for Operation and <b>Maintenance</b> (O&M) <b>entity.</b> Consequently, no SON compensation function can be launched unless SC situation is detected via drive tests or through complaints registered by the affected customers. In this paper, we present a novel solution to address this problem that makes use of minimization of drive test (MDT) measurements recently standardized by 3 GPP and NGMN. To overcome the processing complexity challenge, the MDT measurements are projected to a low-dimensional space using multidimensional scaling method. Then we apply state of the art k-nearest neighbor and local outlier factor based anomaly detection models together with pre-processed MDT measurements to profile the network behaviour and to detect SC. Our numerical results show that our proposed solution can automate the SC detection process with 93 accuracy...|$|R

The technology used in the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia. While the Whipple truss bridge had waned in popularity by the 1890s, the bridges were commonly disassembled and re-erected for use on secondary roads, {{as was the case with}} the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge in 1938.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{advances}} in Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) technologies have enabled {{the use of}} P 2 P architectures for developing complex applications such as, Massively Multi-Player Online Games (MMOG). In this {{paper we address a}} challenging research problem related to P 2 P MMOGs; efficient <b>entity</b> <b>maintenance</b> and interaction. We have identified two opposing software engineering approaches to address this problem. The first approach assumes that the entire virtual world and the game logic are implemented using database techniques, e. g., with a distributed index over all the peers and the game semantics built into data query/update functions. The second approach is to separate the entities into completely independent processes, using agentoriented programming techniques. In our work, we propose a combination of these two approaches; the use of a distributed spatial index to facilitate the discovery and querying of relevant entities and an agent-based approach to facilitate real time interactions between the entities. We show the relevant factors for dynamic optimization and the use of a new software architecture with existing game libraries to implement the system. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN) <b>maintenance</b> using mobile <b>entities</b> called mules. The mules are deployed {{in the area of}} the WSN in such a way that would minimize the time it takes them to reach a failed sensor and fix it. The mules must constantly optimize their collective deployment to account for occupied mules. The objective is to define the optimal deployment and task allocation strategy for the mules, so that the sensors' downtime and the mules' traveling distance are minimized. Our solutions are inspired by research in the field of computational geometry and the design of our algorithms is based on state of the art approximation algorithms for the classical problem of facility location. Our empirical results demonstrate how cooperation enhances the team's performance, and indicate that a combination of k-Median based deployment with closest-available task allocation provides the best results in terms of minimizing the sensors' downtime but is inefficient in terms of the mules' travel distance. A k-Centroid based deployment produces good results in both criteria. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures, conferenc...|$|R

50|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.The technological design advances made by Whipple and Murphy, in addition to further advances in steel and iron fabrication, made wrought iron truss bridges a major industry in the United States. The Capon Lake bridge was a Whipple-Murphy truss bridge, since it incorporated Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords.

40|$|Often, {{the choice}} of the best {{maintenance}} strategies for the management of the housing capital takes as a basis situations or contingent choices, with the consequence of making a prevalent use of corrective maintenance, or of overlooking more appropriate estimative approaches. The work proposes the application of the method of the depreciated reconstruction cost (or depreciation cost approach) to the complex problem of the individuation of the most appropriate criteria for the management of the service life of a building component. Usually, in fact, there are various possibilities, which involve consequence that differ between them on an economic, technological and fruitional point of view: •	absence of interventions, in order to produce the ‘consumption’ of the performance of the component during its service life; •	regular activity of maintenance, which always allows performances to be close to their initial value, with little but constant shares of expense as a consequence; •	programmed interventions of <b>maintenance</b> of major <b>entity</b> in presence of significant decreases of the level of performance, in order to lengthen the service life of the component. The choice of the most appropriate strategy is often determined by issues tied to the opportunity of the moment, considering the available budget or the convenience in its immediate execution in opposition to the possibility to differ the moment of the intervention of maintenance. The aim of the present work is to offer a more reliable to individuate, for each component, which one is the most opportune strategy, considering the depreciation it is subjected to during time as a consequence of its performance decay, which is tied – as it is suggested by the methodology of the depreciated reconstruction cost – to physical wear and tear, income decay and functional obsolescence...|$|R
