40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>menogaril</b> and its major metabolite in animals and humans, N-demethylmenogaril, {{has been investigated}} in the human stem cell assay as developed by Salmon et al. Among 31 evaluable samples, four were sensitive to <b>menogaril,</b> including one which responded to N-demethylmenogaril. Three samples resistant to <b>menogaril</b> responded to N-demethylmenogaril. None was sensitive to doxorubicin. Overall, one out of seven ovarian samples and {{one out of three}} breast samples responded to <b>menogaril.</b> Our data confirm the in vitro {{activity of}} <b>menogaril</b> in ovarian and breast cancer; in addition, they suggest incomplete cross-resistance between doxorubicin and <b>menogaril</b> and, considering the concentrations of N-demethylmenogaril in animals and humans, a minor role for this metabolite in the overall antitumor activity of the parent compound. © 1986.

40|$|<b>Menogaril</b> is an {{anthracycline}} presently in Phase II clinical trials. Menogaril-resistant mouse leukaemia P 388 {{cells were}} developed in vitro by 4 months of exposure to step-wise increasing concentrations of <b>menogaril</b> after which resistant cells (P 388 /MEN) were cloned in 320 ng ml- 1 <b>menogaril.</b> P 388 /MEN cells were 40 -fold more resistant to <b>menogaril</b> in vitro compared to P 388 /O and were also resistant in vivo. Resistance to <b>menogaril</b> was stable for at least 2 months {{in the absence of}} the drug. The results indicate that P 388 /MEN, although resistant to an anthracycline, did not display the typical multidrug resistant phenotype. It was not cross-resistant to several structurally unrelated drugs such as actinomycin D, cisplatin, or vinblastine, but it was cross-resistant to the anthracycline, adriamycin. Uptake and efflux of <b>menogaril</b> was similar in sensitive and resistant cell lines. Also, resistance was not reversed by verapamil. No major karyotypic difference was noted between P 388 /O and P 388 /MEN. There was no significant amplification or overexpression of the mdr gene in P 388 /MEN compared to P 388 /O. In contrast to P 388 /MEN, P 388 cells resistant to adriamycin displayed the typical multidrug resistant phenotype. Glutathione content of P 388 /MEN cells was similar to that of P 388 /O and depletion of glutathione did not potentiate <b>menogaril</b> cytotoxicity. Therefore, we conclude that glutathione is not likely to be involved in <b>menogaril</b> resistance to P 388 /MEN cells...|$|E
40|$|Eighteen adult {{patients}} with solid tumors {{were treated with}} oral <b>menogaril,</b> a new anthracycline antibiotic active against human breast cancer after intravenous administration. The drug was given orally on 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks at doses ranging from 50 to 175 mg/m 2 /day. Reversible and dose-related leukopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. Thrombocytopenia was less frequent. Hematologic toxicity was maximal usually 2 weeks after treatment and recovery usually occurred within 4 weeks. At doses from 50 to 150 mg/m 2 /day, non-hematologic side-effects of oral <b>menogaril</b> were infrequent and mild and consisted of nausea and vomiting (one patient), alopecia (two patients), mucositis (two patients) and liver function test abnormalities (three patients). The single patient treated at a daily dose of 175 mg/m 2 /day developed grade IV leucothrombocytopenia, with fever and gastrointestinal bleeding. This was followed by heart failure and the patient died from multisystem organ failure. Peak plasma concentrations of <b>menogaril</b> ranged from 0. 043 to 0. 409 microM and were linearly correlated with the dose. Similarly, the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve varied from 0. 33 to 9. 59 microM X h and was linearly correlated with the dose. The mean harmonic half-life was 11. 3 +/- 6. 4 h. A comparison of {{the data from the}} present trial and our previous study with intravenous <b>menogaril</b> indicates a bioavailability of 32 +/- 12 %. There was an excellent relationship between the white blood cell decrease (as a percentage of the pretreatment value) and several pharmacokinetic parameters; the best correlation was obtained with the plasma concentration of <b>menogaril</b> at 4 h after treatment. A dose of 150 mg/m 2 /day for 3 consecutive days is recommended for phase II trials with oral <b>menogaril</b> but the bioavailability of the drug should be monitored carefully and, more specifically, the concept of a pharmacokinetic adjustment of the dose of <b>menogaril</b> should be evaluated prospectively.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} {{to obtain a}} better understanding of the cellular mode of action of the anthracycline drug <b>menogaril.</b> Comparative experiments demonstrated that <b>menogaril</b> was as cytotoxic as adriamycin against parental AUX B 1 Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), however, multidrug resistant (MDR) CHdollarlcub RrcubdollarC 5 CHO cells, which are characterized by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein relative to the parental cells, were less resistant to <b>menogaril.</b> When parental and MDR cells were exposed to equitoxic concentrations of both drugs, <b>menogaril</b> accumulated to a higher level, however, both drugs accumulated to a significantly higher level in the MDR cells. Immediately after exposure to either drug, (dollar 3 dollarH) -thymidine incorporation was inhibited, whereas (dollar 3 dollarH) -uridine and (dollar 3 dollarH) -leucine incorporation were altered 48 hours after exposure. Cellular morphology was not altered two hours after treatment with either drug, however, 48 hours after, exposure multinucleated cells were present. These cells contained surface blebs, stress fibers and an increased number of microtubules. Membrane fluidity increased in MDR cells after exposure to either drug but was not altered in the parental cells. Na/K ATPase activity was altered in parental cells after exposure to either drug, whereas neutral amino acid transport was altered 48 hours after exposure. These results suggest that DNA synthesis may be an important site of <b>menogaril</b> cytotoxicity and that perturbations in cell morphology and membrane function may be secondary. Adriamycin increased the rate of oxygen consumption to a greater extent than <b>menogaril</b> which may contribute to the difference in cardiotoxicity between the two drugs. While assessing the effects of both drugs on membrane function it was observed that the amount and rate of accumulation of neutral amino acids was depressed in MDR cells when compared to the parental cells, however, there was no difference in the rate of efflux. Verapamil which reversed the MDR phenotype did not return the kinetics of neutral amino acid transport to parental levels but did alter the transport in both cell lines. Collectively, these results suggest that P-glycoprotein is not directly involved in the altered amino acid transport in MDR cells...|$|E

40|$|Thirty-three adult {{patients}} with solid tumors {{were treated with}} <b>menogaril,</b> a new anthracycline antibiotic. The drug was given as a two-hour infusion every 4 to 5 weeks at doses ranging from 17 to 250 mg/m 2. The maximum tolerated dose was 250 mg/m 2. Reversible and dose-related leukopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. Thrombocytopenia was less frequent. Hematologic toxicity was maximal 2 weeks after treatment, and recovery usually occurred within 4 weeks. There was no dissociation between WBC and neutrophil counts, and myelosuppression {{did not appear to}} be cumulative up to 200 mg/m 2. Myelosuppression was more severe for {{patients with}} heavy pretreatment and/or bone marrow involvement. Local toxicity consisting of phlebitis and/or erythema was the most common nonhematologic toxicity, especially at 250 mg/m 2 (eight out of nine patients). Usually, erythema appeared within 24 hours after treatment at or near the infusion site and resolved within a few days. Occasionally, a more persistent (several weeks) orange discoloration suggesting cutaneous deposits of <b>menogaril</b> was observed. Nausea and vomiting were uncommon and never severe. Alopecia and mucositis were rare. Minor arrhtyhmias were seen in several patients during treatment, but their relationship with <b>menogaril</b> therapy was unclear, and in no patient did heart failure develop. Plasma concentrations were best described by a tricompartmental model with a mean terminal-life of 29. 5 hours and a mean total-body clearance of 20. 2 L/h/m 2. Doses of 160 and 200 mg/m 2 are recommended for phase II trials in poor- and good-risk patients, respectively. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|In a Phase I study, <b>menogaril</b> (7 -OMEN) was {{administered}} daily for 5 days/course, every 21 – 28 days. Dosages of 3. 5, 7, 11. 5, 17, and 31. 5 mg/m 2 were infused over 1 h, and dosages of 42, 50, and 56 mg/m 2 were infused over 2 h. Pharmacokinetics was studied at all dosages. Plasma and urine {{samples were collected}} from 24 patients, and bile samples were also collected from 2 patients. 7 -OMEN and metabolites were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. 7 -OMEN was the major plasma fluorescent species at all times, with only trace amounts of N-demethyl <b>menogaril</b> observed. 7 -OMEN disappeared from plasma biexponentially with t½ α 0. 19 ± 0. 04 (mean ± SE) h and t½ β 13. 22 ± 1. 54 h.

40|$|The {{effect of}} DNA binding on {{poisoning}} of human DNA TOP 1 {{has been studied}} using a pair of related anthracyclines which differ only by a nogalose sugar ring. We show that the nogalose sugar ring of nogalamycin, which binds to the minor groove of DNA, {{plays an important role}} in affecting topoisomerase-specific poisoning. Using purified mammalian topoisomerases, <b>menogaril</b> is shown to poison topoisomerase II but not topoisomerase I. By contrast, nogalamycin poisons topoisomerase I but not topoisomerase II. Consistent with the biochemical studies, CEM/VM- 1 cells which express drug-resistant TOP 2 alpha are cross-resistant to <b>menogaril</b> but not nogalamycin. The mechanism by which nogalamycin poisons topoisomerase I has been studied by analyzing a major topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage site induced by nogalamycin. This site is mapped to a sequence embedded in an AT-rich region with four scattered GC base pairs (bps) (at - 10, - 6, + 2, and + 12 positions). GC bps embedded in AT-rich regions are known to be essential for nogalamycin binding. Surprisingly, DNase I footprinting analysis of nogalamycin-DNA complexes has revealed a drug-free region from - 2 to + 9 encompassing the major cleavage site. Our results suggest that nogalamycin, in contrast to camptothecin, may stimulate TOP 1 cleavage by binding to a site(s) distal to the site of cleavage...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{chemotherapy}} usually {{fails to}} completely cure solid tumors due to surviving cells often repopulating the tumor or metastasizing to other sites. It {{is not clear}} whether tumor cells are apparently resistant due to a restricted drug penetration into the tumor mass, or whether the resistance is intrinsic being due to the tumor microenvironment.;We have used an in vitro model of tumor nodules, the multicell spheroid, to determine the apparent and intrinsic resistances of cells growing in contact in a tumor-like environment to two anthracyclines: adriamycin, and <b>menogaril,</b> and the anthracenedione mitoxantrone. A combination of HPLC, radiolabel, and flow cytometric techniques were used to measure the uptake of the three drugs by monolayers, 100 dollarμdollarm multicell spheroids, and 650 dollarμdollarm multicell spheroids. The 650 dollarμdollarm spheroids were dissociated into two fractions comprising an outer cell layer approximately 50 dollarμdollarm thick, which contained mostly oxygenated proliferating cells, and an inner cell layer approximately 100 dollarμdollarm thick, which contained a subpopulation of quiescent hypoxic cells. The toxicity of each of the three drugs, on the V 79 cells grown in the various culture conditions, was normalized to drug accumulation within the cells. The results demonstrate a restriction to drug uptake of approximately 5 fold in 650 dollarμdollarm spheroids compared to monolayers. The LDdollarlcub 90 rcubdollar of 650 dollarμdollarm spheroids exposed to the cytotoxic compounds was between 6 and 250 fold higher than in monolayers. However, once normalized for drug uptake, the LDdollarlcub 90 rcubdollar was approximately 4 - 40 fold greater for spheroids compared to monolayers. Adriamycin is more toxic to outer cells than inner cells by a factor of five, while outer cells and inner cells are equisensitive to mitoxantrone and <b>menogaril.</b> The data suggest that restricted drug penetration, or reduced accumulation by cells in multicell spheroids, only partially explains their resistance to three drugs. Hence, normalizing survival to drug uptake removes the apparent resistance factor from survival studies allowing the calculation of intrinsic resistance due to the spheroid microenvironment...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the metabolism and disposition, in rabbits, of <b>menogaril</b> (7 -OMEN), a new anthracycline antibiotic recently introduced into clinical trials. 7 -OMEN was administered by rapid i. v. injection at a dosage of 2. 5 mg/kg. 7 -OMEN and metabolites were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. Plasma concentrations of 7 -OMEN declined in biexponential fashion with a terminal half-life of 2. 7 h. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve was 1. 3 µM × h. The systemic clearance of 7 -OMEN was 57. 6 ml/min/kg. No metabolite of 7 -OMEN was detected in plasma. At 8 h after treatment, the cumulative urinary and biliary excretions of 7 -OMEN equivalents amounted to 1. 3 and 3. 4 % of the total administered dose, respectively. 7 -OMEN was the predominant fluorescent compound in urine, but four metabolites were also seen. In bile, 7 -OMEN represented only 9. 6 % of the cumulative excretion and six metabolites were observed. Among the organs, lungs contained the highest concentrations of parent drug. Substantial concentrations of metabolites were observed in the kidneys, liver, duodenum, and small intestine.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{an effort}} to develop a {{rational}} approach to identify anticancer agents with selective polypharmacology, we mined millions of docked protein-ligand complexes involving {{more than a thousand}} cancer targets from multiple signaling pathways to identify new structural templates for proven pharmaco-phores. Ourmethod combines support vectormachine-based scoring to enrich the initial library of 1592 molecules, with a fingerprint-based search formolecules that have the same binding profile as the EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib. Twelve new compounds were identified. In vitro activity assays revealed three inhibited EGFR with IC 50 values ranging from 250 nM to 200 μM. Additional in vitro studies with hERG, CYP 450, DNA, and cell culture-based assays further compared their proper-ties to erlotinib. One compound combined suitable pharmacokinetic properties while closely mimicking the binding profile of erlotinib. The compound also inhibited H 1299 and H 460 tumor cell proliferation. The other two compounds shared some of the binding profile of erlotinib, and one gave the most potent inhibition of tumor cell growth. Interestingly, among the compounds that had not shown inhibition of EGFR, four blocked H 1299 and H 460 proliferation, one potently with IC 50 values near 1 μM. This compound was from the <b>menogaril</b> family, which reached phase II clinical trials for the treatment of lymphomas. This suggests that our computational approach comparing binding profiles may have favored molecules with anticancer properties like erlotinib...|$|E
