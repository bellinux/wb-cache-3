50|$|A further {{strategy}} {{consists in}} using {{a set of}} electrodes with different sizes and shapes during the same EDM operation. This {{is often referred to}} as <b>multiple</b> <b>electrode</b> strategy, and is most common when the tool electrode replicates in negative the wanted shape and is advanced towards the blank along a single direction, usually the vertical direction (i.e. z-axis). This resembles the sink of the tool into the dielectric liquid in which the workpiece is immersed, so, not surprisingly, it {{is often referred to as}} die-sinking EDM (also called conventional EDM and ram EDM). The corresponding machines are often called sinker EDM. Usually, the electrodes of this type have quite complex forms. If the final geometry is obtained using a usually simple-shaped electrode which is moved along several directions and is possibly also subject to rotations, often the term EDM milling is used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objectives Use of potent {{antiplatelet}} drugs requires {{evaluation of}} platelet function. While platelet function in elective cases is usually assessed {{in a central}} laboratory environment, {{there is also an}} urgent need for rapid perioperative point-of-care assessment. Recently, <b>multiple</b> <b>electrode</b> platelet aggregometry has been developed and assumed to measure platelet function independent from platelet count. We tested the hypothesis that results of <b>multiple</b> <b>electrode</b> platelet aggregometry are affected by platelet count, in particular if platelet count is below normal range. Methods Whole blood samples from 20 healthy volunteers were prepared containing platelet concentrations of 50, 000, 100, 000, 150, 000, 200, 000, and 250, 000 μl - 1 while maintaining hematocrit. Platelet aggregation was induced by collagen, thrombin receptor activating peptide 6 (TRAP- 6), adenosine-diphoshate (ADP), and arachidonic acid, respectively, and aggregation was measured by <b>multiple</b> <b>electrode</b> platelet aggregometry (Multiplate™). Results Results of <b>multiple</b> <b>electrode</b> platelet aggregometry significantly decreased in blood samples with platelet count below normal range. Compared to results measured in blood samples with platelet count within normal range, aggregometry results decreased by 18. 4 % (p - 1, respectively. On the other hand, large interindividual variation has been observed and some blood samples showed normal results even with platelet counts of 50. 000 μl - 1. Conclusion The results obtained with Multiplate™ Analyzer are influenced by platelet function as well as platelet count thus displaying the overall platelet aggregability within the blood sample rather than platelet function alone. </p...|$|E

50|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>electrodes</b> record {{different}} waveforms {{for each}} individual spike elicited by the neurons {{in the vicinity of}} the electrodes. The geometric configuration of the electrodes can then be used to define additional dimensions to analyze which spikes originated from which individual cell in the recorded population of cells.

The most popular setup involves the use of four micro electrodes, called 'tetrodes' (different from the vacuum tube Tetrode), though more electrodes may be used.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: It {{is still}} debated {{to what extent}} {{intraoperative}} electrophysiological techniques contribute to the outcome of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation QBS). Intraoperative electrophysiological recordings for identification of the STN {{can be made with}} one <b>electrode</b> or with <b>multiple,</b> simultaneously implanted <b>electrodes.</b> The latter provide more detailed information about the electrophysiological boundaries of the STN; however, implantation of several electrodes at one time might increase the risk of bleeding. Here we report the results of a study of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, in which one group of patients underwent bilateral STN DBS with electrophysiological recordings from a single electrode, and the other group received STN DBS with multiple (five or fewer) simultaneously implanted electrodes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease who underwent bilateral STN stimulation were included in this study. Thirty-two patients underwent STN DBS guided by a single semi-microelectrode, and 23 patients underwent STN DBS guided with simultaneously implanted multiple microelectrodes. All patients were examined preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperatively with regard to activities of daily living, motor functions, and neuropsychological functions. RESULTS: We found that the simultaneous implantation of <b>multiple</b> <b>electrodes</b> does not increase the risk of bleeding or any other major intracranial complication. The use of <b>multiple</b> <b>electrodes</b> resulted in better motor results when compared with patients who underwent STN DBS guided with a single recording electrode. There were significantly more improvements in patients' tremor and rigidity, and as a consequence, a better total Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Part III score was identified during the medication-off phase. Despite better motor effects, patients treated with <b>multiple</b> <b>electrodes</b> showed subtle deterioration in neuropsychological functions, particularly in memory function. CONCLUSION: STN DBS performed with <b>multiple</b> electrophysiological recording <b>electrodes</b> resulted in better motor outcome but induced specific mild declines in neuropsychological functions...|$|R

30|$|Electrophysiological {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} the role of volume conduction, so that neural activities in one area are distributed on <b>multiple</b> <b>electrode</b> positions [21]. Due to this effect, the signals of some undesirable EEG rhythms (i.e., common components) are also recorded and mixed with the specific signals of different hand movements, which may deteriorate the classification results [7]. Although bipolar recording can eliminate this effect to some extent, it cannot completely remove all of those common components. Thus, we should consider the influence of those common components in selecting the ROI.|$|E
40|$|Cochlear {{implants}} (CIs) {{are able}} to restore hearing to many deaf individuals. Contemporary CIs work by converting acoustic signals into pulse trains of electric current delivered to the implanted electrodes. These pulse trains are amplitude-modulated by the changes in energy over time associated with the input signal. CI users’ perception of amplitude modulation (AM) relates strongly to speech perception. However, perception of AM might be quite different when delivered to a single electrode (as in most previous studies) or to <b>multiple</b> <b>electrodes</b> (as in this thesis). We studied tow forms of AM perception: 1) AM detection (sensitivity to changes in amplitude over time relative to steady pulse trains), and 2) AM discrimination (sensitivity to changes In AM frequency for modulated pulse trains). In clinical fitting of CIs, current levels on single electrodes must often be reduced to accommodate multi-electrode stimulation (“multi-channel loudness summation”). We found that these current level reductions may worsen multi-electrode AM detection, relative to AM detection on an equally loud single electrode. However, these current level reductions did not affect multi-electrode AM discrimination, where performance was similar between equally loud single- and multi-electrode stimuli. When different AM information was delivered to <b>multiple</b> <b>electrodes,</b> AM discrimination depended on the spacing of electrodes. When electrodes were closely spaced, CI listeners were very sensitive to differences in AM information delivered to the multiple channels. The results suggest that loudness summation and spacing of electrodes may greatly affect AM perception with <b>multiple</b> <b>electrodes...</b>|$|R

The model system used for the detection of copper comprised electrodes modified with a self-assembled monolayer. The electrodes were modified with the copper-complexing species (3 -mercaptopropionic acid, thioctic acid, and the peptides cysteine and Gly-Gly-His) and copper was determined over concentrations ranging from nanomolar to millimolar using voltammetric analysis. We have demonstrated that by combining the calibration functions from the four electrodes a better estimate (i. e. with smaller variance) of the concentration of the analyte is obtained. Measurement uncertainty is expressed for independently prepared electrodes, which allows the possibility of commercial production and factory calibration.

40|$|Meaningful and {{repeatable}} tactile sensations can be {{evoked by}} electrically stimulating primary somatosensory cortex. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) may thus {{be a viable}} approach to restore the sense of touch in individuals who have lost it, for example tetraplegic patients. One of the potential limitations of this approach, however, is that high levels of current can damage the neuronal tissue if the resulting current densities are too high. The limited range of safe ICMS amplitudes thus limits the dynamic range of ICMS-evoked sensations. One {{way to get around}} this limitation would be to distribute the ICMS over <b>multiple</b> <b>electrodes</b> in the hopes of intensifying the resulting percept without increasing the current density experienced by the neuronal tissue. Here, we test whether stimulating through <b>multiple</b> <b>electrodes</b> is a viable solution to increase the dynamic range of ICMS-elicited sensations without increasing the peak current density. To this end, we compare the ability of non-human primates to detect ICMS delivered through one versus <b>multiple</b> <b>electrodes.</b> We also compare their ability to discriminate pulse trains differing in amplitude when these are delivered through one or more electrodes. We find that increasing the number of electrodes through which ICMS is delivered only has a marginal effect on detectability or discriminability despite the fact that 2 - 4 times more current is delivered overall. Furthermore, the impact of multielectrode stimulation (or lack thereof) is found whether pulses are delivered synchronously or asynchronously, whether the leading phase of the pulses is cathodic or anodic, and regardless of the spatial configuration of the electrode groups...|$|R
