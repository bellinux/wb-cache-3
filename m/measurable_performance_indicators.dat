40|$|Abstract Background Timely {{decisions}} concerning mobilization and {{allocation of}} resources and distribution of casualties are crucial in medical management of major incidents. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate documented initial regional medical responses to major incidents by applying a set of 11 <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> for regional medical command and control and test the feasibility of the indicators. Methods Retrospective data were collected from documentation from regional medical command and control at major incidents that occurred in two Swedish County Councils. Each incident was assigned to one of nine different categories and 11 <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> for initial regional medical command and control were systematically applied. Two-way analysis of variance with one observation per cell was used for statistical analysis and the post hoc Tukey test was used for pairwise comparisons. Results The set of indicators for regional medical command and control could be applied in 102 of the 130 major incidents (78 %), but 36 incidents had to be excluded due to incomplete documentation. The indicators were not applicable as a set for 28 incidents (21. 5 %) due to different characteristics and time frames. Based on the indicators studied in 66 major incidents, the results demonstrate that the regional medical management performed according to the standard in the early phases (1 – 10 min after alert), but there were weaknesses in the secondary phase (10 – 30 min after alert). The significantly lowest scores were found for Indicator 8 (formulate general guidelines for response) and Indicator 10 (decide whether or not resources in own organization are adequate). Conclusions <b>Measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> for regional medical command and control can be applied to incidents that directly or indirectly involve casualties provided there is sufficient documentation available. <b>Measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> can enhance follow- up and be used as a structured quality control tool as well as constitute measurable parts of a nationally based follow-up system for major incidents.

40|$|Within {{the sport}} of cricket it is common {{practice}} for players to tap the blade of a bat with a hard wood mallet or cricket ball to gauge its potential playing performance. This subjective assessment can produce contradictory opinions on the same bat. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the reliability of the ‘tapping’ test in rating the potential performance of cricket bats. This was done by comparing a <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> (apparent coefficient of restitution, ACoR) to player assessment. Twenty experienced amateur and semi-pro cricketers completed a scaled-response questionnaire to describe the sound and feel of impact during the ‘tapping’ test, and rate the predicted performance. Correlations between player responses and ACoR were explored. Predicted bat performance by three out of twenty participants showed correlation with ACoR. It was concluded that the tapping test is not a reliable measure of bat performance across the study population. There are indications that individuals can correctly differentiate bats, but there is clear evidence that they also make errors. A further study with a larger number of participants and an exploration of the relative influence of sensory response will yield further insights to this pilot study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Workflow {{technology}} promises {{an increase}} in efficiency in the execution of business processes. The technology is widely accepted, but often the high costs exceed the promised benefits. Thus, it is desirable to calculate the profitability prior to investing into workflow technology. After an investment into workflow management systems (WFMS), {{it has to be}} verified whether the expected benefits have been realized or not. In this paper we present a method that covers both, the cost-benefit-ratio calculations specially customized for WFMS and the calculation of the realized savings. The profitability analysis is based on simple <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> that consider the tangible calculation of costs as well as the quantitative and qualitative benefits. Long time practical experience in implementing and operating workflow management supported the design of the method. The method presented in this paper has been successfully used in the IT company of a banking corporation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to fill a gap in the literature on internationalization, in relation to the absence of objective and <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> on the process of how firms sequentially enter external markets. To that end, this research develops a quantitative tool that can be used as a performance indicator of gradualness for firms entering external markets at a sectoral level. The performance indicator is based on firms' export volume, number of years of exporting, geographic areas targeted for export, and when exports were initiated for each area. Additionally, the indicator is tested empirically in the Spanish wine sector. The main contribution of this study is the creation of an international priority index which serves as a valuable and reliable tool because of its potential use in other industry sectors and geographic areas, allowing us to analyze how geographically differentiated internationalization strategies develop.

40|$|Long term {{performance}} based contracts (PBC), for pavement networks, involving public-private-partnerships, PBC/PPP, {{have been}} implemented in many countries worldwide. These are essentially an alliance to provide value for public dollars {{while at the same}} time providing adequate return on investment for the private sector concessionaire. The PPP/PBC contract typically includes financing, design, build/maintain and operate for periods of 30 years or more with explicit incorporation of performance targets or requirements and allocation of risk. In order for the concessionaire to meet the performance requirements, a set of realistic, <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> needs to be established and these should be tied to the agency’s policy objectives, which in turn are derived from the agency’s mission statement.

30|$|The {{objective}} of RQ 1 {{is to identify}} patterns in the current body of knowledge and to note weaknesses, whereas RQ 2 mainly intends to develop an extended list of <b>measurable</b> process <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> categorized into recognized performance perspectives, which can be tailored to diverse purposes. This list could, for instance, serve {{as a supplement to}} existing performance measurement models.

The study will thus not address the development of specific measurement systems but rather the indicators to be used within such systems. To make our intended list system-independent, we will begin with the BSC approach and extend its performance perspectives.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that companies face considerable difficulties in implementing a value-based management of their IT portfolios. This paper therefore presents an approach for measuring and managing the business value of IT investments. To ensure practicability, our approach is derived from a set of practice-based requirements extending previous empirical work. In our conceptual model we distinguish between capital budgeting and ongoing value management. For capital budgeting we propose to assess IT investments according to their expected business value by using net present value analysis and a scoring model. For ongoing value management we recommend to keep track of a set of project specific key performance indicators to ensure that the desired benefits are realized. In order to link these two fundamental processes, value drivers and <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> have to be identified. Thus we combine established evaluation for an integrated IT Portfolio assessment considering financial, non-financial and risk effects as well...|$|E

40|$|Efficiency in {{research}} and development (R&D), or more precisely in innovation processes, is to be considered as generating, evaluating and developing ideas in order to create new products, processes or services {{in a short period of}} time. Comparing innovation processes with e. g. production processes from the degrees of freedom point of view, innovation processes tend to be more creative. Therefore, the controlling of these processes in terms of efficiency is not widely used within companies due to the lack of key <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Whereas many <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> are available and are used to control the efficiency of production processes. Value stream mapping as a fast and easy approach to create transparency on the efficiency of production processes by analysing the key characteristics of the production process (value adding and waste) is commonly used within companies.

40|$|Software metrics are an {{essential}} part of Software Project Management, to quantitatively assess the status and performance of projects. Linking the performance of a software project to the department’s goals and thereby to the organization’s strategic objectives creates a powerful approach. Thus, a strategic objective can be seen in relation to the performance drivers that critically aect the organization’s ability to succeed. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) concept has become {{an essential}} cornerstone of the management system, in this scenario. BSC helps in identifying Critical Success Factors (CSFs) to achieve the organization’s vision and indicates its status with <b>measurable</b> Key <b>Performance</b> <b>Indicators</b> (KPIs), across four perspectives. These perspectives (Financial, Customer, Internal Business Process, Learning & Growth) allow companies to specify objectives which balance short-term nancial performance with the drivers of growth opportunities for the future. The Balanced Scorecard addresses performance management for the senior management in developing a balanced strategy and percolating it down to CSFs. These CSFs have to be then owned and managed by the Tactical and Operational managers in a performance management framework.

40|$|Training and {{exercises}} programmes are not independent activities, forming {{part of a}} larger, risk-based, process of disaster management preparedness. In order {{to have an impact}} on an individual's skills knowledge or behaviours, or to influence organizational learning or procedures, the programmes needs a cyclic and holistic approach. It should focus on clearly identified outcomes that are designed to meet the demands of identified gaps and emerging threats. This will support meaningful evaluations against clear indicators. Without having clear outcomes, standards or values, it is not possible to evaluate the effectiveness of a programme. These outcomes form <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> around which a detailed programme can be designed. Following delivery, analysis of the evaluation observations will identify critical gaps in knowledge, skills, behaviour or policy. This analysis allows clear, structured recommendations to be formulated that provide guidance as to the content of the continuing training programme cycle, prioritising key needs and ensuring maximum efficiency and utilisation of resources at all levels. By analysing and comparing six European Modules exercises (EU ModEx 2010 - 2011) and their outcomes we can demonstrate the benefits of this approach.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal in major incidents is to optimize {{care for the}} greatest number of patients. This means matching patients with facilities that have the appropriate resources available in sufficient quantities to provide the necessary care. A major incident is a situation where the available resources are inadequate in relation to the urgent need. As health care resources have become increasingly constrained, it is imperative that all resources be optimized from a regional and sometimes a national perspective. In Sweden, the number of major incidents per year is still unknown. In order to implement effective quality control of response to major incidents, specific standards for regional medical response need to be set and agreed on from a national perspective. This will probably also enhance follow-up and comparison of major incidents in the future. The overall aim of this thesis is to improve understanding of the demand for rapid and accurate regional medical response at major incidents. The objectives were to systematically analyse specific decisions within regional medical response and to identify factors that can influence patient outcome in major incidents. This research is based on four studies in which a set of 11 <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> for initial regional medical command and control have been used as an evaluation instrument together with a simulation system where the assessment of each patient could be evaluated. The collection of data was made during several disaster management programs but also in real major incidents that occurred in two county councils in Sweden. In one of the studies, the national disaster medical response plan for burns was evaluated. This research shows that <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> for regional medical response allow standardized evaluation such {{that it is possible to}} find crucial decisions that can be related to patient outcome. The indicators can be applied to major incidents that directly or indirectly involve casualties provided there is sufficient documentation available and thereby could constitute a measurable part of regional and national follow-up of major incidents. Reproducible simulations of mass casualty events that combine process and outcome indicators can create important results on medical surge capability and may serve to support disaster planning. The research also identified that there is a risk for delay in distribution of severely injured when many county councils needs to be involved due to different regional response times to major incidents. Furthermore, the coordination between health care and other authorities concerning ambulance helicopter transport in mass casualty events needs to be further addressed. It is concluded that there is a demand for rapid and accurate response to major incidents that is similar in all county councils. Like all other fields of medicine, these processes need to be quality assured...|$|E

Are we trapped in a positivist, new managerialist spiral of demonstrating the value of our work, or can we take the lead in reframing the discourse on how educational development proves its worth? This paper suggests that how we gather and present evidence is currently not fit for the purpose of demonstrating the value of educational development to our institutions. The paper argues that reconceptualising ‘impact’ as ‘evidencing value’ could release us from inadequate or instrumental approaches to evaluation. Evidencing does involve measuring and evaluating, but it also acknowledges the role of judgement, experience, and contextual knowledge in determining what needs to be evaluated, and how. It allows us to reconfigure what can legitimately be included in our heterogeneous mix of evaluation data.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that if the}} United States is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions it must aggressively address energy end use in the building sector. While {{there have been some}} notable but modest successes with mandatory and voluntary programs, there have also been puzzling failures to achieve expected savings. Collectively, these programs have not yet reached the majority of the building stock, nor have they yet routinely produced very large savings in individual buildings. Several trends that have the potential to change this are noteworthy: (1) the growing market interest in 'green buildings' and 'sustainable design', (2) the major professional societies (e. g. AIA, ASHRAE) have more aggressively adopted significant improvements in energy efficiency as strategic goals, e. g. targeting 'zero energy', carbon-neutral buildings by 2030. While this vision is widely accepted as desirable, unless there are significant changes to the way buildings are routinely designed, delivered and operated, zero energy buildings will remain a niche phenomenon rather than a sector-wide reality. Toward that end, a public/private coalition including the Alliance to Save Energy, LBNL, AIA, ASHRAE, USGBC and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) are developing an 'action plan' for moving the U.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{some results}} of the Institute of Energy activities under the SENUF initiative. The SENUF stands for the Safety of European Nuclear Facilities. The purpose of these activities was to prepare the preliminary set of maintenance related performance indicators {{to be used by}} nuclear power plants in their self evaluation practice and which can be used also as an objective criterion for benchmarking purposes. To develop a maintenance monitoring system, a broad research was carried out. The objective of the research studies was to analyze the current status in the evaluation of the maintenance effectiveness and efficiency by means of the selection of quantitative indicators. The studies were extended not only to the nuclear industry, but also to other industrial sectors with advanced maintenance strategies and advanced systems for maintenance performance evaluation. As an outcome of work done, quantitative indicators were selected and a maintenance performance monitoring framework was proposed. The proposed framework includes the maintenance performance monitoring system, which defines the hierarchical structure of performance indicators distributed in several hierarchical levels in accordance with the breaking of the maintenance process into the single elements. The system consists of three hierarchical levels. On the top of a hierarchical structure is the Maintenance Excellence, from which the attributes of the maintenance program are developed. Three attributes associated with the excellence of the maintenance program are proposed as a higher level of this structure. They are: preventive character of maintenance, maintenance management and maintenance budget. Using the attributes as a starting point, eight key performance indicators were proposed to cover the key aspects of maintenance. Finally each key performance indicator is supported by a set of specific indicators representing the measurable metrics of the maintenance program. In total forty-three (43) specific indicators were selected to cover all aspects of the maintenance program for nuclear power plants. The results presented in the paper are the initial step {{in the development of the}} framework for the monitoring of the maintenance efficiency using <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> The paper provides some recommendations to nuclear power plants for the implementation of the proposed maintenance performance indicators system.

40|$|This {{case study}} explores the {{relationship}} between the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (NDI), the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development (MLRD), and the Ministry of Justice (MJ) in the years 1998 through 2003. This period was characterized by a strong increase in the arrivals of asylum-seekers and massive critique of the immigration authorities by external actors. The study further explores how the principles of management by objectives and results (MBOR) are implemented in a policy sector characterized by a high degree of political salience and great complexity. The first three years were characterized by a lack of coordination between the parent ministries and different approaches to, and understanding of the MBOR system. Over time the Ministry of Local Government became the dominant parent ministry in regard to agency steering, while the directorate pushed {{for the development of a}} more realistic and binding steering dialogue. The Directorate of Immigration also tried to increase its institutional autonomy, while the ministries wanted to increase steering through an ever greater number of objectives and targets, which were not reached by the directorate. As the directorate over time was unable to live up these expectations, a crisis developed leading to an external examination of the directorate but also a strengthening of the steering capacity in the ministry. After the Ministry of Local Government became the sole parent ministry it became a more pronounced hierarchical agency steerer. The letter of allocation was still worked out with assistance from the NDI, but to a lesser extent than before. Additionally, the ministry stressed the use of quantitative, measurable targets and good steering information. A main finding is that the formal steering dialogue to a large extent dealt with administrative issues in the NDI and to a far lesser extent addressed policy issues. Another finding is that, in spite of the emphasis on measurable outcome targets, the majority of the targets continued to be “activity targets”, especially on the area of immigrant integration. Although there were developed more quantitative, <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> over time, there were continuous problems with making them both binding, unambiguous and realistic due to the lack of learning, the ever changing environmental factors and inadequate technology. The empirical material is analyzed through three main theoretical perspectives: a rational instrumental perspective, an institutional perspective and a consensus perspective. The agency steering can be best understood through the rational instrumental perspective as its instrumental functions increase over time...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Dutch HARM-Wrestling (HW) Task Force issued {{general and}} drug-specific {{recommendations}} {{aimed at reducing}} hospital admissions related to medication (HARMs). This study examines if the drug-specific recommendations could be converted into indicators that could be monitored in existing databases of general practitioner (GP) or community pharmacy (CP) data. The study also assesses the <b>performance</b> of these <b>indicators</b> {{before and during the}} official release of HW recommendations. METHODS: HW recommendations were divided into sub-recommendations. We studied to what extent these were measurable as indicators based on available information in both databases. For each <b>measurable</b> <b>indicator,</b> <b>performance</b> between 2007 and 2010 was determined and possibilities for further improvement were estimated. RESULTS: Thirty-four drug-specific HW recommendations were divided into 69 sub-recommendations, 32 of which were measurable as indicator in {{at least one of the}} databases. Application of these indicators between 2007 and 2010 showed that many of the indicators did not change over time.

Laboratories have a critical role to play in establishing and improving process capability and key <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> (KPI) of the organization. There are inevitably many opinions as to what a lean lab actually is; here is one version fr om. Quality assurance laboratories are crucial to the success of organization and this effectiveness needs to be measurable and demonstrable. To facilitate this, a method of measuring a laboratory's progress towards complete deployment has been created by lean tools. These tools allow laboratories to conduct gap analysis and identify opportunities for improvement...|$|R
40|$|The {{science of}} {{disaster}} medicine {{is more a}} descriptive than analytical type. Research, in most instances, has not employed quantitative methods and there is very sparse knowledge based on analytical statistics. One consequence {{of this is that}} similar mistakes are repeated over and over. Lessons that should be learned are merely observed. Moreover, there are almost no practical or ethical ways in which randomised controlled studies can be performed. The management, command and control of situations on different levels of hierarchy has eldom been evaluated and there have been no standards against which performance can be evaluated. Furthermore, the documentation of decisions and staff work is rarely sufficient enough to evaluate command and control functions. Setting standards that may be used as templates for evaluation and research is an issue that is constantly being addressed by leading experts in the field of disaster medicine and this is also an important issue that is expressed in the Utstein Template. Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, templates of performance indicators were developed. These were tested on reports available from incidents, and our conclusion was that documentation in this form was not adequate enough for use in this method of evaluation. Documentation must be improved and data probably need to be captured and stored with the help of information systems. A template developed for the evaluation of medical command and control at the scene was tested in standardised examinations. When using this template in this setting it was possible to obtain specific information on those aspects of command and control that need to be improved. An information system using on-line Internet technique was studied twice. The first study concluded that in spite of technical disturbances the system was acceptable to the organisation but could not yet be recommended for use during major incidents. The second study concluded that the retrieval of information was, in all respects not as good as the control system, a conventional ambulance file system. In a study of staff procedure skills during training of management staffs in command and control it was concluded that documentation during training sessions was not adequate and this lack of staff procedure skills could possibly be a contributing factor to the fact that lessons in command and control are not learned from incidents. Conclusions in thesis are that <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> can be used in the training of command and control. If performance indicators are to be used in real incidents and disasters, functioning information systems have to be developed. This may lead to a better knowledge of command and control and could possibly contribute to a process where lessons are learned and mistakes are not repeated...|$|E
40|$|Background: Disaster {{exercises}} and simulations serves as teaching and training tool for improving medical response in disaster preparedness. Rapid and effective medical response in major incidents {{is known as}} a “key phase” to optimise resources, and this requires that management systems have an “all hazards” approach. Decision-making at all levels of management is based on available information and involves allocation of medical resources and triage decisions. Aim: The overall aim of this thesis was to increase our knowledge of the impact of quantitative evaluation of medical response on disaster preparedness. The specific aims were: to increase the ability to learn from full-scale exercises by applying quality indicators at two levels of command and control (I, II); to identify key indicators essential for initial disaster medical response registration (III); to explore ambulance staff attitudes towards practising triage tagging (IV); and to increase our knowledge of the applicability of a technical support system and its potential to provide real-time, overall situation awareness available to those overseeing the medical management of the operation. Methods: Study I, II and V were observational studies based on data collections from full-scale exercises. Templates with <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> for evaluation of command and control were used in Study I and II and the same performance indicators combined with outcome indicators was also included in Study II. A consensus method, the Delphi technique, with 30 experts was used in Study III. Study IV used mixed methods, a pre-and post web survey answered by ambulance nurses and physicians (n= 57 respectively 57) before and after a time limited strategy with triage tags and three focus groups interviews comprising 21 ambulance nurses and emergency medical technicians. Study V used major two incidents simulations to test the applicability of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID tags) technology and compare it with traditionally paper-based triage tags (n= 20 respectively 20). The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and content analysis was used for the qualitative data. Results: The evaluation model exposed several problems occurring in the initial decision-making process that were repeatedly observed (I, II). These results in study II also demonstrated to {{have a major impact on}} patient outcome. Out of 17 severely injured patients five respectively seven were at risk for preventable death. A total of 97 statements were generated, of these 77 statements reached experts consensus, and 20 did not (III). Ambulance staffs believe in the usefulness of standardised triage methods, but the sparse application of triage tags at the scene indicates that the tags are not used frequently. Infrequent use in daily practice prevents participants from feeling confident with the triage tool (IV). The Radio Frequency Identification system improved situational awareness in disaster management. Triage information was available at least one hour earlier compared to a paper-based triage system (V). Conclusions: The presented evaluation model can be used in an objective, systematic and reproducible way to evaluate complex medical responses, which is a prerequisite for quality assurance, identification of problems, and the development of disaster preparedness...|$|E
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses {{the efforts of the}} Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) [...] a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) [...] to measure and assess national capabilities to respond to a major disaster. According to the Congressional Research Service, from fiscal years 2002 through 2010, Congress appropriated over $ 34 billion for homeland security preparedness grant programs to enhance the capabilities of state, territory, local, and tribal governments to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks and other disasters. Congress enacted the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (Post-Katrina Act) to address shortcomings in the preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina that, among other things, gave FEMA responsibility for leading the nation in developing a national preparedness system. The Post-Katrina Act requires that FEMA develop a national preparedness system and assess preparedness capabilities [...] capabilities needed to respond effectively to disasters [...] to determine the nation's preparedness capability levels and the resources needed to achieve desired levels of capability. Federal, state, and local resources provide capabilities for different levels of "incident effect" (i. e., the extent of damage caused by a natural or manmade disaster). FEMA's National Preparedness Directorate within its Protection and National Preparedness organization is responsible for developing and implementing a system for measuring and assessing national preparedness capabilities. The need to define measurable national preparedness capabilities is a well-established and recognized issue. For example, in December 2003, the Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response Capabilities noted that preparedness (for combating terrorism) requires measurable demonstrated capacity by communities, states, and private sector entities throughout the United States to respond to threats with well-planned, well-coordinated, and effective efforts. This is consistent with our April 2002 testimony on national preparedness, in which we identified the need for goals and performance indicators to guide the nation's preparedness efforts and help to objectively assess the results of federal investments. We reported that FEMA had not yet defined the outcomes of where the nation should be in terms of domestic preparedness. Thus, identifying <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> could help FEMA (1) track progress toward established goals, (2) provide policy makers with the information they need to make rational resource allocations, and (3) provide program managers with the data needed to effect continual improvements, measure progress, and to enforce accountability. In September 2007, DHS issued the National Preparedness Guidelines that describe a national framework for capabilities-based preparedness as a systematic effort that includes sequential steps to first determine capability requirements and then assess current capability levels. According to the Guidelines, the results of this analysis provide a basis to identify, analyze, and choose options to address capability gaps and deficiencies, allocate funds, and assess and report the results. This proposed framework reflects critical practices we have identified for government performance and results. This statement is based on our prior work issued from July 2005 through October 2010 on DHS's and FEMA's efforts to develop and implement a national framework for assessing preparedness capabilities at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as DHS's and FEMA's efforts to develop and use metrics to define capability levels, identify capability gaps, and prioritize national preparedness investments to fill the most critical capability gaps. As requested, this testimony focuses {{on the extent to which}} DHS and FEMA have made progress in measuring national preparedness by assessing capabilities and addressing related challenges. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{long term}} {{warranty}} or performance based contracts (PBC’s) for periods of 10 {{years or more}} {{has proven to be}} an effective means for sustained preservation of pavement networks. A transfer of risk to the contractor is involved, but there is also increased potential for innovation. There are several keys to maximizing benefits to both the agency and the contractor in long term PBC’s and they range from commitment by both parties to objectively based, <b>measurable</b> <b>performance</b> criteria or warranties to harmonized measurement methods. As well, {{it is important that the}} agency has established realistic policy objectives which can be linked to <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and in turn to implementation targets/warranties. A real world network example from the June 2008 International Conference on Managing Pavement Assets in Calgary provides a comprehensive set of policy objectives – <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> – implementation targets and demonstrates that they can in fact be achieved. Another example from a 10 year PBC shows that the original pre-contract targets for network roughness, rutting, cracking and structural adequacy were realistic in that they were met or exceeded at the end of the contract period. These examples, and other evidence, clearly demonstrate that long term performance based contracts for pavement networks can provide significant benefits to all stakeholders and that well founded realistic warranties/implementation targets are key to success...|$|R

This paper reflects on the coherence between public values, <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and operational actions. We focus on two important quality aspects in two network-based industries: punctuality for the rail sector and interruption of supply for the electricity sector. We observe that <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> in both industries are weakly related to public values and to operational actions. However, although <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> have a limited meaning, they still can {{play a role in the}} safeguarding of public values. ...|$|R
