The theoretical model of rock breakage by <b>mechanical</b> <b>tool</b> was developed based on the rock fracture mechanics and the solution of Boussinesq’s problem, and it could explain the process of rock fragmentation as well as predicating the peak reacting force. The theoretical model of rock breakage by coupled mechanical and hydraulic action was developed according to the superposition principle of intensity factors at the crack tip, and the reacting force of <b>mechanical</b> <b>tool</b> assisted by hydraulic action could be reduced obviously if the crack with a critical length could be produced by mechanical or hydraulic impact. The experimental results indicated that the peak reacting force could be reduced about 15 % assisted by medium water pressure, and quick reduction of reacting force after peak value decreased the specific energy consumption of rock fragmentation by <b>mechanical</b> <b>tool.</b> The crack formation by mechanical or hydraulic impact was the prerequisite to improvement of the ability of combined breakage...|$|R
40|$|Abstmd-In the {{companion}} paper [l], a control law ren-ders a 2 x 1 -degree of freedom (DOF) nonlinear teleoperator (consisting of n-DOF master and slave robots) as a n-DOF common passive <b>mechanical</b> <b>tool</b> {{which has the}} usual robotic dynamics. In this paper, we develop a control methodology to endow the resulting n-DOF common passive <b>mechanical</b> <b>tool</b> with useful passive tool dynamics which incorporates inertia scaling, guidance / avoidance system while preserv-ing energetic passivity of the closed-loop system. A ficti-tious energy storage is used to scale the apparent inertia of the teleoperator. The passive velocity field control [2] for a velocity field tracking and artificial potential function are utilized for guidance / avoidance system. Thus, with the control law proposed in [l], the control law renders the. 211 -DOF teleoperator as a n-DOF common passive <b>mechanical</b> <b>tool</b> which has programmable apparent inertia and moves under the effects of. velocity / potential field tailored to-task objectives and obstacles in the workspace.
