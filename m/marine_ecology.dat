40|$|ABSTRACT. For {{more than}} 50 years, organic chemists have been {{interested}} in the novel chemical structures and biological activities of marine natural products, which are organic compounds {{that can be used for}} chemical defense and chemical communication by diverse <b>marine</b> organisms. Chemi-cal <b>ecology,</b> the study of the natural ecological functions of these compounds, is an interdisciplinary field involving chemistry, biology, and ecology. Examples of ecological functions of marine natural products include distastefulness that inhibits feeding by predators, settlement cues for larvae, alle-lopathic effects that prevent fouling by epiphytes and overgrowth by competitors, and pheromones for mate- searching behavior. Much of the research in marine natural products and <b>marine</b> chemical <b>ecology</b> has used scuba diving and related undersea technologies as necessary tools. The breadth of marine organisms studied and the types of experiments conducted under water have expanded with technological developments, especially scuba diving. In this paper, we highlight the importance of scuba and related technologies as tools for advancing <b>marine</b> chemical <b>ecology</b> by using examples from some of our own research and other selected studies. We trace the origins of <b>marine</b> chemical <b>ecology</b> on the heels of marine natural products chemistry in the 1970 s and 1980 s, followed by the development of increasingly sophisticated ecological studies of marine algae and invertebrates in Caribbean, tropical Pacific, and Antarctic waters...|$|R

25|$|H. Bruce Franklin (born February 1934), is an American {{cultural}} {{historian and}} scholar. He is notable for receiving top awards for his lifetime scholarship in fields {{as diverse as}} American studies, science fiction, prison literature and <b>marine</b> <b>ecology.</b> He has written or edited nineteen books and three hundred professional articles and participated in making four films. His main areas of academic focus are science fiction, prison literature, environmentalism, the Vietnam War and its aftermath, and American cultural history. He was instrumental in helping to debunk false public speculation that Vietnam was continuing to hold prisoners of war. He helped to establish science fiction writing as a genre worthy of serious academic study. In 2008, the American Studies Association awarded him the Pearson-Bode Prize for Lifetime Achievement in American Studies. A critic of the Vietnam War, he was fired from Stanford in 1972 for allegedly inciting to riot, and the termination brought nationwide attention {{to the issue of}} academic freedom. Since 1975, he is the John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey.|$|E
