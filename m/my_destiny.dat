If it's <b>my</b> <b>destiny,</b> fine." [...] In July, Butler said {{that there would be no}} reunion in 2011, as Osbourne was already committed to touring with his solo band.

500|$|Dust Be <b>My</b> <b>Destiny,</b> co-written in 1939 by Rossen, is {{the story}} of a {{fugitive}} from justice who is eventually acquitted with help from an attorney and a journalist, the latter arguing that [...] "a million boys all over the country" [...] were in a similar plight. Warner Bros. then ordered producer Lou Edelman to cut the script, adding that [...] "This {{is the story}} of two people – not a group. It is an individual problem – not a national one." [...] Rossen was one of three writers on the gangster melodrama The Roaring Twenties, released in 1939. A remake of the 1932 play and film Life Begins was written in 1939 by Rossen and released in 1940 as A Child Is Born. The plot recounted the experiences of six expectant mothers, and there was little scope to modify the original.|$|E

500|$|Rossen {{was one of}} the {{directors}} who developed film gris (French for [...] "grey film"). In his films for Warner Brothers' between 1937 and 1944, consistent themes were the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. After Dust Be <b>My</b> <b>Destiny,</b> written by Rossen and released in 1939, Frank Nugent, who regularly reviewed for The New York Times, complained about Warner Brothers' long line of melodramas about boys from poor neighbourhoods. Unlike filmmakers such as John Ford and Howard Hawks, Rossen was willing to explain his aims as a director: [...] "The element common to many of my films is the desire for success, ambition, which is an important element in American life. It is an important element, and has become increasingly more important in what is known as Western Civilization." [...] Polonsky commented that [...] "Rossen's talent is force applied everywhere without let-up." [...] Neve acknowledged that social concerns were central in most of Rossen's works, but commented that Lilith was different from Rossen's earlier films as it emphasized mood rather than narrative and examined through pictures and silences the nature of maladjustment and madness.|$|E
500|$|For an hour De Winter {{continued}} his resistance, with Director holding station off {{the stern of}} Vrijheid and repeatedly raking it. By 15:00, all three masts had been brought down, obstructing the fire of the starboard battery, while De Winter was the only officer who remained uninjured, standing on his wrecked quarterdeck and still refusing to lower his colours. In an attempt to settle the combat, Captain William Bligh of Director closed to within [...] of the Dutch flagship and demanded to know if De Winter surrendered. The Dutch admiral replied [...] "What {{do you think about}} it?", and then attempted to personally raise signals demanding reinforcements from the rest of his fleet, only to find that the halyards had been shot away. De Winter then summoned the ship's carpenter and ordered him to repair his barge, so that the admiral could transfer command to another ship and continue the battle. When British sailors from Director boarded the drifting flagship, De Winter was discovered [...] assisting the carpenter with repairs to the barge. On being informed that he was a prisoner of war, he replied [...] "This is <b>my</b> <b>destiny</b> not foreseen" [...] and, after checking on a mortally wounded officer who lay on the quarterdeck, he followed the boarding party back to their boat for the trip to Venerable.|$|E
