25|$|Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB)(C45H44N3NaO7S2; mW: 825.97) is {{the most}} popular protein stain. It is an anionic dye, which non-specifically binds to proteins. The {{structure}} of CBB is predominantly non-polar, and it is usually used in <b>methanolic</b> solution acidified with acetic acid. Proteins in the gel are fixed by acetic acid and simultaneously stained. The excess dye incorporated into the gel can be removed by destaining with the same solution without the dye. The proteins are detected as blue bands on a clear background. As SDS is also anionic, it may interfere with staining process. Therefore, large volume of staining solution is recommended, at least ten times the volume of the gel.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't until 1962 {{until the}} first {{isolation}} of orellanine was done. The first <b>methanolic</b> extraction and isolation of orellanine was done by Stanisław Grzymala and isolated from the mushroom Cortinarius orellanus. Along with the isolation of orellanine, Grzymala was also able to demonstrate the nephrotoxicity of Cortinarius orellanus and determine various {{physical and chemical properties}} of orellanine. He found that the toxicity of the mushrooms was linked to delayed and acute renal failure, as well as when the isolated white crystalline substance was heated above 150 ̊C it began to slowly decompose. After this first isolation of orellanine, the structure of orellanine was first discovered by Antkowiak and Gessner in 1979. Orellanine’s structure was found to be 3,3',4,4'-tetrahydroxy- 2,2'-bipyridine-l,l'-dioxide. Antkowiak and Gessner were also able to determine that orellanine was the mono-N-oxide of orelline, which was the decomposition product of orellanine. It was also found that orelline was non-toxic. The first successful synthesis of orellanine was done in 1985. Tiecco, M. et. Al. completed a total synthesis of orellanine using commercially available 3-hydroxypyridine. After the first successful synthesis, the structure was confirmed in 1987 by Cohen-Addad et al. in 1987 by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
500|$|Steroidal compounds, {{like those}} {{isolated}} from P.ellipsoideus, can have pharmacological or taxonomical applications; for instance, some {{can act as}} anti-inflammatories (including ergosterol) or inhibit tumour growth. The 2011 study concluded that, as P.ellipsoideus contained {{a large number of}} diverse steroidal compounds, there may be comparatively high pharmacological activity in the fungus; however, more research would be needed to confirm this.
