In this phase, the circulating scrap and the sand are recovered to be re-used in the production process. Finally, the finishing phase includes the shot blasting (necessary to eliminate the remaining sand), the deburring (can be automatic or manual) and, eventually, the painting.|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{presented}} are {{results of a}} research on influence of electrical and physico-chemical properties of materials being parts of multicomponent and multimaterial systems used in foundry practice on efficiency and effectiveness of microwave heating. Effectiveness of the process was evaluated {{on the grounds of}} analysis of interaction between selected parameters of permittivity and loss factor, as well as collective index of energy absorbed, reflected and transmitted by these materials. In the examinations used was a stand of waveguide resonance cavity for determining electrical properties and a stand of microwave slot line for determining balance of microwave power emitted into selected materials. The examinations have brought closer the possibility of forecasting the behaviour of multimaterial systems like e. g. model, moulding sand or <b>moulding</b> <b>box</b> in microwave field on the grounds of various electrical and physico-chemical properties. On the grounds of analysis of the results, possible was selecting a group of materials designed for building foundry instrumentation to be effectively used in electromagnetic field...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve the {{production}} of clay bricks for housing and general construction purposes, a 215 X 102. 5 X 65 mm manual brick moulding machine was designed and fabricated. The machine parts were made of mild steel, because of its availability and versatile machinability. The efficiency of the machine was examined using local clay, sourced within the University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria. Water {{was added to the}} clay after sieving to form a paste, and then packed into a <b>mould</b> <b>box,</b> before manually rammed and compacted with the machine mould cover. This process allowed for the formation of required shape, which was sent to kiln for baking to obtain stronger bricks. The machine is capable of producing a total of four bricks at a time using the available four <b>mould</b> <b>boxes.</b> The production time of the four bricks was found to be relatively equal to the time used by an automated one to produce equal number of bricks, indicating favourable efficiency. Thus, the fabricated manual machine can be used for mass production of clay bricks for improved and effective housing delivery...|$|R

We suggest strategies to minimise the damage, including venting of the volatiles, ventilation of the pallet grooves during cooling and minimisation of brushing effects during cleaning. Some calculations are described in an attempt to quantify the various effects discussed, but we are unable to accurately estimate their significance...|$|R
40|$|This {{is a book}} chapter. Fundamental to the {{understanding}} of furniture is an interest in the continuities and changes in the use of tools, and the application of techniques to furniture making. The development of tools over a long period established ‘type-forms’ that often remain the basis of hand tools (and in many cases powered versions) that are used today. Although most tools could be purchased from tool suppliers, there has been, and still is, a tradition of furniture-makers devising and making their own versions of tools for their own use. These included for example, bevels, braces, clamps, scratch stocks, <b>moulding</b> <b>boxes,</b> saw frames, gauges, lathes, planes and squares. This article briefly traces the development of the various processes and associated tools, from cutting out and shaping, construction and assembly and decoration in the period 1600 - 1840...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a research on abrasion resistance of selected construction materials designed for foundry tooling {{applied in the}} innovative microwave heating process of moulding and core sands. One of the main selection criteria of the materials for foundry tooling, in particular for models, <b>moulding</b> boards, <b>moulding</b> <b>boxes</b> and core boxes, is their good abrasive wear resistance. Usability of the selected polymeric materials, designed for foundry tooling used in electromagnetic field, is decided also by other evaluation criteria determined in the examinations, like thermal resistance and electrical properties. Abrasion resistance of the selected materials was determined for three grades of the moulding sand matrixes. Combined analysis of the determined abrasion resistance, considering also electrical properties and thermal resistance of the foundry tooling materials, characterising their usability for microwave heating of moulding and core sands, will make possible their systemising with respect to effectiveness and efficiency of the heating process, taking under consideration durability of such foundry tooling {{to be used in}} industrial conditions...|$|R

40|$|Currently on the mould-making {{machines}} {{market the}} companies like: DiSA, KUENKEL WAGNER, HAFLINGER, HEINRICH WAGNER SINTO, HUNTER, SAVELLI AND TECHNICAL play significant role. These companies are {{the manufacturers of}} various solutions in machines and instalations applied in foundry engineering. Automatic foundry machines for compaction of green sand have the major role in mechanisation and automation processes of making the mould. The concept of operation of automatic machines {{is based on the}} static and dynamic methods of compacting the green sand. The method which gains the importance is the compacting method by using the energy of the air pressure. It's the initial stage or the supporting process of compacting the green sand. However in the automatic mould making machines using this method it's essential to use the additional compaction of the mass in order to receive the final parameters of the form. In the constructional solutions of the machines there is the additional division which concerns the method of putting the sand into the <b>mould</b> <b>box.</b> This division distinquishes the transport of the sand with simultaneous compaction or the putting of the sand without the pre-compaction. As the solutions of the major manufacturers are often the subject for application in various foundries, the authors of the paper would like/have the confidence to present their own evaluation process confirmed by their own researches and independent analysis of the producers' solutions...|$|R

5000|$|All Bristols {{included}} an interior overhead fiberglass headliner that hid rough, irregular fiberglass {{on the inside}} of the cabin. The cabinetry was fiberglassed to the hull, rather than using an interior liner with molded cabinetry, which significantly added to the structural integrity of the hull. The cabinetry was built from 3/4" [...] mahogany plywood, attached with bronze wood screws and glued. The hulls of early Bristols were all solid, hand-laid fiberglass. The decks and cabin tops were cored with end-grain balsa. The cored structure extended to the cockpit seat tops and the cockpit sole. Rudder posts and propeller shafts were solid bronze. Bronze Wilcox Crittenden tapered-plug seacocks were used on all underwater thru-hulls. A distinguishing feature of virtually all Bristol models included at least two <b>moulded</b> dorade <b>boxes</b> on the cabin top abaft the mast step that allowed ventilation in rough seas or rainy weather.|$|R
40|$|Polythene lined thermocole {{insulated}} plywood boxes (second-hand tea chests) {{could be}} successfully used for transport of fresh iced fish. It {{was found that}} a minimum of 25 mm thermocole insulation was necessary during summer (April to June) and 15 mm during winter (Nov. to March). By using these insulated boxes the initial fish to ice ratio could be brought down to 1 : 0. 75 and still further to 1 : 0. 5 {{at the height of}} winter in Jan. and Feb. These second-hand tea chests are robust and are able to stand a minimum of 5 trips to and fro. The <b>moulded</b> polystyrene <b>boxes</b> are not suited for long distance transport. Another redeeming feature in the entire operation was that there was practically no loss of fish due to spoilage in transit. 100 % of the fish transported was in acceptable condition and could be marketed. In the non-insulated boxes used by the trade, the loss due to spoilage ranged from 10 % to 25 %, and this could be completely eliminated by the use of these insulated boxes...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{endangered}} assemblages of species in Europe is saproxylic beetles associated with old trees. To be able to conserve these species {{there is a need}} of developing methods to survey the fauna and to evaluate the conservation value of different oak habitats, develop instruments for landscape planning and detailed knowledge of species habitat requirements. The results are based on a data set from window and pit-fall trapping of saproxylic beetles at 94 different sites spread over four regions in southern Sweden. Additionally, 48 wooden boxes with artificial wood mould, consisting mainly of oak saw dust and oak leaves and some varying additional substrates, were studied for three years at three of the sites and their vicinities. A comparison of three methods to assess species richness and composition of the saproxylic beetle fauna in standing hollow oaks showed that all trapping methods were effective in detecting species, but as they partially target different assemblages of species it is profitable to combine the methods. Window traps gave most species but wood mould sampling is the cheapest method to sample the fauna. It was possible to predict the conservation value individual oak patches with sets of indicator species of saproxylic beetles with regard to number of species or presence of conservation priority species. Indicator sets of species effectively caught with pitfall traps gave the overall best predictions. When comparing different treatment of species indata, the explanatory power of predictions was strongest for presence/absence data. Predictions of species number and an index worked well within the same regions but gave varied result for three other regions, which shows that transferability of indicators between regions may be doubtful. Species richness was greatest in stands with large, free-standing trees. Among individual trees, large girth as well as low canopy cover, increased frequency of occurrence for several species. Forest regrowth was found to be detrimental for many beetle species. An evaluation of to what extent artificial habitats, mimicking the conditions in hollow oaks, can be exploited by saproxylic beetles showed that nearly 70 % of the species found in hollow oaks was found in artificial wood <b>mould</b> <b>boxes.</b> A dead hen added to the artificial wood mould gave a higher number of beetle specimens. The number of species associated with tree hollows in oak decreased with distance from sites with hollow oaks. An analysis of species assemblages at 38 sites and positions of 33 000 large/hollow oaks showed that different beetle species dependent on a single substrate, hollow oaks, responded to different scales. The total species richness responded to a scale of 859 m and the characteristic scale of response for single species varied between 52 m and 5284 m. Several species were sensitive both to smaller and larger scales. As most sites with endangered beetles living in old oaks are small and isolated, ongoing management directed to keep old oaks free standing and sun exposed and to ensure the recruitment of young oaks, and the restoration of abandoned pasture woodlands should have a high priority in nature conservation. Artificial habitats may in critical areas be created to fill gaps in old oak habitat for parts of the species assemblage. To preserve the saproxylic beetle fauna dependent on old oaks, it is important to retain and create suitable habitats both in local stands and at the landscape level, from single hectares up to hundreds of hectares depending on the species. In some landscape, creations of new oak areas in the fragmented landscape are crucial for long-term survival of sensitive species...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a practical example of improving quality and occupational safety on automated casting lines.

To carry out the research, a simulation model of a line in universal Arena software for modelling and simulation of manufacturing systems by Rockwell Software Inc. was created. A simulation experiment was carried out on a model in order to determine basic parameters of the working system. Organization and working conditions in other sections of the line were also analysed, paying particular attention to quality, ergonomics and occupational safety. Ergonomics analysis was carried out on manual cores installation workplace and filters installation workplace, and changes to these workplaces were suggested in order to eliminate actions being unnecessary and onerous for employees...|$|R
