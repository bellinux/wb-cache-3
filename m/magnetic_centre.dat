40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of the high}} energy e+ e- linear collider CLIC (Compact Linear Collider) is very dependent {{on the ability to}} accurately pre-align its components. There are two 20 km long Main Linacs which meet in an interaction point (IP). The Main Linacs are composed of thousands of 2 m long modules. One of the challenges is to meet very tight alignment tolerances at the level of CLIC module: for example, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>centre</b> of a Drive Beam Quad needs to be aligned within 20 µm rms with respect to a straight line.

The hybrid SiO(2) @APS/DTPA:Gd:Ln (Ln = Eu(3 +) or Tb(3 +)) (APS: 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane, DTPA: diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) system increases the payload of the active <b>magnetic</b> <b>centre</b> (Gd(3 +)) and introduces a Ln(3 +) long-life excited state (Eu(3 +) : 0. 35  ±  0. 02  ms, Tb(3 +) : 1. 87  ±  0. 02  ms), with resistance to photobleaching and sharp emission bands. The Eu(3 +) ions reside in a single low-symmetry site. Although the photoluminescence emission is not influenced by the simultaneous presence of Gd(3 +) and Eu(3 +), a moderate r(1) increase and a larger enhancement of r(2) are observed, particularly at high fields, due to susceptibility effects on r(2). The presence of Tb(3 +) instead of Eu(3 +) further raises r(1) but decreases r(2). These values are constant over a wide (5 - 13) pH range, indicating the paramagnetic NPs stability and absence of leaching. The uptake of NPs by living cells is fast and results in an intensity increase in the T(1) -weighted MRI images.

They have been simulated by the closed-shell La 3 + ab initio embedding model potentials (AIMP). 1 The second approximation concerned the coordination sphere. Cutting the distant atoms may have a crucial effect on the orientation of anisotropy axes.

40|$|Phase {{mixing of}} {{standing}} continuum Alfvén waves and/or continuum slow waves in atmospheric magnetic {{structures such as}} coronal arcades can create the apparent effect of a wave propagating across the magnetic field. We observe a prominence with SDO/AIA on 2015 March 15 and find the presence of oscillatory motion. We aim to demonstrate that interpreting this motion as a magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) wave is faulty. We also connect the decrease of the apparent velocity over time with the phase mixing process, which depends on the curvature of the magnetic field lines. By measuring the displacement of the prominence at different heights to calculate the apparent velocity, we show that the propagation slows down over time, {{in accordance with the}} theoretical work of Kaneko et al. We also show that this propagation speed drops below what is to be expected for even slow MHD waves for those circumstances. We use a modified Kippenhahn-Schlüter prominence model to calculate the curvature of the magnetic field and fit our observations accordingly. Measuring three of the apparent waves, we get apparent velocities of 14, 8, and 4 km/s. Fitting a simple model for the magnetic field configuration, we obtain that the filament is located 103 Mm below the <b>magnetic</b> <b>centre.</b> We also obtain that the scale of the magnetic field strength in the vertical direction plays no role in the concept of apparent superslow waves and that the moment of excitation of the waves happened roughly one oscillation period {{before the end of the}} eruption that excited the oscillation.

40|$|The {{degree of}} spin {{polarization}} at LEP is strongly depen-dent {{on the knowledge}} of the vertical orbit. Quadrupole magnet alignment and beam position monitor (BPM) off-sets are the main source of the orbit uncertainty. The error of the orbit monitor readings can be largely reduced by cal-ibrating the monitor relative to the adjacent quadrupole. At LEP, 16 BPM offsets can be determined in parallel dur-ing 40 minutes. The error of the measured offset is about 30 m. During the LEP run 1997, more than 500 measure-ments were made and used for the optimisation of polariza-tion.

40|$|The {{accelerator}} and {{particle physics}} communities {{are considering a}} lepton Linear Collider LC as the most appropriate machine to carry out high precision particle physics research in the TeV energy regime. The Compact Linear Collider CLIC and the International Linear Collider ILC are the two proposals for the future e+e- LC. Both designs achieve a luminosity L above 10 ^(34) cm- 2 s- 1 at the interaction point IP, satisfying the particle physics requirements. The LC consists of different systems, being the Final Focus System FFS the last one before colliding the beam at the IP. It is responsible to focus the beams at sizes {{in the range of}} nanometres by means of the Final Doublet FD. The FFS designs of the CLIC and ILC projects are based on a new local chromaticity correction scheme which has never been experimentally tested before. The Accelerator Test Facility ATF 2 at KEK (Japan) aims to experimentally verify the feasibility of the FFS based on this novel scheme. The present thesis is devoted to the design and higher order optimisation of FFS for linear colliders based on the local chromaticity correction scheme. The CLIC design luminosity L 0 is 5. 9 · 10 ^(34) cm- 2 s- 1 assuming head-on collisions. However the beams cross each other at the IP forming an angle of 20 mrad. Due to this crossing scheme the luminosity would be reduced by 90 %. Crab cavities are dedicated to tilt the bunches in order to provide head-on like collisions preserving the design L 0. In this thesis different solutions that recover the design luminosity for the CLIC FFS are proposed. The designs of a new ATF 2 Nominal and Ultra-low beta* lattices, to test the feasibility of the ILC and CLIC FFS respectively, are presented in this thesis. The expected IP vertical beam sizes sy* for these lattices are 38 and 23 nm respectively, at this beam size regime the magnetic field quality of the FFS magnets is a concern. Indeed, the evaluated sy* with the measured multipole components is 100 % for the Nominal lattice and 400 % for the Ultra-low beta* lattice. The study of the higher order aberrations performed in this thesis is crucial for identifying possible cures that minimise the observed beam size growth. Different solutions have been studied: (i) replacing the FD by better field quality magnets, (ii) swapping the ATF 2 quadrupole magnets according to their skew sextupole component and (iii) modifying the lattice optics. The new lattice designs ATF 2 Bx 2. 5 By 1. 0 and ATF 2 Ultra-low betay* are based on the prosposed solutions. The impact of the multipoles components is effectively minimsed for both new designs, achieving a sy* equal to 38 and 27 nm,respectively. The tuning study of the FFS determines its feasibility under realistic error conditions. 100 machines with different initial error configurations are used to address this problem. The tuning simulation study for the alternative CLIC FFS design takes into account BPM resolution, the effect of synchrotron radiation and the misalignment errors of the magnets, being the later a critical parameter on the tuning performance of the system. The motion of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>centre</b> when shunting the quadrupole magnet might represent a limiting factor for further improvement of its alignment. Dedicated measurements at ATF 2 have shown a motion of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>centre</b> below 1 micrometre for a shunting variation of 20 %. Under this alignment condition the tuning study of the CLIC FFS shows that 80 % of the machines reach a L equal or above than L 0. The errors included in the tuning study of the ATF 2 lattices are misalignments, tilts and miss-powering of the ATF 2 FFS magnets. The simulated tuning results show that 80 % of the machines reach a final sy* that does not exceed in more than 11 % and 35 % the design sy* for the ATF 2 Bx 2. 5 By 1. 0 and Ultra-low beta_y* lattices respectively.

As the formula indicates, it contains two copper(II) ions. The Cu2+ ions are held together by four acetate ligands, each of which binds to both copper ions. Each Cu2+ ion has a d9 electronic configuration, and so should have one unpaired electron. If there were a covalent bond between the copper ions, the electrons would pair up and the compound would be diamagnetic. Instead, there is an exchange interaction in which the spins of the unpaired electrons become partially aligned to each other. In fact two states are created, one with spins parallel {{and the other with}} spins opposed. The energy difference between the two states is so small their populations vary significantly with temperature. In consequence the magnetic moment varies with temperature in a sigmoidal pattern. The state with spins opposed has lower energy, so the interaction can be classed as antiferromagnetic in this case. It is believed that {{this is an example of}} superexchange, mediated by the oxygen and carbon atoms of the acetate ligands. Other dimers and clusters exhibit exchange behaviour.|$|R

By contrast, a weak antiferromagnetic interaction is detected for compound 3 at low temperature with TN = 0. 19 (1) K. Since the closest intermetallic distances are similar in the crystals of 2 ·CH 2 Cl 2 and 3 · 1. 75 CH 2 Cl 2 (ca. 1. 1 nm), we conclude that the insaturation of the aromatic Xy group together with the extended intermolecular p–p stacking interactions between Xy rings observed in the crystal lattice of 3 · 1. 75 CH 2 Cl 2 (centroid-to-centroid distance: 0. 35 nm) favour magnetic interaction between the individual <b>magnetic</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R
