50|$|Early color {{negative}} film had many shortcomings, including {{the high cost of}} the film, processing and printing, the mediocre color quality, rapid fading and discoloration of highlights of some types of print that became noticeable after several years. Amateurs who owned <b>projection</b> <b>equipment</b> used reversal films extensively because the cost of <b>projection</b> <b>equipment</b> and slide film was offset by not having to pay for prints. Eventually, print quality improved and prices decreased, and, by the 1970s, color {{negative film}} and color prints had largely displaced slides as the primary method of amateur photography.|$|R
2500|$|Napoléon is a 1927 silent French epic film written, produced, and {{directed}} by Abel Gance that {{tells the story of}} Napoleon's early years. On screen, the title is Napoléon vu par Abel Gance, meaning [...] "Napoleon as seen by Abel Gance". The film is recognised as a masterwork of fluid camera motion, produced in a time when most camera shots were static. Many innovative techniques were used to make the film, including fast cutting, extensive close-ups, a wide variety of hand-held camera shots, location shooting, point of view shots, multiple-camera setups, multiple exposure, superimposition, underwater camera, kaleidoscopic images, film tinting, split screen and mosaic shots, <b>multi-screen</b> <b>projection,</b> and other visual effects. A revival of Napoléon in the mid-1950s influenced the filmmakers of the French New Wave.|$|R

This article describes how to integrate {{the special needs of}} MSPDs into a standart graphics rendering-pipeline. UUsing the example of OpenGL, the by far most widely used graphics API for interactive and immersive graphic systems, the viewing pipeline is examined for changes needed to accommodate MSPDs. The main focus lies on which functionalities are influenced by these changes and which features need special care to work on MSPDs. The resulting artifacts are examined and classified. Important aspects are lighting continuity across edges, including specular highlights, environment mapping and fog. Alternative solutions of making them work are examined for their performance implications and possible interoperability problems...|$|R
5000|$|Despite initial ignorance to the Kinetoscope, the Edison Manufacturing Company {{responded to}} this {{innovation}} with legal action. According to the company, film outfits were showing motion pictures illegally because each of the improvised projectors violated the Kinetoscope patent. However, each film outfit had its own patent protection connected with individual innovations. [...] Concurrent formation of a black market for <b>projection</b> <b>equipment</b> exacerbated legal issues. Following legal proceedings, the Motion Picture Patents Company was established on January 1, 1909. [...] This coalition established a trust of the major film outfits in the United States. Firms from Chicago included in the Motion Picture Patents Company were the Vitagraph Company, the Selig Polyscope Company, the Kleine Company, and Essanay Studios. [...] Provisions restricted movie making to these licensed firms. The trust also required outfits to pay the Edison Company royalties {{for use of the}} improvised <b>projection</b> <b>equipment.</b> To snuff out competitors, a rental system was put in place. Individuals operating theaters were now required to pay a $2 per week rental for films and <b>projection</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{perceptive}} modalities constituted by the <b>multi-screen</b> <b>projection</b> installation and its architectural and spatial forms. The thesis explores {{the hypothesis that}} the affective spatial experience created by the spatially configured moving image space (MIS) produces changed spectatorial positions from that of the single screen (or one-directional multi screen). The research asks: How can we understand the spatially configured <b>multi-screen</b> <b>projection</b> installation as constituting a changed aesthetic perception for the spectator? The MIS comprises two major temporalities, the multi-image structure and the mobile spectator whose physical interaction articulates the receptive process. Thus, perception in the MIS is not purely constructed through vision. Instead, the spatio-temporal assemblage shapes other direct sense phenomena. These are the spatial intensities produced by the spatial field, i. e. variable sensations of spatial receptivity, which are not mediated by the gaze but experienced directly by the body. Further, the mobile gaze of the moving spectator intersects with the moving images, and constructs vision as fluid and transient. Merleau-Ponty (2006), first published 1945, proposed that the mobile orientation of the body in space creates changing points of reference and alters both vision and embodied experience of space. The analysis of two inter-related concepts aims to contribute to a new understanding of the MIS. The first is the interstitial modality established by the screen architecture which engenders temporal and spatial gaps that interrupt the process of perception. Interstitiality here serves as an analytical tool in discerning the specific spectatorial positions instituted by individual installations. The second is the process of inter-animation which is constituted by the corporeal interaction of the spectator in the animated space of the MIS. Spatial and temporal effects act upon the body of the viewer. In turn, the viewer negotiates the unfamiliar space and multiple interstices through intuitive reaction. Deleuze (1994), first published 1968, suggested that spatial intensities and differences create immediate sensory impact which is experienced as intuition. Intuition intervenes in the visual process and expands perception from observation and reflection to intuitive action. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
