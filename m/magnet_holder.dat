25|$|The {{difference}} between diamagnetic low-spin oxyhemoglobin in uninfected {{red blood cells}} and paramagnetic hemozoin in infected red blood cells {{can also be used}} for isolation. Magnetic columns have shown to be less harmful for the parasite and are simple and adjustable {{to the needs of the}} researcher. The column is mounted in a potent <b>magnet</b> <b>holder</b> and the culture flowed through it. The column traps the erythrocytes infected with the latest stages of the parasites, which can then be eluted when the column is removed from the magnet. It is a simple method that does not need expensive equipment and it does not seem to affect the parasites as to their invasion capabilities afterwards.|$|E
50|$|To achieve {{synchronization}} and/or {{concentration of}} the parasites in culture several methods have been developed. A discontinuous Percoll gradient procedure {{can be used to}} isolate infected red blood cells because red cells containing plasmodia are less dense than normal ones. Young trophozoites coincided with erythrocytes in a broad band corresponding to densities from 1.075 to 1.100 g/ml, whereas schizonts were concentrated at a density approximating 1.062 g/ml. There are studies, however, that suggest that some strains of P.falciparum are affected in their capacity of invasion after being exposed to this chemical. The difference between diamagnetic low-spin oxyhemoglobin in uninfected red blood cells and paramagnetic hemozoin in infected red blood cells can also be used for isolation.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} applications of superconductivity is high field magnet. Mechanical disturbance such as abrupt conductor motion {{is one of the main}} origin of premature quench (transition from superconducting state to the normal resistive state) in high current density superconducting coils. The wire motion occurs when electromagnetic force to conductor exceeds constrain force including frictional force on the surface of conductor. Behavior of superconducting wire motion depends on the electromagnetic force acting on it, frictional property of the insulating material and thrust force applied to the superconducting wire. 　　　The experiments for superconducting wire motion in magnetic field was carried out using small coil wound on stainless steel (SUS) bobbin using Polyimide film as an insulating material and high strength polyethylene fiber (Dyneema: DF) reinforced plastic (DFRP) bobbin [1]. The Dyneema fiber has negative thermal expansion [2] and low coefficient of friction [3]. It was found that voltage spikes generated due to sudden wire motion in case of DFRP bobbin are a few and small in amplitude. The speculations are; the negative thermal expansion of the DFRP bobbin restrains the wire motion and low coefficient of friction between superconducting wire and DFRP bobbin reduces sudden motion. 　　　In order to study the effect of frictional coefficient of insulating material on superconducting wire motion under the influence of electromagnetic force, a special experimental setup was designed and fabricated. The main distinctiveness of the experimental setup is that the tension of the superconducting wire can be changed during the experiments. The experimental set up consists of a cryostat, superconducting solenoid <b>magnet,</b> sample <b>holder,</b> tensional unit to apply tension to the superconducting wire, power supplies and pen recorder or a 16 -bit data recorder to measure the voltage tap signal. The sample holder consists of two parts, a semi- circular head and a body part. Experiments were conducted at 4. 2 K by varying the experimental conditions such as the tension to the superconducting wire, superconducting wire current ramp rate and different insulating materials at the interface of the superconducting wire and semi-circular head. 　　　Voltage taps to measure the signal generated due to the superconducting wire motion are connected at the end of the semi-circular head. To reduce the voltage tap loop area, a groove was incorporated in the semi-circular head and the voltage tap wire was passed through it. The voltage tap signal is measured by a pen recorder or a 16 -bit data recorder with a sampling rate of 1 MS/s. Sudden wire motion was indicated by observing the voltage spikes. 　　　In order to examine the effect of the current ramp rate on the superconducting wire motion, ramp rate was changed from 0. 4 A/s to 1. 69 A/s. The superconducting wire tension was varied from 7. 1 N to 35. 8 N to study the effect of tension on the superconducting wire motion. During all experiments, a constant magnetic field of 6 T was applied by superconducting solenoid magnet. 　　　In the thesis work, different types of insulating material were used to study superconducting wire motion under electromagnetic force. They are Polyimide film, cloth / sheet material fabricated using Dyneema fiber, Zylon fiber and Teflon. The Dyneema / Zylon fiber has negative thermal expansion and a low coefficient of friction. 　　　We have verified the effectiveness of this system. We could measure the pattern of voltage spikes. The time duration of voltage spikes are of the same order for all the samples. The peak voltage tap signal amplitude, velocity of wire motion, distance moved by wire and energy dissipated due to wire motion in case of Polyimide film is more than 2 order of magnitude larger than Dyneema based insulating materials and Zylon cloth. Hence use of Dyneema / Zylon based materials as an interface material between layers of superconducting wire may reduce the frictional heat generated due to wire motion and could make superconducting magnet performance more reliable...|$|R
40|$|A {{common problem}} for elliptically {{polarizing}} undulators EPUs {{is that the}} magnetic forces give a mechanical deflection in the <b>magnet</b> <b>holder</b> construction when changing the undulator phase. Gluing horizontally and vertically magnetized blocks together can increase the mechanical stability of the magnet holders. The gluing process of pairs of magnetized magnet blocks is time consuming, expensive and difficult to carry out with high positional precision. A novel magnet production technique has been developed where un magnetized pairs of blocks are glued together before magnetization. The large number of parts, the time for assembly, {{and the cost of}} the EPU can be reduced with the novel magnet production technique. The novel magnet production method has been used for a 2. 6 m long EPU of APPLE II type, which has been built in house at the MAX IV Laboratory. The frame for the EPU is made of cast iron {{in order to get a}} small mechanical deformation when changing phase in the inclined mode. The paper includes detailed descriptions of the novel magnet production technique, including measurements of the magnetization, and the new EP...|$|E
40|$|Two devices a {{magnetic}} separator {{and a special}} filter denoted a self-regenerating separator (SRS) {{have been developed for}} separating sludge from the stream of wastewater from a bioreactor. These devices were originally intended for use in microgravity, but have also been demonstrated to function in normal Earth gravity. The magnetic separator (see Figure 1) includes a thin-walled nonmagnetic, stainless-steel cylindrical drum that rotates within a cylindrical housing. The wastewater enters the separator through a recirculation inlet, and about 80 percent of the wastewater flow leaves through a recirculation outlet. Inside the drum, a <b>magnet</b> <b>holder</b> positions strong permanent magnets stationary and, except near a recirculation outlet, close to the inner drum surface. To enable magnetic separation, magnetite (a ferromagnetic and magnetically soft iron oxide) powder is mixed into the bioreactor wastewater. The magnetite becomes incorporated into the sludge by condensation, onto the powder particles, of microbe flocks that constitute the sludge. As a result, the magnets inside the drum magnetically attract the sludge onto the outer surface of the drum...|$|E

Eight radially magnetized segmented magnets were used to form one set of a magnet ring. Four magnet rings of such type were constructed, in which one pair of rings has north-pole on its outer diameter and south-pole on inner diameter, while the other pair is it's complementary. The magnets were mounted with opposite poles together on the <b>magnet</b> <b>holder</b> with an axial moving shaft having a piston mounted {{on both ends of}} the shaft. The shaft movement was restricted to the axial direction by using C-clamp type flexures, mounted {{on both sides of the}} shaft. The force requirement for driving the compressor was calculated based on which the electrical circuit of motor is designed by proper selection of wire gauge and Ampere-turns. The flexure spring force estimation was done through simulation using ANSYS 11. 0 and was verified experimentally; while the magnet spring force was determined experimentally.
