5000|$|The main {{physical}} {{problem is}} water infiltrating into the exterior building envelope (walls and roofs) of buildings, usually through a weather barrier (e.g. building paper or air barrier membrane) {{that is designed}} to prevent water drops to pass through, but allow water vapour through. However, problems in design, installation, and damage during construction can allow water to penetrate the walls. This causes rot and delamination of exterior wall cladding and sheathing, rusting in metal wall studs, rot in the wood structure, saturation of batt insulation, and development of mould and spores inside the walls and building interior. The construction failures ranged from minor to major failure of the structural integrity of the building. Some buildings became unhealthy to occupants. Most of these buildings are low-rise, 3-4 story buildings constructed of wood-frame construction, as well as some with steel, concrete, and <b>metal</b> <b>stud</b> construction types, including highrises.|$|E

5000|$|Moving magnet stud {{detectors}} use {{a neodymium magnet}} that {{is suspended}} in an enclosure and free to move in response to hidden metal. The strength of this rare earth magnet and the easy movement of the magnet allow moving magnetic stud detectors {{to work on a}} broad range of construction types. The magnet is suspended {{in such a way that}} it always sits in its [...] "home" [...] position until it is moved directly over a metal fastener or <b>metal</b> <b>stud.</b> On walls with shallow fasteners, the magnet moves towards the wall with such velocity that it makes a distinct thud sound when it hits the wall. Because a moving magnet is not dependent on the operator to feel the attraction to the metal, fasteners buried more deeply under plaster or tile can be located with this detector. For deeper fasteners, the sound is softer since the speed of movement is slower.|$|E

40|$|This study uses a <b>metal</b> <b>stud</b> {{partition}} fireproof drywall measuring 83 [*]mm in thickness as a {{test specimen}} to explore the impact of an embedded junction box on the firefighting performance of the wall through one time of standard fire test on a 300 [*]cm × 300 [*]cm area and five times of standard fire test on a 120 [*]cm × 120 [*]cm area. The {{results show that the}} quality of calcium silicate board plays a big role in the fireproof effectiveness. The embedded junction box located on the backside of the fire can reduce the effectiveness of the wall, especially the area above the socket. The thickness of rock wool may increase the performance, but in a limited rate. External junction box may not impact the fireproofing performance of the wall but it still possesses some safety risks. An embedded junction box measuring 101 × 55 [*]mm could already damage the fire compartment, and in reality there may be more complicated situations that should be noted and improved...|$|E

40|$|The author {{investigated}} five residential {{units of}} an eight story high rise condominium building that had elevated indoor radon levels on every floor. The building had {{two levels of}} ventilated garages under most {{of the building and}} only partial ground contact. Each floor was constructed with post stressed concrete floors and ceilings. Blower door and ventilation dilution measurements in the units tested indicated very low air change rates to the exterior of the units. E-PERM’s ® were placed under three liter metal accumulator’s over exposed surfaces of the concrete in six locations of the building to determine the emanation rate from the concrete. The measurement results indicated the concrete radon emanation rate along with the low ventilation rates was the cause of the elevated indoor radon levels. GENERAL BUILDING INFORMATION The investigated building was actually two buildings above grade with three levels of open parking garages under most of the building. These garages are mechanically ventilated and open to each other. There is an alley way above the garages that separates the buildings. One side of the building is five stories tall. The other side is eight stories tall. There is a single row of ground contact condominiums and commercial stores surrounding three sides of the buildings. Both buildings are built with post stressed concrete slab floors and ceilings. The exterior and interior walls are <b>metal</b> <b>stud</b> framed except around the stairwell and elevator shafts which are concrete walls. There are multiple concrete beams throughout the building supporting the concrete slabs. See aerial photo of the site in Figure 1 below...|$|E

Despite this, all of the contestants easily determine how the strengthening channel is to be installed (cutting it too long, bending the excess up, and screwing it in place). Despite some minor difficulties in aligning {{the holes in the}} studs for the channel as well as attaching the stud wall to the room's walls, all of them eventually pass.|$|R

5000|$|Roll forming {{machines}} are available that produce shapes {{of different sizes}} and material thicknesses using the same rolls. Variations in size are achieved by making the distances between the rolls variable by manual adjustment or computerized controls, allowing for rapid changeover. These specialized mills are prevalent in the light gauge framing industry where <b>metal</b> <b>studs</b> and tracks of standardized profiles and thicknesses are used. For example, a single mill {{may be able to}} produce <b>metal</b> <b>studs</b> of different web (e.g. 3-5/8" [...] to 14 inches), flange (e.g. 1-3/8" [...] to 2-1/2") and lip (e.g. 3/8" [...] to 5/8") dimensions, from different gauges (e.g. 20 to 12 GA) of galvanized steel sheet.|$|R

5000|$|In {{mountain}} biking (MTB) and BMX, platform pedals typically refer to any flat pedal without a cage. BMX riders typically use plastic pedals made of nylon, polycarbonate, or carbon reinforced plastic, although aluminum alloy, and magnesium {{are not uncommon}} pedal body materials. Mountain bikers tend to use aluminum or magnesium because of the necessary use of <b>metal</b> <b>studs</b> to offer grip while the pedals are wet, muddy and slippery. BMX'ers tend to prefer platforms to cage pedals because they offer more support and grip for flexible [...] "skate" [...] shoes by using short <b>metal</b> <b>studs.</b> Cage pedals are more popular in the low end mountain bike range. In general, cage pedals are uncommon in all types of biking, {{although there is a}} niche market within {{mountain biking}}.|$|R
