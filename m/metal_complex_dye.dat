At cepa roots were treated with different concns. of the dye (50, 100, 250 & 500 ppm) for different durations (6, 12 & 24 h) ​. The dye inhibited cell division and a strong dosage effect was obvious from a decline in the mitotic index (4. 4 ​%) with the increase in dye concn. (500 ppm) and duration (24 h) of treatment. The dye induced a wide range of mitotic abnormalities which included stickiness of chromosomes, bridges, laggards, fragments, binucleate cells and vacuolated nuclei.

40|$|The textile {{industry}} is a large water consumer: dyeing, rinsing, and follow-up treatment of textiles use large amounts of freshwater. As regulations {{become more and more}} stringent and the cost of freshwater increases, reclamation of wastewater becomes more and more attractive. This paper explores the possibility of using nanofiltration to improve the wastewater quality to the standards that are used for the dyeing of wool. Four different samples from the wastewater treatment sequence of a textile factory were filtrated with three different nanofiltration membranes (NF 70, UTC- 20, and NTR 7450). The samples were a used and untreated <b>metal</b> <b>complex</b> <b>dye</b> bath, a used and untreated acid dye bath, a sample from the storage tank (containing a diluted mixture of the previous baths), and the effluent of the biological treatment. Nanofiltration was possible for all samples, but the biologically treated dye baths showed a more efficient color removal. For direct nanofiltration of used dye baths, two membrane passages would be needed to provide the required permeate quality. Flux decline due to adsorption of organic material on the membrane decreased the membrane capacity by up to 73 %, but the process water flux reached a stable value in all experiments. The flux decline was less important for the biologically treated water. The effect of flux decline was only partly reversible; the effect of osmotic pressure on the process water flux is fully reversible. It was found that flux decline is largely concentration-dependent: higher concentrations of organic compounds always caused lower process water fluxes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{dyeing of fibres}} in {{the textile}} industry is usually performed at high temperatures although {{it is possible to}} dye at low temperatures. The dyeing of fibres at low temperature presents some advantages from the industrial point of view, namely energy saving, environmental control and fibre protection (maintenance of the properties during the dyeing, finishing and final use). The conventional process of exhaustion dyeing of the microfibres of PA 6. 6 takes place at temperatures that can go from 98 to 115 ºC, in spite of it being possible to dye at lower temperatures, using for this effect dyes with low molecular weight, as it is the case of some acid dyes. However, in the dyeing with dyes of large molecule, as the <b>metal</b> <b>complex</b> <b>dyes,</b> it can result in defective dyeing due to their lower diffusion and migration properties. Dyeing at low temperatures without affecting the properties of dyeing, such as diffusion and levelness, {{has been shown to be}} possible with the aid of solvents. Polyester has been dyed with methylene chloride at temperatures of 40 ºC [1] and wool has been dyed at lower temperatures with n-butanol and benzyl alcohol [2]. In this work we studied the use of benzyl alcohol as an auxiliary for lowering the dyeing temperature of PA fibres.

It has been shown that LiBOB-based liquid electrolyte is able to function in the QD/N 3 dye co-sensitized solar:cells but some stability issues of the QD were observed in the electrolyte system containing iodide whereby the QD-sensitized TiO 2 was easily etched. Overall efficiencies and fill factors of the co-sensitized solar cells varied from 0. 98 % to 1. 66 % and 40 % to 46 % respectively. CdS QD was shown to be effective when coupled with polysulfide electrolyte while Ag 2 S QD was favorable towards the LiBOB-based liquid electrolyte...|$|R
40|$|Colored {{waterborne}} polyurethanes {{have been}} widely used in paintings, leathers, textiles, and coatings. Here, a series of black waterborne polyurethanes (WPUs) with different ratios of black dye, Sudan Black B (SDB), were prepared by step-growth polymerization. WPU emulsions as obtained exhibit low particle sizes and remarkable storage stability at the same time. At different dye loadings, essential structural, statistical and thermal properties are characterized. FTIR (fourier transform infrared) spectra indicate that SDB is covalently linked into waterborne polyurethane chains. All of the WPUs with covalently linked SDB show better color fastness and resistance of thermal migration than those with SDB mixed physically. Besides, WPUs incorporated SDB covalently with different polymeric diols, polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly- 1, 4 -butylene adipate glycol (PBA) and polycaprolactone glycol (PCL), were prepared to obtain different properties to cater to a variety of practical demands. By a spraying method, the black WPUs can be directly used as <b>metal</b> coatings without <b>complex</b> <b>dyeing</b> process by simply mixing coating additive and other waterborne resins, which exhibit excellent coating performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{photosensitive}} molecule adsorption on {{titanium dioxide}} (TiO 2) forms the so-called “dye sensitized TiO 2 ” system, a typical organic/oxide heterojunction, {{which is of}} great interest in catalysis and energy applications, e. g. dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Traditionally, the transition <b>metal</b> <b>complex</b> <b>dyes</b> {{are the focus of}} the study. However, as the fast development of the organic semiconductors and invention of new pure organic dyes, it is necessary to expand the research horizon to cover these molecules and concrete the fundamental understanding of their basic properties, especially during sensitization. In this work, we focus on two different photosensitive molecules: phthalocyanines and triphenylamine-based dyes. Phthalocyanines are organic semiconductors with symmetric macro aromatic molecular structures. They possess good photoelectrical properties and good thermal and chemical stability, which make them widely used in the organic electronic industries. Triphenylamine-based dyes are new types of pure organic dyes which deliver high efficiency and reduce the cost of DSSC. They can be nominated as one of the strong candidates to substitute the ruthenium <b>complex</b> <b>dyes</b> in DSSC. The researches were carried out using classic surface science techniques on single crystal substrates and under ultrahigh vacuum condition. The photosensitive molecules were deposited by organic molecular beam deposition. The substrate reconstruction and ordering were checked by low energy electron diffraction. The molecular electronic, geometric structures and charge transfer properties were characterized by photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and resonant photoelectron spectroscopy (RPES). Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to directly image the molecular adsorption. For phthalocyanines, we select MgPc, ZnPc, FePc and TiOPc, which showed a general charge transfer from molecule to the substrate when adsorbed on rutile TiO 2 (110) surface with 1 × 1 and 1 × 2 reconstructions. This charge transfer can be prevented by modifying the TiO 2 surface with pyridine derivatives (4 -tert-butyl pyridine (4 TBP), 2, 2 ’-bipyridine and 4, 4 ’-bipyridine), and furthermore the energy level alignment at the interface is modified by the surface dipole established by the pyridine molecules. Annealing also plays an important role to control the molecular structure and change the electronic structure together with the charge transfer properties, shown by TiOPc film. Special discussions were done for 4 TBP for its ability to shift the substrate band bending by healing the oxygen vacancies, which makes it an important additive in the DSSC electrolyte. For the triphenylamine-based dye (TPAC), the systematic deposition enables the characterization of the coverage dependent changes of molecular electronic and geometric structures. The light polarization dependent charge transfer was revealed by RPES. Furthermore, the iodine doped TPAC on TiO 2 were investigated to mimic the electrolyte/dye/TiO 2 interface in the real DSSC. The whole work of this thesis aims to provide fundamental understanding of the interaction between photosensitive molecules on TiO 2 surfaces at molecular level in the monolayer region, e. g. the formation of interfacial states and the coverage dependent atomic and electronic structures, etc. We explored the potential of the application of new dyes and modified of the existing system by identifying their advantage and disadvantage. The results may benefit the fields of dye syntheses, catalysis researches and designs of organic photovoltaic devices. QC 2011111...|$|R
