50|$|A quantum {{critical}} endpoint {{arises when}} a nonzero temperature critical point is tuned to zero temperature. One {{of the best}} studied examples occurs in the layered ruthenate metal, Sr3Ru2O7 in a magnetic field. This material shows metamagnetism with a low-temperature first-order metamagnetic transition where the magnetization jumps when a magnetic field is applied within the directions of the layers. The first-order jump terminates in a critical endpoint at about 1 kelvin. By switching {{the direction of the}} magnetic field so that it points almost perpendicular to the layers, the critical endpoint is tuned to zero temperature at a field of about 8 teslas. The resulting quantum critical fluctuations dominate the physical properties of this material at nonzero temperatures and way from the critical field. The resistivity shows a non-Fermi liquid response, the effective mass of the electron grows and the <b>magnetothermal</b> expansion of the material is modified all in response to the quantum critical fluctuations.|$|E

40|$|Classical {{transport}} theory predicts strong coupling between thermal transport and magnetic field dynamics in laser produced plasmas; for example, fields are carried with the thermal flux, via the Nernst effect, while simultaneously deflecting it, {{giving rise to}} a Righi-Leduc heat-flow. Coupling between these effects is shown here to drive {{a new kind of}} instability-the <b>magnetothermal</b> instability-which is described in detail for the first time. A linear perturbation theory is derived in the absence of density gradients and hydrodynamical effects, and yields unstable solutions which propagate as <b>magnetothermal</b> waves. The theory is compared with full non-linear simulation {{in the context of a}} recent nanosecond gas-jet experiment and found to be in good agreement; exhibiting typical growth-rates and characteristic wavelengths of order 10 ns- 1 and 50 µ m respectively. Further incorporation of density gradients and hydrodynamics into the <b>magnetothermal</b> stability analysis is shown to introduce the well-known field generating thermal instability source term, which can either complement or counteract the <b>magnetothermal</b> mechanism. Inequalities for predicting the dominance of each process are given: of the two, the <b>magnetothermal</b> mechanism is found to represent the main-and sometimes only-source of unstable feedback for the conditions considered here. Using super-Gaussian {{transport theory}}, the implications of inverse-bremmstrahlung heating for transport in laser-plasmas are also explored. Super-Gaussian modifications are shown to suppress a number of classical processes, by up to ~ 90 % in some cases, while simultaneously introducing new effects, such as advection of magnetic field up density gradients. The combined consequences of these modifications are considered for the field generating thermal instability, and super-Gaussian effects are found to reduce growthrates by [greater than or similar to] 80 % compared to predictions from classical transport theory under inertial confinement fusion conditions. The development of a unique code CTC, written to assist the exploration of both classical and super-Gaussian transport phenomena, and the new <b>magnetothermal</b> instability, is also described.

40|$|In {{this letter}} the authors present the {{observation}} of giant <b>magnetothermal</b> conductivity in NiMnIn single crystals.

The magnetic field-induced phase transition leads to a large magnetoresistance and a large <b>magnetothermal</b> conductivity up to 70 % and 120 %, respectively.

40|$|In topological Weyl semimetals, the {{low energy}} {{excitations}} are comprised of linearly dispersing Weyl fermions, which act as monopoles of Berry curvature in momentum space {{and result in}} topologically protected Fermi arcs on the surfaces. We propose that these Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals lead to an anisotropic <b>magnetothermal</b> conductivity, strongly dependent on externally applied magnetic field and resulting from entropy transport driven by circulating electronic currents. The circulating currents result in no net charge transport, but they do result in a net entropy transport. This translates into a <b>magnetothermal</b> conductivity {{that should be a}} unique experimental signature for the existence of the arcs. We analytically calculate the Fermi arc-mediated <b>magnetothermal</b> conductivity in the low-field semiclassical limit {{as well as in the}} high-field ultra-quantum limit, where only the chiral Landau levels are involved. By numerically including the effects of higher Landau levels, we show how the two limits are linked at intermediate magnetic fields. This work provides the first proposed signature of Fermi arc-mediated thermal transport and sets the stage for utilizing and manipulating the topological Fermi arcs in experimental thermal applications.

Magnetic field-induced antiferromagnetic/charge-orbital ordered insulating to ferromagnetic metallic transition leads to giant <b>magnetothermal</b> conductivity and magnetostriction effect.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{optimized}} field/circuit coupling approach for the simulation of <b>magnetothermal</b> transients in superconducting magnets.

40|$|We use the {{machinery}} usually employed {{for studying the}} onset of Rayleigh [...] Bénard convection in hydro- and magnetohydro-dynamic settings to address the onset of convection induced by the <b>magnetothermal</b> instability and the heat-flux-buoyancy-driven-instability in the weakly-collisional magnetized plasma permeating the intracluster medium. Since most of the related numerical simulations consider the plasma being bounded between two `plates' on which boundary conditions are specified, our strategy provides a framework that could enable a more direct connection between analytical and numerical studies. We derive the conditions for the onset of these instabilities considering the effects of induced magnetic tension resulting from a finite plasma beta. We provide expressions for the Rayleigh number {{in terms of the}} wave vector associated with a given mode, which allow us to characterize the modes that are first to become unstable.

There is a double interest in such systems: First, an excited level 3 meV (4. 2 meV) above the acceptor ground state has been concluded from ultrasonic measurements. Such an excited state might be connected with a Jahn-Teller effect of these deeper acceptors and should be seen by resonant phonon scattering in thermal conductivity.

40|$|Selective {{hysteretic}} heating {{of multiple}} collocated sets of single domain magnetic nanoparticles (SDMNPs) by alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) may offer {{a useful tool}} for biomedical applications. The possibility of <b>magnetothermal</b> multiplexing has not yet been realized, in part due to prevalent use of linear response theory to model SDMNP heating in AMFs. Predictive successes of dynamic hysteresis (DH), a more generalized model for heat dissipation by SDMNPs, are observed experimentally with detailed calorimetry measurements performed at varied AMF amplitudes and frequencies. The DH model suggests that specific driving conditions play an underappreciated role in determining optimal material selection strategies for high heat dissipation. Motivated by this observation, <b>magnetothermal</b> multiplexing is theoretically predicted and empirically demonstrated for the first time by selecting SDMNPs with properties that suggest optimal hysteretic heat dissipation at dissimilar AMF driving conditions. This form of multiplexing could effectively create multiple channels for minimally invasive biological signaling applications. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{theoretical}} {{model for the}} <b>magnetothermal</b> conductivity of a spin- 1 / 2 ladder with low exchange coupling (J≪Θ_D) subject to a strong magnetic field B. Our theory for the thermal transport accounts for the contribution of spinons coupled to lattice phonon modes in the one-dimensional lattice. We employ a mapping of the ladder Hamiltonian onto an XXZ spin-chain in a weaker effective field B_eff=B-B_ 0, where B_ 0 =(B_c 1 +B_c 2) / 2 corresponds to half-filling of the spinon band. This provides a low-energy theory for the spinon excitations and their coupling to the phonons. The coupling of acoustic longitudinal phonons to spinons gives rise to hybridization of spinons and phonons, and provides an enhanced B-dependant scattering of phonons on spinons. Using a memory matrix approach, we show that the interplay between several scattering mechanisms, namely: umklapp, disorder and phonon-spinon collisions, dominates the relaxation of heat current.
