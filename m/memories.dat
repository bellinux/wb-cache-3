5|$|In , Sora's group stumbles upon a {{fortress}} known as Castle Oblivion, believing {{they will find}} Mickey and Riku inside. There, Sora's <b>memories</b> are manipulated by a girl named Naminé, who is being held captive by the group Organization XIII and forced to replace his <b>memories</b> of Kairi with herself. However, as Sora ascends the castle, he meets Naminé and learns the truth from her. Sora still wishes to protect Naminé and stop the Organization members in the castle. After Sora and friends defeat the Organization members controlling the castle, Naminé helps the three restore their <b>memories</b> to their state prior to entering Castle Oblivion, {{at the cost of}} their <b>memories</b> of the events in the castle. This requires them to sleep in the castle for the restoration of <b>memories</b> to be completed.|$|E
50|$|Long-term <b>memory</b> is {{commonly}} labelled as explicit <b>memory</b> (declarative), {{as well as}} episodic <b>memory,</b> semantic <b>memory,</b> autobiographical <b>memory,</b> and implicit <b>memory</b> (procedural <b>memory).</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Memory</b> is a {{very broad}} {{function}} which includes several distinct abilities, {{all of which can}} be selectively impaired and require individual testing. There is disagreement as to the number of <b>memory</b> systems, depending on the psychological perspective taken. From a clinical perspective, a view of five distinct types of <b>memory,</b> is in most cases sufficient. Semantic <b>memory</b> and episodic <b>memory</b> (collectively called declarative <b>memory</b> or explicit memory); procedural <b>memory</b> and priming or perceptual learning (collectively called non-declarative <b>memory</b> or implicit <b>memory)</b> all four of which are long term <b>memory</b> systems; and working <b>memory</b> or short term <b>memory.</b> Semantic <b>memory</b> is <b>memory</b> for facts, episodic <b>memory</b> is autobiographical <b>memory,</b> procedural <b>memory</b> is <b>memory</b> for the performance of skills, priming is <b>memory</b> facilitated by prior exposure to a stimulus and working <b>memory</b> is a form of short term <b>memory</b> for information manipulation.|$|R

5|$|Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket {{walk down}} a winding path in search of Riku and King Mickey. A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive {{fortress}} called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper {{they go into the}} castle, the more <b>memories</b> they will lose, but they will also uncover new <b>memories</b> in the process. He creates a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' <b>memories,</b> and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their <b>memories.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} an {{intermediary}} title was developed after director Tetsuya Nomura {{and his team}} {{had already begun to}} develop ideas for the second Kingdom Hearts game, which he had intended to be set a year after the original. Originally titled Kingdom Hearts: Lost <b>Memories,</b> Nomura changed the name to match the overall outline of the story, while still reflecting the theme of <b>memories.</b> Chain of <b>Memories</b> was developed {{to bridge the gap between}} Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. Like most sequels, Kingdom Hearts II was planned to have the character start from the beginning, ability-wise. To explain the loss of abilities gained in the previous game, Nomura had the story revolve around Sora's <b>memories</b> getting corrupted and implemented the card battle system to symbolize Sora's various <b>memories.</b>|$|E
5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful <b>memories,</b> all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted <b>memories</b> within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the <b>memories</b> of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the <b>memories</b> back into the general population. As the <b>memories</b> are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that <b>memories</b> should not become open to all, and that painful <b>memories</b> should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E

50|$|Registered (also called buffered) <b>memory</b> modules have a {{register}} between the DRAM modules and the system's <b>memory</b> controller. They place less electrical {{load on the}} <b>memory</b> controller and allow single systems to remain stable with more <b>memory</b> modules {{than they would have}} otherwise. When compared with registered <b>memory,</b> conventional <b>memory</b> is usually referred to as unbuffered <b>memory</b> or unregistered <b>memory.</b> When manufactured as a dual in-line <b>memory</b> module (DIMM), {{a register}}ed <b>memory</b> module is called an RDIMM, while unregistered <b>memory</b> is called UDIMM.|$|R
50|$|Working <b>memory</b> is {{not part}} of {{long-term}} <b>memory,</b> but is important for long-term <b>memory</b> to function. Working <b>memory</b> holds and manipulates information {{for a short period of}} time, before it is either forgotten or encoded into long-term <b>memory.</b> Then, in order to remember something from long-term <b>memory,</b> it must be brought back into working <b>memory.</b> If working <b>memory</b> is overloaded it can affect the encoding of long-term <b>memory.</b> If one has a good working <b>memory</b> they may have a better long-term <b>memory</b> encoding.|$|R
5|$|A {{terrorist}} group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami, one of Shunsuke's closest friends and aides, and holds them hostage {{in exchange for}} Yuu, who attempts to rescue them. However, the operation does not go as planned, which results in Kumagami's death and Yuu being gravely injured. After Yuu recovers, he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing their abilities per Nao's suggestion. As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities, the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on him as he starts losing his <b>memories</b> and sense of self. However, he still manages to steal everyone's abilities throughout the world before collapsing. Shunsuke rescues Yuu, bringing him back to Japan among friends and family. Yuu is left with no past <b>memories,</b> but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend. Yuu and his friends {{look forward to the}} <b>memories</b> they will make from now on as Yuu continues to recover from his ordeal.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Four, One Direction became the first band in the US Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one. Their third album, Midnight <b>Memories,</b> was the best-selling album {{worldwide}} of 2013. The band's Where We Are Tour in support of Midnight <b>Memories</b> and Four, was the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014, and the highest-grossing tour ever by a vocal group, generating $282million. In 2014, Billboard named One Direction Artist of the Year. The band is currently on a hiatus that began in January 2016, allowing all members to pursue other projects.|$|E
50|$|In computing, {{interleaved}} <b>memory</b> is {{a design}} made {{to compensate for}} the relatively slow speed of dynamic random-access <b>memory</b> (DRAM) or core <b>memory,</b> by spreading <b>memory</b> addresses evenly across <b>memory</b> banks. That way, contiguous <b>memory</b> reads and writes are using each <b>memory</b> bank in turn, resulting in higher <b>memory</b> throughputs due to reduced waiting for <b>memory</b> banks to become ready for desired operations.|$|R
50|$|Extended <b>memory</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with expanded <b>memory,</b> an earlier method for expanding the IBM PC's <b>memory</b> capacity beyond 640 kB (655,360 bytes) using an expansion card with bank switched <b>memory</b> modules. Because of the available support for expanded <b>memory</b> in popular applications, device drivers were developed that emulated expanded <b>memory</b> using extended <b>memory.</b> Later two additional methods were developed allowing direct access to a small portion of extended <b>memory</b> from real mode. These <b>memory</b> areas are referred to as the high <b>memory</b> area (HMA) and the upper <b>memory</b> area (UMA; also referred to as upper <b>memory</b> blocks or UMBs).|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} types of <b>memory</b> are {{short-term}} <b>memory</b> and long-term memory; however, short-term <b>memory</b> has become better {{understood to be}} working <b>memory.</b> Cognitive psychologists often study <b>memory</b> in terms of working <b>memory.</b>|$|R
5|$|After the war, the {{military}} service of Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective <b>memories</b> of the American Civil War {{and the history}} of Hawaii. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember the legacy of the Hawaiians who fought. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history have inspired efforts to preserve the <b>memories</b> of the Hawaiians who served in the war.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Riley and {{her parents}} move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their {{belongings}} is misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy <b>memories,</b> turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry {{in front of her}} class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core <b>memories</b> loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core <b>memories</b> are sucked out of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{generally recognized}} that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that <b>memories</b> were generally not the result of new neuron production. With this realization came the need to explain how <b>memories</b> could form in the absence of new neurons.|$|E
5|$|Main <b>memory</b> in a {{parallel}} computer is either shared <b>memory</b> (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed <b>memory</b> (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed <b>memory</b> refers {{to the fact that}} the <b>memory</b> is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared <b>memory</b> and <b>memory</b> virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local <b>memory</b> and access to the <b>memory</b> on non-local processors. Accesses to local <b>memory</b> are typically faster than accesses to non-local <b>memory.</b>|$|R
40|$|Working <b>memory</b> and {{long-term}} <b>memory</b> {{are two types}} of <b>memory</b> associated with children’s learning and academic performance. A number of <b>memory</b> models have suggested there is a relationship between working <b>memory</b> {{and long-term}} memory; however, {{there is a lack of}} empirical research measuring this relationship using standardized assessment tools. Further, there are currently no studies measuring this relationship in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between children’s working <b>memory</b> (i. e., verbal working <b>memory,</b> visual-spatial working <b>memory,</b> verbal short-term <b>memory,</b> visual-spatial short-term <b>memory,</b> and the central executive) and long-term <b>memory,</b> using standardized assessment tools. The Automated Working <b>Memory</b> Assessment was used to measure working <b>memory</b> and the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities – Third Edition was used to measure long-term <b>memory.</b> This study utilized secondary data from a larger SSHRC funded study. Participants included 41 children between grades 1 and 8. The majority of parents who volunteered to have their children participate identified them as having a disability (e. g., speech/language difficulty; learning disability). Kendall’s tau-b revealed statistically significant correlations between four areas of working <b>memory</b> (i. e., verbal working <b>memory,</b> visual-spatial working <b>memory,</b> visual-spatial short-term <b>memory,</b> and central executive) and long-term <b>memory.</b> Mann-Whitney tests revealed children with higher working <b>memory</b> abilities differed significantly from children with lower working <b>memory</b> abilities on measures of long-term <b>memory.</b> The findings from this study may have implications for both theory and practice. The relationship observed between working <b>memory</b> and long-term <b>memory</b> appears to align with widely accepted <b>memory</b> models (e. g., Baddeley, 2000; Dehn, 2008). The findings also suggest interventions designed to improve children’s working <b>memory</b> may have the potential to enhance long-term <b>memory</b> abilities...|$|R

5|$|Development {{plans for}} Kingdom Hearts II began around the {{completion}} of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, but specific details were undecided until July 2003. Nomura noted several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One such obstacle was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more, which required Disney's approval. The game was developed by Square Enix's Product Development Division-1, {{with most of the}} original staff from the first game. The game was originally supposed to have been released after Kingdom Hearts. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of <b>Memories</b> was developed. To explain the loss of all the abilities from the first game at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts II, Nomura had Sora's <b>memories</b> scrambled in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of <b>Memories.</b>|$|E
