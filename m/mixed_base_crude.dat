The area, which consists of various geological strata and diverse trap types, was discovered and exploited {{during the first half}} of the 20th century. Most of the crude oil found in the onshore mid-continent oil field is considered to be of the <b>mixed</b> <b>base</b> or intermediate type (a <b>mix</b> of paraffin <b>base</b> and asphalt <b>base</b> <b>crude</b> oil types).|$|R

Its effect is almost instantaneous and lasts for more than 11  h, along which viscosity is significantly lower and flow rate can increase up to double. One very interesting advantage is the low energy consumption.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove two {{characterizations}} of reflexivity for a Banach space X. The {{first one is}} based on the existence in X of a closed convex cone with nonempty interior such that all the bases generated by a strictly positive functional are bounded, while the second one is stated in terms of non existence of a cone such that has bounded and unbounded bases (both generated by strictly positive functionals) simultaneously. We call such a cone <b>mixed</b> <b>based</b> cone. We study the features of this class of cones. In particular, we show that every cone conically isomorphic to the nonnegative orthant ℓ 1 + of ℓ 1 is a <b>mixed</b> <b>based</b> cone and that every <b>mixed</b> <b>based</b> cone contains a conically isomorphic copy of ℓ 1 +. Moreover we give {{a detailed description of the}} structure of a <b>mixed</b> <b>based</b> cone. This approach allows us to prove some results concerning the embeddings of ℓ 1 and c 0 in a Banach space...|$|R

Their experiments shown that a paraffin <b>base</b> <b>crude</b> oil could have its viscosity reduced for several hours.

While the previous experiments have shown the existence of three-wave mixing pathway {{in a system of}} two-coupled phonon modes, this work demonstrates a similar pathway in a system of three-coupled phonon modes.

The experimental validation of three-mode three-wave mixing along with the previous demonstration of two-mode three-wave mixing points to the ultimate possibility of multimode frequency combs.

40|$|AbstractStandard {{methods used}} to {{estimate}} HIV- 1 population diversity are often resource intensive (e. g., single genome amplification, clonal amplification and pyrosequencing) and not well suited for large study cohorts. Additional approaches are needed to address the relationships between intraindividual HIV- 1 genetic diversity and 2 disease. With a small cohort of individuals, we validated three methods for measuring diversity: Shannon entropy and average pairwise distance (APD) using single genome sequences, and counts of <b>mixed</b> <b>bases</b> (i. e. ambiguous nucleotides) from population based sequences. In a large cohort, we then used the <b>mixed</b> <b>base</b> approach to determine associations between measure HIV- 1 diversity and HIV associated disease. Normalized counts of <b>mixed</b> <b>bases</b> correlated with Shannon Entropy at both the nucleotide (rho= 0. 72, p= 0. 002) and amino acid level (rho= 0. 59, p= 0. 015), and APD (rho= 0. 75, p= 0. 001). Among participants who underwent neuropsychological and clinical assessments (n= 187), increased HIV- 1 population diversity was associated with both a diagnosis of AIDS and neuropsychological impairment...|$|R
40|$|Peptide {{nucleic acid}} {{oligomers}} (PNAs) have a remarkable ability to invade duplex DNA at polypurine–polypyrimidine target sequences. Applications for PNAs {{in medicine and}} biotechnology would increase if the rules governing their hybridization to <b>mixed</b> <b>base</b> sequences were also clear. Here we describe hybridization of PNAs to <b>mixed</b> <b>base</b> sequences and demonstrate that simple chemical modifications can enhance recognition. Easily synthesized and readily soluble eight and 10 base PNAs bind to plasmid DNA at an inverted repeat {{that is likely to}} form a cruciform structure, providing convenient tags for creating PNA–plasmid complexes. PNAs also bind to <b>mixed</b> <b>base</b> sequences that cannot form cruciforms, suggesting that recognition is a general phenomenon. Rates of strand invasion are temperature dependent and can be enhanced by attaching PNAs to positively charged peptides. Our results support use of PNAs to access the information within duplex DNA and demonstrate that simple chemical modifications can make PNAs even more powerful agents for strand invasion. Simple strategies for enhancing strand invasion should facilitate the use of PNAs: (i) as biophysical probes of double-stranded DNA; (ii) to target promoters to control gene expression; and (iii) to direct sequence-specific mutagenesis...|$|R
40|$|The Sub Bytes (S-boxes) is {{the only}} {{non-linear}} transformation in the encryption of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), occupying {{more than half of}} its hardware implementation resources. One important required aspect of the hardware architectures of the S-boxes is the reliability of their implementations. This can be compromised by occurrence of internal faults or intrusion of the attackers. In this paper, we present a high-speed architecture for the S-boxes constructed using <b>mixed</b> <b>bases</b> to counteract these internal/malicious faults. Although using polynomial and normal bases for the S-boxes has been studied extensively, using <b>mixed</b> <b>bases</b> has just been considered very recently in CHES 2010. In the proposed fault detection scheme of this paper, we present formulations for multi-bit parities for the S-boxes using <b>mixed</b> <b>bases.</b> Then, these formulations are utilized in our error simulations and it is shown that the presented architecture reaches very high error coverage. Through our ASIC syntheses utilizing a 65 -nm CMOS technology, we show that with comparable hardware complexity, the efficiency of the presented reliable architecture (without sub-pipelining) reaches around 5. 02 Mbps/μm 2, outperforming other fault detection schemes for composite field architectures...|$|R
