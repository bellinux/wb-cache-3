Rock mass displacement in the tunnel was calculated using a software program Phase 2. Meanwhile, as a supporter of the parameter values used to obtain the required form Roclab software.

Gender, age (mass), wounds or scars, season, and local relative population densities were statistically associated with the period prevalence of antibody (used as a marker of infection) to SNV in host populations. Nevertheless, antibody prevalence and some of the risk factors associated with antibody prevalence, such as relative population density, gender bias, and prevalence of wounding, varied significantly among sites and even between nearby trapping arrays at a single site. This suggests that local micrositespecific differences {{play an important role in}} determining relative risk of infection by SNV in rodents and, consequently, in humans. Deer mouse relative population density varied among sites and was positively and statistically associated with infection prevalence, an association that researchers conducting shorter-term studies failed to demonstrate.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-modelling approach that incorporates contributions from morpho-evolutionary modelling, detailed engineering-geological modelling and time-dependent stress-strain numerical modelling to analyse the rheological {{evolution of a}} river valley slope over approximately 102 kyr. The slope {{is located in a}} transient, tectonically active landscape in southwestern Tyrrhenian Calabria (Italy),where gravitational processes drive failures in rock slopes. Constraints on the valley profile development were provided by a morphoevolutionary model based on the correlation of marine and river strath terraces. Rock <b>mass</b> <b>classes</b> were identified through geomechanical parameters that were derived fromengineering-geological surveys and outputs of a multi-sensor slope monitoring system. The rock <b>mass</b> <b>classes</b> were associated to lithotechnical units to obtain a high-resolution engineering-geological model along a cross section of the valley. Time-dependent stress-strain numericalmodelling reproduced the mainmorpho-evolutionary stages of the valley slopes. The findings demonstrate that a complex combination of eustatism, uplift and Mass Rock Creep (MRC) deformations can lead to firsttime failures of rock slopes when unstable conditions are encountered up to the generation of stress-controlled shear zones. The multi-modelling approach enabled us to determine that such complex combinations may have been sufficient for the first-time failure of the S. Giovanni slope at approximately 140 ka (MIS 7), even without invoking any trigger. Conversely, further reactivations of the landslide must be related to triggers such as earthquakes, rainfall and anthropogenic activities. This failure involved a portion of the slope where a plasticity zone resulted from mass rock creep that evolved with a maximumstrain rate of 40...|$|R
