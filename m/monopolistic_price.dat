5000|$|In {{contract}} theory, {{the terms}} [...] "screening models" [...] and [...] "adverse selection models" [...] {{are often used}} interchangeably. An agent has private information about his type (e.g., his costs or his valuation of a good) before the principal makes a contract offer. The principal will then offer a menu of contracts in order to separate the different types. Typically, the best type will trade the same amount as in the first-best benchmark solution (which would be attained under complete information), a property known as [...] "no distortion at the top". All other types typically trade less than in the first-best solution (i.e., there is a [...] "downward distortion" [...] of the trade level). Optimal auction design (more generally known as Bayesian mechanism design) {{can be seen as}} a multi-agent version of the basic screening model. Contract-theoretic screening models have been pioneered by Roger Myerson and Eric Maskin. They have been extended in various directions, e.g. it has been shown that in the context of patent licensing optimal screening contracts may actually yield too much trade compared to the first-best solution. Applications of screening models include regulation, public procurement, and <b>monopolistic</b> <b>price</b> discrimination. Contract-theoretic screening models have been successfully tested in laboratory experiments and using field data.|$|E

Indeed, <b>monopolistic</b> <b>price</b> differentiation can improve welfare and also aggregate consumer surplus even if, as in the benchmark linear case, total output does not increase.

By reducing the costs of information acquisition or forcing firms to supply consumers with the respective information about past usage, policy can further improve welfare, as contracts become more efficient.

The findings are robust to the inclusion of distortionary taxes, government indebtedness, and non-traded goods. ...|$|E

Each relay’s bid includes a charging function and a proposed traffic share. Relays aim to maximize their individual profit from forwarding traffic. We show that the socially optimal traffic allocation can always be induced by an equilibrium where no relay can increase its profit by unilaterally changing its bids. Inefficient equilibria arise due to the <b>monopolistic</b> <b>pricing</b> power of a superior relay.

40|$|The {{security}} of the Bitcoin system is based on having {{a large amount of}} computational {{power in the hands of}} honest miners. Such miners are incentivized to join the system and validate transactions by the payments issued by the protocol to anyone who creates blocks. As new bitcoins creation rate decreases (halving every 4 years), the revenue derived from transaction fees start to have an increasingly important role. We argue that Bitcoin's current fee market does not extract revenue well when blocks are not congested. This effect has implications for the scalability debate: revenue from transaction fees may decrease if block size is increased. The current mechanism is a "pay your bid" auction in which included transactions pay the amount they suggested. We propose two alternative auction mechanisms: The <b>Monopolistic</b> <b>Price</b> Mechanism, and the Random Sampling Optimal Price Mechanism (due to Goldberg et al.). In the <b>monopolistic</b> <b>price</b> mechanism, the miner chooses the number of accepted transactions in the block, and all transactions pay exactly the smallest bid included in the block. The mechanism thus sets the block size dynamically (up to a bound required for fast block propagation and other security concerns). We show, using analysis and simulations, that this mechanism extracts revenue better from users, and that it is nearly incentive compatible: the profit due to strategic bidding relative to honest biding decreases as the number of bidders grows. Users can then simply set their bids truthfully to exactly the amount they are willing to pay to transact, and do not need to utilize fee estimate mechanisms, do not resort to bid shading and do not need to adjust transaction fees (via replace-by-fee mechanisms) if the mempool grows. We discuss these and other properties of our mechanisms, and explore various desired properties of fee market mechanisms for crypto-currencies...|$|E
