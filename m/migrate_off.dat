Connections between these stocks and whales seen in the Sea of Okhotsk, on Kamchatka coasts and around the Commander Islands have been studied. Historical {{wintering}} distributions could have been much wider and more southerly distributed, as whales were seen in areas along the Batanes, Sulu and Celebes Seas including off Palawan, Luzon, Malaysia and Mindanao, with higher densities around today's Cape Eluanbi and Kenting National Park. Unconfirmed sightings have been reported near Borneo in modern times. The first confirmation in modern Taiwan was of a pair off Hualien in 1994, followed by a successful escape from entanglement off Taitung in 1999, and continuous sightings around Orchid Island in 2000. Few/none regularly migrate into Kenting National Park. In addition, despite sightings reported almost annually off Green and Orchid Islands, relatively short stays in these waters indicate recoveries as winter foraging has not occurred. Sightings, including of a cow-calf pair, have occurred along {{the east coast of}} Taiwan. Around Hong Kong, two documented sightings were recorded in 2009 and in 2016.

40|$|Parasitic {{nematodes}} {{of humans}} and livestock cause extensive disease and economic loss worldwide. Many parasitic nematodes infect hosts as third-stage larvae, called iL 3 s. iL 3 s vary in their infection route: some infect by skin penetration, others by passive ingestion. Skin-penetrating iL 3 s actively search for hosts using host-emitted olfactory cues, but {{the extent to which}} passively ingested iL 3 s respond to olfactory cues was largely unknown. Here, we examined the olfactory behaviors of the passively ingested murine gastrointestinal parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus. H. polygyrus iL 3 s were thought to reside primarily on mouse feces, and infect when mice consume feces containing iL 3 s. However, iL 3 s can also adhere to mouse fur and infect orally during grooming. Here, we show that H. polygyrus iL 3 s are highly active and show robust attraction to host feces. Despite their attraction to feces, many iL 3 s <b>migrate</b> <b>off</b> feces to engage in environmental navigation. In addition, H. polygyrus iL 3 s are attracted to mammalian skin odorants, suggesting that they migrate toward hosts. The olfactory preferences of H. polygyrus are flexible: some odorants are repulsive for iL 3 s maintained on feces but attractive for iL 3 s maintained off feces. Experience-dependent modulation of olfactory behavior occurs over the course of days and is mediated by environmental carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels. Similar experience-dependent olfactory plasticity occurs in the passively ingested ruminant-parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, a major veterinary parasite. Our results suggest that passively ingested iL 3 s <b>migrate</b> <b>off</b> their original fecal source and actively navigate toward hosts or new host fecal sources using olfactory cues. Olfactory plasticity may be a mechanism that enables iL 3 s to switch from dispersal behavior to host-seeking behavior. Together, our results demonstrate that passively ingested nematodes do not remain inactive waiting to be swallowed, but rather display complex sensory-driven behaviors to position themselves for host ingestion. Disrupting these behaviors may be a new avenue for preventing infections...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the nineteenth century, the struggles of Paris Bourse to manage {{counterparty}} risk revealed the awkward choices that face derivatives exchanges. Shortly after it was founded, the stock exchange, primarily a forward market, instituted a mutual guarantee fund to prevent broker failures from snowballing into a general liquidity crisis. The creation of the fund then forced the Bourse to search for mechanisms to control moral hazard. To study the determinants of broker failures, we collected new individual data on defaulting brokers and describe the evolving regulatory regime. To identify the factors behind the annual number of broker failures we use negative binominal regressions. To explain individual brokers’ duration in office, we employ a proportional hazard model, while logit regressions examine the causes of individual broker failures. In addition to declines in asset prices and trading volume, the moral hazard from the mutual guarantee fund contributed to brokers’ defaulting on their obligations. The Bourse faced a conundrum; when it finally imposed a tight regulatory regime that limited risk, trading began to <b>migrate</b> <b>off</b> the exchange to less regulated markets. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{facilitate}} a direct interface between protein separation by PAGE and protein identification by mass spectrometry, {{we developed a}} multichannel system that continuously collects fractions as protein bands <b>migrate</b> <b>off</b> the bottom of gel electrophoresis columns.

We demonstrate that rapid, high-resolution separation of a complex protein mixture can be achieved on this system using SDS-PAGE. In a 2. 5 h electrophoresis run, for example, each sample was separated and eluted into 48 - 96 fractions over a mass range of 10 - 150 kDa; sample recovery rates were 50 percent or higher; each channel was loaded with up to 0. 3 mg of protein in 0. 4 mL; and a purified band was eluted in two to three fractions (200 L/fraction). Similar results were obtained when running native gel electrophoresis, but protein aggregation limited the loading capacity to about 50 g per channel and reduced resolution...|$|E

30|$|To engage VM migration, {{the authors}} in [39] used a two-threshold {{reactive}} approach. The low threshold aims to lower power consumption and triggers VMs to be <b>migrated</b> <b>off</b> a node, {{which is then}} set to sleep mode. The high threshold aims to meet SLA and triggers migration of a VM with the highest utilisation to another node. The double threshold approach takes a snapshot in time of the current CPU utilisation and thus can suffer from false positives caused by workload utilisation peaks and troughs. In later work, Beloglazov et al. [69] proposed an adaptive auto-adjustment of the upper threshold, based on statistical analysis of historical data collected during the lifetime of VMs, combating statistical outliers in their earlier approach. Similarly, the authors in [70] proposed a dynamic threshold approach that finds and adjusts thresholds at runtime. Zuo et al. [71] also use an adaptive threshold. The authors monitor 3 metrics: number of resource requests, resource service capacity and resource service strength, and propose a dynamic weighted evaluation, dividing the resource load into three states including Overload, Normal and Idle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Three-dimensional (3 D) {{acoustic}} imaging {{is a highly}} developed technology that has produced a detailed image of the subsurface, at over 30 hazardous waste sites. 3 D imaging {{has been used to}} provide the density of data necessary to analyze the pathways for fluid transport, whether in free phase or as a dissolved plume. This information has then been used to optimally locate control or monitor points. Evaluation of chemical sampling while drilling has been combined with the seismic data to address whether the plume can be contained or remediated. In 1994 the first 3 D seismic survey over a hazardous waste site was performed at Naval Air Station North Island in California. The 3 D seismic information, followed by confirmatory drilling, significantly changed the site conceptual model. The seismic image saved time and costs for characterization and remediation. A seismic survey at a NASA site and confirmatory drilling showed that free product was not present and that natural attenuation could be used. At Edwards AFB in California, there was concern that contaminants could <b>migrate</b> <b>off</b> base. The seismic image demonstrated that this was unlikely.

40|$|In February 1994, {{a ground}} water level {{monitoring}} program was begun at the Vitro processing site. The {{purpose of the}} program was to evaluate how irrigating the new golf driving range affected ground water elevations in the unconfined aquifer. The program also evaluated potential impacts of a 9 -hole golf course planned as an expansion of the driving range. The planned golf course expansion would increase the area to be irrigated and, thus, the water that could infiltrate the processing site soil to recharge the unconfined aquifer. Increased water levels in the aquifer could alter the ground water flow regime; contaminants in ground water could <b>migrate</b> <b>off</b> the site or could discharge to bodies of surface water in the area. The potential effects of expanding the golf course have been evaluated, and a report is being prepared. Water level data obtained during this monitoring program indicate that minor seasonal mounding may be occurring in response to irrigation of the driving range. However, the effects of irrigation appear small in comparison to the effects of precipitation. There are no monitor wells in the area that irrigation would affect most; that data limitation makes interpretations of water levels and the possibility of ground water mounding uncertain. Limitations of available data are discussed in the conclusion...|$|E

Since the mid 1990 's the industry has been increasingly threatened by changes in Western Arctic Caribou Herd (WACH) migration paths and winter range. Free-range reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) intermingle with caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) and <b>migrate</b> <b>off</b> designated reindeer ranges. As of spring 2003, eleven of fourteen Seward Peninsula reindeer operations were no longer commercially viable {{as a result of}} caribou induced reindeer losses. This loss is significant to an economically depressed region with few development opportunities. An economic input-output model was constructed in this study to analyze the reindeer industry's economic role in the regional economy prior to the loss of reindeer to caribou. Impact scenarios were used to estimate the effect of WACH on the regional economy through decreased output from the reindeer industry. Results show a per annum negative impact of $ 1. 4 million (2000 dollars) on the regional economy with 11 non-operational reindeer herds. If reindeer losses lead to complete elimination of the commercial reindeer industry on the Seward Peninsula, study results show the region would incur a total negative economic impact of more than $ 17 million...|$|E
