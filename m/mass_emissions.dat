5000|$|Leo Breton of the USEPA {{questioned}} dynamometer testing's {{ability to}} reflected real-world emissions levels of vehicles on-road. To investigate the matter, in 1995 he constructed a device called ROVER, short for Real-time On-road Vehicle Emissions Reporter. The first commercially available device was invented and patented by Michal Vojtisek-Lom, {{in conjunction with}} Clean Air Technologies International (CATI) Inc. out of Buffalo, New York in 1999. The early commercially available units relied upon engine data from either an [...] "On-Board Diagnostic" [...] (OBD) port or directly from an engine sensor array. The first unit was developed for, and sold to - Dr. H. Christopher Frey of North Carolina State University NCSU) for the first ever on-road testing project sponsored by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. David W. Miller, who co-founded CATI, first coined the phrase [...] "Portable Emissions Measurement System" [...] and [...] "PEMS" [...] when working on a 2000 New York City Metropolitan Transportation Agency bus project with Dr. Thomas Lanni of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, as a short-hand description of the new device. Other governmental groups and universities soon followed, and quickly began to utilize the equipment due to its balance of accuracy, low cost, light weight, and availability. From 1999 through 2004, research groups such as Virginia Tech, Penn State, and Texas A&M Transportation Institute, Texas Southern University and others began to use PEMS in border crossing projects, roadway evaluations, traffic control methods, before-and-after scenarios, and even on ferries, planes, and off-road vehicles, to explore what was possible outside of a lab environment. A project performed in April 2002 by the California Air Resources Board(ARB) - utilizing non-1065 PEMS equipment, tested 40 trucks {{over a period of}} 2 ½ days; of which, 22 trucks were tested on road in Tulare, California. Also during this timeframe, one such high-profile project performed with early PEMS equipment was the World Trade Center (WTC) Ground Zero Project in lower Manhattan, testing concrete pumpers, bulldozers, graders, and later - diesel cranes on Building #7 - 40 stories high. Other early PEMS projects such as Dr. Chris Frey's field work was used by the USEPA {{in the development of the}} MOVES Model. However, users such as regulators and vehicle manufacturers had to wait for ROVER to be commercialized to conduct actual measurements of <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> rather than depend on estimates of <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> using data the OBD port, or a direct engine measurement, in order to have a more defensible data set. This push led to a new 2005 standard known as CFR 40 Part 1065.|$|E

40|$|High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes were {{recently}} proposed for I- 85 in Atlanta {{as a way}} to relieve congestion and provide a reliable commute time for single occupant drivers that are willing to pay a toll. It is important to evaluate the air quality impacts of such a proposal to meet environmental regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Transportation Conformity Regulations. The goal {{of this study is to}} understand how vehicle <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> change as a result of implementing HOT lanes on I- 85 in Atlanta. This is done by considering a number of factors affect mass vehicle emissions, such as vehicle activity, vehicle speeds, vehicle age distributions, and vehicle class distributions. These factors are incorporated into a base scenario, which models the current condition on I- 85 with HOV lanes, and a future scenario, which models the implementation of HOT lanes on this corridor. The base scenario mainly uses data from a data collection effort by Georgia Tech during the summer of 2007 on the I- 85 corridor, while the future scenario makes alterations to these data using information from other cities that have already implemented HOT lanes. The MOBILE-Matrix modeling tool, which was recently developed by Georgia Tech [16], was used to run the emissions analysis using the input factors from these data sources. This tool calculated <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> for five pollutants: HC, NOx, CO, PM 2. 5, and PM 10. The results show very small increases in <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> for NOx, CO, PM 2. 5, and PM 10, and very small decreases in <b>mass</b> <b>emissions</b> for HC. Therefore, the implementation of HOT lanes on I- 85 in Atlanta is unlikely to violate the Transportation Conformity Rule. For NEPA purposes, this analysis could be used to make the case that air quality impacts are not significant, and therefore further detailed analyses are not required. M. S.

The objective {{of this research was}} to measure carbonyl emission factors for California light-duty {{motor vehicles}}. Measurements were made at the entrance and exit of a San Francisco Bay area highway tunnel, in the center bore where heavy-duty trucks are not allowed. During summer 1999, approximately 100 carbonyls were identified, including saturated ahphatic aldehydes and ketones, unsaturated ahphatic carbonyls, ahphatic dicarbonyls, and aromatic carbonyls. Concentrations were measured for 32 carbonyls and were combined with NMOC, CO and CO 2 concentrations to calculate by carbon balance emission factors per unit of fuel burned. The measured carbonyl mass emitted from light-duty vehicles was 68 +/- 4 mg L^- 1. Formaldehyde accounted for 45 % of the measured <b>mass</b> <b>emissions,</b> acetaldehyde 12 %, toluadehydes 10 %, benzaldehyde 7. 2 %, and acetone 5. 9 %. The ozone forming potential of the carbonyl emissions was dominated by formaldehyde (70 %) and acetaldehyde (14 %).

The two areas studied had average ages of 3. 7 and 16 years, and contained 5. 7 x 10 ^ 6 and 2. 04 x 10 ^ 6 tonnes of MSW, respectively. Variations in flow rate, total dissolved solids (TDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), Fe, and Mn were monitored over a 3 -month period in the winter and spring of 1992. Increases in flow driven by precipitation caused gradually increasing leachate mass emission from the aged fill. The rate of mass emission increase with increasing flow from the new fill was more than three times higher than that from the old fill. Leachate flow through the old fill appeared more channelized, resulting in diluting effects with increasing percolation.

To date very little work has been done on tracking the emissions of NMOC from landfills. To this end, a concerted effort was made to investigate the total annual <b>mass</b> <b>emission</b> rate of NMOC from a closed landfill site in South Manchester, United Kingdom. This was done by using field estimates of NMOC concentration and the landfill parameters into the Landfill Gas Emission Model embedded in ACTS and RISK software. Two results were obtained: (i) a deterministic outcome of 1. 7218 x 10 - 7 kg/year, which was calculated from mean values of the field estimates of NMOC concentration and the landfill parameters, and (ii) a probabilistic outcome of 1. 66 x 10 - 7 - 1. 78 x 10 - 7 kg/year, which is a range of value obtained after Monte Carlo simulation of the uncertain parameters of the landfill including NMOC concentration. A comparison between these two results suggests that the probabilistic outcome is a more representative and reliable estimate of the total annual <b>mass</b> <b>emission</b> of NMOC especially given the variability of the parameters of the model. Moreover, a comparison of the model result and the safety standard of 5. 0 x 10 - 5 kg/year indicate that the <b>mass</b> <b>emission</b> of NMOC from the studied landfill is significantly less than previously thought.
