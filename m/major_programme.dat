5|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the construction of}} the works, trunk sewers were built to convey sewage from the city to the works. These was a <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are also expected to handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E

The redevelopment would include the demolition of the existing East and South Stand structures, to be replaced by new purpose built stands that would partially enclose the stadium; complete renovation of the existing North and West Stands; and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the IFA.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for Edward's {{involvement}} in legal reform {{is hard to}} find but his reign saw a <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of legal change. Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the Statutes of Mortmain, Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when Philip IV of France confiscated the Duchy of Gascony in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting assembly in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants. The resulting parliament included barons, clergy, knights, and burgesses for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In 1872 a <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of {{building}} works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court of the Exchange and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to {{have been made in the}} late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under the central part of the Exchange. Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E

500|$|Henry VIII gave {{instructions}} through Parliament in 1539 {{that new}} defences {{were to be}} built along the coasts of England, beginning a <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of work that would continue until 1547. The order {{was known as a}} [...] "device", which meant a documented plan, instruction or schema, leading to the fortifications later becoming known as the [...] "Device Forts". The initial instructions for the [...] "defence of the realm in time of invasion" [...] concerned building forts along the southern coastline of England, as well as making improvements to the defences of the towns of Calais and Guisnes in France, then controlled by Henry's forces. Commissioners were also to be sent out across south-west and south-east England to inspect the current defences and to propose sites for new ones.|$|E

500|$|It was {{replaced}} in 1896, possibly {{on the same}} site, by a new lighthouse built to a design by David Stevenson {{as part of a}} <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of construction works around northern Scotland. A fog warning system was installed the following year. Stevenson's lighthouse consists of a circular white-painted stone tower standing [...] high at an elevation of [...] above Mean High Water with a number of buildings nearby to house generators and the lighthouse keepers. The light was converted to a paraffin lamp when the former lythene lamp was found to be unsuitable. An oil store was installed in the lighthouse tower, ending the need for a separate building to hold the fuel. The lighthouse was subjected to a machine-gun attack by a German aircraft on 22 February 1941. It caused little damage and no injuries, and the keepers were soon able to make repairs.|$|E
500|$|The Device Forts, {{also known}} as Henrician castles and blockhouses, were a series of {{artillery}} fortifications built to defend the coast of England and Wales by Henry VIII. Traditionally, the Crown had left coastal defences {{in the hands of}} local lords and communities but the threat of French and Spanish invasion led the King to issue an order, called a [...] "device", for a <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of work between 1539 and 1547. The fortifications ranged from large stone castles positioned to protect the Downs anchorage in Kent, to small blockhouses overlooking the entrance to Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, and earthwork bulwarks along the Essex coast. Some forts operated independently, others were designed to be mutually reinforcing. The Device programme was hugely expensive, costing a total of £376,000; much of this was raised from the proceeds of the dissolution of the monasteries a few years before.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} also encouraged {{the development of}} new industries such as financial services, duty-free shopping, casinos and Internet gambling. Branches of major British chains such as Marks & Spencer were opened in Gibraltar to encourage visits from British expatriates on the nearby Costa del Sol. To facilitate the territory's economic expansion, a <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of land reclamation was carried out; a tenth of Gibraltar's present-day land area was reclaimed from the sea. These initiatives proved enormously successful. By 2007, Chief Minister Peter Caruana was able to boast that Gibraltar's economic success had made it [...] "one of the most affluent communities in the entire world." [...] , Gibraltar is ranked as the second most prosperous territory within the European Union and the 18th most prosperous worldwide in terms of gross domestic product by purchasing power parity per capita (the United Kingdom, for comparison, is 33rd worldwide and Spain is 44th). Today, Gibraltar has one Big Four accounting firm office per 10,000 people, the second highest in the world after the British Virgin Islands, and a bank per 1,700 people, the fifth most banks per capita in the world.|$|E

500|$|The {{estate was}} {{inherited}} in 1739 by Charles Legh, who {{embarked on a}} <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of reconstruction, transforming the hall [...] "from a medium-sized Tudor house into a large Georgian manor". He built a new west wing, which contained a dining room, a drawing room, a library, and a ballroom, the last occupying the whole length of the first floor. [...] He then rebuilt the south wing, connecting it with the new west wing and the older Tudor east wing. At {{each end of the}} south wing was a pavilion with a canted bay on its south front. [...] The west pavilion contained {{the southern end of the}} ballroom, and the east pavilion housed a chapel. [...] During this time the stable block and other buildings were constructed in the grounds. [...] The architect responsible for this work is unknown, although it has been suggested that the design was by Charles himself. [...] A major reconstruction took place in 1928 under the direction of the architect Hubert Worthington. [...] Much of the west wing was demolished, removing the ballroom but retaining the drawing and dining rooms. [...] To avoid leaving a gap exposing the courtyard, Worthington filled it with a screen wall containing a corridor linking the west and south wings. [...] He decorated this with quoins, cornices and sash windows. [...] The projecting pavilions at the ends of the south front were also demolished. In the 1960s the stable block was converted into mews flats. [...] Between 2004 and 2009 the east wing was restored.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} James IV at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 meant {{a long period}} of regency in the name of his infant son James V. He was {{declared}} an adult in 1524, but the next year Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, the young king's stepfather, took custody of James and held him as a virtual prisoner for three years, exercising power on his behalf. He finally managed to escape from the custody of the regents in 1528 and began to take revenge on a number of them and their families. He continued his father's policy of subduing the rebellious Highlands, Western and Northern isles and the troublesome borders. He took punitive measures against the Clan Douglas in the north, summarily executed John Armstrong of Liddesdale and carried out royal progresses to underline his authority. He also continued the French Auld alliance that had been in place since the fourteenth century, marrying first the French noblewoman Madeleine of Valois and then after her death Marie of Guise. He increased crown revenues by heavily taxing the church, taking £72,000 in four years, and embarked on a <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of building at royal palaces. He avoided pursuing the major structural and theological changes to the church undertaken by his contemporary Henry VIII in England. He used the Church as a source of offices for his many illegitimate children and his favourites, particularly David Beaton, who became Archbishop of Saint Andrews and a Cardinal. James V's domestic and foreign policy successes were overshadowed by another disastrous campaign against England that led to an overwhelming defeat at the Battle of Solway Moss (1542). James died a short time later, a demise blamed by contemporaries on [...] "a broken heart". The day before his death, he was brought news of the birth of an heir: a daughter, who would become Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
500|$|When the Hanoverian dynasty {{ascended the}} throne, their {{situation}} was uncertain {{and with a}} possible Scottish rebellion in mind, the Tower of London was repaired. Gun platforms added under the Stuarts had decayed. The number of guns at the Tower was reduced from 118 to 45, and one contemporary commentator noted that the castle [...] "would not hold out four and twenty hours against an army prepared for a siege". For the most part, the 18th-century work on the defences was spasmodic and piecemeal, although a new gateway in the southern curtain wall permitting access from the wharf to the outer ward was added in 1774. The moat surrounding the castle had become silted over the centuries since it was created despite attempts at clearing it. It was still {{an integral part of}} the castle's defences, so in 1830 the Constable of the Tower, the Duke of Wellington, ordered a large-scale clearance of several feet of silt. However this did not prevent an outbreak of disease in the garrison in 1841 caused by poor water supply, resulting in several deaths. To prevent the festering ditch posing further health problems, it was ordered that the moat should be drained and filled with earth. The work began in 1843 and was mostly complete two years later. The construction of the Waterloo Barracks in the inner ward began in 1845, when the Duke of Wellington laid the foundation stone. The building could accommodate 1,000men; at the same time, separate quarters for the officers were built to the north-east of the White Tower. The building is now the headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The popularity of the Chartist movement between 1828 and 1858 led to a desire to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest. It was the last <b>major</b> <b>programme</b> of fortification at the castle. Most of the surviving installations for the use of artillery and firearms date from this period.|$|E
