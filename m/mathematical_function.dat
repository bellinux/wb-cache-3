25|$|The {{result was}} widely advertised by Murray Gell-Mann, leading Gabriele Veneziano to {{construct}} a scattering amplitude that had the property of Dolen-Horn-Schmid duality, later renamed world-sheet duality. The amplitude needed poles where the particles appear, on straight line trajectories, {{and there is a}} special <b>mathematical</b> <b>function</b> whose poles are evenly spaced on half the real line—the gamma function— which was widely used in Regge theory. By manipulating combinations of gamma functions, Veneziano was able to find a consistent scattering amplitude with poles on straight lines, with mostly positive residues, which obeyed duality and had the appropriate Regge scaling at high energy. The amplitude could fit near-beam scattering data as well as other Regge type fits, and had a suggestive integral representation {{that could be used for}} generalization.|$|E
25|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of a}} regular grid of cells, each in one of {{a finite number of}} states, such as on and off (in contrast to a coupled map lattice). The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state (time t=0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a <b>mathematical</b> <b>function)</b> that determines the new state of each cell in terms of {{the current state of the}} cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously, though exceptions are known, such as the stochastic {{cellular automaton}} and asynchronous cellular automaton.|$|E

The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wave—a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an atomic orbital, a <b>mathematical</b> <b>function</b> that characterises the probability that an electron appears {{to be at a}} particular location when its position is measured. Only a discrete (or [...] ) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.

Since Bode's law also predicted a body between Mars and Jupiter that at that point had not been observed, astronomers turned their attention to that region in the hope that it might be vindicated again. Finally, in 1801, astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi found a miniature new world, Ceres, lying at just the correct point in space. The object was hailed as a new planet.|$|E
