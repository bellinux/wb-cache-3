5000|$|The name maraschino {{originates}} {{from the}} <b>Marasca</b> <b>cherry</b> of Croatian origin and the maraschino liqueur made from it, in which Marasca cherries were crushed and preserved after being pickled. Whole cherries preserved in this liqueur {{were known as}} [...] "maraschino cherries." [...] These had been a local means of preserving the fruit in Dalmatia.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Marasca</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus cerasus var. marasca) {{is a type}} of sour [...] "Morello cherry" [...] {{known only}} from cultivation. The [...] "Marasca" [...] cherry as grown in coastal Croatia (historic Dalmatia) is reputed to attain its finest flavour. The fruit's largest yield is in Zadar in Croatia, but it has been {{successfully}} cultivated in northern Italy, Slovenia, southern Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has become naturalized in North America, though the [...] "maraschino cherry" [...] of American commerce is the Royal Ann variety of sweet cherry.|$|E

5000|$|Maraschino ( [...] ) is a liqueur {{obtained}} from the distillation of <b>Marasca</b> <b>cherries.</b> The small, slightly sour fruit of the Tapiwa cherry tree (Prunus cerasus var. marasca), which grows wild along parts of the Dalmatian coast, lends the liqueur its unique aroma.|$|R
5000|$|In response, the USDA in 1912 defined [...] "maraschino {{cherries}}" [...] as [...] "Marasca cherries {{preserved in}} maraschino" [...] {{under the authority}} of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. The artificially-colored and sweetened Royal Anne variety were required to be called [...] "Imitation Maraschino Cherries" [...] instead. Food Inspection Decision 141 defined <b>Marasca</b> <b>cherries</b> and maraschino themselves. It was signed on Feb. 17, 1912.|$|R
50|$|The company's current {{products}} {{include a}} variety of liqueurs and similar products (Maraschino, Sangue Morlacco, Sambuca, Amaretto, Grappa, Passione Nera, Slivovitz etc.) {{as well as other}} baking related products, such as liqueur concentrates, fruit syrups, and jams. Luxardo products are sold in about 70 countries worldwide. The distillery employs approximately 45 people, as well as roughly 100 salespeople throughout Italy. The 6800 m2 distillery is capable of producing 6,000 bottles per hour. In 2010, it produced a pre-tax profit of €16 million. The company owns 22,000 <b>Marasca</b> <b>cherry</b> trees in what is the largest cherry orchard in the European Union.|$|E
5000|$|Cherry wine {{is a type}} {{of fruit}} wine made with {{cherries}}, usually tart cherries that provide sufficient acid. [...] Cherry wines {{can be used to make}} fortified wines and liqueurs. Michigan wine makers, located in the leading tart-cherry-producing region of the United States, produce several varieties of cherry wine, including spiced versions and cherry-grape blends. [...] "Cherry Kijafa" [...] is a fortified fruit wine that is produced in Denmark from cherries with added natural flavors, and usually contains 16% ABV. [...] Among cherry liqueurs Maraska, a cherry wine made from <b>Marasca</b> <b>cherry</b> from Croatia, is among the best known. The last couple of years Fredriksdal Cherry Wine (partly invented by distinguished restaurant owner Jan Friis-Mikkelsen) has been produced in Denmark. Having growing international success Frederiksdal's goal is to make cherry wine of a quality equivalent to wine made from grapes.|$|E
50|$|Back at Castle, Beckman {{finds it}} hard to believe that two of the CIA's best agents went rogue and wants to know why. Sarah is {{determined}} to find the Turners, but Chuck is stressed over what the Turners' relationship means for their own, and about not knowing where to even begin their search. However, Sarah pieces together that they are staying at the Grand Ambassador hotel, the only place in Los Angeles where the rare <b>Marasca</b> <b>cherry</b> can be found, which Craig had mentioned when discussing his fondness for Manhattans. After locating the correct suite (the only room which ordered twelve Manhattans), Chuck and Sarah ambush and apprehend the Turners and bring them back to Chuck's apartment. The Turners each attempt to blame the other, but are shamed by Chuck into remembering they used to genuinely love each other before being disillusioned by their spy work with the CIA. Before any further action can be taken, Vogel arrives, locating them via a tracking device hidden in Sasha's collar.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{different stages of}} maturity on the anthocyanin content and colour parameters in three sour <b>cherry</b> <b>Marasca</b> ecotypes grown in two Dalmatian geographical regions has been studied. Anthocyanins were determined by HPLC-UV/VIS PDA analysis and the colour of fruit flesh and skin was measured by tristimulus colourimeter (CIELAB system). The major anthocyanins in all ecotypes at all stages of maturity were cyanidin 3 -glucosylrutinoside and cyanidin 3 -rutinoside, whereas pelargonidin glycosides were de-termined in lower concentrations. During ripening, anthocyanins did not change uni-formly, but in most ecotypes they were determined in higher concentrations at the last stage of maturity (3. 18 to 19. 75 g per kg of dry matter). The formation of dark red, almost black colour in ripe <b>Marasca</b> <b>cherries</b> decreased redness (a*), brightness (L*) and colour intensity (C*). The results of two-way ANOVA test indicated that the growing region sig-nificantly influenced the accumulation of individual anthocyanins and L * value during ripening, while ecotype and {{the interaction between the}} growing region and the ecotype significantly affected total anthocyanin content of sour cherry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports about}} the content of {{polyphenols}} and volatiles in fresh fruits of two sour <b>cherry</b> cultivars (<b>Marasca</b> and Obla~inska), some berry fruits (strawberry Maya, raspberry Willamette and wild blueberry) and the corresponding low sugar jams. Pheno-lic compounds (hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, flavan- 3 -ols and flavonols) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Those found in the fruits were also found in the jams. Jams contained lower amounts of polyphenols than fresh fuits, but their overall retention in jams was relatively high. Among fruits, sour <b>cherry</b> <b>Marasca</b> had the highest level of polyphenols, while sour <b>cherry</b> <b>Marasca</b> jam and rasp-berry Willamette jam had the highest level of polyphenols among jams. The major flavo-noid in all investigated fruits, except in sour cherry Obla~inska, was (–) -epicatechin. Sour <b>cherry</b> <b>Marasca</b> had the highest level of (–) -epicatechin (95. 75 mg/kg), and it also contained very high amounts of flavonols, derivatives of quercetin and kaempferol.

Phenolic compound (+) -gallocatechin was found only in Marasca fruit and jam. Ellagic acid was found in the highest concentration in raspberry Willamette fruit and jam. Hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) were found in all the investigated fruits, {{with the exception of a}} derivative of ferulic acid, which was not found in strawberry. Derivatives of caffeic, p-coumaric and chlorogenic acids were found in all the investigated fruits, with chlorogenic acid being the most abundant, especially in sour <b>cherry</b> <b>Marasca.</b> Volatiles were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and expressed as the peak area of the identified compounds. All investigated volatiles of fresh fruit were also determined in the related jams with relatively high retention. Sour <b>cherries</b> <b>Marasca</b> and Oblačinska contained the same volatile compounds, but Marasca had higher level of total volatiles. The main volatile compound in both sour cherry cultivars was benzaldehyde (characteristic cherry aroma compound), which was followed by hexanal, 2 -hexenal, 2 -heptanone, linalool, nerol, and α-terpineol. Our results show that γ-decalactone and linalool were the most abundant volatile compounds in strawberry Maya and raspberry Willamette, respectively. The most abundant group of volatiles in wild bluberry was esters, and they were followed by terpenes, ethyl butanoate and linalool...|$|R
40|$|Response surface {{methodology}} {{was applied}} for optimization of the sour <b>cherry</b> <b>Marasca</b> juice spray drying process with 20, 30 and 40 % of carriers maltodextrin with dextrose equivalent (DE) value of 4 – 7 and 13 – 17 and gum arabic, at three drying temperatures: 150, 175 and 200 °C. Increase in carrier mass per volume ratio resulted in lower moisture content and powder hygroscopicity, higher bulk density, solubility and product yield. Higher temperatures decreased the moisture content and bulk density of powders. Temperature of 200 °C and 27 % of maltodextrin with 4 – 7 DE {{were found to be}} the most suitable for production of sour <b>cherry</b> <b>Marasca</b> powder...|$|R
5000|$|Francesco Drioli {{developed}} and perfected Giuseppe Carceniga's earlier innovative techniques for the distillation of <b>Marasca</b> <b>cherries</b> and in 1759 {{he founded the}} Fabbrica di Maraschino Francesco Drioli (Francesco Drioli Maraschino Factory). By {{the end of the}} 18th century his maraschino had already gained widespread fame and had cornered the major markets in Europe, especially in England. In the first advertisement in the London Morning Post and Daily Advertiser, dated 17 June 1779, the firm Johnson and Justerini informed [...] "the nobility and gentry" [...] of having [...] "just imported a large quantity of maraschino from Zara ... of the most exquisite flavour" [...] and in 1804 the Austrian Emperor granted the factory the title Imperial Regia Privilegiata entitling it to use the Imperial coat of arms. The liqueur was sought after by distinguished personages, rulers and courts from all over Europe and the Francesco Drioli factory held Royal Warrants, entitling them to use the royal coat of arms, from the royal households of Austria, Great Britain and Italy. British warships were sent from bases in Corfù and Malta to pick up shipments of maraschino for British royalty. In fact in 1877 the Duke of York (the future George V) and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the factory and accepted [...] "with great pleasure a choice buffet" [...] in the Salghetti-Drioli family home and purchased [...] "more cases of rosolio and several jars of maraschino cherries" [...] (Il Dalmata, a. XXII, no.77, 28 September 1877). From the outset, however, Drioli Maraschino was subject to counterfeiting, a scourge which would plague the factory even after it closed in 1980, forcing its owners to take repeated legal action. In his Via Facti, Nicolò Tommaseo noted how widespread Drioli Maraschino was in Italia... e in tutte cinque le parti del mondo (in Italy... and in all five parts of the world) and he wrote, [...] "in tutte bevuto e in tutte falsificato..." [...] (it is drunk everywhere and copied everywhere).|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} heating {{temperature}} (80 – 120 °C) and processing time (5 – 50 min) on {{the stability of}} anthocyanins (cyanidin- 3 -glucosylrutinoside, cyanidin- 3 -rutinoside and cyanidin- 3 -glucoside), quercetin- 3 -glucoside and phenolic acids (chlorogenic, neochlorogenic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids) in freeze-dried <b>Marasca</b> sour <b>cherry</b> pastes was studied. The degradation rates of individual anthocyanins, quercetin- 3 -glucoside and phenolic acids followed the first order reaction kinetics. Cyanidin- 3 -glucoside {{was found to be}} the most unstable among the anthocyanins, together with p-coumaric and neochlorogenic acids among other phenols. Activation energies for anthocyanin degradation ranged from 42 (cyanidin- 3 -glucosylrutinoside) to 55 kJ/mol (cyanidin- 3 -glucoside), and for other phenols from 8. 12 (chlorogenic acid) to 27 kJ/mol (neochlorogenic acid). By increasing the temperature from 80 to 120 °C, the reaction rate constant of cyanidin- 3 -glucosylrutinoside increased from 2. 2 · 10 – 2 to 8. 5 · 10 – 2 min– 1, of p-coumaric acid from 1. 12 · 10 – 2 to 2. 5 · 10 – 2 min– 1 and of quercetin- 3 -glucoside from 1. 5 · 10 – 2 to 2. 6 · 10 – 2 min– 1. The obtained results demonstrate that at 80 °C the half-life of anthocyanins ranges from 32. 10 min for cyanidin- 3 -glucosylrutinoside to 45. 69 min for cyanidin- 3 -rutinoside, and of other phenolic compounds from 43. 39 for neochlorogenic acid to 66. 99 min for chlorogenic acid. The results show that the heating temperature and duration affect the anthocyanins considerably more than the other phenols in terms of degradation...|$|R
60|$|But {{under all}} her questionings she felt well; a nonchalance deep as sleep, a {{passivity}} and indifference so dark and sweet {{she felt it}} must be evil. Evil! She was evil. And yet she had no power to be otherwise. They were legally married. And she was glad. She was relieved by knowing she could not escape. She was Mrs. Marasca. What was the good of trying to be Miss Houghton any longer? <b>Marasca,</b> the bitter <b>cherry.</b> Some dark poison fruit she had eaten. How glad she was she had eaten it! How beautiful he was! And no one saw it but herself. For her it was so potent it made her tremble when she noticed him. His beauty, his dark shadow. Ciccio really was much handsomer since his marriage. He seemed to emerge. Before, he had seemed to make himself invisible in the streets, in England, altogether. But now something unfolded in him, he was a potent, glamorous presence, people turned to watch him. There was a certain dark, leopard-like pride in the air about him, something that the English people watched.|$|R
60|$|Ciccio, the <b>marasca,</b> {{the bitter}} <b>cherry,</b> was {{standing}} {{on the edge of the}} crowd, looking on. He had no connection whatever with the proceedings--stood outside, self-conscious, uncomfortable, bitten by the wind, and hating the people who stared at him. He saw the trim, plump figure of Madame, like some trim plump partridge among a flock of barn-yard fowls. And he depended on her presence. Without her, he would have felt too horribly uncomfortable on that raw hillside. She and he were in some way allied. But these others, how alien and uncouth he felt them. Impressed by their fine clothes, the English working-classes were none the less barbarians to him, uncivilized: just as he was to them an uncivilized animal. Uncouth, they seemed to him, all raw angles and harshness, like their own weather. Not that he thought about them. But he felt it in his flesh, the harshness and discomfort of them. And Alvina was one of them. As she stood there by the grave, pale and pinched and reserved looking, she was of a piece with the hideous cold grey discomfort of the whole scene. Never had anything been more uncongenial to him. He was dying to get away--to clear out. That was all he wanted. Only some southern obstinacy made him watch, from the duskiness of his face, the pale, reserved girl at the grave. Perhaps he even disliked her, at that time. But he watched in his dislike.|$|R
