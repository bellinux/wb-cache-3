30|$|The F 2 -region is {{the most}} {{important}} part of the ionosphere for propagation of high frequency (HF) signals. The key F 2 -layer characteristics are the critical frequency (foF 2) and height of the F 2 peak electron density (hmF 2). It is important to state that hmF 2 values are not directly scaled from ionograms as are other ionospheric F 2 -region parameters. As a result of group retardation of the radar wave, a practical approach to infer hmF 2 values is to use empirical formulas that connect hmF 2 to the maximum usable frequency (<b>MUF)</b> <b>factor,</b> M 3000 F 2 parameter, rather than working with the virtual height read from the ionogram (Bradley and Dudeney, 1973). Thus, the derivation of the F 2 altitude using M 3000 F 2 parameter requires use of semi-empirical models (Bradley and Dudeney, 1973; Bilitza et al., 1979).|$|E
40|$|Somatic {{hypermutation}} (SHM) of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes is {{a highly}} specific mechanism restricted to B lymphocytes during only a few cell generations. Data presented here suggest that transcription of the target genes is required, but not sufficient for SHM. Presumably, cis-acting elements, such as those present in the Ig enhancers, are required to target a mutator <b>factor</b> (<b>MuF)</b> to Ig and human BCL- 6 genes. It is postulated that the MuF travels with the transcribing RNA polymerase and is deposited on the target gene when the polymerase pauses. Point mutations, and rare deletions and insertions, are created by the combined actions of MuF and certain DNA polymerases. A subset of the mutations is corrected during SHM by DNA mismatch repair...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA) project, a pilot study was performed to identify the effects of triclosan on the MELiSSA carbon-mineralizing microorganism Rhodospirillum rubrum S 1 H. Triclosan is a biocide that is commonly found in human excrement and is considered an emerging pollutant in wastewater and the environment. Chronic exposure to MELiSSA-relevant concentrations (≥ 25 μg liter− 1) of triclosan resulted in a significant extension of the lag phase of this organism but hardly affected the growth rate. Analytical determinations gave no indication of triclosan biodegradation during the growth experiment, and flow cytometric viability analyses revealed that triclosan is bacteriostatic and only slightly toxic to R. rubrum S 1 H. Using microarray analyses, the genetic mechanisms supporting the reversibility of triclosan-induced inhibition were scrutinized. An extremely triclosan-responsive cluster of four small adjacent genes was identified, for which there was up to 34 -fold induction with 25 μg liter− 1 triclosan. These four genes, for which the designation <b>muf</b> (micropollutant-upregulated <b>factor)</b> is proposed, appear to be unique to R. rubrum and are shown {{here for the first time}} to be involved in the response to stress. Moreover, numerous other systems that are associated with the proton motive force were shown to be responsive to triclosan, but they were never as highly upregulated as the muf genes. In response to triclosan, R. rubrum S 1 H induced transcription of the phage shock protein operon (pspABC), numerous efflux systems, cell envelope consolidation mechanisms, the oxidative stress response, beta-oxidation, and carbonic anhydrase, while there was downregulation of bacterial conjugation and carboxysome synthesis genes. The muf genes and three efflux-related genes showed the most potential to be low-dose biomarkers...|$|R
