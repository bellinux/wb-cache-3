5|$|As previous, the Swedish {{authorities}} {{continued to}} subsidize freight operations on their side, making it profitable for Swedish exports to go via the Baltic Sea. Hopes in Trondheim {{to act as}} a major transit port for Swedish cargo never materialized. The 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn paper <b>mill</b> <b>saw</b> an increase in transport of lumber from Sweden. The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests. A major customer was still Meråker Smelteverk, who used designated trains to haul ore from Muruvik to Kopperå and microsilica in return. By 1980, cargo volumes were up to the level seen during World War I.|$|E
5|$|The north–south highway {{connecting}} Crompond Road to {{the hamlet}} of Shrub Oak {{was acquired by}} the state of New York in the mid-1920s. It did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became part of NY132, a new route extending from US6 in Shrub Oak to NY22 near the hamlet of Katonah. The highway went southeast from Shrub Oak to Yorktown Heights on Crompond Street and Crompond Road, from where it traveled generally eastward to Katonah on Hallocks <b>Mill,</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River, Amawalk, and Woods Bridge roads. In Katonah, NY132 used Woods Bridge Road, Bedford Road, and Jay Street to connect to NY22.|$|E

[...] Winchester and Cage {{established}} a mercantile business and a successful flatboat trade between Cairo and New Orleans. [...] By 1812, the city had its own cotton mill, woolen <b>mill,</b> <b>saw</b> mill, gristmill, still house, and tavern. [...] The death of Winchester in 1826 and the improvement and shift of the main road between Knoxville and Nashville away from Sumner, however, led to Cairo's eventual decline. [...] In 1923, the Cairo community took advantage of Rosenwald Funds to establish a school for African-American children, which operated until 1959.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his shipbuilding company and merchant fleet, T. J. Southard was a major contributor in numerous other ways to {{the economic and social}} development of his home town of Richmond and the surrounding locale. He founded the Southard Cotton Mill, as well as a mineral spring business that sold its product nationally. He owned numerous businesses collectively employing hundreds of people, including four shipyards, a brass foundry, grist <b>mill,</b> <b>saw</b> and planing mill, furniture factory, sail loft, bakery, edged tool store, drugstore and dry goods and West Indies goods store, the latter alone turning over $50,000 annually in 1840s dollars. Additionally, he worked to bring other businesses and business infrastructure to Richmond, including shoe factories, a bag mill, the telegraph and railroad. He is credited with establishing several business blocks in Richmond along with some fifty houses, and he owned and rented farmland in the locality. It was said of him that there was scarcely an [...] "institution in town he hasn't a corner in." ...|$|E
60|$|Those whom disgust at the aimlessness and insignificance {{of most of}} {{our social}} {{intercourse}} may dispose to withdrawal from it--and their number will probably increase as the reaction against intellectual flippancy goes on--will do well to remember that Mr. Mill's retirement and his vindication of it sprang from no moral valetudinarianism. He did not retire to gratify any self-indulgent whim, but only {{in order to work}} the more uninterruptedly and definitely. The Autobiography tells us what pains he took to keep himself informed of all that was going on in every part of the world. 'In truth, the modern facilities of communication have not only removed all the disadvantages, to a political writer in tolerably easy circumstances, of distance from the scene of political action, but have converted them into advantages. The immediate and regular receipt of newspapers and periodicals keeps him au courant of even the most temporary politics, and gives him a much more correct view of the state and progress of opinion than he could acquire by personal contact with individuals; for every one's social intercourse is more or less limited to particular sets or classes, whose impressions and no others reach him through that channel; and experience has taught me that those who give their time to the absorbing claims of what is called society, not having leisure to keep up a large acquaintance with the organs of opinion, remain much more ignorant of the general state either of the public mind, or of the active and instructed part of it, than a recluse who reads the newspapers need be. There are, no doubt, disadvantages in too long a separation from one's country--in not occasionally renewing one's impressions of the light in which men and things appear when seen from a position in the midst of them; but the deliberate judgment formed at a distance, and undisturbed by inequalities of perspective, is the most to be depended on, even for application in practice. Alternating between the two positions, I combined the advantages of both.' Those who knew him will perhaps agree that he was more widely and precisely informed of the transactions of the day, in every department of activity all over the world, than any other person of their acquaintance. People should remember, further, that though Mr. <b>Mill</b> <b>saw</b> comparatively little of men after a certain time, yet he was for many years of his life in constant and active relations with men. It was to his experience in the Indian Office that he attributed some of his most serviceable qualities, especially this: 'I learnt how to obtain the best I could, when I could not obtain everything; instead of being indignant or dispirited because I could not have entirely my own way, to be pleased and encouraged when I could have the smallest part of it; and when even that could not be, to bear with complete equanimity the being overruled altogether' (pp. 85, 86). In these words we seem almost to hear the modest and simple tones of the writer's own voice.|$|E
