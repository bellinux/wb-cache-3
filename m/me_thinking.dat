500|$|In 2008, {{she moved}} to Mumbai to {{audition}} for film roles, auditioning for a film, Junction, which was never made: [...] "I never thought of coming to Mumbai or being an actress. But when my friend called me for an audition for a movie called Junction, it set <b>me</b> <b>thinking.</b> Sadly, the film never got made". Qureshi signed a two-year contract with Hindustan Unilever to appear in their television commercials. She promoted a range of products, including Samsung Mobile (with Aamir Khan), Nerolac (with Shah Rukh Khan), Vita Marie, Saffola Oil, Mederma Cream and Pears Soap. During a shoot for a Samsung Mobile commercial, director Anurag Kashyap was impressed with her acting ability and promised to use her in a film. Qureshi recalled: [...] "I didn't believe him then. You hear lots of such stories in this industry, so I wasn't waiting with bated breath". Kashyap kept his promise, though, signing her for a three-film deal with his company Anurag Kashyap Films.|$|E
500|$|Yankovic was {{inspired}} to write the song after he heard The Kinks' song [...] "Lola" [...] while driving in his car one day. He noted, [...] "I was driving a rent-a-car through Florida when the song 'Lola' came on the radio, and it got <b>me</b> <b>thinking</b> about how much fun I had doing 'Yoda' [...] where I took a then-current topic and combined it with a classic rock tune." [...] He soon {{turned his attention to}} the film Jurassic Park—about a park on a fictional island, where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs. The film is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton—which had just come out and was already a blockbuster success. Yankovic decided to write a parody about the movie, and considered various songs that he could spoof. Eventually, he decided to parody the 1968 hit single [...] "MacArthur Park", which was performed by Richard Harris. Yankovic approached the original song's writer, Jimmy Webb, who agreed to the idea. In fact, Webb was so amused by the parody that he later penned a letter to Yankovic that read, [...] "Well, [...] oughta [...] bury that song once and for all!" [...] In addition, Yankovic received permission from Crichton and director Steven Spielberg to produce the track.|$|E
500|$|... 30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, both {{of which}} debuted on 2006–07 NBC lineup, {{revolved}} around the off-camera happenings on a sketch comedy series. Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, {{as well as the}} conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied. Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock. Fey wound up [...] "winning" [...] over Sorkin when Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was cancelled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Although 30 Rocks first season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, the latter was more expensive to produce. The first season episode [...] "Jack the Writer" [...] contained a self-referencing walk and talk sequence, which was commonly used on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Sorkin's previous series. In this episode, the walk and talk sequence is referenced when Liz asks Kenneth, [...] "can you walk and talk?", to which Kenneth replies, [...] "usually, but now you've got <b>me</b> <b>thinking</b> about it".|$|E

500|$|Author Amish Tripathi is {{a finance}} {{professional}} educated from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C). While {{working in the}} insurance industry, Tripathi felt that his life was devoid of any meaning or self. Ultimately {{he decided to take}} the spiritual route. He started reading on the different philosophies and the Indian mythologies. One day, while watching a historical program, Tripathi and his family got into the discussion about consciousness and the evil inside man. In the program they learned that in ancient Persia, demons were known as Daeva (a term reserved for the Gods in Indian mythology), and angels were called Asuras (a term reserved for demons in Indian mythology). Tripathi added, [...] "It set <b>me</b> <b>thinking</b> that this was exact opposite of our Vedic etymology where evil was Asura and gods were Devas. It struck me that if the two civilizations were to confront each other, they would be at stark odds and calling each other evil." [...] But when he decided {{to write a book about}} the philosophy of evil, his family discouraged him, saying that the subject itself was not popular and would get a narrow audience. They suggested that Tripathi write a thriller/adventure novel and the philosophy should be a part of the story, hence there would be a mainstream appeal in it. Tripathi felt that no subject was better than Shiva, one of the major Hindu deity and the destroyer of evil; his journey and stories about him would deliver the philosophy that he wanted to convey, to his readers. Once he started to write a book about Shiva, he decided to base it on some fundamental beliefs of his. He noted that the Hindu Gods were probably not [...] "mythical beings or a figment of a rich imagination", but rather they were once human beings like the rest. It was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods.|$|E
2500|$|Chesney later {{suggested}} {{the failure of}} his marriage was due to [...] "panic" [...] from the intense media scrutiny surrounding it. In an interview by 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper, Chesney commented on the failed marriage. [...] "The only fraud that was committed was <b>me</b> <b>thinking</b> that I {{knew what it was}} like…that I really understood {{what it was like to}} be married, and I really didn't." [...] The annulment was finalized in late December 2005. Chesney's family still resides in east Tennessee.|$|E
2500|$|The writer admits; [...] "I sought fame, and so I {{left the}} village green." [...] But he has somewhere to return to; [...] "I'll take you where real animals are playing, {{and people are}} real people not just playing. It's a quiet, quiet life". The village green offers a place to be natural, a place of solitude, while the [...] "city" [...] offers only artifice, haste, {{competition}} and {{the dangers of the}} Cold War. The animal farm, Ray Davies said, [...] "was just <b>me</b> <b>thinking</b> everybody else is mad and we are all animals anyway – which is really the idea of the whole album." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{living with}} his father, an engineer, Edgard was pushed to further his {{scientific}} understanding at the Institute Technique, {{a high school in}} Italy that specialized in teaching mathematics and science. It was here where Edgard became particularly interested in the works of Leonardo da Vinci. It was through Edgard's love of science that he began to study sound, as he later recalled [...] "When I was about twenty, I came across a definition of music that seemed suddenly to throw light on my gropings toward music I sensed could exist. Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński, the Polish physicist, chemist, musicologist and philosopher {{of the first half of}} the nineteenth century, defined music as 'the corporealization of the intelligence that is in sounds.' It was a new and exciting conception and to me the first that started <b>me</b> <b>thinking</b> of music as spatial—as moving bodies of sound in space, a conception I gradually made my own." ...|$|E
