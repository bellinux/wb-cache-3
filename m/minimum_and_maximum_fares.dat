5000|$|In an {{interview}} with DNA published on 9 May, MMRDA Commissioner U.P.S. Madan declared that the August 2013 fares were final stating, [...] "There is already a fare notification in place about metro, which is final. The notification was issued recently with a revision in ticket prices. The fare notification is final and binding." [...] Anil Galgali, an RTI activist {{and chairman of the}} Mumbai-based NGO Athak Seva Sangh, {{wrote a letter to the}} Chief Minister on 2 May 2014, urging him to use his special powers to prevent the fare hike. Galgali stated, [...] "The Maharashtra state government should use its special powers and stop the new fares from being implemented. The delay in project and increase in cost is not the fault of Mumbai's citizens. It is the responsibility of the Maharashtra state government to act against MMOPL's demands." [...] He further accused the MMOPL of [...] "blackmailing the government and playing with citizens". MMOPL announced the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>fares</b> on the line as 10 and 40 respectively in early May 2014. However, MMOPL later announced a special introductory fare of 10, regardless of distance, for the first 30 days of service, i.e. from 8 June to 8 July.|$|E
40|$|Pricing ladders {{are widely}} used in the airline {{industry}} to define the discrete set of prices that can be charged for seats on a flight. We consider the factors that affect the setting of these ladders for one-way economy tickets. The <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>fares</b> are assumed to be fixed and we focus on maximising the revenue generated on a flight by changing the spacing of the intermediate fares. Three scenarios are considered for the market: single flight with perfect market segmentation and imperfect market segmentation and multiple flights on one route...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the effects that}} low-cost carriers (LCC’s) produce when entering new routes operated only by full-service carriers (FSC’s) and routes operated by low-cost carriers in competition with full-service carriers. A mathematical model has been developed to determine what routes should be operated by a low-cost carrier with better possibilities to subsist, {{as a first step}} towards reaching the most convenient route; additional factors must be considered after running the proposed model, such as route passenger demand and aircraft characteristics not took into account in this paper. The proposed model was set up by analyzing The United States domestic air transport market. Distance is the only variable taken into account by the model. This model analyses the relation between the real fare data ($) and the distance (miles). The model generates three lines that includes amongst them 68 % of the approximately 18, 000 routes by calculating a standard deviation <b>and</b> estimates the <b>minimum,</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>and</b> average <b>fare</b> for a low-cost carrier given the distance the model determines in which routes a low-cost carrier could be successful by comparing, route by route, different airline fares against the low-cost <b>minimum,</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>and</b> average <b>fare</b> estimated per distance...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that leased public {{services}} prices can be calculated endogenously from the rate of return regulation model. In particular, this research extends the work by Rocha, Cavalcante and Oliveira (2009) where a method to price <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> leased <b>fares</b> to be charged from the users was presented. Moreover, these fares must be published on the public document bidding. Therefore, the value of the leased tariff must be between the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> the <b>maximum</b> ones, including the extreme values. The model is grounded upon the rate of return regulation method and, to establish the minimum tariff, it is resorted to the so-called certainty equivalent concept. The Brazilian transport regulatory agencies apply such method of regulation. This paper advances the described method assuming that the needed variables (demand and costs) used to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> the <b>maximum</b> tariffs of the leased public services have stochastic properties. To show its feasibility, the proposed model is implemented to the leasing of an inter-state bus service, where the values of the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> tariffs are obtained, besides making a sensitivity analysis study...|$|R

Priority was given to studies conducted in California, but sources from other states in western North America were included as appropriate for PFRs for which information was limited. When all sources were compiled, the average was taken of all mean, median, <b>minimum,</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> FRI values to yield a single mean, median, mean <b>minimum,</b> <b>and</b> mean <b>maximum</b> FRI estimate for each PFR. Thus, the <b>minimum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maximum</b> FRI estimates we provide for each PFR are not absolute <b>minima</b> <b>and</b> <b>maxima,</b> but typical mean values that would be expected across the geographical range of each PFR.|$|R
