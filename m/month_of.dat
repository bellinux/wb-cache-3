40|$|The {{ability of}} infant {{temperament}} and maternal sensitivity to predict 24 month behavior problems was examined in a normative sample of 88 mother-infant dyads from Baltimore, Maryland. Mothers completed the Infant Temperament Questionnaire {{when their children}} were 4 and 12 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> age; they completed the Child Behavior Checklist when their infants were 24 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> age. A 45 -minute free-play interaction {{was used to evaluate}} maternal sensitivity when infants were 4 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> age. Externalizing behavior problems at 24 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> age was predicted by difficult infant temperament at 4 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> age and maternal sensitivity. Maternal sensitivity also predicted internalizing, and total behavior problems at 24 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> age. Low levels of maternal sensitivity moderated the relation between 4 month difficult temperament and 24 month total behavior problems. Results indicate that low maternal sensitivity at 4 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> age interacts with difficult infant temperament at 4 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> age to predict high incidences of total behavior problems when children are 24 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> age. This research demonstrates a need to evaluate maternal sensitivity early in a child's life, before the environment has had an opportunity to affect an infant's seemingly innate temperamental tendencies...|$|R
