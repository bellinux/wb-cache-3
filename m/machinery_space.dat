5|$|On 22 March, Scharnhorst, Tirpitz, and Lützow steamed to Altafjord {{for repairs}} to damage {{incurred}} in heavy storms. In early April, Scharnhorst, Tirpitz, and nine destroyers conducted a training mission to Bear Island in the Arctic Ocean. On the 8th, a serious internal explosion {{occurred in the}} aft auxiliary <b>machinery</b> <b>space</b> above the armor deck. The explosion killed or injured 34 men and prompted the crew to flood the magazines for turret Caesar as a precaution against a magazine explosion. A repair ship completed work on the vessel in two weeks. Fuel shortages prevented major operations {{for the next six}} months, during which Scharnhorst was able to conduct only short training maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|Ship's {{engineers}} operate, maintain, {{and repair}} engines, boilers, generators, pumps, and other machinery. Merchant marine vessels usually have four engineering officers: a chief engineer and a first, second, and third assistant engineer. On many ships, Assistant Engineers stand periodic watches, overseeing the safe operation of engines and other machinery. However, most modern ships sailing today utilize Unmanned <b>Machinery</b> <b>Space</b> (UMS) automation technology, and Assistant Engineers are Dayworkers. At night and during meals and breaks, {{the engine room}} is unmanned and machinery alarms are answered by the Duty Engineer.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945 {{an attempt}} was made to mount an attack on Vaenga Bay in the Kola Inlet. The hope was either to attack one of the convoys that stopped there to refuel and take on {{ammunition}} or to attack the Soviet battleship Arkhangelsk (HMS Royal Sovereign on loan to the USSR). As it happened neither the battleship nor a convoy were in the port {{at the time of the}} planned attack. The plan was for U-boats to carry the Bibers within range of the harbour. U-295, U-318 and U-716 set off from Harstad on 5 January with Bibers mounted on their casings. Vibrations from the U-boats’ engines caused the Bibers stern glands to leak allowing water to reach the <b>machinery</b> <b>space</b> and as a result the mission was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|The {{ship was}} one of three Modified Leander-class light cruisers {{constructed}} for the Royal Navy. The main difference to the previous five Leanders was that the newer ships had their machinery and propulsion equipment organised in two self-contained units (separated fore and aft), allowing the ship to continue operating if one set was damaged. The two exhaust funnels, one for each <b>machinery</b> <b>space,</b> gave the modified ships a different profile from the early Leanders, which had a single funnel. To cover the separate machinery spaces, the side armour was extended from , negating the weight reduction created by the separation. During design, it was planned to modify the forward-most and aft-most 6-inch turrets to be fitted with three guns instead of two, but the plan was cancelled when it was determined that the required alterations would cause several negative side effects, including reducing the ship's top speed and causing problems with effective fire control.|$|E

She arrived in Yokosuka via Singapore in November 1913 to undergo armaments sighting checks in Kure Naval Arsenal, {{being placed in}} reserve upon her arrival. On 23 August 1914, Japan formally declared war on the German Empire {{as part of her}} contribution to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and Kongō was deployed near Midway Island to patrol the communications lines of the Pacific Ocean, attached to the Third Battleship Division of the First Fleet. Following the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, Kongō and her contemporaries (including the ships in the , [...] and es) were the only Japanese capital ships to avoid the scrapyard. On 1 November 1924, Kongō docked at Yokosuka for modifications which improved fire control and main-gun elevation, and increased her antiaircraft armament. In September 1929, she began her first major reconstruction. Her horizontal armour, boilers, and <b>machinery</b> <b>space</b> were all improved, and she was equipped to carry Type 90 Model 0 floatplanes. When her reconstruction was completed on 31 March 1931, she was reclassified as a battleship.
