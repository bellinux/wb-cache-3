Her wins brought her prizes of $50,000 (for her bronze medal) and $100,000 (silver) from the SNPC's Athletes Achievement Awards scheme, again leading to comments about the stark difference between the cash prizes that Olympic and Paralympic medallists receive. Twenty per cent of the prize <b>money</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> paid to the Singapore National Paralympic Council for training and development.

Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission.
