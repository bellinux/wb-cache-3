In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the D-17B was designed, transistors lacked today's reliability. DTL provided, however, either gain or inversion.

50|$|Availability, {{operational}} (Ao) The {{probability that}} an item will operate satisfactorily {{at a given}} point in time when used in an actual or realistic operating and support environment. It includes logistics time, ready time, and waiting or administrative downtime, and both preventive and corrective maintenance downtime. This value {{is equal to the}} <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> (MTBF) divided by the <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> plus the mean downtime (MDT). This measure extends the definition of availability to elements controlled by the logisticians and mission planners such as quantity and proximity of spares, tools and manpower to the hardware item.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failures</b> (MTBF) is the {{predicted}} elapsed <b>time</b> <b>between</b> inherent <b>failures</b> {{of a system}} during operation.

The system has a <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> of around 600 hours, and can track at least 60 targets at once. It can elevate up to +55 degrees and depress to -10 degrees.|$|E
50|$|Annualized {{failure rate}} (AFR) gives the {{estimated}} {{probability that a}} device or component will fail during a full year of use. It is a relation between the <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> (MTBF) and the hours {{that a number of}} devices are run per year. AFR is estimated from a sample of like components - AFR and MTBF as given by vendors are population statistics that can not predict the behaviour of an individual unit.|$|E
50|$|Probabilistic risk {{assessment}} {{has created a}} close relationship between safety and reliability. Component reliability, generally {{defined in terms of}} component failure rate, and external event probability are both used in quantitative safety assessment methods such as FTA. Related probabilistic methods are used to determine system <b>Mean</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Between</b> <b>Failure</b> (MTBF), system availability, or probability of mission success or failure. Reliability analysis has a broader scope than safety analysis, in that non-critical failures are considered. On the other hand, higher failure rates are considered acceptable for non-critical systems.|$|E

50|$|The APQ-159's primary upgrade was the {{addition}} of a new planar phased array antenna, replacing the -153's parabolic dish. This made the antenna smaller front-to-back and allowed it to be pointed to higher angles within the nose. It also greatly reduced the sidelobes, which improved gain and allowed the range to be greatly increased from the -153's roughly 10 nmi km to the -159's 20 nmi km. The electronics were also upgraded, offering increased frequency agility and dramatically improving <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> (MTBF) from about 62 hours in the -153 to 125 in the latest models of the -159, which have actually demonstrated 150 hours MTBF in the field.|$|E

50|$|The first {{technique}} {{involving an}} optocoupler {{has been used}} to obtain tight voltage and current regulation, whereas the second approach has been developed for cost-sensitive applications where the output {{does not need to be}} as tightly controlled, but up to 11 components including the optocoupler could be eliminated from the overall design. Also, in applications where reliability is critical, optocouplers can be detrimental to the MTBF (<b>Mean</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Between</b> <b>Failure)</b> calculations. The third technique, primary-side sensing, can be as accurate as the first and more economical than the second, yet requires a minimum load so that the discharge-event keeps occurring, providing the opportunities to sample the 1:N secondary voltage at the primary winding (during Tdischarge, as per Fig3).|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "reliability" [...] of a {{logic gate}} {{describes}} its <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> (MTBF). Digital machines often have millions of logic gates. Also, most digital machines are [...] "optimized" [...] {{to reduce their}} cost. The result is that often, {{the failure of a}} single logic gate will cause a digital machine to stop working. It is possible to design machines to be more reliable by using redundant logic which will not malfunction {{as a result of the}} failure of any single gate (or even any two, three, or four gates), but this necessarily entails using more components, which raises the financial cost and also usually increases the weight of the machine and may increase the power it consumes.|$|E
50|$|The {{design life}} of {{components}} and products {{differs from the}} items <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> (MTBF), in that MTBF {{is a measure of}} the rate of occurrence of random failures in time where these failures are not due to a wear-out mechanism. For example, the MTBF of a device may be 100,000 hours and the design-life is 20,000 hours. In this example, across the population of products, one failure will occur, on average, every 100,000 population operating hours (100,000 units operating for 1 hour each = 100,000 population operating hours). None of these units will ever approach reaching 100,000 operating hours as it will fail due to wear-out and be replaced by a new unit. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors, fans, and batteries are classic examples of components that will fail due to wear-out well before they could achieve the operating time indicated by their individual MTBF.|$|E
5000|$|Drive {{capacity}} {{has grown}} {{at a much}} faster rate than transfer speed, and error rates have only fallen a little in comparison. Therefore, larger-capacity drives may take hours if not days to rebuild, during which time other drives may fail. The rebuild time is also limited if the entire array is still in operation at reduced capacity. Given an array with only one redundant drive (which applies to RAID levels 3, 4 and 5, and to [...] "classic" [...] two-drive RAID 1), a second drive failure would cause complete failure of the array. Even though individual drives' <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> (MTBF) have increased over time, this increase has not kept pace with the increased storage capacity of the drives. The time to rebuild the array after a single drive failure, {{as well as the}} chance of a second failure during a rebuild, have increased over time.|$|E
