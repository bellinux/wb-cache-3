500|$|For the episode, McCreary {{composed}} a {{theme for the}} character of Akela Amador, a musical representation of her name with the notes arranged [...] "so that the syllables in her name land with the right emphasis. The melody basically suggests that you sing along with her name ... I also put two of the A’s and the D in Akela Amador’s name on those exact notes ... Starting with this association with her name was a fun way to kickstart my creative process, and it also produced a malleable melody that could be adapted to <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> throughout the episode." [...] The theme is initially used with low strings or brass to sound ominous, or even evil, but when she [...] "reunites with Coulson for an emotional conversation, the strings repeat her theme in twisting, circular statements, adding angst and heartbreak." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} in the Texas Legislature, DeLay {{struggled}} with alcoholism and gained a reputation as a playboy, earning the nickname [...] "Hot Tub Tom". By the time of his election to Congress in 1984 he was drinking [...] "eight, ten, twelve martinis a night at receptions and fundraisers." [...] In 1985 DeLay became a born-again Christian, and gave up hard liquor. Of the Rev. Ken Wilde, an evangelical minister from Idaho who founded the National Prayer Center in Washington, D.C., which houses volunteers who come to the capital to pray for the nation's leaders, DeLay said, [...] "This is the man who really saved me. When I was going through my troubles, it was Ken who really stepped up." [...] Of his conversion, DeLay said, [...] "I had put <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> first ... I was on the throne, not God. I had pushed God from His throne." ...|$|E

60|$|Occasionally, for {{the larger}} game animals and the {{gigantic}} beasts of prey, I used my express rifle, {{but for the most}} part the revolver filled all <b>my</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'I cannot {{tell you}} all; {{but you must}} take it that <b>my</b> <b>need</b> to get away is imperative.' After pondering a while Mr. Hilton said suddenly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He gae me a lock o' {{his yellow}} hair, And bade me keep it ever mair; He gae me a carknet o' bonny beads, And bade me keep it against <b>my</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{snatched}} their toil {{to serve}} <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> -- [...] Too slow their fleetest flew for me -- [...] I tired twenty smoking steeds, [...] And bade them bait a new for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{said the}} king, gratefully. [...] "You have {{rendered}} me a rare favor; for now I shall have money for all <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> {{and will not}} be obliged to marry anyone. Thank you a thousand times!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] said Marvel, [...] "but {{there is}} small chance of <b>my</b> <b>needing</b> help. Farewell, and may your future life be {{pleasant}} and happy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God of his mercy {{grant that}} they find somewhat," [...] said poor Miles; [...] "I have searched enow, and failed, yet is <b>my</b> <b>need</b> greater than theirs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you, on your side, forget, Charlie, that as your {{business}} friend I {{can give you}} no security; <b>my</b> <b>need</b> being so sore that I cannot get an indorser." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I need no reward," [...] Wulf replied. [...] "My estates are {{sufficient}} for all <b>my</b> <b>needs,</b> and I desire neither land nor dignity, being more than content that I have been enabled to render {{a service to}} you and to England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I desire it much, nay I {{will take}} no refusal. When your master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf, it was {{understood}} that <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> only were to be consulted. I have not stinted. Is it not so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I was of {{delicate}} mind. I went aside for <b>my</b> <b>needs,</b> [...] Disdaining the common office. I was seen from afar and killed.... How is this matter for mirth?

60|$|On this long, five-months' voyage, I {{found that}} among all <b>my</b> bodily <b>needs</b> not the {{slightest}} shred of a bodily need for alcohol existed. But this I did find: <b>my</b> <b>need</b> was mental and social. When I thought of alcohol, the connotation was fellowship. When I thought of fellowship, the connotation was alcohol. Fellowship and alcohol were Siamese twins. They always occurred linked together.|$|R
60|$|Mine was no half-hearted, backward-glancing return. Having {{determined}} {{upon the}} step, I took it resolutely and completely {{at a single}} stride. Since Galeotto placed his resources at my disposal, to be repaid him later when I should have entered upon the enjoyment of my heritage of Mondolfo, I did not scruple to draw upon them for <b>my</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hereupon I was {{put through}} {{a course of}} reading--that is, I just glanced at the books lent me; they were too little in my way to be {{thoroughly}} read, marked, learned, or inwardly digested. And besides, I had a book up-stairs, under my pillow, whereof certain chapters satisfied <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> in the article of spiritual lore, furnishing such precept and example as, to my heart's core, I was convinced could not be improved on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I speak {{once a week}} in the Springs. I {{ride down}} the trail from my cabin and back again the same day. The fact is I stayed in Rock River till I was nearly broken. I lost my health, and became morbid, trying to preach {{to the needs of the}} old men and women of my congregation. Now I am free. I am back to the wild country. Of course, so long as my wife lived I couldn't break away, but now I have no one but myself and <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> are small. I am happier than I have been for years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Jacopo! what a curse is {{a tender}} conscience! Thou hast {{been kind to}} me in <b>my</b> <b>need,</b> and if prayers from a sincere heart can do thee service, thou shalt not want them." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>My</b> hair is <b>needing</b> washed or <b>My</b> hair <b>needs</b> washed for [...] "My hair needs washing" [...] or [...] "My hair {{needs to}} be washed".|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} not let me be selfish in <b>my</b> <b>need!</b> I know you have many duties to engage you; and though I shall value your help highly--most highly--it would not be fair to monopolise your time." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, a {{depressing}} day. The two mates have alternated on deck {{and in their}} bunks. Captain West has dozed on the cabin sofa or read the Bible. Miss West is still sea-sick. I have tired myself out with reading, and the fuzziness of my unsleeping brain makes for melancholy. Even Wada is anything but a cheering spectacle, crawling out of his bunk, as he does at stated intervals, and with sick, glassy eyes trying to discern what <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> may be. I almost wish I could get sea-sick myself. I had never dreamed that a sea voyage could be so unenlivening as this one is proving.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} have passed through the low country without finding that out. Indeed," [...] said the youth, glancing at his belt with a half-apologetic smile, [...] "these weapons, which are so {{unfamiliar}} to my hand, and so distasteful to my spirit, are proof that I, at least, do not look for a time of peace. I accoutred myself thus on landing, at the urgent advice of a friend, though my good cudgel--which has sufficed for all <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> hitherto--is more to my mind, besides being useful as a mountain staff. But why do you ask? Is there much probability of the belligerents coming so far among the hills?" ...|$|E
60|$|My really useful furniture--of {{plain old}} Sheraton design--was {{set out in}} my bedroom. In {{one half of the}} room slept Pollie, a placid but, before her marriage, rather slow-witted {{creature}} about six years my senior. The other half was mine and had been made proportionate to <b>my</b> <b>needs</b> by a cabinet-maker from London. My father had had a low stone balcony built on beyond my window. This was fenced with fine trellis work to screen it from the colder winds. With its few extremely dwarf trees set along in green Nankin tubs, and the view it commanded, I could enjoy this eyrie for hours--never wearied of it in my youth, nor shall if I live to be a hundred.|$|E
6000|$|Then I read: [...] "I, Rameses Mi-amen, {{in my day}} and in <b>my</b> hour of <b>need,</b> visited this sepulchre. But, though great <b>my</b> <b>need</b> {{and bold}} <b>my</b> heart, I dared not face the curse of Menkau-ra. Judge, O thou who shalt come after me, and, if thy soul is pure and Khem be utterly distressed, take thou that which I have left." ...|$|R
50|$|Therefore bless I that paramour e. Our Lady That in <b>my</b> <b>need</b> does me soccour That saves me {{on earth}} from sin And heaven bliss me helps to win.Mother and mayden {{nevertheless}} Therefore of her took Jesu flesh.|$|R
60|$|My voice faltered {{a little}} in spite of me. I forced myself from the room. It was no time, then, for parting with the {{self-control}} which might yet serve me in <b>my</b> <b>need</b> before the day was out.|$|R
