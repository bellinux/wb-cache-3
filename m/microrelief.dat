40|$|Skin imaging is a powerful, noninvasive {{method used}} with {{potential}} {{to aid in}} the diagnosis of various dermatological diseases and assess overall skin health. This thesis discusses imaging platforms that were developed to aid in studying skin features and characteristics at different time and length scales to characterize and monitor skin. Two applications are considered: (1) using natural skin features as a position encoding system and an aid for volume reconstruction of ultrasound imaging and (2) studying natural skin feature evolution or stability over time to aid in assessing skin health. A 5 -axis, rigid translational scanning system was developed to capture images at specific locations and to validate skin based body registration algorithms. We show that natural skin features could be used to perform ultrasound based reconstruction accurate to 0. 06 mm. A portable, handheld scanning device was designed to study skin characteristics at different time and length scales. With this imaging platform, we analyze skin features at different length scales: [mu]m (for <b>microreliefs),</b> mm (for moles and pores), and cm (for distances between <b>microreliefs</b> and other features). Preliminary algorithms are used to automatically identify <b>microreliefs.</b> Further work in image processing is required to assess skin variation using these images. by Ina Annesha Kundu.

50|$|Within California, vernal pools {{are quite}} {{commonly}} associated with Mima Mounds. These Mima Mounds are typically located on stable landforms that are greater than 100,000 years old. These landforms are characterized by strongly developed soils that usually have a relatively impermeable layer (claypan or silcrete duripan) in the subsoil. This impermeable layer locally impedes drainage and creates perched water levels and causes the formation of vernal pools within the intermound depressions {{that are associated with}} Mima Mounds. Vernal pools are typically small, shallow, and complex ephemeral wetlands that only have internal drainage because they are hydrologically isolated from perennial inflow by a ring of Mima Mounds. Although the ponded water that fills vernal pools comes and goes throughout the year, it is present at least for a short time in most years. However, within California, the mound-depression <b>microrelief</b> associated with Mima Mounds is just one of a variety of geographic settings within which vernal pools occur. For example, in the Modoc Plateau region of California, numerous vernal pools are found on the surface of volcanic mudflows and basalt lava flows where Mima Mounds are completely absent.|$|E

40|$|Diffractive optics is {{a modern}} branch of optics, that {{exploits}} microstructures to manipulate the propagation of light. Fast computers and the progress in manufacturing technique of microelectronics have made possible a rapid development of diffractive optics during the past 10 years. Static diffractive optical elements (DOEs), are typically realized as <b>microreliefs</b> generated in polymer films on quartz plates. Today, high quality static DOEs can be manufactured, but applications of diffractive optics are yet in their infancy. In this thesis, an optical scheme for ultra-fast analog-to-digital conversion where static DOEs are the key components, is proposed. To reduce the Fresnel reflection losses from DOEs, subwavelength gratings can be superimposed on them. Promising experiments to achieve such DOEs are reported in this thesis. The use of diffractive optics would be much wider {{if they could be}} dynamically computer controlled, which requires high quality spatial light modulators (SLMs). However, such SLMs are not yet available, although substantial progress has been made the last few years, thanks to the driving force of the consumer display market. Today, a promising type of SLMs is that based on liquid crystal (LC) materials. The use of binary type ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) SLMs was investigated in the following studies presented in the thesis: The degree of control of the area between pixel elements in an FLC SLM was investigated by analysis of the diffracted light from the SLM. The diffraction efficiency of an FLC SLM was iteratively optimized using a feedback signal from the diffracted light. A new scheme to achieve beam steering, utilizing two FLC SLMs, modulating phase and amplitude respectively, was proposed and tested experimentally.

More than 1, 872, 172 people received Hyaluronic Acid (HA) injections in 2013. Moreover, filler treatments {{are the most popular}} procedures performed by dermatologists. Objective: Evaluate, with a new imaging system, durability, efficacy and safety of a nasolabial fold treatment with a cross-linked HA of non-animal origin with different molecular weights. Material and methods: A cross-linked HA (25 mg/ml, 1000 - 2000 kDa, 23 ± 3 Newton [N] extrusion force, 1, 4 -Butanediol Diglycidyl Ether (BDDE) content < 0. 1 ppm) was used in order to perform the treatment. The product is commercially available with the trademark Aliaxin®GP (Global Performance) and distributed by IBSA Farmaceutici Italia Srl. 25 female subjects aged 40 and 60 years with a photoageing level III according Rubin or type III according Glogau were recruited for the treatment and 0. 5 ml of the product were injected for single nasolabial fold. The aesthetic result and the duration of the aesthetic correction were evaluated by the analysis of the skin <b>microreliefs</b> through confocal microscopy and by Glogau's Scale. Additionally, pictures of each patient were collected by Canon PowerShot G 10 Digital Camera (14. 7 megapixels) before and after treatment. Below the description of the experimental schedule: T 0 : Baseline, evaluation and treatment; T 1 : second visit, 4 months after the treatment; T 2 : third visit, 6 months after the treatment. Results: From 25 patients, 150 silicone casts were obtained: 75 casts of the right nasolabial fold and 75 casts of the left nasolabial fold. Roughness arithmetical average (Ra) was assessed by profilometry. This parameter represents the arithmetic mean deviation of the profile points compared to the average value. The Ra of the right fold at T 2 decreased by 50 % versus T 0 and by 40 % compared to T 1; Ra of the left fold at T 2 decreased by the 45 % versus T 0 and by 35 % compared to T 1.

40|$|Comparing {{with the}} {{previous}} publications related to surface <b>microrelief</b> of friction pairs, {{this article focuses on}} investigation of workpiece surface interaction having different or similar, fully or partially regular slide surface <b>microrelief</b> and different or similar finish parameters. These parameters give an opportunity to spend minimum time for their bedding and further minimization of attrition intensity dependending on surface parts application, conditions of loading, lubrication etc. Further experimental investigations presuppose different friction pair materials, applied for guide equipment of different functionality with the aim of optional parameters and mating surface relief specification; also the ways for their processing in regard of meeting normative document requirements on hard and finish surfaces of machinery parts and mechanisms reported in related state standards. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{researches}} {{related to the}} influence of partially regular <b>microrelief</b> parameters on the adhesion component of the friction factor under boundary lubrication have been given. A special ring-on tape test rig is proposed in order to avoid errors during running-in process. Special technique is used to form sinusoidal microgrooves what helped to create a partially regular <b>microrelief</b> on the surface with controlled contour and nominal contact areas. Fatigue and deformation components of wear process are considered. We proved that microtexturing with proposed parameters decreases the adhesion component of friction and reduces the probability of microwelding. It has been shown that under boundary friction micro grooves are effective on precision surfaces with low roughness when lack of film and probability of seizure appear...|$|E
