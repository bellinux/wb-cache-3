5|$|Cascioferro is {{considered}} to be the mastermind behind the murder of New York policeman and head of the Italian Squad, Joseph Petrosino, on March 12, 1909. He was shot and killed in Piazza Marina in Palermo; two men were seen running from the crime scene. Petrosino had gone to Sicily to gather information from local police files to help deport Italian gangsters from New York as illegal immigrants. The two men were very <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> of the danger to each other's survival; Petrosino carried a note describing Cascioferro as “a terrible criminal”, while Cascioferro had a photograph of the police officer.|$|E

The respected, independent, ambitious young Bureau Agent formed a close relationship with Frank Black—and then turned her back on him to join the Millennium Group, which had agreed to cure her father of Alzheimer's.|$|E

The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal.|$|E

25|$|In 1895, Johnson, very <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> of the {{successful}} Bensonhurst-by-the-Sea, built three homes. His home was on {{the southwest corner of}} 11th Avenue and 82nd Street (across the Avenue from the home of his mother), Albert Edward Parfitt's home was on 82nd Street next to Johnson's, and the last, closest to Tenth Avenue, was the home of Arthur S. Tuttle who was Assistant Engineer of The Water Supply of The City Works Department of The City of Brooklyn. Parfitt was the architect of these three homes. Johnson's house burned down before 1900, Parfitt's was demolished by a developer in 1928 and replaced with seven, run-of-the-mill, fully detached, single-family homes, and Tuttle's house was remodeled over 10 years ago and clad in bright-white and sky-blue brick.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{there came}} into being {{the idea of a}} select corps of teenaged youths, who would devote some of their spare time to prepare for the day when they would take their places in the ranks of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). In 1940, Air Minister Power, who was very <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> of the need for this type of Air Cadet training, called in a group of {{influential}} civilians and asked them to set up a national voluntary organization to sponsor and develop this movement. The response was immediate, and a civilian organization was soon created to work on a partnership basis with the RCAF. As it later developed, this partnership was to be the main reason for the striking success of the Air Cadet Movement in Canada.|$|E

25|$|Schumacher cites that William Howard Taft, {{the head}} of the Second Philippine Commission and the first civil {{governor}} of the Philippine Islands, was very <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> of the need to defuse anti-friar feeling throughout the islands. He requested the Spanish friars be given leave of their parish posts. Many of the friars left voluntarily, and were replaced by native Filipino priests in lower ranks and American bishops in the ranks of the episcopacy. Negotiations also began for the compulsory sale of vast Roman Catholic Church holdings. Although the sale was affected by pressure from influential sectors like some bishops and certain delegates, it achieved Taft’s goal of sequestering all the Roman Catholic Church lands, something that the ill-fated Philippine Republic had failed to achieve. After taking the land, the governor intended to redistribute the land. This not only reduced the financial position of the Roman Catholic Church, but also diminished the influential clout it had during the Spanish colonial period.|$|E

500|$|On Sunday, 18 August, the Buddhists {{staged a}} mass protest at Xá Lợi, {{attracting}} around 15,000 people, undeterred by rain. The attendance was approximately {{three times higher}} than that at the previous Sunday's rally. The event lasted for several hours, as speeches by the monks interspersed religious ceremonies. A Vietnamese journalist {{said that it was}} the only emotional public gathering in South Vietnam since Diệm's rise to power almost a decade earlier. David Halberstam of The New York Times speculated that by not exploiting the large crowd by staging a protest march towards Gia Long Palace or other government buildings, the Buddhists were saving their biggest demonstration for the scheduled arrival of new U.S. ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. the following week. As a government attack on Xá Lợi was anticipated, Halberstam concluded that the Buddhists were playing [...] "a fast and dangerous game". He wrote that [...] "the Buddhists themselves appeared to be at least as <b>much</b> <b>aware</b> of all the developments, and their protest seemed to have a mounting intensity".|$|E
