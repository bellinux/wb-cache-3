In an article dated May 6, 2009 with MusicRadar.com, Jack mentioned recording songs with Meg before the Conan gig had taken place, saying, [...] "We had recorded a couple of songs at the new studio." [...] About a new White Stripes album, Jack said, [...] "It won't be too far off. <b>Maybe</b> <b>next</b> year." [...] Jack also explained Meg's acute anxiety during the Stripes' last tour, saying, [...] "I just came from a Raconteurs tour and went right into that, so I was already full-speed. Meg {{had come from a}} dead-halt for a year and went right back into that madness. Meg is a very shy girl, a very quiet and shy person. To go full-speed from a dead-halt is overwhelming, and we had to take a break." ...|$|E
500|$|The rivalry {{intensified}} {{following the}} arrival of Arsène Wenger in October 1996. A league match {{between the two sides}} in February 1997 was marred by an incident between Arsenal's Ian Wright and United's Peter Schmeichel; the striker challenged for the ball with both feet and caught the goalkeeper with his studs. A confrontation ensued and police stepped in to keep the players apart after the final whistle. Wright's behaviour was scrutinised at a hearing, where he complained he was subject to racial abuse by Schmeichel, at which point the FA intervened and met with representatives of both clubs. In April 1997, Wright and Schmeichel settled their differences, but the managers' animosity towards each other started to become apparent. Wenger had advised against the Premier League extending the season to ease Manchester United's fixture congestion, to which Ferguson publicly retorted: [...] "Maybe he should concentrate on Ian Wright's tackles rather than Manchester United. He's at a big club, well Arsenal used to be a big club, and <b>maybe</b> <b>next</b> year he could be in the same situation. I wonder what is story will be then." ...|$|E

Unaware that Mayor Ambrose {{was in fact the}} infamous serial killer PJ Maybe, who had stolen Ambrose's identity, Sinfield threatened to undermine his re-election campaign. Maybe retaliated by covertly infecting him with a deadly fungus. However he survived not only the fungus but also <b>Maybe's</b> <b>next</b> attempt, using another deadly disease. Consequently Sinfield recalled Judge Dredd from the Cursed Earth to investigate the attempts on his life, believing Dredd to be the best man for the job. Dredd uncovered Maybe's involvement after he personally thwarted a third murder attempt.|$|R
500|$|In May 2002, {{he signed}} a two-year {{contract}} with Braga. He made his debut in a 3–2 defeat at Belenenses on 5 October 2002. In a season disrupted by injuries, Mendes only played in one more match for Braga, against his old club Vitória Guimarães. He had his contract cancelled in January 2003, which allowed him to join Moreirense. He made his debut on 3 February 2003 in a 1–1 draw at Benfica. He made two more appearances that season as the club finished 12th in the table. Having fractured his foot in July 2003, he was used sparingly during the 2003–04 season by manager Manuel Machado. He made four league appearances in an injury-plagued season, as the club finished 9th in the Primeira Liga. Mendes dropped down a division in June 2004 after signing a one-year contract with Santa Clara. [...] "This project is attractive," [...] he said. [...] "The coach, Jose Morais, spoke to me and showed willingness in {{me to go to}} the Azores and that's important. I know that Santa Clara is going through some difficulties, but the Department intends to make a financial recovery in time and <b>maybe</b> <b>next</b> season bet on rising." ...|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{was given}} his own {{laboratory}} called Apple Electronics, at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London, and was helped {{to obtain a}} British work visa. His pay eventually rose to £6,000 per year, and an American patent attorney, Alfred Crotti, moved to England to assist Mardas. In a historical TV promo for Apple Corps included on the Beatles Anthology DVD, Mardas is shown wearing a white laboratory assistant's coat in Apple Electronics (with loud oscillating noises in the background) saying, [...] "Hello, I'm Alexis, from Apple Electronics. I {{would like to say}} 'Hello' to all my brothers around the world, and to all the girls around the world, and to all the electronic people around the world. That is Apple Electronics." [...] Mardas then turns and points back to a collection of two portable 2-track recorders in wooden boxes, a 2-track studio recording machine, voltage meters, a hi-fi amplifier, an oscilloscope, and a TV screen showing pulsating psychedelic balloon shapes. A mysterious fire at the laboratory prevented Mardas from presenting his inventions, but he later said: [...] "I'm a rock gardener, and now I'm doing electronics. <b>Maybe</b> <b>next</b> year, I make films or poems. I have no formal training in any of these, but this is irrelevant".|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1994 season, the Expos, seeking to replace {{departed}} ace Dennis Martínez in the starting rotation, acquired a young reliever in Pedro Martínez, who the Los Angeles Dodgers had cast doubt over his potential as starter and pitched him out of the bullpen. [...] One amusing moment (...) materialized on April 24 while playing the Dodgers in Los Angeles and Martínez starting. [...] With one out in the third inning, Walker caught a Mike Piazza fly ball and innocently handed it to a young fan, six year-old Sebastian Napier, thinking it was the third out of the inning. [...] He then quickly noticed that José Offerman, already on base, was running at full speed. [...] Walker managed to retrieve the ball from Napier and held Offerman to third base. [...] Embarrassed, Walker admitted that he “told the little kid that <b>maybe</b> <b>next</b> time I’ll give him a ball when there are three outs instead of two. Everybody around him was laughing.” [...] Where Offerman was stationed made little difference as Tim Wallach homered on the next pitch from Martínez for two runs. [...] True to his word, when the Expos assumed the field in {{the bottom half of the}} fourth inning, Walker gave Napier a signed ball, inducing a standing ovation.|$|E

When bacon is frying they must run away from the fire and cough half an hour in the snow. They freeze their cheeks a little bit, so that the skin turns black and is very sore. Also, the man freezes his thumb till the end is like to come off, and he must wear a large thumb on his mitten to keep it warm. And sometimes, when the frost bites hard and the thumb is very cold, he must take off the mitten and put the hand between his legs next to the skin, so that the thumb may get warm again.|$|E

6000|$|He was {{uncertain}} {{as to when}} she might get her trip, but {{thought it might be}} to-morrow or <b>maybe</b> <b>next</b> day. This would not answer at all; so we had to give up the novelty of sailing down the river on a farm. We had one more arrow in our quiver: a Vicksburg packet, the 'Gold Dust,' was to leave at 5 P.M. We took passage in her for Memphis, and gave up the idea of stopping off here and there, as being impracticable. She was neat, clean, and comfortable. We camped on the boiler deck, and bought some cheap literature to kill time with. The vender was a venerable Irishman with a benevolent face and a tongue that worked easily in the socket, and from him we learned that he had lived in St. Louis thirty-four years and had never been across the river during that period. Then he wandered into a very flowing lecture, filled with classic names and allusions, which was quite wonderful for fluency until the fact became rather apparent that {{this was not the first}} time, nor perhaps the fiftieth, that the speech had been delivered. He was a good deal of a character, and much better company than the sappy literature he was selling.

6000|$|I {{set down}} one time {{back in the}} woods, and had a long think about it. I says to myself, if a body can get {{anything}} they pray for, why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was [...] "spiritual gifts." [...] This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I {{went out in the}} woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in {{a way to make a}} body's mouth water; but <b>maybe</b> <b>next</b> day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.|$|E
