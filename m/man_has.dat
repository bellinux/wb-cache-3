5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, <b>man</b> <b>has</b> waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, <b>man</b> <b>has</b> {{given way to}} hatred, greed, and violence. Because <b>man</b> <b>has</b> been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E
5|$|Bees can be {{severely}} and even fatally affected by pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals that <b>man</b> <b>has</b> {{introduced into the}} environment.

5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a <b>man</b> <b>has</b> more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow <b>Man</b> <b>has</b> been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead. Emma Restall Orr, a neo-druid, has questioned whether the body should be displayed at all. This {{is part of a}} wider discussion about the scientific treatment of human remains and museum researchers and archaeologists using them as information sources.|$|E

Several {{sources were}} {{critical of the}} film's resemblance to other science fiction films, with The Fly and 4D Man being singled out by critics and moviegoers alike as possible inspirations, although the film's executive producer Richard Gordon has denied this.

5|$|The child's sex can be {{influenced}} by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age.

Blamey later {{said that he had}} given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The <b>man</b> <b>has</b> never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E

After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the <b>man</b> <b>has</b> the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E
