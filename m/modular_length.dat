Here hydropathic analysis, previously applied to quantify common flu (H 1 N 1) evolution (1934 -), {{is applied to}} the evolution of less common but more virulent (avian derived) H 3 N 2 (1968 -), beginning with N 2. Whereas N 1 exhibited opposing migration and vaccination pressures, the dominant N 2 trend is due to vaccination, with only secondary migration interactions. Separation and evaluation of these effects is made possible by the use of two distinct hydropathic scales representing first-order and second-order thermodynamic interactions. The evolutions of H 1 and H 3 are more complex, with larger competing migration and vaccination effects. The linkages of H 3 and N 2 evolutionary trends are examined on two <b>modular</b> <b>length</b> scales, medium (glycosidic) and large (corresponding to sialic acid interactions). The hierarchical hydropathic results complement and greatly extend advanced phylogenetic results obtained from similarity studies.

40|$|Distribution of five {{species of}} {{tropical}} insect herbivores {{was recorded in}} relation to gradients of <b>modular</b> <b>length</b> on their host plants. Patterns in plant architecture and herbivore responses were compared with a well-studied temperate herbivore, Euura lasiolepis Smith (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae). The five tropical species were each from a different family, and host plants belonged to different families and vegetation types. Using modular gradients of shoot or leaf length we showed that plant architecture was comparable directly and was similar even when trees, shrubs, and grasses were compared. Also, the membracid, cicadellids, psyllid, and cecidomyiid in the tropics showed patterns of attack on modular gradients consistent with the patterns derived from high ovipositional preference linkage with larval performance, known {{to exist in the}} temperate species. Strong positive relationships between module length and percentage of modules attacked in each length class were observed, with variance accounted for ranging from 68 to 96 %. One pest species on forage grasses in the on vicinity of Brasilia, Deois flavopicta Stal (Homoptera: Cercopidae), showed a weak response to the shoot-length gradient of its host grass (r(2) = 0. 41) and an insignificant response per unit length of shoot, suggesting a generalized capacity to use wide variation in module size. A method was developed for direct comparison of species employing a comparison between a hypothetical ideal response to modular gradients and the actual response. The actual slope of the attack versus module length regression, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} hypothetical slope, provided estimates of herbivore responses to modular plant structure consistent with hypotheses on plant vigor and phylogenetic constraints...|$|E
40|$|Comparing {{the mean}} {{features}} of helium proportional counters with the ones {{of the standard}} boron trifluoride tubes, it appears at glance that, in equal term of efficiency and for the same active length, the 3 He filled counters are characterized by a very smaller diameter which optimizes their spectral resolution and minimizes wall effects.

This thesis contributes arithmetic algorithms and hardware architectures for the modular multiplication Z = A × B mod M. This operation {{is the basis of}} many public-key cryptosystems including RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. The Residue Number System (RNS) is used to speed up long word <b>length</b> <b>modular</b> multiplication because this number system performs certain long word length operations, such as multiplication and addition, much more efficiently than positional systems. A survey of current modular multiplication algorithms shows that most work in a positional number system, e. g. binary. A new classification is developed which classes these algorithms as Classical, Sum of Residues, Montgomery or Barrett. Each class of algorithm is analyzed in detail, new developments are described, and the improved algorithms are implemented and compared using FPGA hardware. Few modular multiplication algorithms for use in the RNS have been published. Most are concerned with short word lengths and are not applicable to public-key cryptosystems that require long word length operations. This thesis sets out the hypothesis that each of the four classes of modular multiplication algorithms possible in positional number systems can also be used for long word <b>length</b> <b>modular</b> multiplication in the RNS; moreover using the RNS in this way will lead to faster implementations than those which restrict themselves to positional number systems. This hypothesis is addressed by developing new Classical, Sum of Residues and Barrett algorithms for modular multiplication in the RNS. Existing Montgomery RNS algorithms are also discussed. The new Sum of Residues RNS algorithm results in a hardware implementation that is novel in many aspects: a highly parallel structure using short arithmetic operations within the RNS; fully scalable hardware; and the fastest ever FPGA implementation of the 1024 -bit RSA cryptosystem at 0. 4 ms per decryption.

If LA is a FR of L on A and L {{is also the}} congruence lattice of some algebra with base set A, we say LA is a finite algebraic representation (FAR). Thus every finite lattice has a FR, and it is unknown whether every finite lattice has a FAR.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{some aspects}} of the {{representation}} theory of Mantaci-Reutenauer algebras: Cartan matrix, Loewy <b>length,</b> <b>modular</b> representations. Let Wn be a Coxeter group of type Bn (i. e. the group of permutations σ of In = {± 1, [...] .,±n} such that σ(−i) = −σ(i) for every i ∈ In) and let R be a commutative ring. Mantaci and Reutenauer [MR] have defined a subalgebra RΣ′(Wn) of the group algebra RWn which contains both the Solomon descent algebra of the symmetric group Sn and the one of Wn. In [BH], the authors have provided another construction of the Mantaci-Reutenauer algebra RΣ′(Wn) which relies more on the structure ofWn as a Coxeter group. As a consequence of their work, they were able to generalize to this algebra the classical results of Solomon on the Solomon descent algebra (construction of a morphism to the character ring of Wn, description of the radical whenever R is a field of characteristic 0 [...] .). For instance, the description of the simple QΣ′(Wn) -modules was obtained in [BH, Proposition 3. 11]: they are all of dimension 1. In this paper, we study the representation theory of KΣ′(Wn) whenever R = K is a field of any characteristic: simple modules, radical, projective modules, Cartan matrix [...] . We also define some morphisms between different Mantaci-Reutenauer algebras. Let us gather here some of the main results obtained all along the text: Theorem. Let p denote the characteristic of K. Then: (a) There exists a natural morphism of algebras KΣ′(Wn) → KΣ ′(Wn− 1); it is surjec-tive if p = 0. (b) If p 6 = 2, then the Loewy length of KΣ′(Wn) is n. If p = 2, then this Loewy length lies in {n, n+ 1, [...] ., 2 n − 1 }. (c) If p does not divide |Wn | (i. e. is p = 0 or p> max(2, n)), then the Cartan matrix of KΣ′(Wn) is unitriangular.

The 10 MW, 1. 334 GeV ESS H-linac is 570 m in <b>length,</b> <b>modular</b> cryomodules are used above 400 MeV with separated warm quads. After winding up the ESS Council and the Technical Team {{by the end of}} 2003, the neutron scattering community wanted to keep ESS on the political table and demonstrate to young scientist that the struggle for ESS goes on. For this purpose, the ESS-Initiative (ESS-I) was formed to include the European Neutron Scattering Association (ENSA), various consortia for site candidatures and some key European laboratories. A major highlight was the successful promotion of ESS to be as a high maturity project on the European Road Map of Research Infrastructures, published in October 2006 by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI). The ESS Preparatory Phase project has been accepted in the meanwhile after a very positive assessment and has been allocated 5 M€ EU support to investigate site independent technical items and answer legal, financial and governance questions, starting January 2008. ESS 07 will be a 5 MW LP source, the worlds first one to offer the unique capabilities of novel long pulse instruments for almost all of the most interesting areas of science and technology. ESS will be built {{in such a way that}} governments can decide later on during its lifetime to increase power and add more target stations, as the future scientific need would arise. The 5 MW, 1 GeV ESS H+ linac is similar to the ESS H- SC Reference Linac, but only 464 m in length, as more intense H+ sources are available. ESS’s world lead would become even more pronounced, even when SNS would upgrade its power to, say, 3 MW, if the ESS beam power would be increased to 7. 5 MW. This goal is achievable by enlarging the linac tunnel by 115 m, which allows to add later on 16 cyromodules, and increasing the accelerating gradient in all SC cavities by 15 %. The H+ linac length of 579 m in this case would still not be larger than the ESS H- SC Reference Linac. Synergy with the CERN plans would require to avoid the funnel section at 20 MeV, leading to a 5 MW LP power at 2 GeV. Linac length is unchanged by using accelerating high gradient in SC cavities.

40|$|Joining {{the goal}} to {{building}} energy consumption drastic reduction, acting on today’s natural resources preservation global emergency, is nowadays an authentic challenge which involves {{national and international}} applied research. Historic buildings that belong to our heritage, representing our territory cultural structure, trigger lots of unsolved problems {{in the field of}} sustainability and energy consumption. The problem dwells on complexity to find a mediation between con-servation needs and energetic update request, to join a satisfying compromise be-tween new law requirements and ancient building reuse with modern functions and historical material minimum transformations. The carried out research activity founds its groundwork in this context. It starts from the regulatory path analysis from the Kyoto protocol (1997) to todays’ interna-tional, national and local laws. These norms started to be simple and general indications on environmental sus-tainability and then they evolved becoming prescriptive guides on energy efficiency improvements redirecting furthermore to existing building heritage. Comparing the energy consumption reduction regulation and the existing building heritage study, it’s evident the complexity in actuating innovation process. This re-search wants to be a methodology stimulus for building heritage. In this field Venetian reality leads us to consider the energy qualification of monu-mental safeguard buildings. Three examples in Venice have been analyzed that respond to these characteristics. The research field was directed to find the most suitable innovative plants by stud-ying the real possibility to join a valid architectonic integration, and to quantify future energetic performances obtained by monitoring the recuperated buildings. The research used two different instruments: the simulation and the system plant monitoring. By the use of dynamic simulation software (Design Builder and Energy Plus) and by the use of built-up software it has been possible to analyze alternative project strategies, to evaluate the project accordance with law standards, pursuing pro-posed solutions energy optimization. Environmental and energetic monitoring has been used as essential instrument to optimize operating plant systems taking advantage of a capillary supervising sys-tem divided in sections. During first research year data regarding relative humidity, the maximum and min-imum winter and summer temperature, the maximum CO 2 level (which leads the ventilation modulation and the shutters opening percentage) have been analyzed Next obtained data analysis has permit to evaluate building system and plant sub systems intervention and optimization manners, in real management and using conditions. In the course of time research has been subdivided in the in-depth analysis of three different study cases: 1. 	The making up of conditioning system plant monitoring installed at “ex Magazzino 6 ” acquired by University Iuav of Venice, with consequent indi-viduation of possible interventions on working parameters, to reach a net improvement of energy performances and indoor comfort. The after data elaboration, system monitoring given, allowed an energy and economic savings analysis obtainable by a correct management, which optimize in-door humidity and ventilation control, ensuring in any case internal comfort. From this study has been proved that scholar buildings are particularly suitable to reach benefices from a flexible use of relative humidity set point and from a variable ventilation levels, managed from an automatic control based on CO 2 sensors. 2. 	The restoration and plant upgrade of Tolentini ex convent, todays’ University Iuav of Venice headquarter: old classrooms have been transformed to University Library and lecture hall has been renovated. New plants consid-er invertible heat pump use, with geothermal heat-exchanger with vertical boreholes. The project is quite interesting because in a city like Venice, us-ing heating and cooling production machines, it finds obstructions linked to locate either installation permitted areas for cooled air machines or con-densing towers, either using lagoon water, only possible near major canals. The study has been done by building/plant system simulation, which underlined seasonal performance levels always certainly higher than ones obtained by a normal air-water machine. The sensitivity analysis done, in-dicated possible increases of these performance levels using larger sur-face exchange boreholes (double U) and <b>modular</b> machines.

40|$|Thesis for PhD {{degree in}} Chemical and Biological EngineeeringBacteriophages are viruses that {{specifically}} infect bacterial hosts to reproduce. At {{the end of}} the infection cycle, progeny virions are confronted with a rigid cell wall that impedes their release into the environment. Consequently, bacteriophages encode hydrolytic enzymes, called endolysins, to digest the peptidoglycan and cause bacteriolysis. In contrast to their extensively studied counterparts, active against Gram-positives, endolysins from bacteriophages from a Gram-negative background remain less explored. This knowledge gap is largely due to their limited potential as an antimicrobial, which is related to the presence of an impermeable outer membrane in Gram-negatives that blocks the exogenous endolysin action. The experimental work developed in the scope of this thesis aimed at developing efficient strategies to potentiate the endolysin action against these pathogens. An extensive in silico analysis was performed to provide new insights about endolysins structure and function and bacteriophage-endolysin-host ecology. It was possible to identify and analyze 723 putative endolysins sequences from 5 distinct bacteriophages families, infecting 64 different bacterial genera. These endolysins are tremendously diverse in terms of enzymatic function (24 different enzymatic and 13 binding domains), architecture arrangements (89 different types with either globular or <b>modular</b> design) and <b>length</b> (72 to 578 amino acid residues). Three different novel endolysins (Lys 68, ABgp 46 and PVP-SE 1 gp 146) were studied in detail. Biochemical characterization of Lys 68 (from a Salmonella-infecting bacteriophage) showed that it is highly thermostable, withstanding temperatures up to 100 °C, and able to refold to its original conformation upon thermal denaturation. Lys 68 was able to lyse a wide panel of Gram-negative bacteria in combination with outer membrane permeabilizers. While the Lys 68 /EDTA combination could only inactivate Pseudomonas strains, the use of citric or malic acid as permeabilizer broadened and increased its antibacterial effect. Particularly against Salmonella, the combinatory effect of malic or citric acid with Lys 68 led to approximately 3 to 5 log reductions after 2 hours, respectively. During an acid-promoted effect, weak acids permeabilized the lipopolysaccharide of most bacteria to Lys 68, which retained a relative high activity under these acidic conditions. In case of EDTA, its chelation effect was only observed against Pseudomonas membranes, where ionic interactions are crucial stabilizing forces. The endolysin ABgp 46 (from an Acinetobacter-infecting bacteriophage) was shown to naturally inactivate 1 log of certain Acinetobacter strains. Tests {{in the presence of a}} number of weak acids (citric, malic, lactic, benzoic and acetic acid) resulted in a powerful antibacterial effect when combined with Abgp 46. Higher bactericidal activity was consistently obtained when ABgp 46 was combined with citric and malic acid, reducing all planktonic Cronobacter, Klebsiella and E. coli O 157 (reductions of 1 to 3 logs) and Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Salmonella (reduction of more than 4 logs) species tested. It can be speculated that the major weak acid differences observed are related to their acid dissociated constant, that seems to favor compounds (with lower pKa values) that tend be more ionized. The same combinations did not have significant antibacterial activity when applied against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter biofilms. To enhance the activity of endolysins against Gram-negative cells, modified endolysins where constructed by fusing PVP-SE 1 gp 146 (from a Salmonella-infecting bacteriophage) with different LPS-destabilizing peptides of polycationic, hydrophobic and amphipathic nature. This strategy resulted in an improvement of the activity of the modified endolysin compared to the native one (1 log reduction on Pseudomonas and Salmonella cells was obtained). The bactericidal activity of all modified variants was increased further in the presence of EDTA. A polycationic nonapeptide was the most efficient tag (maximum reduction of 5 logs). With a different purpose, attempts of increasing the endolysin (in this case Lys 68) action against Listeria monocytogenes cells, by inserting species-specific peptidoglycan-binding peptides, did not result in a higher activity. From the moment their genetic identity became known, endolysins have sparked the interest as alternatives for existing antibiotics. Here it was shown that endolysins can be used to kill not only Gram-positive, but also Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. These obtained results underline the great potential of using an endolysin-based strategy for prevention and/or control of Gram-negative pathogens in foodstuff, food processing surfaces, veterinary and medical applications.
