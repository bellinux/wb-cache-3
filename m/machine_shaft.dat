50|$|Most {{vibration}} analysis instruments today utilize a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) {{which is}} a special case of the generalized Discrete Fourier Transform and converts the vibration signal from its time domain representation to its equivalent frequency domain representation. However, frequency analysis (sometimes called Spectral Analysis or Vibration Signature Analysis) is {{only one aspect of}} interpreting the information contained in a vibration signal. Frequency analysis tends to be most useful on machines that employ rolling element bearings and whose main failure modes tend to be the degradation of those bearings, which typically exhibit an increase in characteristic frequencies associated with the bearing geometries and constructions. Depending on the type of machine, its typical malfunctions, the bearing types employed, rotational speeds, and other factors, the CM specialist may use additional diagnostic tools, such as examination of the time domain signal, the phase relationship between vibration components and a timing mark on the <b>machine</b> <b>shaft</b> (often known as a keyphasor), historical trends of vibration levels, the shape of vibration, and numerous other aspects of the signal along with other information from the process such as load, bearing temperatures, flow rates, valve positions and pressures to provide an accurate diagnosis. This is particularly true of machines that use fluid bearings rather than rolling-element bearings. To enable them to look at this data in a more simplified form vibration analysts or machinery diagnostic engineers have adopted a number of mathematical plots to show machine problems and running characteristics, these plots include the bode plot, the waterfall plot, the polar plot and the orbit time base plot amongst others.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{industrial}} users of turbomachinery began {{to experiment with}} the use of these sensors for measuring vibration. Direct observation of the vibratory motion of a <b>machine's</b> <b>shaft</b> is desirable because most often, the shaft is the source of vibration in the machine. Previous to the introduction of the so-called [...] "Bently probe," [...] this shaft motion had to be indirectly inferred by measuring the vibration of the machine's casing. While machinery casing measurements can be valuable under certain conditions, machines that employ fluid bearings generally have damping and stiffness characteristics that do not adequately transmit shaft vibration to the machine's casing. Consequently, direct observation of the <b>machine's</b> <b>shaft</b> (rotor) was recognized as a more accurate method of assessing condition on such machines.|$|R

40|$|International audienceControlling {{electrical}} drives without mechanical sensors at the <b>machine</b> <b>shaft</b> has several benefits e. g. low cost and high reliability. To avoid these sensors, state observers must be resorted {{to get the}} required information using only measured voltages and currents at the machine terminals. In this paper we are considering the problem of estimating mechanical state variables in permanent magnet synchronous generators driven by wind turbines through AC/DC rectifiers and DC/AC inverters. Only the electrical variables {{are supposed to be}} accessible to measurements. Then a sensorless interconnected adaptive observer of the high-gain type is designed to get online estimates of the rotor position and speed as well as the load torque. Parameter adaptation is resorted because the load torque and stator resistor are not supposed to be known. The observer convergence is formally analyzed and illustrated by simulation. This theoretical result is confirmed by simulations which, besides, show that the observer convergence is quite robust with respect to wind speed (or load torque) and machine parameters uncertainties...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between vibration and current in induction motors operated under external vibrations. Two approaches are usually available to define this relationship. The former is based on airgap variations, the latter on torque perturbation. This paper {{is focused on the}} airgap variations model. The ball bearing fault is modeled by contact mechanics. External vibrations often occur in many industrial applications where external induced vibrations of suitable amplitude cause cyclic radial loading on the <b>machine</b> <b>shaft.</b> The model is validated by experiments, thanks to a dedicated test setup, where an external vibration source (shaker) was employed, together with ball bearing alterations in order to decrease the stiffness of the support along radial direction. To maximize the effects of externally induced vibrations, the frequency chosen was near the flexural resonance of the rotor (determined by FEM analysis). The direction of the external vibration is radial with respect to the axis of the electric machine under test. During tests, both stator phase currents and vibration of the machine were sampled. The test setup allowed to vary machine speed and load, vibration amplitude and bearing stiffness (damage level). Radial effects are usually visible only in case of large failures that result in significant airgap variations, as confirmed by experiment...|$|E

The control scheme without the encoder can not only reduce the system cost but also increase the system robustness. Therefore, it is popular in many industrial areas. In many drive applications, a DSP or a similar digital processer adopting C as the programming language is used as the controller. However, the sampling frequency of the DSP is limited. Thus, in this master thesis, the traditional DSP based controller is replaced by the FPGA based controller for the sensorless control of PMSM, because the FPGA has advantages of parallel calculation and fast sampling frequency.
