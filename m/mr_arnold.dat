She left the Victoria Dock for Chatham in May 1902, for armament and trials, and was completed in October 1903.|$|E
500|$|The film Jurassic Park {{was being}} filmed at the time, the sets {{used for the}} deleted scene where <b>Mr</b> <b>Arnold</b> goes to the shed to turn the power on were destroyed, {{the cast and crew}} took shelter in a hotel. Looting {{occurred}} in the aftermath of Iniki, though it was very minor. A group of Army Corps of Engineers, who experienced the looting of Hurricane Andrew just weeks before, were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island. Although electrical power was restored to most of the island approximately six weeks following the hurricane, students returned to Kauaʻi public schools two weeks after the disaster. [...] Kauai citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies, though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help. The military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs, though, and help arrived before local officials requested aid.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{the present}} {{opinion of the}} {{interviewer}} that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold</b> actually saw what he stated he saw. It is {{difficult to believe that}} a man of [...] character and apparent integrity would state that he saw objects and write up a report {{to the extent that he}} did if he did not see them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ginny Gordon and the Missing Heirloom (1950). The Hustlers {{still have}} the swap shop, {{but now it is}} old <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold's</b> pin that is missing. Ginny finds that the plot is not just about a pin, but a scheming woman's plan to take over all of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold's</b> estate.|$|R
50|$|Ann <b>Arnold</b> - <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> is Josh's {{mother and}} is in sharp {{contrast}} to his father. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> is a strong southern woman who does not display the same kindness to minorities. The absence of her husband, however, leads to her mental breakdown, another trying factor for Josh, halfway through the book.|$|R

2500|$|Arnold's [...] "want {{of logic}} and {{thoroughness}} of thought" [...] {{as noted by}} John M. Robertson in Modern Humanists was {{an aspect of the}} inconsistency of which Arnold was accused. Few of his ideas were his own, and he failed to reconcile the conflicting influences which moved him so strongly. [...] "There are four people, in especial," [...] he once wrote to Cardinal Newman, [...] "from whom I am conscious of having learnt – a very different thing from merely receiving a strong impression – learnt habits, methods, ruling ideas, which are constantly with me; and the four are – Goethe, Wordsworth, Sainte-Beuve, and yourself." [...] Dr. Arnold must be added; the son's fundamental likeness to the father was early pointed out by Swinburne, and was later attested by Matthew Arnold's grandson, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Whitridge.|$|E
2500|$|The Portland Oregon Journal {{reported}} on July 4 receiving {{a letter from}} an L. G. Bernier of Richland, Washington (about [...] east of Mt. Adams and [...] southeast of Mt. Rainier). Bernier wrote that he saw three of the strange objects over Richland flying [...] "almost edgewise" [...] toward Mt. Rainier about one half-hour before Arnold. Bernier thought the three {{were part of a}} larger formation. He indicated they were traveling at high speed: [...] "I have seen a P-38 appear seemingly on one horizon and then gone to the opposite horizon in no time at all, but these disks certainly were traveling faster than any P-38. [...] No doubt <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold</b> saw them just a few minutes or seconds later, according to their speed." [...] The previous day, Bernier had also spoken to his local newspaper, the Richland Washington Villager, and was among the first witnesses to suggest extraterrestrial origins: [...] "I believe it may be a visitor from another planet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of the weather, Patrick?" [...] asked <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> from the window, still {{undecided}} about the wisdom of letting her flock go off alone, papa having been called away after the plan was made.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks so}} much like snow I {{think it would be}} wiser to put off your {{sleighing}} party, Gwen," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold,</b> looking anxiously out at the heavy sky and streets still drifted by the last winter storm.|$|R
60|$|Miss Cornelia {{had always}} averred that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold</b> had no gumption. Miss Cornelia was not apt {{to err on}} the side of charity in her {{judgment}} of Methodist ministers, but in this case she did not greatly overshoot the mark. The Rev. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold</b> certainly did not have much of that desirable, indefinable quality known as gumption, or he would never have asked Whiskers-on-the-moon to lead in prayer at a khaki prayer-meeting. He thought he was returning the compliment to Mr. Meredith, who, at the conclusion of his address, had asked a Methodist deacon to lead.|$|E
60|$|The prayer-meeting opened {{conventionally}} {{and continued}} quietly. Mr. Meredith spoke first {{with his usual}} eloquence and feeling. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold</b> followed with an address which even Miss Cornelia had to confess was irreproachable in taste and subject-matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "You hold strong cards, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Greatson," [...] he said, [...] "but I {{see their}} backs only. How do I {{know that you}} speak the truth? From whom have you learnt {{the story of this}} young lady's antecedents?" ...|$|E

50|$|Arnold Transit Company {{was started}} in 1878 by George Arnold (1846-1921). Coal-fire steam boats transported {{passengers}} and goods for almost 70 years to various Michigan ports and islands. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold</b> brought in Otto Lang and Prentiss Brown to manage the business.|$|R
5000|$|Arnold died at West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park {{at the age}} of 84. The Moody Press Tips {{obituary}} said Not My Will “will {{continue to}} be a best-seller, sending forth <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Arnold’s</b> Christian witness for many years to come.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold</b> Brinkworth came in {{his place}} and said what was {{necessary}} to satisfy the scruples of the landlady, you understood that he was acting in your interests, from motives of kindness only, and under the instructions of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a {{peculiar}} case on hand, doctor," [...] said Arnold Baxter, after introducing himself as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold.</b> [...] "A young {{friend of mine}} has been almost drowned in the lake. I {{would like you to}} take charge of him for a day or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "Experiments in Quantity" [...] were, perhaps, {{suggested}} by Mr Matthew Arnold's Lectures on the Translating of Homer. <b>Mr</b> <b>Arnold</b> believed in a translation into English hexameters. His negative criticism of other translators and translations was amusing and instructive: {{he had an}} easy game {{to play with the}} Yankee-doodle metre of F. W. Newman, the ponderous blank verse of Cowper, the tripping and clipping couplets of Pope, the Elizabethan fantasies of Chapman. But Mr Arnold's hexameters were neither musical nor rapid: they only exhibited a new form of failure. As the Prince of Abyssinia said to his tutor, [...] "Enough; you have convinced me that no man can be a poet," [...] so <b>Mr</b> <b>Arnold</b> went some way to prove that no man can translate Homer.|$|E

6000|$|... "Would I {{advise you}} to marry?" [...] {{repeated}} Sir Patrick. [...] "Two courses are open to us, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Arnold,</b> in treating that question. We may put it briefly, or we may put it at great length. I am for putting it briefly. What do you say?" ...|$|E
