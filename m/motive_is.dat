5|$|The {{concept of}} <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> also explored. When confronting Padgett, Mulder asks {{him why he}} is murdering his victims. Padgett, in turn, admits that he cannot answer the question. Kaner {{suggests}} that Padgett is representative of a version of Mulder, {{and that there is}} a direct parallel between being a criminal profiler—who must think like the criminal—and a writer—who must think like his characters. In the end, however, Padgett sacrifices his personal quest—his manuscript—in order to be free. This presents a distinct contrast to Mulder, who will never truly give up his obsession. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, also notes that the episode sheds light on Scully's motive throughout the series: she wants to gain Mulder's attention, something she feels she does not have. Padgett eventually realizes this, and sacrifices himself for her love.|$|E
40|$|Aims This study {{examined}} whether parental drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> associated with young adults' drinking motives, and {{their association with}} young adults' drinking behaviors. Methods: The sample consisted of 290 18 -year-old and 289 20 -year-old drinking young adults and their parents. Results: For the younger group, stronger maternal coping <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> related to stronger social and enhancement motives, while stronger paternal coping <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> associated with stronger young adult coping motives. For the older group, stronger maternal coping <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> related to stronger social motives and stronger paternal enhancement <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> associated with stronger overall young adult drinking motives. For the younger group, both enhancement and conformity <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> predictive of their alcohol use. For the older group, only higher social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> predictive of higher alcohol use. Both groups' higher coping and enhancement <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> associated with more drinking problems. Conclusions: While, concerning content, there are some differences due to parent gender and adolescent age, stronger parental drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> indeed associated with stronger adolescent drinking motives, which in turn are quite consistently related to more adolescent alcohol use and alcohol-related problems...|$|R

40|$|Although episodic {{volunteers are}} a {{critical}} resource for many organisations, their <b>motives</b> for volunteering <b>are</b> poorly understood. A systematic review {{was conducted to}} describe empirical evidence about motives for episodic volunteering (EV) across sectors (sport, tourism, events, health and social welfare). Identified EV <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> then categorised using core functions from the Volunteer Functions Inventory (VFI) for comparison across studies. Twelve databases (1990 –December 2014) were searched. Thirty-three English language studies included results describing EV <b>motives.</b> Studies <b>were</b> predominantly cross-sectional, quantitative, event-based and originating in North America. Measurement of <b>motives</b> <b>was</b> also inconsistent. Common <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> helping others and socialising. Physical challenge and healing <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> specific to sport-based events and charity sport events, respectively. Over 80 % of <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> classified using VFI functions, particularly enhancement, values and social functions. The VFI supplemented by qualitative work may be efficacious to further identify EV motives and retention strategies...|$|R
5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E

Social utility and convenient information-seeking <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> positively related to cognitive involvement and cognitive involvement was positively related to perceived control.

40|$|Drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> {{among the}} most {{proximal}} factors for drinking behavior {{and serve as a}} mechanism through which more distal factors are mediated. However, it is less clear whether drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> precursors of drinking or, in contrast, shaped by previous drinking experiences (reciprocal effects), or both. Moreover, in adults it is unclear whether drinking motives, usually shaped in adolescence, influence each other over time. In this longitudinal study (N = 2440, 47 % women, average age 53 years), drinking motives and drinking behavior (i. e., number of drinks on the heaviest drinking day and number of drinking days; both during the past week) were assessed at 2 time points, separated by 3 months. Full cross-lagged regression models revealed that drinking <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> positively associated with drinking behavior over time and that drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> shaped by the number of drinking days (i. e., reciprocal effects). Furthermore, coping and enhancement motives, as well as social and conformity motives, positively reinforced each other. Moreover, social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> positively associated with enhancement motives over time. In conclusion, drinking motives influence each other over a 3 -month period in adulthood and predict drinking behavior over time, making them important candidates for prevention efforts. Drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> likely to be modifiable and might be used to stimulate drinking decrease...|$|R

Self-induced (through autosuggestion) itching and subsequent scratching of which the individual is unaware is likely to occur in suggestible persons if the stimulus is a mental or actual picture of the Crucifixion used during meditation and if the main <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> to receive the stigmata. The motive behind that may be unconscious conflict and a desire to escape from an intolerable situation into invalidism where one's needs are taken care of. It then becomes a case of hysterical conversion reaction. Many cases of stigmatism can be explained as fraud or unconsciously self-inflicted wounds.|$|E

Miss Gilchrist, Cora's companion, thinks it is because Richard was poisoned, as Cora told her. Miss Gilchrist gains nothing from Cora's death except Cora's own paintings. Entwhistle calls on his friend, Hercule Poirot, to resolve doubts {{about the death of}} Richard. Poirot employs an old friend, Mr Goby, to investigate the family. Goby rapidly turns up a number of reasons for family members desperate for the money in Richard's estate. Goby employs all sorts of clever methods to uncover the most private information, using agents who pose as actors, lawyers or Catholic nuns. None of the family members can be cleared of suspicion.|$|E

Clarissa guesses that Miranda and Costello's real <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> to obtain money from Henry and she accuses him of blackmail, a word overheard by Elgin just as he enters the room to tell Clarissa {{that he and his wife}} are off out. When he has gone, Clarissa, in turn, threatens to expose Costello and Miranda's drug activities. Pippa comes into the room, appalled to see Costello there as she is terrified of the man. Clarissa throws him out of the house with the help of Miss Peake and Clarissa calms the hysterical Pippa down and sends her for her bath.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{structure}} and endorsement of drinking motives and their links to alcohol use among 11 - to 19 -year-olds from 13 European countries. Method: Confirmatory factor analysis, latent growth curves, and multiple regression models were conducted, based on a sample of 33, 813 alcohol-using students from Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Wales who completed the Drinking Motives Questionnaire Revised Short Form (DMQ-R SF). Results: The findings confirmed the hypothesized four-dimensional factor structure. Social <b>motives</b> for drinking <b>were</b> most frequently indicated, followed by enhancement, coping, and conformity motives, in that order, in all age groups in all countries except Finland. This rank order was clearest among older adolescents and those from northern European countries. The results confirmed that, across countries, social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> strongly positively related to drinking frequency, enhancement <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> strongly positively related to frequency of drunkenness, and conformity <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> negatively related to both alcohol outcomes. Against our expectations, social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> more closely related to drunkenness than <b>were</b> coping <b>motives,</b> particularly among younger adolescents. Conclusions: The findings reveal striking cross-cultural consistency. Health promotion efforts that are based on, or incorporate, drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> likely to be applicable across Europe. As social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> particularly closely linked to drunkenness among young adolescents, measures to impede the modeling of alcohol use and skills to resist peer pressure are particularly important in this age group...|$|R

25|$|Pippa {{has been}} put to bed with a {{sleeping}} draught. Clarissa {{has set up a}} card table for bridge when her three guests arrive back, summoned by a phone call from her. She asks them to move the body to Costello's car which she knows is parked some distance from the house to a local wood. Their alibi will be the bridge game for which she has set up the cards with false scores to indicate the progress of some time having elapsed. She tells them that her <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> Henry's diplomatic visit. The three somewhat incredulous men fall in uneasily with her plan but only after Sir Rowland has been told by Clarissa of Pippa's supposed involvement. Wearing gloves supplied by Clarissa, they manage to move the body back into the recess, with the intention of moving him later, but are interrupted when the police unexpectedly arrive. Inspector Lord is there following a mysterious phone call to the station telling them that a murder has been committed at the house.|$|E
25|$|Poirot tells Lord Charles of Lady Julia's offer {{but that}} she is mistaken, as {{she does not know}} that her son was busy with Leonie at the time in question. Poirot {{explains}} that Mrs. Macatta was heard snoring in her room, Mrs. Vanderlyn was heard to call for Leonie from upstairs, and Sir George was with Lord Charles on the terrace. Everyone is accounted except for Carlile and Lord Charles. As Carlile has access to the safe at all times and could have taken tracings at his leisure, only Lord Charles is left. Poirot has no doubts that Lord Charles put the plans in his own pocket. His <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> linked back to a denial given some years earlier that he was involved in negotiations with a belligerent foreign power. As he was indeed involved in such activities he must now have been blackmailed to hand over the plans via Mrs. Vanderlyn. Poirot has no doubt that the plans she holds are subtly altered so as to make the design unworkable. Lord Charles confesses to the deception but insists that his motive, refusing to be derailed from leading Britain through the coming world crisis, is pure.|$|E
