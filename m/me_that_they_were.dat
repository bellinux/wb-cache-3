5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E
25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the various}} films that have {{attracted}} nominations {{in all four}} acting categories, Sunset Boulevard {{is one of only}} three not to win in any category, the others being My Man Godfrey (1936) and American Hustle (2013). Its eleven Oscar nominations were exceeded only by the fourteen received by All About Eve, which won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for All About Eve and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. Swanson recalled the press's reaction following Holliday's win: [...] "It slowly dawned on <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> asking for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond." ...|$|E
2500|$|In response, 60 Minutes Wednesday {{released}} a statement suggesting that Will and James had [...] "misrepresented" [...] {{their role in the}} authentication of the documents and had played only a small part in the process. CBS News concurrently amended its previous claim that Matley had authenticated the documents, saying instead that he had only authenticated the signatures. On CNN, Matley stated he had only verified that the signatures were [...] "from the same source," [...] not that they were authentically Killian's: [...] "When I saw the documents, I could not verify the documents were authentic or inauthentic. I could only verify that the signatures came from the same source," [...] Matley said. [...] "I could not authenticate the documents themselves. But at the same time, there was nothing to tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not authentic." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Howarth {{left the}} {{role for the}} first time. Significantly brought on by Todd's {{redemption}} storyline, {{he said he had}} no desire to portray a redeemed Todd. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos that he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> taking the character on a different path [...] they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic [...] it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E

60|$|I {{wanted to}} mollify this severe looking old lady; for even my short {{experience}} of old ladies had convinced <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the hereditary enemies of all strange young men.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye'll no persuade <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> birth marks," [...] {{returned}} Mistress Jean. [...] "Such a {{thing would}} be a miracle in a loyal Scottish Catholic's wean, let alone an English heretic's." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. Well, no one {{has ever}} told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in this {{extraordinary}} position.|$|E
60|$|I {{shook my}} head. Some {{instinct}} told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> professors. But I didn't say so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] replied Millicent sharply, [...] "didn't {{you tell}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> worth sixteen shillings {{not very long}} ago? Why didn't you sell them then?" ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{while their}} monuments remind <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not dead, but living—for all live to God—then awed I am, and humbled; better so: but sad I cannot be in such grand company.|$|R
6000|$|... "But their corsairs seize all our craft, Signore, {{and treat}} their people as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{no better than}} dogs; then, <b>they</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not Christians--no, not even Luterani or heretics!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{the same}} fact convinces <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the very men we seek; for {{they said they}} meant to have some game with you, and what more amusing than {{to give you a}} long, hard chase for nothing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{perhaps he}} did. He told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> mine, and I shall keep them. So that's {{the end of}} it. You can go to bed now." [...] And Miss Macnulty went to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think you'll {{find the}} roads around Rayville all right," [...] called Mr. Basswood to him. [...] "My friend told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in good condition, {{especially}} {{those on the}} other side of the town." ...|$|E
60|$|Who {{they were}} {{or where they}} came from was a mystery to <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the outpost of some {{powerful}} black nation seemed likely, yet where the seat of that nation lay I could not guess.|$|E

60|$|Perry {{has told}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> almost {{identical}} with the fossilized {{remains of the}} diplodocus of the outer crust's Jurassic age. I have to take his word for it--and I guess you will, unless you know more of such matters than I.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> making {{just the same}} mistake here," [...] another put in. [...] "As Jeanne of Navarre is well nigh as {{dangerous}} as the Admiral himself, why don't they seize her and her cub, and carry them to Paris?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... “I don’t know {{anything}} about them, Lady Cochrane; I have never had any little brothers and sisters. Of course some of my school-fellows had them, and it always seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> jolly little things {{when they were in}} a good temper.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Nicholas II's {{government}} knew {{an uprising}} was being planned but allowed {{it because it}} would justify crushing the revolutionaries.

60|$|I sent {{these papers}} to an eminent lawyer (and yet {{a man of}} virtue and {{learning}} into the bargain) who, after many alterations returned them back, with assuring <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> perfectly innocent; without the least mixture of treason, rebellion, sedition, malice, disaffection, reflection, or wicked insinuation whatsoever.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{never made}} the {{slightest}} effort to communicate with Arthur's widow or with his child, for Arthur had assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> well provided for and quite happy amongst their own kindred.

60|$|I {{was very}} greatly {{surprised}} at {{the ease with which}} these savages had mastered the rather intricate detail of this unusual work, but Perry assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> a wonderfully intelligent race, and had been quick to grasp all that he had tried to teach them.|$|E
60|$|Always, {{during my}} childhood, {{at this stage}} of the dream, did I wake up {{screaming}} with fright--to find, often, my mother or nurse, anxious and startled, by my bedside, passing soothing hands through my hair and telling <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> there and that there was nothing to fear.|$|E
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. Your birth! Now Adolphus, don't dare {{to make up}} {{a wicked}} story for the sake of these wretched cannons.
