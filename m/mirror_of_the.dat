5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} Venus {{is the same}} as that used in biology for the female sex: a circle with a small cross beneath.

5|$|In {{the other}} naval theatres {{there were no}} decisive pitched battles. In the Black Sea, {{engagement}} between Russian and Turkish battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the Baltic Sea, action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the Battle of Moon Sound at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The Adriatic was {{in a sense the}} <b>mirror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Sea: the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the Mediterranean, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on Gallipoli.|$|E

25|$|The flawed primary <b>mirror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hubble Space Telescope was {{ground and}} {{polished}} in Danbury by Perkin-Elmer's Danbury Optical System unit from 1979 to 1981.

The four elements, called heaven, earth, man and matter, represented the four unknown quantities in his algebraic equations. The Ssy-yüan yü-chien deals with simultaneous equations and with equations of degrees as high as fourteen.

This poem is a first-person, mystical narrative of the soul as a yearning woman calling out to Christ as her father-brother-lover. Her work was passed to the royal court of England, suggesting that Marguerite had influence on the Protestant Reformation in England.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the oldest}} known Chinese books written on naval matters was the Yuejueshu (Lost Records of the State of Yue) of 52 AD, {{attributed}} to the Han Dynasty scholar Yuan Kang.

25|$|The {{end of the}} 19th {{century is}} {{sometimes}} called Amsterdam's second Golden Age. New museums, a railway station, and the Concertgebouw were built; in this same time, the Industrial Revolution reached the city. The Amsterdam–Rhine Canal was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the Rhine, and the North Sea Canal was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the North Sea. Both projects dramatically improved commerce {{with the rest of}} Europe and the world. In 1906, Joseph Conrad gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in The <b>Mirror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a family of}} Lagrangian submanifolds in the Landau [...] Ginzburg mirror to the projective plane equipped with a binodal cubic curve as anticanonical divisor. These objects correspond under mirror symmetry to <b>the</b> powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twisting sheaf O(1), and hence their Floer cohomology groups form an algebra isomorphic to the homogeneous coordinate ring. An interesting feature is <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a singular torus fibration on <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> Lagrangians are sections. The algebra structure on the Floer cohomology is computed by counting sections of Lefschetz fibrations. Our results agree with the tropical analog proposed by Abouzaid [...] Gross [...] Siebert.
