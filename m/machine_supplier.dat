40|$|Does high {{products}} complexity & {{production cost}} drive high customer involvement in product development? Author: Ellen Wendel Tutor/Examiner: Sarah Philipson   Background   The {{purpose of this}} thesis first arose when interviewing the CEO and the chief of product development of a Swedish wood company. The lack of communication {{between the two of}} them and the overall information flow within the company seemed to me brutally bad. When leaving that company a question popped up: Do a low production cost/unit and/or a low product complexity on an industrial market result in low customer involvement?   Problem focus/hypotheses   Product failure is costly and time consuming; doing it right the first time can keep a company alive and give it competitive advantages, Matzler et al (1997). Customer involvement has proven to increase the chances for a successful product launch, von Hippel (1988), Lagrosen (2005), Pitta et al (1996) and Matzler et al (1997). With the assumption that customer involvement can affect product development in a positive way, any conditions that might drive customer involvement in product development would be of interest. This thesis investigates three hypotheses concerning how product complexity and production cost drive customers involvement; H 1 : High product complexity positively predicts the use of high customer involvement in the product development. H 2 : High production cost positively predicts the use of high customer involvement in the product development. H 3 : High production cost and high product complexity together positively predicts the use of high customer involvement.   Method   The main study was executed with surveys sent per e-mail. The investigated populations are wood component suppliers and machine suppliers. The suppliers were chosen to get a vast range of product complexity and production cost. The hypotheses were analyzed with chi-square statistics and percentages.   To get a basic understanding of the industry, I first made a pre-study; interviewing two suppliers and telephone interviewing the head of glued edge pine panel issues at the Swedish Wood & Furniture Association.   Findings   Hypothesis 1 I conclude that higher product complexity leads to higher customer involvement on both industries. This result gives more validation to the emerging theory stated by Richard et al (2004). Hypothesis 2  This thesis validates hypothesis 2 among wood suppliers. I suggest future research to validate a possible theory the states that higher production cost drive higher customer involvement.  Hypothesis 2 is not accepted on the <b>machine</b> <b>supplier</b> industry since the results were inconclusive. No overall pattern was found.   However, the result indicates that the hypothesis might be correct up until a certain level of complexity, after which the relationship is negative. Hypothesis 3   I consider hypothesis 2 to be validated on the wood supplier market. I suggest future research to validate a possible theory the states that higher production cost and product complexity and production cost combined drive higher customer involvement. The thesis result indicates that hypothesis 3, on the <b>machine</b> <b>supplier</b> market, might be correct up until a certain level of complexity and production cost combination, after which the relationship is negative. Hypothesis 3 cannot be accepted for the <b>machine</b> <b>supplier</b> industry since the results are inconclusive. General findings from the hypotheses All three hypotheses indicate a positive prediction that product complexity, production cost and the two variables combined will drive the behavior of “usage or no usage” of customer involvement, regardless of industry.   Opponenter: Elna Hägglund och Frida Tillmar</p...|$|E

40|$|Currently little data {{exists on}} {{temperature}} repeatability of BGA/CSP rework machine equipment. This {{is an issue}} especially for lead-free rework as the temperatures during lead-free BGA/CSP rework {{are likely to be}} higher than reflow soldering, leading to potential component and board temperature related issues. A series of evaluations was conducted on rework equipment from four rework machine equipment suppliers. The BGA/CSP rework machine repeatability and tolerance temperature study used a fixed thermal profile with temperature measurement output on equipment specifically designed for BGA/CSP rework machines. The temperature input was a lead-free rework profile developed by each supplier on a PBGA 544 component on a 135 mil (3. 4 mm) thick test vehicle board. This lead-free rework profile was run on the rework machine 10 times. Temperature peaks and durations were recorded at the 6 different temperature locations on the temperature measurement equipment placed within the rework machine. In Phase 1 of the program each rework <b>machine</b> <b>supplier</b> recorded temperatures using its defined lead-free profile with a specific rework machine. In Phase 2, each supplier repeated these tests on a different machine of the same model. A comparison was then done to analyze the temperature and time data from Phases 1 and 2 to determine rework machine temperature repeatability and tolerances...|$|E

40|$|I {{argue that}} {{equipment}} price de‡ation might be overstated because {{the methods used}} to measure it rely on the erroneous assumption of perfectly competitive markets.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} the successful {{story of a}} SME that exemplifies {{the case of the}} systems integrating firm. A series of strategic and courageous decisions enabled Tecnomatic to rapidly evolve along the value chain: from a mere special <b>machine</b> tools <b>supplier</b> to partner of leading European and US automotive firms. As from the 1980 s, cost cutting strategies and a more competent supplier base have pushed and enabled manufacturers to extensively believe in outsourcing. More recently, first-tier suppliers (both component manufacturers and <b>machine</b> tools <b>suppliers)</b> have also adopted such strategy. By pursuing outsourcing strategies, both manufacturers and first-tier suppliers have lost important design and manufacturing capabilities. Following a visionary entrepreneur, Tecnomatic started a capability acquisition process that enabled it to fill the capability gap left by manufacturers and first tier suppliers.

Luna Export AB, a Swedish tools and <b>machines</b> <b>supplier,</b> is considering following this trend by entering the Ukraine with its product line – Teng Tools – through the means of distributors. This project investigates which distributors Luna Export AB should choose. Not much research has been conducted in the area of distributor selection, but rather on issues regarding the process of why choosing a distributor as an entry mode as well as the establishment of channel strategies. Therefore, we developed our own criteria list in order to choose the appropriate distributor. Consequently, this research shows how we went about when selecting distributors for Teng Tools in the Ukraine. The result ended up with three potential distributors, whereof two of these are considered to be the most compatible for Teng Tools. After conducting a field study, the result indicated that Luna needed to reconsider its choice of entry mode through distributors.

40|$|All {{manufacturers}} in the {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) industry have experienced lack of reliability, maintenance, and performance problems with their machines. These challenges decrease manufacturing productivity and increase costs. Addressing these manufacturing challenges requires the right process information {{to be available to}} the engineering team. Currently, managers and process engineers either have insufficient or no data to measure the impact of these issues in order to make improvements. It is essential for the industry to use the adopted equipment communication standards that provide the basic framework to gather the data necessary to dramatically improve equipment utilization. The industry has been using the Semiconductor Equipment Communication Standard/Generic Model for Communications and Control of SEMI Equipment (SECS/GEM) standards that allow manufacturers to gather data directly from the equipment. Several factories that have used SECS/GEM have published their remarkable process improvements. Experience demonstrates that SECS/GEM is most reliable when equipment suppliers use robust software products created by third party developers to implement the interface and provide it as a standard feature. IPC is defining new communication standards for retrieving information from the equipment based on Extensible Markup Language (XML), a common and popular communication language. The new standards promise facilitated access to process information in order to increase equipment efficiency and reduce costs. Equipment suppliers are already required to support the SECS/GEM standard for certain customers. Today, <b>machine</b> <b>suppliers</b> {{are on the verge of}} also supporting the IPC XML standards as manufacturers adopt the new standards. Suppliers and factories should avoid developing non-standard protocols to implement equipment communication interfaces and instead use the existing standards as a baseline and implement special messages to fulfill any additional requirements...|$|R
