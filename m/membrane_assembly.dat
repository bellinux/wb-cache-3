40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} polytopic membrane protein insertion in Escherichia coli, we have examined the protein and energy requirements for in vivo <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly</b> of the prototypic 12 transmembrane domain sugar co-transporter, melibiose permease (MelB). MelB <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly</b> was analyzed both kinetically, by pulse labeling experiments, and functionally by measuring {{the activity of the}} inserted permease. Strikingly, the rate of MelB <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly</b> is decreased approximately 4 -fold upon dissipation of the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient, delta(mu) H+, indicative of a strong requirement for delta(mu) H+. Interestingly, selective dissipation of either the electrical (delta(psi)) or the chemical (delta(pH)) component of delta(mu) H+ demonstrates that either form of energy is required for MelB <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly.</b> In contrast, MelB <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly</b> does not require SecA, SecY or SecE, all three proteins which are strictly required for protein translocation. Neither the rate of MelB <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly</b> nor the amount of functional permease is affected by inactivation or depletion of these Sec proteins.

40|$|Epithelial {{differentiation}} including {{tight junction}} (TJ) formation occurs exclusively within the trophectoderm (TE) lineage {{of the mouse}} blastocyst. Here we examine mechanisms by which TJ protein <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly</b> might be regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) in the embryo. To overcome the inherent staging asynchrony of individual blastomeres within intact embryos, we have used isolated inner cell masses (ICMs) from early blastocysts to induce epithelial differentiation in their outer cells responding to their new cell contact pattern. Two TJ proteins examined retain their order of <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly</b> in isolated ICMs in culture as during normal development (early-assembling ZO- 2 and late-assembling ZO- 1 {alpha}+), but this process is highly accelerated. Using six chemical modulators of PKC activity, we show here that PKC signalling {{is involved in the}} regulation of TJ <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly.</b> While indolactam-mediated PKC activation stimulates <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly</b> of both TJ proteins, TPA-mediated PKC activation stimulates only that of ZO- 1 {alpha}+. The PKC inhibitors Ro- 31 - 8220, Ro- 31 - 8425 and Gö 6983 suppress the stimulatory effect of both PKC activators on <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly</b> to varying extents according to inhibitor and TJ protein examined. Gö 6983 similarly inhibits ZO- 2 and ZO- 1 {alpha}+ <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly.</b> PKC inhibition by Gö 6976 appeared to stimulate TJ <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly.</b> Despite the broad PKC isotype specificity of the inhibitors used, these data suggest that the two TJ proteins are differently regulated by PKC isotypes or subfamilies. As Gö 6983 uniquely affects aPKC (particularly PKC{zeta}) and we find that both PKC{delta} and {zeta} relocate upon activator treatment to colocalise partially with the TJ proteins in isolated ICMs, we suggest that at least PKC{delta} and {zeta} may {{play a central role in}} regulating TJ <b>membrane</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|E
