We have previously located the predisposing genetic defect {{to the long}} arm of chromosome 11 by genetic linkage. In this study, 124 members of six MEN 1 families, including 59 affected individuals, were genotyped for restriction fragment length polymorphisms with different DNA probes, and the genetic linkage between these <b>marker</b> <b>systems</b> and MEN 1 was determined. 13 <b>marker</b> <b>systems</b> (17 DNA probes) {{were found to be}} linked to MEN 1. These markers are located within a region on chromosome 11 spanning 14 % meiotic recombinations, with the MEN 1 locus in the middle. Four of the <b>marker</b> <b>systems</b> are on the centromeric side of MEN 1, and four on the telomeric side, based on meiotic crossovers. The remaining five DNA probes are closely linked to MEN 1, with no crossovers in our set of families. The 13 <b>marker</b> <b>systems</b> can be used for an accurate and reliable premorbid test for MEN 1. In most clinical situations it is possible to identify a haplotype of this part of chromosome 11 with the mutant MEN 1 allele in the middle.

Genetic variation between 10 landraces of rice bean was evaluated using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. Among these markers, RAPD primers generated 987 amplification products of which 719 were polymorphic and ISSR markers produced 479 amplification products, out of which 296 were polymorphic. RAPD fingerprinting detected more polymorphic loci (70. 30 %) than the ISSR fingerprinting (61. 79 %). Mean PIC (polymorphism information content) {{for each of these}} <b>marker</b> <b>systems</b> (0. 243 for RAPD and 0. 203 for ISSR) suggested that both the <b>marker</b> <b>systems</b> were equally effective in determining polymorphisms.

The data indicate that both minisatellites and SSRs can be used to genetically distinguish the analysed materials. Furthermore, these two <b>marker</b> <b>systems</b> depict relationships consistent with the hierarchal pattern obtained by the morphological data. As locally cultivated tomato accessions are often characterised by some degree of genetic variability, our results will be valuable in facilitating the purification, management and breeding of tomato germplasms.

A germplasm collection is maintained ex situ by CIP, which has developed a morphological <b>markers</b> <b>system</b> to classify the accessions into morphotypes, i. e. groups of morphologically identical accessions. However, their genetic uniformity is currently unknown. The ISSR technique was used in two experiments to determine the relationships between both morphological and molecular <b>markers</b> <b>systems.</b> The intra-morphotype genetic diversity, the spatial structures of the diversity and the congruence between both <b>markers</b> <b>systems</b> were determined. In the first experience, 44 accessions representing five morphotypes, clearly distinct from each other, were analyzed. At the molecular level, the accessions exactly clustered according to their morphotypes. However, a genetic variability was observed inside each morphotype. In the second experiment, 34 accessions gradually differing from each other on morphological base were analyzed. The morphological clustering showed no geographical structure. On the opposite, the molecular analysis showed that the genetic structure was slightly related to the collection site. The correlation between both <b>markers</b> <b>systems</b> was weak but significant. The lack of perfect congruence between morphological and molecular data suggests that the morphological system may be useful for the morphotypes management but is not appropriate to study the genetic structure of the oca.

The main objectives of the present study were 1) to determine differences between ISSR and RAPD <b>marker</b> <b>systems</b> in detecting genetic variation in soybeans and 2) to identify and characterize accession- diagnostic molecular markers in G. max accessions. Genomic DNAs from 108 G. max accessions from 11 different gene pools were analyzed using several ISSR and RAPD primers. The levels of polymorphic loci detected with the two <b>marker</b> <b>systems</b> were in general moderate and similar [...] Overall, 82 % of genetic distance values were above 0. 40 based on ISSR analysis. However, RAPD data revealed that the accessions from different countries are closely related with 64 % genetic distance values below 0. 40. The dendrograms constructed with ISSR data revealed that the South Korean accessions formed an out-group while the RAPD analysis showed that accessions from Sweden were separate from the other 10 gene pools. One variety-diagnostic marker generated with ISSR 5 primer was identified in the accession Kao Chien Tao from China. This marker was cloned, and sequenced.

For hunting, perhaps religious reasons, and in connection with certain myths, hares have been and are still being intentionally translocated. Ancient translocations by humans can be inferred from the presence of hares on islands that had no mainland connections, at least during the Pleistocene, the major evolutionary period of the genus Lepus. We review some of the literature on anthropogenic translocations of hares.
