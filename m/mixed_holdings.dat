The assessment was conducted based on agro-ecological indicators and environmental burden (material pressure). The analysis was conducted according to a classification into agricultural holding types: field crops, dairy cattle, and <b>mixed</b> <b>holdings.</b> The factor with the strongest impact on the agro-ecological sustainability of the studied agricultural holdings was the holding type. Field crop and <b>mixed</b> <b>holdings</b> achieved more favorable environmental sustainability indicators. Holdings specializing in dairy cattle breeding pose a threat to the natural environment due to their excessive number of livestock...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} deals with an {{appearance}} of peasant-workers in the prewar period in Yugoslavia. The author stresses {{the fact that the}} conditions for the emergence of this mixed social stratum in Yugoslavia were created relatively late, due mainly to specific historical circumstances (frequent wars), which disrupted or postponed the utilization and application of many technical inventions of the modem civilization. For instance, the steam machine and construction of railway roads started at the end and {{at the beginning of the}} second half of the XIX-th century. Before the Second World War the most regions of today Yugoslavia had not developed industrially, so it is quite understandable that the number of peasant-workers in that times were minimal. It is estimated that in Yugoslavia 9. 00 % of the total number of agricultural holdings were mixed (part-time) in 1938. In the second chapter the author analyses the development of mixed agricultural holdings in the postwar period. Due to rapid changes of the social structure of population under the influence of the developing industries and tertiary activities, the number of mixed agricultural holdings has been growing from year to year. Already in 1960. they amounted up to 34. 00 % of the total number of agricultural holdings and today it is estimated that approximately 50. 00 % of the total number employed in nonagricultural sector are coming from agricultural holdings. In the third chapter the author considers some causes of the origination of <b>mixed</b> <b>holdings.</b> He particularly analyses the economic reasons, namely the agrarian overpopulation. Among other reasons he mentions aspirations of agricultural population for better life and higher living standard by the employment in nonagricultural activites, need for money accumulation necessary for the realization of certain specific goals, like migration to other richer regions or a town, schooling of children, payments of state land tax or debts and different individual motives. In the fourth chapter the author pleads for more systematic and scientific research of this mixed stratum; differentiation of various substrata on the basis of certain characteristics which can be taken as real hypotheses that essentially influences their different production and cosumption orientation as well as their different behaviour and attitudes towards other social strata is necessary. In this sense the author exemplifies his thesis, citing the data on different size of holdings and different consumption characteristics of <b>mixed</b> <b>holdings</b> (households). He separately points out the regional and local pecularities of mixed households. Here too, we find an explication of preliminary results of the questionnaire on <b>mixed</b> <b>holdings</b> which was carried out by the Agrarian Institute in Zagreb last year. In the last chapter the author critically reviews several more or less already generally accepted views on peasant-workers (as bad agricultural and nonagricultural workers, as the lowest social stratum, as people with no formal group participation etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{many parts}} of Europe, decades of {{production}} subsidies led to the steady intensification of agriculture in marginal areas, but the recent decoupling of subsidies from production decisions means {{that the future of}} farming in these areas is uncertain. For example, in the uplands of the United Kingdom, an area important both for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision, hill farmers steadily increased stocking densities in response to headage payments but must now reconfigure farm businesses to account for the shift to the Single Farm Payment scheme. We examined hill farming in the Peak District National Park as a case study into the future of marginal agriculture after decoupling. We surveyed 44 farm businesses and from this identified six representative farm types based on enterprise <b>mix</b> and land <b>holdings.</b> We developed linear programming models of production decisions for each farm type to examine the impacts of policy changes, comparing the effects of decoupling with and without agri-environment and hill farm support, and evaluating the effects of removal of the Single Farm Payment. The main effects of decoupling are to reduce stocking rates, and to change the mix of livestock activities. Agri-environmental schemes mediate the income losses from decoupling, and farmers are predicted to maximise take up of new Environmental Stewardship programmes, which have both positive and negative feedback effects on livestock numbers. Finally, removal of the Single Farm Payment would lead to negative net farm incomes, and some land abandonment. These changes have important implications for ongoing debates about how ecological service flows can be maintained from upland areas, and how marginal upland farming communities can be sust ained.

40|$|Most working {{adults have}} access to a taxable {{brokerage}} account (TBA) and a tax deferred retirement account (TDRA). According to the existing literature, taxable bonds should be located in the TDRA, while equities should be located in the TBA due to the tax treatments of these accounts. If borrowing is not allowed <b>mixed</b> <b>holdings</b> can be optimal in either account but not in both simultaneously. But if borrowing is allowed all the wealth in the TDRA should be allocated to bonds. Unfortunately, the empirical findings are at odds with the theoretical predictions as investors do hold both equities and bonds in both of the accounts. This discrepancy is known as the asset location puzzle. In this paper, we revisit the asset location issue by extending the model to include multiple risky assets. This allows us to capture the interaction of portfolio diversification and the tax timing option, features that are not captured in the existing models. We find that the correlation structure of the risky assets and the borrowing constraints have substantial impact on asset location decisions. We also find that asset location and allocation decisions are sensitive to the Sharpe ratios of the risky assets {{and the size of the}} retirement account. Consistent with the existing empirical findings, we also observe a mix of bonds and equities in either of the account with borrowing constraints and with reasonable relaxation of the borrowing constraints. Furthermore, we document the impact of borrowing constraints, and show that the assumption of unlimited borrowing is not innocuous. Failing to incorporate institutional restrictions on borrowing contributes to the theoretical inconsistencies. To support some of our conclusions, we also provide some empirical evidence. ...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIVs) are {{a diverse}} group of viruses that are a major global threat to the poultry industry. To date, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes of avian influenza have been observed in birds. Most of these subtypes cause no or only mild disease in poultry and are therefore classified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs). However, as a result of mutations, LPAIVs belonging to the H 5 or H 7 subtypes (LPNAIVs) may evolve into a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) when they are circulating in poultry. Since these HPAIVs cause severe sickness and mortality in poultry and are able to spread rapidly, such an outbreak can wreak havoc among poultry holdings in a large region. In order to prevent the emergence of a HPAIV, it is important that LPNAI outbreaks in poultry are detected as soon as possible and that control measures can be applied before the virus has the opportunity to become widespread. In order to achieve this, active surveillance programs directed towards an early detection of LPNAIV in poultry holdings are established. It is believed that focusing the current active surveillance programs on those sectors of the poultry industry that are more susceptible to a LPNAIV infection, would lead to an earlier detection of LPNAIV. To this end, it is necessary that those factors that determine whether a poultry holding is at increased risk for infection with LPNAIV are identified. In this thesis, transmission experiments were designed to identify and study some putative risk factors for LPNAIV infection in poultry holdings. In a first series of transmission experiments (Chapter 3), the transmission of three LPNAIVs between SPF chickens was studied. A H 5 N 2 LPAIV, which had been isolated from chickens and a H 7 N 1 LPAIV which had also been isolated from chickens, were found to be highly infectious and transmissible to SPF chickens. In contrary, a H 5 N 3 LPAIV that had been isolated from wild ducks proved to be low infectious to SPF chickens and was not transmitted between them. It was additionally examined whether keeping chickens in cage or barn housing could influence the transmission of LPNAIV. To achieve this, differences in virus transmission were studied between SPF chickens housed on a grid (to simulate housing in enriched cages) and SPF chickens housed on a floor covered with wood shavings (to simulate floor-based housing). The obtained results suggest that the transmission of LPNAIVs may be slightly enhanced by the accumulation of fecal matter as it occurs in floor-based housing systems. However, no large impact was observed. In order to decide whether this factor should be regarded as a risk factor and be included in the active LPNAI surveillance programs, further investigation should be conducted. This could be realized by conducting additional transmission experiments or by conducting an epidemiological study looking for a relationship between LPNAI outbreaks and the type of housing system. A second set of transmission experiments (Chapter 4) was dedicated to the investigation of the transmission of LPNAIVs between ducks and chickens. In these experiments, the transmission of the duck originated H 5 N 3 LPAIV that was also used in chapter 3 was investigated between pekin ducks and SPF chickens. Despite this virus was previously found to be low infectious to SPF chickens, it was found to be efficiently transmitted from pekin ducks to SPF chickens, suggesting that this virus can be efficiently introduced in chicken farms if contact with wild waterfowl is possible. Additionally, from experiments with a special setting, it was suggested that drinking water that is fecally contaminated by visiting waterfowl {{may be one of the}} most important fomites by which LPNAIVs are introduced to poultry holdings. From these results, it can be suggested that the risk of a wild bird originated LPNAIV becoming established in poultry is only realistic if the virus itself has a high infectious potential to poultry. Indeed, our results suggest that, despite the fact that they can be relatively easily introduced, a LPNAIV with a low infectious potential to chickens has a significant risk of dying out spontaneously when it is introduced in an all-chicken population. On the other hand, in mixed poultry farms where contact between domestic waterfowl and gallinaceous poultry is possible, these low infectious LPNAIVs may be of a bigger problem; It is possible that such a LPNAIV can circulate among the holding’s waterfowl and can then be repeatedly passed on to the chickens. This would theoretically enable the virus to adapt to chickens, which means that these <b>mixed</b> poultry <b>holdings</b> can act as a bridge for the virus to cross the species barrier from its natural host to gallinaceous poultry. In a third study (Chapter 5); it was evaluated if transmission of the H 5 N 2 and H 7 N 1 LPAIVs used in chapter 3 still occurs when a more natural infection pressure is used. Indeed, it is often assumed that the inoculation of animals, as carried out in standard transmission experiments, may lead to a higher infectivity and thus to an artificially enhanced transmission. Extended transmission experiments in which susceptible SPF chickens were exposed to naturally infected SPF chickens were carried out. For the H 5 N 2 LPAIV, it was observed that the reproduction ratio was similar to the one obtained in chapter 3. This suggests a similar infectivity for naturally infected SPF chickens as for inoculated SPF chickens, at least for this virus. Unfortunately, for the H 7 N 1 LPAIV, no conclusions could be drawn; naturally infected SPF chickens could not be obtained, most likely due to problems in the design of the experiment. In a final study (Chapter 6), the multispecies NP-ELISA kit that was used throughout the thesis for the determination of infection was compared with other commercially available multispecies NP-ELISA kits. A selection of chicken and duck sera from the transmission experiments (chapter 3 and 4) were analyzed and results were compared. As these kits are also widely used in the active surveillance of LPNAIV in wild waterfowl, some additional field sera from wild geese, swans and ducks were included. The results suggest that the currently available commercial multispecies NP-ELISA kits perform equivalent for the analysis of chicken sera, and that they are most probably more sensitive than the current standard, the HI test. For wild bird sera however, a high degree of inconsistency between the different kits was observed. This indicates that, whilst the currently available commercial multispecies NP-ELISA kits are reliable for the active LPNAI surveillance in chickens, they can give unreliable results for wild bird sera. Hence, either these kits need to be better calibrated for the use in these species, or more reliable alternatives need to be investigated...|$|R
