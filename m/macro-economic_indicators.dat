From the percentage equation of the PDRB change and workforce absorption change, there could be concluded that elasticity level from 9 economic sector in each city was inelastic.

A comparison of the models of WB and DBM, which are both micro-founded computable general equilibrium models using the same data, reveals that DBM strongly outperforms WB. We argue that the shortening of the time horizon and the quantity adjustment following the dramatic shock explain why our model performs much better.

Starting from the concept of organizational intelligence, the way it is defined in recent literature, we establish seven dimensions which are relevant for its analysis, and test them on a relevant sample, random stratified, of Romanian companies, reflecting the structure of Romanian economy, and all the layers of company size. We examine, thus, the correlation between the quality of the organizational human capital (the individual intelligence) and the learning processes, at the organizational level.

While the post- 2015 development agenda sets out action on climate change {{as one of the}} Sustainable Development Goals, there is little provision on how this can be achieved in tandem with the desired economic progress and the required improvements in health and wellbeing. This paper examines synergies and tensions between the goals addressing climate change and economic progress. We identify reductionist approaches in economics, such as ‘externalities’, reliance on the metric of the Gross Domestic Product, positive discount rates, and short-term profit targets as some of the key sources of tensions between these goals. Such reductionist approaches could be addressed by intersectoral governance mechanisms. Health in All Policies, health-sensitive <b>macro-economic</b> progress <b>indicators,</b> and accounting for long-term and non-monetary values are some of the approaches that could be adapted and used in governance for the SDGs.

40|$|Tactical {{forecasting}} in {{supply chain}} management supports planning for inventory, scheduling production, and raw material purchase, amongst other functions. It typically refers to forecasts up to 12 months ahead. Traditional forecasting models take into account univariate information extrapolating from the past, but cannot anticipate macroeconomic events, such as steep increases or declines in national economic activity. In practice this is countered by using managerial expert judgement, which is well known to suffer from various biases, is expensive and not scalable. This paper evaluates multiple approaches to improve tactical sales forecasting using <b>macro-economic</b> leading <b>indicators.</b> The proposed statistical forecast selects automatically both the type of leading indicators, {{as well as the}} order of the lead for each of the selected indicators. However as the future values of the leading indicators are unknown an additional uncertainty is introduced. This uncertainty is controlled in our methodology by restricting inputs to an unconditional forecasting setup. We compare this with the conditional setup, where future indicator values are assumed to be known and assess the theoretical loss of forecast accuracy. We also evaluate purely statistical model building against judgement aided models, where potential leading indicators are pre-filtered by experts, quantifying the accuracy-cost trade-off. The proposed framework improves on forecasting accuracy over established time series benchmarks, while providing useful insights about the key leading indicators. We evaluate the proposed approach on a real case study and find 18. 8 % accuracy gains over the current forecasting process...|$|R

We review the different approaches of this link, starting from the earlier themes of the Big Push and of exogenous growth, to the recent renewal of growth theories and of spatial spillover models. We assess the empirical estimates of these various models, using the production and the cost function approach, as well as the conditional convergence framework and the link between infrastructures, investment and growth. We present a theoretical model of this last link, which is estimated on panel data on a sample of 87 countries using the three stages least squares method. We highlight two channels of transmission of the role of infrastructures: a first one through production capacities which shows a complementarity between public and private investment, and another one through total factor productivity. The estimates are based on an aggregate indicator of infrastructures constructed from the principal component analysis of various physical social and financial <b>indicators.</b> <b>macro-economic</b> modelisation, panel data estimation, survey, infrastructure, investment, economic growth...|$|R

40|$|In 2003 the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{published}} {{estimates of}} <b>macro-economic</b> <b>indicators</b> for 2002 {{of the economy}} of Palestine. The WB used a micro-founded recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, calibrated on the 1998 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of Palestine, to which shocks were applied, whereas the IMF based its estimates on a macro-founded income-expenditure model relying on more recent data. It turned out that there were substantial differences: the estimate by the WB of the real gross national income (at 1998 prices) was 25 % less than the corresponding figure calculated by the IMF. This huge difference is not only relevant for {{a full understanding of}} the economic consequences of the intifada, but also for the size of the international community intervention.

Using a number of financial, market, corporate governance, <b>macro-economic</b> and other <b>indicators</b> as explanatory variables, we compare classifiers ranging from conventional techniques (such as logit/probit and LDA) to fully nonlinear classifiers, including neural networks, support vector machines and more recent statistical learning techniques such as generalised boosting, AdaBoost and random forests. We find that the newer classifiers significantly outperform all other classifiers on both the cross sectional and longitudinal test samples; and prove remarkably robust to different data structures and assumptions. Simple linear classifiers such as logit/probit and LDA are found nonetheless to predict quite accurately on the test samples, in some cases performing comparably well to more flexible model structures. We conclude that simpler classifiers can be viable alternatives to more sophisticated approaches, particularly if interpretability is an important objective of the modelling exercise. We also suggest effective ways to enhance the predictive performance {{of many of the}} binary classifiers examined in this study...|$|R

We also use a simultaneous equation model with additional <b>macro-economic</b> and governance <b>indicators</b> as controls to see whether FDI and FMD are determined simultaneously and how these indicators affect this relationship. The causality tests provide evidence for bi-directional causality between FDI and banking sector development variables, while the relationship between FDI and stock market development variables {{seems to be more}} uni-directional, i. e. from FDI to FMD. The simultaneous equation model reveals an overall tendency towards a more uni-directional relationship from FDI to FMD, except for a bi-directional relationship between FDI inflows and credit provided by banks to the private sector. Overall, through the use of post- 2007 data, our findings add to previous research by tracking the change in overall trends in the FDI-FMD relationship since the global financial crisis. Moreover, our study finds some evidence that improving governance indicators like transparency, institutional efficiency and corruption can improve the development of financial markets in newly developing economies which in turn can be crucial in attracting further FDI inflows. This makes for a strong case for a policy that encourages focus on governance reforms in order to stimulate economic growth and promote financial sophistication in emerging economies...|$|R
