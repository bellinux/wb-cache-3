5|$|Anxiety {{reduction}} {{can reduce}} the unpleasantness of pain but is least effective for <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> severe pain. Since anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines and major tranquilizers add to sedation, they should only be used to address anxiety, depression, disturbed sleep or muscle spasm.|$|E
5|$|Findings on the {{frequency}} of each level of severity vary based on the definitions and methods used in studies. A World Health Organization study estimated that between 70 and 90% of head injuries that receive treatment are mild, and a US study found that <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> severe injuries each account for 10% of TBIs, with the rest mild.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe major {{purpose of}} this article is to expand the domain of the {{business}} research by providing conceptual analysis of the <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating variables and exploring their potent effects in business research. To provide specific implications, Kang et al. (2015) model with respect to Balanced Scorecard technique is conceptually extended. Theoretical foundation of the <b>moderating,</b> mediating, <b>and</b> their major distinctions along with appropriate statistical tests applicable to each situation are also provided. The model is also extended to analyzing interaction effects of Mediated-Moderation and Moderated-Mediation designs and their testing. The article concludes that: 1) the nature of complex business problems will be more transparently captured by considering <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating variables, 2) without specifying <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating variables, business models are incomplete and therefore are not able to solve real business obstacles. Lack of inclusion of <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating effects is one viable reason which indicates why most business models do not function in real practice, 3) <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> mediating variables are widening the scope of the prevalent business theories, <b>and</b> 4) <b>moderating</b> <b>and</b> <b>moderating</b> variables makes it possible to respond to the inquiries regarding “when” “how” and “why” a particular relationship exists between the independent and dependent variables. Hence, this study posits great impacts in future correlational and experimental studies in business...|$|R

In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, who they believed to be both a <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> federalist, to move against Lumumba's centralism and resolve the secession issue. Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance.|$|E

5|$|Letters backing John {{arrived from}} the Pope in April, but by then the rebel barons had {{organised}} into a military faction. They congregated at Northampton in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, marching on London, Lincoln, and Exeter. John's efforts to appear <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London, they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists. The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter, {{but this was not}} attractive to the rebels. Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, had been working with the rebel barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.|$|E

As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> {{calling for more}} violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Paul Tremo (1733/34–1810) was {{the head}} chef at the court of King Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski of Poland. He was born in Berlin, {{in a family of}} French Huguenots. As the king's {{favourite}} cook, he was responsible for the culinary side of royal banquets, including Thursday Dinners to which Stanislaus Augustus invited Warsaw's leading intellectuals. He followed the king to Saint Petersburg after the latter's abdication in 1795, but returned to Warsaw after his death in 1798. His cooking style combined Polish, French and other west European influences. As a mentor to aspirant Polish chefs and author of recipes which circulated in handwritten copies, he was instrumental in the development of modern Polish cuisine that was more <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> cosmopolitan than old Polish cookery.|$|E

5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to <b>moderate</b> <b>and</b> lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E

Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of bleeding. In that case, three months is sufficient.
