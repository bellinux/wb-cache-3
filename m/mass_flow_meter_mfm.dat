The differential measurement is achieved by fabricating two parallel, mechanically coupled micro-channels.

40|$|Abstract. The {{lower limit}} of the {{existing}} vortex <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> based on differential pressure is high.

This paper proposes a method using vortex <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> of dual bluff body based on differential pressure principle. The differential pressure signal between the upstream and downstream can be amplified by the vortex overlap caused by the dual bluff body structure. The results of the simulation by Fluent show that this method can reduce the lower limit of measurement, and improve the measurement sensitivity effectively...|$|R

40|$|In the {{capillary}} type thermal <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{the sensor}} {{is a small}} diameter stainless steel or constantan capillary, heated by an electric current. The heat is supplied either at the central point or over the whole length of the tube. In the absence of gas flow, the temperature profile is symmetric about the mid point. Gas flow through the capillary tube cools the entry section while heating the exit. This introduces an asymmetry in the temperature profile, which {{is a measure of}} the fluid flow rate. The asymmetry is measured in terms of difference of temperature between two suitably chosen points on the capillary tube, which are equidistant from the mid point on opposite sides. This temperature difference is a function of the direction and rate of <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> of the fluid. The focus of this dissertation is to experimentally characterize thermal <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> so as to properly understand their functioning, and to create an adequate knowledge base on the subject.
