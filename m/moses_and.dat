40|$|The role {{of dietary}} {{supplemental}} mannan oligosaccharide (<b>MOS)</b> <b>and</b> an essential oil blend (EOB) on performance of laying hens, and susceptibility of egg yolk and hen liver to lipid oxidation were examined. Four hundred and thirty-two 52 -week old Lohmann laying hens {{were divided into}} three groups and fed a basal diet containing no antioxidant as control (CNT), basal diet plus 1 g/kg <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> basal diet with 24 mg/kg EOB, for a 10 -week experimental period. Supplementation of diet with <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> EOB improved egg production rate and eggshell weight, but did not influence other performance or egg quality traits. <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> EOB provided higher antioxidant activity in egg yolk than the control regimen at all storage time periods. EOB also retained the oxidative stability of liver by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Liver antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathion peroxidase (GSH-Px), were higher in birds fed the additives. <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> EOB tended to increase serum glucose concentration (6. 2 % and 8. 8 %, respectively) while they slightly decreased triglycerides (11. 0 % and 4. 8 %, respectively) without affecting cholesterol level. Relative weight of pancreas and spleen were not affected by dietary treatments whereas diet supplemented with EOB significantly increased liver weight. The {{findings of this study}} suggest that EOB <b>and</b> <b>MOS</b> could act as free radical scavengers that enhance performance and also increase eggshell weight...|$|R

Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of <b>Moses</b> <b>and</b> the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E

5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them.

Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P.

40|$|A new physics-based {{model of}} leakage current {{suitable}} for <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> Flash memory gate oxide {{is presented in}} this paper. This model, which assumes the multi-Phonon Trap-Assisted Tunneling as conduction mechanism, calculates the total leakage current summing {{the contributions of the}} percolation paths formed by one or more aligned traps. Spatial positions and energetic levels of traps have been randomly generated within the oxide by a random number generator which has been integrated into the model. Using this model, statistical simulations of leakage currents measured from both <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> Flash EEPROM memory tunnel oxides have been carried out. In this way, experimental leakage current distributions can be directly reproduced, thus opening a wide range of useful applications in <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> Flash EEPROM memory reliability prediction...|$|R

The second criterion is the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) which measures the prediction monotonicity of an IQA approach. The last one is the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> the objective scores. We adopt the nonlinear regression proposed in [35].|$|R
5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new <b>Moses,</b> <b>and</b> the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E
5|$|On October27, 1934, the Meadowbrook and Lido Beach Loop causeways {{were opened}} to {{vehicular}} traffic by LISPC. A motorcade of cars was led across the new roadways by Robert Moses, then a Republican Party candidate for Governor of New York. The event {{was preceded by}} parades in Freeport and Rockville Centre. During a speech Moses cited praises to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for donating the money and letting the LISPC and Jones Beach State Parkway Authority do the work without interference. Other speakers that afternoon praised <b>Moses</b> <b>and</b> the LISPC, and New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia showed up late to give his congratulations. Despite the opening ceremony, two-way traffic was not permitted on the Meadowbrook between the Southern State and Merrick Road until June1, 1935.

Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, Commercial Street, {{and worked as a}} deliverer in the East End, then an impoverished ghetto where Yiddish was the predominant spoken language. Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the Aliens Act in 1905.|$|E

5|$|The company's {{repertory}} in the 1960s {{combined the}} standard operatic works and less familiar pieces. The five composers whose works were given most frequently were Verdi, Puccini, Wagner, Mozart and Richard Strauss; {{the next most}} performed composer was Britten. Rarities performed in the 1960s included operas by Handel and Janáček (neither composer's works being as common in the opera house then as now), and works by Gluck (Iphigénie en Tauride), Poulenc (The Carmelites), Ravel (L'heure espagnole) and Tippett (King Priam). There was also a celebrated production of Schoenberg's <b>Moses</b> <b>and</b> Aaron in the 1965–66 and 1966–67 seasons. In the mainstream repertoire, a highlight of the decade was Franco Zeffirelli's production of Tosca in 1964 with Callas, Renato Cioni and Gobbi. Among the guest conductors who appeared at Covent Garden during the 1960s were Otto Klemperer, Pierre Boulez, Claudio Abbado and Colin Davis. Guest singers included Jussi Björling, Mirella Freni, Sena Jurinac, Irmgard Seefried and Astrid Varnay.|$|E

40|$|International audience—Although high {{dynamic range}} (HDR) imaging has gained great {{popularity}} and acceptance in both the scientific and commercial domains, the relationship between perceptually accurate, content-independent dynamic range and objective measures has not been fully explored. In this paper, a new methodology for perceived dynamic range evaluation of complex stimuli in HDR conditions is proposed. A subjective study with 20 participants was conducted and correlations between mean opinion scores (<b>MOS)</b> <b>and</b> three image features were analyzed. Strong Spearman correlations between <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> objective DR measure <b>and</b> between <b>MOS</b> <b>and</b> image key were found. An exploratory analysis reveals that additional image characteristics should be considered when modeling perceptually-based dynamic range metrics.
