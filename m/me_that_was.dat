500|$|Northern Ireland Secretary of State Paul Murphy congratulated Tyrone {{on their}} victory. The Ulster Council of the GAA congratulated {{both sets of}} fans, in {{particular}} the Tyrone fans who formed a guard of honour for the Armagh players as they returned to their team bus. Joe Kernan, manager of Armagh, also praised the opposition fans: [...] "...when the final whistle went and all the Tyrone supporters came running past me there wasn't one bad word said. To <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> great." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} sessions, Higgs {{suffered from}} depression. He {{referred to the}} end of their 150-date tour as [...] "an out-of-the-sauna-and-into-a-cold-bath experience", adding that [...] "riding that low as well as trying to make a record was quite hard". He was affected by frequent mood swings {{as a result of his}} medication; Pritchard said that these [...] "affected [...] pretty adversely". Drummer, Michael Spearman, explained to Q that Higgs's attempt to channel his depression into his writing worried the rest of the group. At one point during writing sessions, Higgs presented his bandmates with [...] "Pigdog", a song about [...] "how [...] a horrible person and [...] want to be one any more". Spearman objected to this style: [...] "For <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a turning point. I was like, 'Let's make a record that’s energetic and fucked up and exciting.'" ...|$|E

500|$|According to Dave Mustaine, {{the band}} have {{encountered}} numerous mishaps and odd occurrences. In {{an interview with}} Terrorizer magazine, Mustaine, taking note of the connection to the unlucky number 13, explained [...] "This is our 13th studio record, and we've already {{had a bunch of}} weird things happen. Car problems, stuff disappearing, a guy who worked for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the most white-laced guy you could imagine falling out on drugs and disappearing... but this one's got me excited!" [...] In addition, Mustaine announced on Twitter that producer Johnny K was [...] "suddenly struck ill", and the band had ceased recording for the time being. However, the band resumed recording a few days later, with K having apparently recovered. In an interview, Drover had said nothing weird occurred until after he finished recording drum tracks for the album.|$|E
500|$|In December 2013, Disney began {{releasing}} [...] "Musical Magic Elsa and Anna Dolls", {{which played}} their signature songs {{that appear in}} the film. Numerous other doll versions of Elsa were released for purchase, including fashion doll sets, mini dolls, plush dolls, and Elsa-as-a-toddler dolls. A dress up costume for children was modeled after Elsa's ice gown along with gloves similar to ones she wears in the film. Together with Anna, she was depicted on various Frozen-inspired dishware such as plates and coffee mugs. Other Elsa-inspired merchandise includes luggage, nightgowns, and home décor. Additionally, simplified versions of the film were adapted to children's storybooks, including one with voice audio and another called A Sister More Like <b>Me</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> illustrated by Brittney Lee. Elsa and Anna also both appear as playable characters in Disney Infinity {{through the use of}} their corresponding figurines.|$|E
500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E

500|$|On 11 December 1980 Hodgson {{asked to}} see a priest, Father Frank Moran, to whom he confessed {{that he was having}} nightmares and the face of a woman he had killed [...] "kept coming back to him". He said that the murder had {{happened}} in Southampton the previous year and [...] "that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death". He repeated the confession to a prison officer the following day, and subsequently wrote a note which stated: [...] "After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish now that it was <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> dead and not the person I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. ... I did the murder, why I don't know. So all I can say is let justice be done".|$|E
500|$|During 1965, Dylan {{composed}} prose, poems, {{and songs}} by typing incessantly. Footage in Dont Look Back of Dylan in his suite at London's Savoy Hotel captures this process. However, Dylan told two interviewers that [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] {{began as a}} long piece of [...] "vomit" [...] (10 pages long according to one account, 20 according to another) that later acquired musical form. Dylan has never publicly spoken of writing any other major composition in this way. In an interview with CBC radio in Montreal, Dylan called {{the creation of the}} song a [...] "breakthrough", explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career. He said that he found himself writing [...] "this long piece of vomit, 20 pages long, and out of it I took 'Like a Rolling Stone' and made it as a single. And I'd never written anything like that before and it suddenly came to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> what I should do... After writing that I wasn't interested in writing a novel, or a play. I just had too much, I want to write songs." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{regional}} finals, Kentucky trailed top-seeded Duke by 12 {{in the second}} half, but battled back to force overtime. With 2.1 seconds left in overtime, Sean Woods hit a running bank shot to put Kentucky up one. Then, Duke's Christian Laettner caught a long inbounds pass, faked right, and hit {{a shot at the}} buzzer to give Duke the 104103 victory. The game, which ended Farmer's playing career, is widely {{regarded as one of the}} greatest college basketball games of all time. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski later recalled, [...] "The thing I'll always remember about that game is Richie Farmer's face as the ball went in. That, to me, helped me to have a better understanding of that game. ... To <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the deepest emotion that was on the court, the emotion that was on Richie Farmer's face." [...] Describing the impact of the game, Jerry Tipton wrote, [...] "On one fateful night, the Cats obliterated any lingering association with $1,000 packages and academic fraud. Alluring images of courage, honest effort and heartracing excitement became symbols of UK basketball." [...] Local media gave the seniors the nickname [...] "The Unforgettables". Collectively, they were voted as the Lexington Herald-Leaders 1992 Sportsmen of the Year.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} Obsessed was thought up by Clint Culpepper, {{president}} of Screen Gems, and was shared with David Loughery, {{who wrote the}} screenplay. Producer William Packer read the script and signed on; executive producers for the film were Glenn S. Gainor, Jeff Graup, Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson, Beyoncé, Mathew Knowles, Damon Lee and Loughery, while Nicholas Stern and George Flynn served as co-producer and associate producer, respectively. Director Steve Shill signed on after reading the script and hearing that Beyoncé was on board. Part of the reason Elba joined in was that the black–white theme was ignored; [...] "It's {{not mentioned in the}} film, it's never an issue, and I think that's phenomenal ... To <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> very refreshing that the studio execs didn't want to make an issue of it." [...] Obsessed was allocated a production budget of $20 million. Shill stated that the intended effect of the film was to have the audience discuss the characters' motivations. Writer David Loughery designed Lisa as [...] "not a villain in a traditional sense; she's not setting out to wreck a marriage or ruin somebody's life. She really believes that [...] is in love with her." [...] Lisa's past was deliberately omitted from the film, explaining, [...] "It's scarier if we never really know how she's developed this personality that can go from very loving to ultimately deadly." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I {{think it would be a}} lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." [...] Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens.|$|E

He then got into in the training program of the Directors Guild of America, which enabled him to work in television as an apprentice. He observed and worked for over a year on such shows as Gunsmoke, Wild Wild West, Bonanza and Warning Shot. [...] "I did a lot of shows for a couple of weeks, they would rotate you through," [...] he says.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his career as an entertainer, Jones' other first love was horses. Training as a jockey in his teens, Jones later said, [...] "I made one huge mistake.

Everyone makes mistakes in life and for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the biggest."

He and fellow prisoners survived the bombing while being held in a deep cellar of Schlachthof Fünf (Slaughterhouse 5). The narrator begins the story describing his connection to the fire-bombing of Dresden and his reasons for writing Slaughterhouse-Five.|$|E

Insurance concerns prevented McQueen from performing the film's notable motorcycle leap, which was done by his friend and fellow cycle enthusiast Bud Ekins, who resembled McQueen from a distance. When Johnny Carson later tried to congratulate McQueen for the jump during a broadcast of The Tonight Show, McQueen said, [...] "It wasn't <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> Bud Ekins."

2500|$|On the night, Labour's {{candidate}} Judith Tizard {{came within}} 406 votes {{of winning the}} traditionally National-held seat of Remuera; she had been forecast as the winner by initial vote counting. Tizard's near-win fueled Lange's misgivings about the direction his government was taking. He commented, [...] "That election night was a great revelation for <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> an apprehension on my part that we had actually abandoned our constituency. And it set me to think what on earth have we done that we come within 400 votes of winning the true-blue seat of Remuera. And that struck me as being a dangerous flirtation, and an act of treachery to the people we were born to represent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did that while I {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I knew that that was the ending because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> one of the last straws for me, because nobody had said anything to me, and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. So I knew that was it." ...|$|E
