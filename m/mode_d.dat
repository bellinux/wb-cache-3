40|$|The MOMS- 2 P sensor (Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral Stereo Scanner) is a German {{stereo camera}} {{mounted on the}} PRIRODA module of the Russian space station MIR. Its main new feature was the {{along-track}} three-fold stereo capability. It delivered approx. 65 million km 2 of high quality and high resolution (approx. 18 m ground resolution) imagery from 1996 to 1999, which is still subject of ongoing image processing to generate digital elevation models and orthoimages throughout the entire world. The three-fold along-track stereo principle and multispectral capabilities of the MOMS- 2 P sensor were highly advantageous for digital elevation model (DEM) generation compared to other satellite systems in orbit. The majority of all data takes of MOMS- 2 P were imaged in <b>Mode</b> <b>D,</b> which {{is a combination of}} the two inclined stereo and two nadir looking multispectral channels (blue and near-infrared) with a swath width of approx. 100 km and a ground resolution of 18 m.

This paper describes the latest processing experience in generating high quality digital surface models and orthoimages from MOMS- 2 P stereo data at DLR. The steps of the processing chain are shortly explained. It is shown that self-calibration via bundle block adjustment is necessary.

40|$|LHCb is the {{dedicated}} B physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It will make precision measurements of CP violating {{effects in the}} Bd and Bs systems, as well as making precision measurements of the lifetimes of all flavours of B hadrons. In this thesis, two possible measurements of the CKM angle gamma are evaluated:from the decay <b>mode</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+, and from the combined analysis of the decay <b>modes</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+ and B 0 s -> D-s K+ under the conditions of U-spin symmetry. Also, a Monte Carlo independent method of measuring the lifetimes of B hadrons is described. The reconstruction of the decay <b>mode</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+ is studied using the LHCb simulation software, and a general method for categorising background at LHCb is developed. The decay <b>mode</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+ is {{found to have a}} yearly yield of 1340 k events, and a signal to background ratio of ~ 5. It is shown that the analysis of time dependent decay rate asymmetries in B 0 d -> D- pi+ can result in a precision of ~ 8 degrees on gamma after one year of data taking. The combined extraction of gamma from the decay <b>modes</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+ and B 0 s -> D-s K+ is seen to allow an unambiguous extraction of gamma, with a precision of a few degrees after one year of data taking. The LHCb trigger uses the lifetime of reconstructed particles to discriminate between signal and background, and therefore introduces a bias in the lifetime distributions of B h adrons. A method for measuring this bias, and hence the lifetimes of B hadrons, without recourse to Monte Carlo information, is developed. This method can be applied to any decay mode reconstructed at LHCb which is expected to suffer from a lifetime bias, in particular hadronic decay channels. It is shown that LHCb can expect to match the current world average precision on the B 0 s lifetime with a few weeks of data taking in the decay mode B 0 s -> D-s pi+, while the world average precision on the B 0 d lifetime can be matched with a few months of data taking in the decay <b>mode</b> B 0 <b>d</b> -> D- pi+...|$|R
