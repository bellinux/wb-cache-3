40|$|We live in {{a complex}} world and <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> {{organizations}} are constantly facing numerous challenges. Good decisions, i. e., better outcomes for organizations, require use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powerful discipline Operational Research (OR) /Management Science (MS). Organizations applying this discipline have achieved significant benefits such as cost reduction, increased revenues, increased market share, higher quality, improved productivity, improved performance, better customer service, etc. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this paper is to}} examine whether <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in Macedonia use OR models for supporting decision-making processes, where OR models, methods and techniques are commonly used, and what benefits achieved in using quantitative OR models, methods and techniques. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire distributed electronically to 100 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> micro, 100 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> small and 100 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> medium-sized enterprises. <b>The</b> questionnaires were answered completely by 93 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> micro, 73 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small and 71 <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium-sized enterprises, and the questionnaire responses were subsequently analyzed. The answers showed that decisions on running enterprises are made intuitively by 90 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> micro, 78 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small, and 55 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium-sized enterprises, while quantitative OR models for supporting the decision-making process are used by 10 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> micro, 22 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small, and 45 % <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium-sized enterprises. Applied in the micro, small and medium-sized enterprises are inventory models, time series analysis and forecasting, whereas micro and medium-sized enterprises rely on decision analysis. Small and medium-sized enterprises use break-even analysis, assignation, linear programming, and project management. The OR models and methods used in running the respective enterprises led to the following results: optimal inventory level, cost reductions, revenue growth, forecasted sales, increased sales, production optimization, improved quality, better planning of activities, more efficient allocation of staff, absence of complaints and increased customers satisfaction...|$|R
