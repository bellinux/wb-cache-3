5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic to {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs. A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of pure substance.

Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E
5|$|Various legal {{definitions}} of beer exist in different countries. Historically, {{the most famous}} of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must have less than 25% ABV, which means {{that it has to be}} 25 <b>mL</b> <b>of</b> alcohol or less per 100 <b>mL</b> <b>of</b> solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, hops, and starches (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process. In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by volume concentration at 20°C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like malt, sugars or its equivalent, and hops or other vegetables.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{heterogenous}} {{strains of}} soil borne haploid infective propagules (allantoid sporidia) of Tilletia indica causing Karnal bunt (KB) disease of wheat fuse obligatory in pairs on flower surfaces to establish infection in developing host ovaries. Artificial infection assays using paired monosporidial lines (MLs) {{in the form}} of sporulating mycelia raised from haploid allantoid sporidia isolated from teliospores collected from various places in the states of north west India revealed 8 mating types (self incompatibility alleles) in this heterothallic fungal pathogen <b>of</b> wheat. <b>MLs</b> <b>of</b> Haryana and Punjab showed presence of three types of common mating alleles of which only two were noticed in samples of Delhi and Himachal Pradesh. The fourth and fifth alleles traced respectively in <b>MLs</b> <b>of</b> Haryana and Punjab were different from the rest three present in these states. Three alleles conjectured in <b>MLs</b> <b>of</b> Uttranchal were quite different from all five reported above. Representative <b>MLs</b> <b>of</b> 8 alleles when paired in all possible combinations and inoculated on a set of differential lines produced host – pathogen – interaction matrices of 6 distinct pathotypes.

The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (<b>ml)</b> <b>of</b> oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans.

40|$|A {{search for}} novel {{materials}} for making multilayers of high reflectivity {{has been driven}} by the vigorous demand towards miniaturizing photonics. A typical consumer of high performance multilayers (MLs) is the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) based on the 13. 5 nm laser produced plasma (LPP) source. To sustain “Moore’s law” and print fine features below 10 nm on integrated circuits (IC), source of radiation for the EUVL has to shift towards even shorter wavelengths where 6. x nm wavelength seems to be immediate successor. However, the 6. x nm EUV lithography needs <b>MLs</b> <b>of</b> reflectivity performance above 70 % to support high volume manufacturing (HVM). It is clear that more work is required particularly on the development <b>of</b> <b>MLs</b> with high reflectance, stable to thermal heat and sufficient lifetime. In this work new <b>MLs</b> <b>of</b> B 4 C/CeO 2 are deposited, analyzed and characterized for the first time. Combinations of X-ray reflectometry (XRR) and EUV reflectance measurements near resonance edge of boron are analyzed to derive structural and optical parameters <b>of</b> <b>MLs.</b> <b>ML</b> coatings <b>of</b> B 4 C/CeO 2 MLs have shown similar reflectance performance with the leading candidate MLs around 6. x nm wavelength.

25|$|Calcium (calcium {{chloride}} or calcium gluconate) increases {{threshold potential}} through a mechanism {{that is still}} unclear, thus restoring normal gradient between threshold potential and resting membrane potential, which is elevated abnormally in hyperkalemia.
