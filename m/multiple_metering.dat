40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} hydraulically actuated machine system performance, valves with high performance bandwidths and large flow rates at low pressure drops are needed. While high flow rates were previously achieved using either very large spool strokes and/or diameters that would hinder valve performance, research is underway on a valve incorporating the Ho¨rbiger plate principle.

40|$|In {{order to}} expand the {{operational}} capabilities of hydraulically actuated systems {{the development of new}} valves to allow of enhanced flow rates and bandwidth performance is required. Previously, the technical challenge in developing such valves was the need for large spool strokes to achieve the desired flow rates.

To increase flow without reducing dynamic performance it is proposed that the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>metering</b> edges is appropriate. This is achievable using the Horbiger plate valve principle and direct connection to a piezoelectric actuator. This paper examines the design criteria associated with such a valve. Simulations undertaken as part of its construction and design show that improved flow rates can be achieved.

Finally a simulation was undertaken to determine the total forces acting on the valve, and the forces on the piezoactuator were found to be compressive under normal conditions, which should lead to predictable and stable operation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of hydraulically actuated machine systems {{could be improved}} {{with the use of}} valves that have high bandwidth and high flowrates under low pressure drops. Although high flowrates can be achieved using very large spool strokes and/or diameters, the overall bandwidth of the valve will be reduced. Research has therefore been undertaken on a prototype valve design incorporating the Hörbiger plate principle, which utilizes <b>multiple</b> <b>metering</b> edges to allow high flowrates to be obtained at low pressure drops and small poppet displacements. The valve is directly activated using a piezoelectric actuator to achieve a fast dynamic response. Valve performance is assessed using a mathematical model that includes the piezoelectric actuator and power amplifier, the supply flow, fluid squeeze forces, end stop response, and valve mechanical components. The steady state relationship between valve flow, force and pressure drop, and the fluid inertance, were determined using computational fluid dynamics software. The simulation model has been validated using test data obtained from experimental tests undertaken on a prototype valve. Good agreement is obtained between the predicted and measured results and it is shown that the valve is capable of opening or closing fully in less than 1. 5 ms, and can pass a flow of 65 l/min at a pressure drop of 20 bar...|$|E
30|$|This study {{installed}} {{and tested}} communal prepaid metering for its suitability to improve water service provision among urban poor communities. Water metering is a management tool in water supply. It {{is used by the}} service providers to quantify water bills, for leak detection, monitoring water demand and plan for supply, among others (Maddaus 2001). Many water metering technologies and models have been reported in literature. Van Zyl (2011) described different types of water meters and where they are often used. These meters also have some impact on the type of water meter management in terms of meter reading and water billing. As such, there are now meters that allow automatic reading and telemetric submissions to a central location and those that require a meter reader to periodically walk to the meter and collect the readings (Marais et al. 2016). There also those that are pre-loaded to allow water-use up to the loaded limit (Gambe 2015). Flat rate billing is another approach that is often used in places with <b>multiple</b> <b>metering</b> problems (Bakker 2001). Each of these water metering models have own potential and challenges especially when applied to urban poor areas. For the challenges, {{there is a lot of}} literature on issues like non-revenue water, high cost of water per unit volume, frequent outages in water supply, billing inaccuracies, among others (Chepyegon and Kamiya 2018).|$|E

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration's Next Generation Air Transportation System will combine {{advanced}} {{air traffic}} management technologies, performance-based procedures, and state-of-the-art avionics to maintain efficient operations throughout the entire arrival phase of flight. Flight deck Interval Management (FIM) operations are expected to use sophisticated airborne spacing capabilities to meet precise in-trail spacing from top-of-descent to touchdown. Recent human-in-the-loop simulations by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have found that selection of the assigned spacing goal using the runway schedule can lead to premature interruptions of the FIM operation during periods of high traffic demand. This study compares three methods for calculating the assigned spacing goal for a FIM operation that is also subject to time-based metering constraints. The particular paradigms investigated include: one based upon the desired runway spacing interval, one based upon the desired meter fix spacing interval, and a composite method that combines both intervals. These three paradigms are evaluated for the primary arrival procedures to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport using the entire set of Rapid Update Cycle wind forecasts from 2011. For typical meter fix and runway spacing intervals, the runway- and meter fix-based paradigms exhibit moderate FIM interruption rates due to their inability to consider <b>multiple</b> <b>metering</b> constraints. The addition of larger separation buffers decreases the FIM interruption rate but also significantly reduces the achievable runway throughput. The composite paradigm causes no FIM interruptions, and maintains higher runway throughput more often than the other paradigms. A key implication of the results with respect to time-based metering is that FIM operations using a single assigned spacing goal will not allow reduction of the arrival schedule's excess spacing buffer. Alternative solutions for conducting the FIM operation in a manner more compatible with the arrival schedule are discussed in detail...|$|E

Specifically, it aims to compare and contrast the definition of geographical boundaries among different CNEM models and examine the benefits and limitations of each approach.

The {{goal is to}} detect the occurrence of disturbances in the nominal sinusoidal voltage/current signal {{as quickly as possible}} such that protection measures can be taken in time.

The proposed multi-meter scheme features substantially low communication overhead, while its performance is close to that of the ideal case where distributed meter readings are perfectly available at the central meter...|$|R

The preferred environmental conditions and other details of the process depend on the choice of polymer and substrate material and on the shape and size of the membrane to be cast. Once the polymer has dried to a membrane, it is cured with convective heating, then released. Membranes with root-mean-square surface roughnesses of less than 10. 5 can be produced routinely by this method.

The WET Labs ac- 9 is a recently developed in situ absorption and attenuation meter with a precision better than ± 0. 001 m⁻¹ in the raw signal, which is sufficient to make these measurements in pristine samples. Whereas the superior sensitivity of the ac- 9 has been well documented, the accuracy of in situ measurements for bio-optical applications has not been rigorously evaluated. Obtaining accurate results with an ac- 9 requires careful attention to calibration procedures because baselines drift {{as a result of}} the changing optical properties of several ac- 9 components.
