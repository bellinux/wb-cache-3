5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} <b>multiplier</b> <b>onion</b> cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E
50|$|The {{potato onion}} (also known as <b>multiplier</b> <b>onion)</b> is {{a variety of}} the Aggregatum Group of Allium cepa, similar to the shallot, {{although}} producing larger bulbs. It is remarkably easy to grow, keeps better {{than almost any other}} variety of onion, and is ideal for the home gardener with restricted space. It was very popular in the past, but--like many old varieties--it has been passed over in favor of types more suitable for mechanical harvesting and mass marketing.|$|E

5|$|This group {{contains}} {{shallots and}} potato onions, {{also referred to}} as <b>multiplier</b> <b>onions.</b> The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} six fungal species were {{isolated}} from soil samples. Among the six species Glomus fasiculatum and Gigaspora marigarita noted in dominant level. So both {{are used as}} bioinoculant and were mass <b>multiplied</b> in <b>onion</b> plant by pot culture. After pot culture, biochemical and antibacterial activity were analysed from the treated plant Solanum surattense. In the phytochemical analysis falvonoids, tannins, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides and saponins were noted. Antibacterial activity of ethanolic extract of Solanum surattense against clinical isolates were analyzed and show the more activity noted in K. pneumoniae when compared with Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogens, E. coli respectively...|$|R
