40|$|Abstract: Metropolitan {{areas in}} the {{developing}} world face a pressing need for policy tools to evaluate urban development strategies. This need, placed within the context of fiscal restraint, sustainable development, and public administrative regimes, has kindled an interest in the use of “integrated urban models ” (IUM) that explicitly consider urban transportation and land use interactions. While the development and use of these models has helped science to better understand urban processes, they can only be useful to society as a whole if used to inform policy making and analysis. The objective {{of this paper is to}} put into perspective the necessary conditions for the formulation of an IUM useful for policy and planning in developing countries taking the case of Metro <b>Manila.</b> The <b>paper</b> frames the steps needed for development and application of a model of this type in the area...|$|R

Bare {{moved with}} his wife to Spang's Mill in 1864 after having {{purchased}} the 90 acre [...] "Mill Seat Tract" [...] with his father, a farmer from Sinking Valley in Blair County, north of Altoona. Attracted to the location because of the spring's dependable flow and superior water quality, Bare initially operated the gristmill and general store. He built the first paper mill in 1866 with two partners, John Eby and John Morrison, but a disastrous fire destroyed the wood-frame building just after its completion. The three men rebuilt on the site almost immediately, and by 1867 were in business again, establishing a trade in low-grade paper made from rag, gunny sacking and straw. Through {{the rest of the}} 19th century, the mill evolved from a maker of <b>manila</b> wrapping <b>paper</b> and newspaper to a manufacturer of fine bond by the late 1930s.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} increase in private sector participation (PSP) in the urban water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector in recent years. However, even with increased PSP, public authorities will still have to: ensure that the service providers do not use their market power to exploit customers; internalise public health and environmental externalities; provide mechanisms whereby water consumption is sustainable and is allocated efficiently between alternative uses; and, serve as a guarantor of a level of service provision which is consistent with a basic standard of living. While there is considerable literature addressing the first of these four issues, the latter three are less adequately addressed.

40|$|Paper Presentation at 9 th International Conference on Catholic Social Thought and Business Education Prosperity, Poverty and the Purpose of Business: Rediscovering Integral Human Development in the Catholic Social Tradition February 26 - 28, 2015, <b>Manila</b> PhilippinesThis <b>paper</b> {{argues that}} the view of {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) as advanced in management theory and practice is flawed due to its theoretical underpinnings in individualism, a position which upholds {{the primacy of the}} individual and provides legitimacy to individuals’ active pursuit of self-interest to the detriment of society. This view, however, significantly diverges from CSR perspectives which prescribe the duty and obligation inherent in every member of society to contribute to the promotion of the common good. This paper therefore suggests the need for an alternative model and presents the view of CSR advanced by Catholic social teaching (CST) as a more comprehensive and coherent framework to correctly articulate the relations between business and society, and the consequent duty of business to contribute toward promotion of the common good. The paper also offers a critique of some CSR practices which it considers unacceptable from the perspective of CST...|$|R
40|$|Public {{spaces in}} cities often contain mixed land uses and activities, which render its {{surrounding}} streetscapes a coveted location for different stakeholders. The significance of streets shapes {{an array of}} socio-spatial relations among various players in the area. In the urban global South, informal street vending contributes {{to the complexity of}} socio-spatial interactions. In many cases, vendors’ presence generates hostile treatment from governments, which see hawkers as an obstruction. Often, state authorities resort to evictions to keep vendors off strategic streets and sidewalks. Viewed as a legitimate government apparatus to impose order, evictions target practices and players that are seen to disrupt a neat and regimented system of urban existence. When street hawkers resist, evictions typically result in violence and other conflictive encounters. Beyond the usual conflict-oriented framing, however, this paper illustrates how evictions serve as a critical engagement arena between the state and street vendors. By examining eviction episodes in one informal vending district in Metropolitan <b>Manila,</b> the <b>paper</b> underscores the value of locating grassroots collective action, self-help mechanisms, and state engagement as embedded in the continuing struggle for access to contested public spaces and the power relations in urban centres...|$|R

40|$|In urban Philippines, the {{percentage}} of persons with disability (PWDs) participating in various government and nongovernment programs is low. In fact, the level of awareness among PWDs on the policies that intend to uplift their well-being is also low. These {{were some of the}} findings of a 2008 survey on persons with disability in selected cities in Metro <b>Manila.</b> This <b>paper</b> therefore aims to examine this problem by looking at the various factors that influence the PWD`s participation specifically in the government-mandated discount on fare on bus and other land transportation vehicles and medical services. Interestingly, it focuses on the role of social networks among PWD, environmental constraints, and the type of disability the person has. Interestingly, because participation is conditional on awareness and eligibility, this paper likewise looks into variables that are associated with awareness and eligibility. The goal is to identify areas of potential gaps in terms of information dissemination, implementation, and enforcement so that PWDs can fully benefit from the policies and programs intended for them.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, many Southeast Asian cities {{underwent}} unprecedented growth {{that has led to}} the degradation of their urban traffic situations. Increases in the ownership and use of motor vehicles led to massive road building programmes adding on to the resultant deterioration in the quality of life within major capital cities. Based on official transport studies which have been completed for both Kuala Lumpur and <b>Manila,</b> this <b>paper</b> aims to compare urban transport characteristics, land use disposition and policies advocated in both Metro Manila and Kuala Lumpur. It is found that both cities attempt to manage their liveability challenge by implementing a public transportation system (the LRT) that could help satisfy increased travel demand and alleviate transport congestion in the cities, and by seeking to develop areas outside the city centres so that they will decrease the need to obtain employment and other urban services in the city centres. The goal of easing traffic congestion by enhancing the public transport modes has not been very successful because of the strong, non-rational value attached to private car ownership. The paper concludes that attitudinal rather than physical change is the real challenge to the management of liveability in the two Southeast Asian Citie...|$|R

It was shown that the current land use patterns largely differ depending on the existence of agricultural infrastructure development in the pre-urbanized stage. It was also confirmed by a GPS-based travel survey that travel behavior patterns in scattered development areas are significantly different from those in orderly development areas. The former areas lack not only road space but also a structured hierarchy of networks, resulting in inefficient travel behaviors with low speed and detours. The GPS survey gave clearer pictures to grasp the relationship between travel patterns of residents and their demand for the improvement of local transport services.
