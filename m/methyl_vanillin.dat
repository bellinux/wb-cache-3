Four hundred sixty-seven male Euglossini bees were captured, distributed in 4 genus and 19 species. Euglossa was the most abundant and with high diversity (302 specimens and 14 species), followed by Eulaema (121; 3), Eufriesea (41; 1), and Exaerete (3; 1). The species which more frequently visited the bait were Euglossa piliventris (141 specimens; 30. 19 %), Euglossa cingulata (113; 24. 21 %), Euglossa ignita (45; 9. 64 %), Eufriesea pulchra (41; 8. 78 %), and Euglossa gaianii (33; 7. 07 %) corresponding to 79. 88 % of the sampling universe.

Euglossine bees are important pollinators in forests and agricultural areas. Although the structure of their communities is critically affected by anthropogenic disturbances, {{little is known about}} these bees in small forest fragments. The objectives of this study were to analyze the composition, abundance, and diversity of euglossine bee species in nine small fragments of different phytophysiognomies of the Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil, and to identify the environmental variables that {{may be related to the}} species composition of these communities. Males were sampled quarterly from May 2007 to May 2009 with aromatic traps containing <b>methyl</b> cinnamate, <b>vanillin,</b> eucalyptol, benzyl acetate, and methyl salicylate. A total of 1558 males, belonging to 10 species and three genera of Euglossina were collected. The richness ranged from five to seven species per fragment. Euglossa cordata, E. securigera, Eulaema nigrita e E. cingulata were common to all fragments studied. The diversity differed significantly among areas, ranging from H' = 1. 04 to H' = 1. 65. The precipitation, phytophysiognomy, and altitude had the highest relative importance over the species composition variation. The results presented in this study demonstrate that small forest fragments are able to support populations of euglossine bee species, most of which are widely distributed and reportedly tolerant to open and/or disturbed areas and suggest that the conservation of such areas is important, particularly in areas that are regenerating and in regions with agricultural matrices where these bees can act as important pollinator...|$|R

We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify 12 abundant compounds in the floral headspace from two inbred lines of C. breweri. These volatiles are derived from two biochemical pathways, one producing acyclic monoterpenes and their oxides, the other leading from phenylalanine to benzoate and its derivatives. Linalool and linalool oxide (pyran form) were the most abundant monoterpenoids, while linalool oxide (furan form) was present at lower concentrations.

This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of two groups of molecules in wine, enolones and vanillines. Both types of molecules present a common characteristic, their great polarity. Sotolon, maltol, furaneol and homofuraneol belong to the first group. Their chemical structures present certain similarity among them, which leads to similar physicochemical and olfactory properties. This group of compounds is described with the terms “burnt sugar, candy sugar, caramel and maple”. Sotolon and furaneol are the most powerful aromatic molecules within them, being their odor thresholds estimated in water‐ethanol matrix around 5 μg/L [1, 2].

40|$|Abstract The fauna of Euglossini bees {{is poorly}} known in savanna regions, making it {{difficult}} to understand how these bees use open vegetation environments. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of landscape structure on species abundance and composition of Euglossini bees in naturally heterogeneous savanna landscapes. Nine sites were sampled monthly using six traps with chemical baits. Three aromatic essences (eucalyptol, <b>methyl</b> salicylate and <b>vanillin)</b> were used to attract the Euglossini. Surrounding environmental conditions were measured using three independent variables, calculated in multiple scales: index of local vegetation and two landscape indices (Shannon Diversity and area-weighted shape). We compared the competing hypotheses through model selection based on Second-order Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). The four competing hypothesis were: (1) The local vegetation complexity favors Euglossini bees species richness and/or abundance (local vegetation hypothesis); (2) The proportion of the native vegetation types favors Euglossini bees species richness and/or abundance (habitat amount hypothesis); (3) Higher landscape diversity shall increase species richness of Euglossini bees (landscape heterogeneity hypothesis); (4) More complex landscape configuration shall favor the Euglossini bees richness and/or abundance (landscape heterogeneity hypothesis). We sampled 647 individuals belonging to six species of two distinct genera. Our results support the habitat amount hypothesis since bees&# 8217; abundance was strongly related with the proportion of habitat in the surrounding landscape. This may be related to the availability of floral and nesting resources in some types of savanna vegetation...|$|R

The tissue culture technique started with sterilization method by using different combinations of fungicide, alcohol and commercial bleach. Then, the vanilla explants undergone gamma radiation (0 Gy, 10 Gy, 20 Gy, 30 Gy) and planted in different concentrations of methyl jasmonate (0 μM, 10 μM, 20 μM, 40 μM, 80 μM). The ten weeks vanilla cultures were harvested and their shoot height, leaf number, root length and root number were measured and analyzed using ANOVA (SPSS 18). Then the vanilla explants were oven dried at 40 °C, ground and soaked in methanol for 48 hours. GC-MS analysis was done to the ten vanilla cultures with highest shoot length. The results showed that 1 % fungicide, 10 % commercial bleach and 70 % alcohol were the best combination to sterilize vanilla explants without harming the explants. The gamma radiation results showed that 10 Gy gamma irradiated vanilla culture had the highest regeneration of vanilla, shoot height was 13. 40 ± 0. 33 cm, while 30 Gy gamma irradiated cultures showed the lowest. Ten Gy gamma irradiated culture be higher regeneration in 20 μM methyl jasmonate, shoot height of 14. 5 ± 0. 4 cm, compared to other methyl jasmonate concentrations. This may due to the enhancement of photosynthesis and metabolites that was promoted by gamma ray and jasmonic acids inside the mesophyll cells of vanilla explants. The GC-MS analysis showed higher production of acetovanillone and ethyl vanillyl <b>methyl,</b> derivatives of <b>vanillin</b> in 10 Gy irradiated cultures as well as other metabolites such as phenols, fatty acids and siloxanes.

40|$|It is {{important}} to know how tobacco additives behave when cigarettes are smoked, whether they transfer intact to the smoke or whether there is any decomposition during smoking. Pyrolysis-GC-MS is a technique that can be focussed upon the effects of combustion from a single material free from interference from the complex mixture of different components present in the smoke. However, because pyrolysis is a model technique, the results need to be validated by comparison with cigarette smoke chemistry. In a previous paper we presented such a method for modelling the smoke chemistry from a burning cigarette using pyrolysis-GC-MS. The transfer and the extent of degradation of anisole, p-anisaldehyde, benzaldehyde, isoamylisovalerate, <b>methyl</b> trans-cinnamate and <b>vanillin</b> within a burning cigarette were estimated using this pyrolysis method. When these data were compared with results from smoke studies from 14 C-analogues of the materials, the high levels of transfer predicted by pyrolysis were found to be generally consistent with the smoke chemistry data. However, there were still two outstanding issues. Firstly, there was some ambiguity in the labelled study about whether vanillin actually transferred without degradation or not. Furthermore, the results from the 14 C-labelled study showed a greater extent of degradation for p-anisaldehyde than that indicated from the pyrolysis experiments. The purpose of the current study was to present some new information obtained to address these questions by better understanding the effect upon the smoke chemistry from adding vanillin and p-anisaldehyde, and the relationship between the smoke chemistry and the pyrolysis results. Components were identified in the smoke from cigarettes loaded with p-anisaldehyde and vanillin labelled with 18 O and 13 C. The extent of degradation from each additive was estimated by identifying labelled degradation products in the smoke. Because there was a clear distinction between the mass spectra from the labelled compounds and their natural counterparts, the major degradation products from the labelled compounds could be readily identified in the chromatograms of the corresponding smoke extracts. Evidence of some degradation at above the transfer temperature was indicated for both additives. The amount of degradation was found to be less than 1 % for p-anisaldehyde and only 0. 1 % for vanillin. This low level of degradation was acceptably consistent with the intact transfer values of 97 % and 100 %, respectively, obtained by pyrolysis...|$|R

Porém entre os anos de 1993 e 2000, um total de 946 fêmeas de Megalopta foram capturadas (machos não foram capturados) usando iscas aromáticas frequentemente usadas para atração de machos de Euglossini, em cinco localidades na região de Bauru, São Paulo, Brasil. Os compostos aromáticos utilizados foram: acetato de benzila, eucaliptol, eugenol, escatol, salicilato de metila e vanilina. As espécies encontradas foram M. guimaraesi (71. 2 % do total de indivíduos), M. amoena (28. 1 %) and M. aegis (0. 6 %). De modo geral, os resultados mostraram correlação positiva e significativa entre a abundância de indivíduos e os fatores meteorológicos considerados - precipitação pluviométrica e temperatura. As abelhas foram geralmente capturadas em maior número na primavera e verão e raramente no outono e inverno, período mais seco e frio. Variações na abundância também foram detectadas entre as localidades e entre os anos estudados. As substâncias mais atrativas foram: eugenol (54 %), salicilato de metila (22 %) e eucaliptol (16 %). A capacidade de detectar cheiros pode ter um importante papel na busca por flores em condições crepusculares. Sugerimos o uso destes compostos aromáticos em pesquisas futuras sobre a biologia de Megalopta na região Neotropical...|$|R
