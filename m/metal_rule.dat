5000|$|Critic {{and author}} Martin Popoff was very {{complimentary}} toward the album, {{calling it a}} [...] "strangely irresistible yet measured flood of fresh, catchy, creative, NWOBHM-ish ideas that draw you {{to the conclusion that}} with a pile of work, this is the next Led Zeppelin." [...] Peter Makowski of Classic Rock writes that [...] "the whole concept screams box office disaster, but somehow it works" [...] and [...] "at its best" [...] the album [...] " [...] sounds like a tasty hybrid of Dio circa Rainbow, Iron Maiden, and early Metallica with a touch of Manowar." [...] <b>Metal</b> <b>Rules</b> highly recommends the album, with the review highlighting the unusual composition of the songs and the use of a 70s sound [...] "blended with some Power Metal and (...) lots of instrumentation, orchestrations and long arrangements." ...|$|R
5000|$|Venereology was {{my first}} release on a death metal label. So, my target was [...] "death metal" [...] itself. I used more serious dead visuals than on the usual death metal albums. For me, it's like J. P. Witkin or J. G. Ballard. The rhythm in Venereology was a little slower than in my past releases, but more heavy. Also, the tone of Venereology was lots of overlevels and dirty sound. It's {{important}} to know that I made Venereology while drinking lots of beer. These essences are all influenced by death metal. But not musically. I liked something more extreme than the death <b>metal</b> <b>rules.</b> Masami Akita Akita then explained that his next album for Relapse, Pulse Demon, was back to his normal sound and was recorded sober.|$|R

5000|$|Critics Paul Schwarz and EvilG {{mentioned}} that the sounds resembles to the Carcass album Heartwork. Schwarz mentions and compares again Black Earth: [...] "Opener [...] "Beast of Man" [...] kicks in with searing riffing and thundering double bass, which creates the false impression that the new material will be far more like the Heartwork era Carcass sound which characterised much of Black Earth. Arch Enemy have, in fact, gone the opposite way - in terms of heaviness, not quality -, and produced an album which utilises far more melody, especially in its choruses, than BE did." [...] EvilG of <b>Metal</b> <b>Rules</b> praises writing that [...] "I think the reason why this CD is so great {{is that it has}} re-captured the Carcass Heartwork sound and feel {{while at the same time}} incorporating more melody and even some power metal sounds." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Zdeněk P.

They found that the available video records are {{not consistent with the}} free fall hypothesis, that the size of the concrete particles is consistent with comminution caused by impact, and that the high velocity of compressed air explains why material from the towers were ejected to a distance of several hundred meters from the tower. The authors conclude that the allegations of controlled demolition do not have any scientific merit. A spokesman for NIST said that any sightings of molten metal, including metal seen pouring from the South tower, were likely molten aluminum from the airplane, an explanation disputed by Richard Gage who stated that the color of the molten <b>metal</b> <b>rules</b> out aluminum.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{we focus on the}} z∼ 6. 6 Lyman-α CR 7 {{consisting}} of clump A that is host to a potential direct collapse black hole (DCBH), and two metal enriched star forming clumps B and C. In contrast to claims that signatures of <b>metals</b> <b>rule</b> out the existence of DCBHs, we show that metal pollution of A from star forming clumps clumps B and C is inevitable, and that A can form a DCBH well before its metallicity exceeds the critical threshold of 10 ^- 5 - 10 ^- 6 Z_. Assuming metal mixing happens instantaneously, we derive the metallicity of A based on the star formation history of B and C. We find that treating a final accreting black hole of 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 7 M_ in A for nebular emission already pushes its H_ 160 - [3. 6] and [3. 6]-[4. 5] colours into the 3 σ limit of observations. Hence, we show that the presence of metals in DCBH hosts is inevitable, and that it is the coevolution of the LW radiation field and metals originating from neighbouring galaxies that governs DCBH formation in a neighbouring initially pristine atomic cooling haloes.
