5|$|Darren Craig {{directed}} the song's music video, which Candy envisioned as a satire on political and socioeconomic repression {{of women and}} <b>misogyny.</b> In the video, Candy appears {{with a group of}} oppressed women who rise up against a tyrannical man and shoot him with golden rifles. The visual attracted critical attention from media commentators, who discussed the possible inspirations for the women and the setting. Critics positively responded to the music video, complimenting it as vibrant and outrageous.|$|E
5|$|Motivated by Jyoti's {{rape and}} murder, Ram Devineni, Lina Srivastava, and Dan Goldman {{released}} {{the comic book}} Priya's Shakti. The storyline of the comic focuses on Priya, a human woman and ardent devotee of the Goddess Parvati, who has experienced a brutal rape and the social stigma and isolation resulting from it. Inspired by the goddess, Priya fights against gender-based sexual violence in India and around the world, supporting the movement against patriarchy and <b>misogyny.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of the 23rd June 2010, with the support of a posse of faceless men, Julia Gillard deposed the sitting Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd. Gillard {{reportedly}} told Senator Kim Carr that we are sleepwalking to defeat. With the event occurring in the evening, involving red-haired and 'deliberately barren' Gillard goading Rudd into resigning from Head of Government to be replaced by herself, led Julia Gillard to be compared with Lady Macbeth, labelled a witch and be the recipient of <b>misogyny.</b>|$|E
5|$|Violence {{against women}} may take many forms, {{including}} physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in legislation or policy, or be systematic <b>misogyny</b> by organisations against groups of women. Perpetrators of personal violence include state actors, strangers, acquaintances, relatives and intimate partners and manifests itself across a spectrum from discrimination, through harassment, sexual assault and rape, and physical harm to murder (femicide). It may also include cultural {{practices such as}} female genital cutting.|$|E
5|$|Davies' script {{takes place}} in two {{distinct}} time frames and required two different actors for the eponymous role: the older Casanova was portrayed by Peter O'Toole, and the younger Casanova was portrayed by David Tennant. The serial takes place primarily during Casanova's early adulthood and depicts his life among three women: his mother (Dervla Kirwan), his lover Henriette (Laura Fraser), and his consort Bellino (Nina Sosanya). The script takes {{a different approach to}} Dennis Potter's 1971 dramatisation; instead of Potter's focus on sex and <b>misogyny,</b> the 2005 serial focuses on Casanova's compassion and respect for women.|$|E
5|$|For the {{follow-up}} to their 1998 album Aquemini, the duo worked {{to create an}} expansive and experimental musical aesthetic, incorporating a diverse array of styles including funk, rave music, psychedelia, gospel, and rock within a Dirty South-oriented hip hop context. During the recording sessions, André 3000 began moving beyond traditional rapping {{in favor of a}} more melodic vocal style, an approach to which Big Boi and several other producers were initially unaccustomed. Lyrically, the duo touched upon a wide range of subject matter, including sexuality, politics, <b>misogyny,</b> African-American culture, parenthood, and introspection. Stankonia featured appearances from a variety of local musicians discovered by the group while they were visiting clubs in the city of Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of <b>misogyny</b> and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{noted the}} weak {{character}} development, especially in its female characters. Critics also focused on <b>misogyny</b> and stereotyping, {{in particular the}} Asian gangster.|$|E
25|$|Queers {{subvert the}} gender system. Gay men love males {{and are not}} {{adequately}} macho and aggressive. Lesbians love women and are insufficiently passive and dependent on men. That's why we're persecuted. Our nonconformity threatens the system which sustains the social hegemony of male heterosexuality and <b>misogyny.</b>|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{women were}} {{outraged by the}} {{inherent}} inequity and <b>misogyny</b> of the legislation. For the first time, women in large numbers took up the rights of prostitutes. Prominent critics included Blackwell, Nightingale, Martineau, and Elizabeth Wolstenholme. Elizabeth Garrett, unlike her sister, Millicent, {{did not support the}} campaign, though she later admitted that the campaign had done well.|$|E
25|$|Often, <b>misogyny</b> is {{a common}} trait of gang activity. According to a study {{conducted}} in 2008 using the Feminicide Database 1993–2007 at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, which documented incidents of feminicide that occurred in Ciudad Juárez from 1993–2007, 9.1% of the murders of women were attributed to organized crime and drug trafficking activities.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's {{analysis}} of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On this ground, feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of <b>misogyny</b> and sexism. However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness {{as he did}} to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness {{need to be in}} women as well as men.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Steele {{formed the}} heavy metal band Fallout. In 1982, after the split of Fallout, Steele formed the thrash metal band Carnivore. With Carnivore, Steele's lyrics were often harsh, dealing with religion, war, race and <b>misogyny.</b> Carnivore {{released}} their debut self-titled album in 1985. In 1986, Steele wrote lyrics for several songs on hardcore punk band Agnostic Front's second album Cause for Alarm. In 1987, Carnivore released Retaliation, before splitting up later that year.|$|E
25|$|The community, {{while in}} theory {{should be more}} liberal than other {{communities}} in Western and Southern Asia, has some paternal aspects that clash with liberal western youth values. A number of second generation have commented on how their first generation parents tend to look down on many elements of western youth culture (binge drinking, illegal drugs, promiscuity, etc.), and issues such as mental illness, homophobia, and <b>misogyny</b> have often received minor vocal opposition from first generation Sri Lankans.|$|E
25|$|Isi Life Mein...! (2010); {{written by}} Vidhi Kasliwal and Sulekha Bajpai, {{directed}} by Vidhi Kasliwal, starring Sandeepa Dhar and Akshay Oberoi; {{when a young}} girl is sent to college in Mumbai, she joins the Dramatics Society, which {{is currently working on}} a production of The Taming of the Shrew for the National Theatre Festival. However, when several members of the cast complain that the play is sexist, the director decides to rewrite it, removing any <b>misogyny,</b> and renaming it The Taming of the Shrew - Reborn.|$|E
25|$|However, some gay {{men such as}} Andrea Dworkin's husband John Stoltenberg {{are also}} {{critical}} of sadomasochism and pornography and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices. Stoltenberg wrote that sadomasochism eroticizes both violence and powerlessness. The gay pro-feminist author Christopher N. Kendall wrote the book Gay Male Pornography: An Issue Of Sex Discrimination, advancing the idea that gay male pornography involved sex discrimination and should be banned under Canada's equality laws. He uses radical feminist theory {{to make the case}} that gay male pornography reinforces <b>misogyny</b> and homophobia.|$|E
25|$|The attack, videos, {{and written}} {{manifesto}} of Rodger sparked conversations about broader issues {{of violence against}} women and <b>misogyny</b> in society. Rodger indicated in online postings and YouTube videos that he would punish women for denying him sex and he would also punish men who had access to sex with women, as he did not. Rodger frequented online forums such as PUAHate and /r/ForeverAlone where he and other men posted misogynistic statements about women. He subscribed to several pick-up artist YouTube channels. For these reasons, as well as Rodger's apparent sense of entitlement to sex with women, he {{has been described as}} misogynistic.|$|E
25|$|There were {{frequent}} exposés of {{his lifestyle}} in the press, and attacks {{from all sides}} from the groups his films offended. His television series Eight Hours Do Not Make a Day was cut from eight to five episodes after pressure from conservatives. The playwright Franz Xaver Kroetz sued over Fassbinder's adaptation of his play Jail Bait, alleging that it was obscene. Lesbians and feminists accused Fassbinder of <b>misogyny</b> (in presenting women as complicit in their own oppression) in his 'Women's Picture'. The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant has been cited by some feminist and gay critics as both homophobic and sexist.|$|E
25|$|American Doll Posse is {{the ninth}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Tori Amos, {{released}} in 2007 by Epic records. A concept album, American Doll Posse sees Amos assuming {{the identity of}} five different female personalities inspired by Greek mythology in order to narrate stories of life in modern America. Themes include opposition to the Iraq war, recording industry <b>misogyny,</b> disillusion, sexuality, personal loss and female empowerment in general. Musically, the album is more rock-oriented than other studio albums by Amos, notably featuring more guitar and drums than previous albums The Beekeeper (2005) and Scarlet's Walk (2002).|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychologist}} Satoshi Kanazawa {{has argued}} that an important cause of intergroup conflict may be the relative availability of women of reproductive age. He found that polygyny greatly increased the frequency of civil wars but not interstate wars. Gleditsch et al. did not find a relationship between ethnic groups with polygyny and increased frequency of civil wars but nations having legal polygamy may have more civil wars. They argued that <b>misogyny</b> is a better explanation than polygyny. They found that increased women's rights were associated with less civil wars and that legal polygamy had no effect after women’s rights were controlled for.|$|E
25|$|French writer Christine de Pizan (1364 – c. 1430), {{the author}} of The Book of the City of Ladies and Epître au Dieu d'Amour (Epistle to the God of Love) is cited by Simone de Beauvoir as {{the first woman to}} {{denounce}} <b>misogyny</b> and write about the relation of the sexes. Other early feminist writers include Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi, who worked in the 16th century, and the 17th-century writers Hannah Woolley in England, Juana Inés de la Cruz in Mexico, Marie Le Jars de Gournay, Anne Bradstreet, and François Poullain de la Barre.|$|E
25|$|According to Norris, Bittaker {{saved him}} from being {{attacked}} by fellow inmates {{on at least two}} occasions. By 1978, the pair had become close acquaintances; discovering they shared a common interest in sexual violence and <b>misogyny,</b> with Norris also divulging to Bittaker the biggest stimulation for him was of seeing frightened young women, adding this was the primary reason he had amassed a lengthy record for sexual offenses. Bittaker — who is not known to have committed any sexual offenses prior to his meeting Norris — himself divulged to Norris that if he ever raped a woman, he would kill her so as not to leave a witness to the crime.|$|E
25|$|Bourgois, {{writing about}} life in East Harlem, New York, United States, {{described}} how young men felt pressured by models of successful masculinity and family structure passed down from their parents' and grandparents' generations, together with modern-day ideals of manhood that also place an emphasis on material consumption. Trapped in their slums, {{with little or no}} available employment, they are unlikely to attain either of these models or expectations of masculine success. In these circumstances, ideals of masculinity are reshaped to emphasize <b>misogyny,</b> substance abuse and participation in crime and often also xenophobia and racism. Gang rape and sexual conquest are normalized, as men turn their aggression against women they can no longer control patriarchally or support economically.|$|E
25|$|It was {{probably}} through Eminescu that Ion Luca Caragiale {{came into contact}} with the Iaşi-based Junimea, the influential literary society which was also a center for anti-National Liberal politics. Initially, Caragiale met with Junimea founder, the critic and politician Titu Maiorescu, during a visit to the house of Dr. Kremnitz, physician to the family of Domnitor Carol I. The doctor's wife and Maiorescu's sister-in-law, Mite Kremnitz, was herself a writer, and later became Eminescu's lover. During several meetings, Caragiale was asked by Maiorescu to write down a series of aphorisms in an album. His concise musings are contemplative in tone, and some of them constitute evidence of both misanthropy and, to a certain degree, <b>misogyny.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argue that}} even in Shakespeare's day the play must have been controversial, due to {{the changing nature of}} gender politics. Marjorie Garber, for example, suggests Shakespeare created the Induction so the audience wouldn't react badly to the <b>misogyny</b> in the Petruchio/Katherina story; he was, in effect, defending himself against charges of sexism. G.R. Hibbard argues that during the period in which the play was written, arranged marriages were beginning to give way to newer, more romantically informed unions, and thus people's views on women's position in society, and their relationships with men, were in a state of flux. As such, audiences may not have been as predisposed to tolerate the harsh treatment of Katherina as is often thought.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Ice Cube {{recorded}} his debut solo album, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, in New York with the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy's production team). It {{was released in}} May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to {{the rising tide of}} rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of <b>misogyny</b> and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed the female rapper Yo-Yo (who appeared on AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted) to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, Make Way for the Motherlode. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in John Singleton's violent crime drama, Boyz n the Hood. In the same year as AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, Ice Cube released the acclaimed EP, Kill At Will which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go Platinum.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{argue that}} hip hop {{can have an}} {{empowering}} effect on youth. While there is <b>misogyny,</b> violence, and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics, hip hop also displays many positive themes of self-reliance, resilience, and self-esteem. These messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty. A lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the African American community promoting social causes. Social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with at-risk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child. Hip hop {{has the potential to}} be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically, be it through forms of writing, creating music, or social activism. The lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, tone, theme, motif, plot, and point of view.|$|E
25|$|The Labor Party {{replaced}} Rudd with Julia Gillard in 2010 {{owing to}} Rudd's unpopularity both among his frontbench and the public, so then Julia Gillard {{became the first}} woman prime minister in Australian history. Following the 2010 Election, Labor secured office in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election. The Gillard Government struggled on multiple policy fronts, trying to wrestle with a hung parliament. A scandal rocked the parliament: Speaker of the House Peter Slipper, who was a former Liberal Party member turned Labor ally, had sent sexually suggestive messages to a colleague. This resulted in his removal. Opposition to Gillard's government following her <b>misogyny</b> speech intensified. Leadership rivalry continued and Kevin Rudd was reinstated as prime minister in a Labor leadership spill on 27 June 2013. At the 2013 Election, the Second Rudd Government lost office and the Liberal-National Abbott Government formed.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a {{sophisticated}} {{do it yourself}} infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement {{as a way to}} activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the <b>misogyny</b> in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.|$|E
25|$|Big Black's {{aggressive}} and abrasive music {{was characterized by}} distinctively clanky guitars {{and the use of}} a drum machine rather than a drum kit, elements that foreshadowed industrial rock. The band's lyrics flouted commonly held taboos and dealt frankly— and often explicitly— with politically and culturally loaded topics including murder, rape, child sexual abuse, arson, racism, and <b>misogyny.</b> Though the band's lyrics contained controversial material, the lyrics were meant to serve as a commentary or a display of distaste for the subject matter. They were staunchly critical of the commercial nature of rock, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career. At the height of their success, they booked their own tours, paid for their own recordings, refused to sign contracts, and eschewed many of the traditional corporate trappings of rock bands. In doing so, they {{had a significant impact on}} the aesthetic and political development of independent and underground rock music.|$|E
25|$|The countercultural artists {{movement}} of the post-Revolutionary period, beginning in the 1920s, was clearly political and aimed at allowing other voices {{in the development of}} a modern Mexico. In Guadalupe Marín's novel La Única (The Unique Woman) she speaks of violence against women, <b>misogyny</b> and lack of citizenship for women, but also feminine and homosexual desires. She presented publicly the understanding that sexuality has a political component. Frida Kahlo's work, blending both masculine and feminine gender perceptions, challenged false perceptions, as did Maria Izquierdo's insistence on her right to be independent of any state or cultural attempts to define her art. Tina Modotti's move away from portraiture and toward images of social change through the lens of realism and revolutionary action and Concha Michel’s dedication to the rights and status of Mexican women, without challenging sexual inequality, represented a more humanist rather than feminist approach to their art. Whereas Michel explored feminism and politics with Anita Brenner, Modotti did not. The women were bound by their questioning of women's place in Mexico and society with their art, but they did not formally join with the suffragettes or in feminist organizations. In retrospect these artists have become feminist icons because their actions and work questioned gender restrictions, but in their time, they may not have seen themselves in that way.|$|E
