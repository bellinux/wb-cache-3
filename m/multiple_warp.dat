Furthermore, it is only possible to approximate the Jacobian associated with the VTLN transformation. A new, simple, linear approximation to VTLN is described in this paper. This linear approximation allows the Jacobian to be exactly computed. It can also be highly efficient in terms of warp factor estimation and application of the warp factors.

40|$|The Goldberger-Wise {{mechanism}} enables one {{to stabilize}} {{the length of the}} warped extra dimension employed in Randall-Sundrum models. In this work we generalize this mechanism to models with <b>multiple</b> <b>warped</b> throats sharing a common ultraviolet brane. For independent throats this generalization is straight forward. If the throats possess a discrete interchange symmetry like Z_n the stabilizing dynamics may respect the symmetry, resulting in equal throat lengths, or they may break it. In the latter case the ground state of an initially symmetric configuration is a stabilized asymmetric configuration in which the throat lengths differ. We focus on two- (three-) throat setups with a Z_ 2 (Z_ 3) interchange symmetry and present stabilization dynamics suitable for either breaking or maintaining the symmetry. Though admitting more general application, our results are relevant for existing models in the literature, including the two throat model with Kaluza-Klein parity and the three throat model of flavor based on a broken Z_ 3 symmetry.

40|$|Augmenting {{datasets}} by transforming inputs in a {{way that}} does not change the label is a crucial ingredient of the state of the art methods for object recognition using neural networks. However this approach has (to our knowledge) not been exploited successfully in speech recognition (with or without neural networks). In this paper we lay the foundation for this approach, and show one way of augmenting speech datasets by transforming spectrograms, using a random linear warping along the frequency dimension. In practice this can be achieved by using warping techniques that are used for vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) - with the difference that a warp factor is generated randomly each time, during training, rather than fitting a single warp factor to each training and test speaker (or utterance). At test time, a prediction is made by averaging the predictions over <b>multiple</b> <b>warp</b> factors. When this technique is applied to TIMIT using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) of different depths, the Phone Error Rate (PER) improved by an average of 0. 65 % on the test set. For a Convolutional neural network (CNN) with convolutional layer in the bottom, a gain of 1. 0 % was observed. These improvements were achieved without increasing the number of training epochs, and suggest that data transformations should be an important component of training neural networks for speech, especially for data limited projects.

40|$|From the {{technological}} {{point of view}} {{it is necessary that}} the phase of warping to be done two or three <b>multiple</b> <b>warp,</b> which results in two or three rolls of the warp final will meet only the warping. To achieve longitudinal striped fabric spinning machines is necessary to have all tensioning mechanism dispensing rolls which requires their special construction. The homogeneity of the fabric {{from the point of view}} of the warp yarns tension must be ensured by synchronizing operation of the tensioning two cutting mechanisms of the two reels on which the wires are wound with a degree of waving and thus the fuel consumption at the different weaving. It is recommended that the design be adopted average float bonds, such that the wires can be wrapped around more than two final reels. In terms of manufacturing technology with longitudinal stripes fabrics have a more complicated and expensive technology to cross-striped fabrics for the manufacture of which technology is simplified. Cross-striped fabrics containing groups of warp threads those linked to floating average is materially different. Due to this degree of crimping of wires in the stripes with different bonds makes their contract to be different, having a direct influence on the wires consumption. The different contraction of wire weaving makes warp yarn length, contained in a linked reports are so different that it requires winding wires with different bonds also differing on the final rolls...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Multi-atlas {{segmentation}} {{has been}} widely applied in medi-cal image analysis. This technique relies on image registration to transfer segmentation labels from pre-labeled atlases to a novel target image and applies label fusion to reduce errors produced by registration-based label transfer. To improve the performance of registration-based label transfer against registration errors, our first contribution is to propose a label transfer scheme that generates <b>multiple</b> <b>warped</b> versions of each atlas to one target image through registration paths obtained by composing inter-atlas registrations and atlas-target registrations. The problem of decreasing quality of warped atlases caused by accumulative errors in composing multiple registrations is properly addressed by an atlas selec-tion method that is guided by atlas segmentations. To improve the perfor-mance of label fusion against registration errors, our second contribution is to integrate the probabilistic correspondence model employed by the non-local mean approach with the joint label fusion technique, {{both of which have}} shown excellent performance for label fusion. Experiments on mitral-valve segmentation in 3 D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|High single {{instruction}} multiple data (SIMD) {{efficiency and}} {{low power consumption}} have made graphic processing units (GPUs) an ideal platform for many complex computational applications. Thousands of threads can be created by programmers and grouped into fixed-size SIMD batches, known as warps. High throughput is then achieved by concurrently executing such warps with minimal control overhead. However, if a branch instruction occurs, which assigns different paths to different threads, this warp will be broken into <b>multiple</b> <b>warps</b> {{that have to be}} executed serially, consequently reducing the efficiency advantage of SIMD. In this thesis, the contemporary fixed-size warp design is abandoned and a hybrid warp size (HWS) mechanism is proposed. Mixed-size warps are generated according to HWS and are scheduled and issued flexibly. Once a branch divergence occurs, split warps are squeezed according to the proposed algorithm, and warp sizes are downscaled wherever applicable. Based on updated warp sizes, warp schedulers calculate the number of cycles the current warp needs and issue the next warp accordingly. As a result, hybrid warps are pushed into pipelines as soon as possible and more pipeline stages are overlapped. The simulation results show that this mechanism yields an average speedup of 1. 20 over the baseline architecture {{for a wide variety of}} general purpose GPU applications. This work also integrates HWS with dynamic warp formation (DWF), which is a well-known branch handling mechanism aimed at improving SIMD utilization by forming new warps out of split warps in real time. The warp forming policy is modified to better tolerate warp conflicts. Also, squeeze operations are added before a warp merges with other warps. The simulation shows that the combination of DWF and HWS generates an average speedup of 1. 27 over the DWF-only platform for the same set of GPU benchmarks...|$|R
40|$|SIMD {{organizations}} amortize {{the area}} and power of fetch, decode, and issue logic across multiple processing units {{in order to maximize}} throughput for a given area and power budget. However, throughput is reduced when a set of threads operating in lockstep (a warp) are stalled due to long latency memory accesses. The resulting idle cycles are extremely costly. Multi-threading can hide latencies by interleaving the execution of <b>multiple</b> <b>warps,</b> but deep multi-threading using many warps dramatically increases the cost of the register files (multi-threading depth × SIMD width), and cache contention can make performance worse. Instead, intra-warp latency hiding should first be exploited. This allows threads that are ready but stalled by SIMD restrictions to use these idle cycles and reduces the need for multi-threading among warps. This paper introduces dynamic warp subdivision (DWS), which allows a single warp to occupy more than one slot in the scheduler without requiring extra register file space. Independent scheduling entities allow divergent branch paths to interleave their execution, and allow threads that hit to run ahead. The result is improved latency hiding and memory level parallelism (MLP). We evaluate the technique on a coherent cache hierarchy with private L 1 caches and a shared L 2 cache. With an area overhead of less than 1 %, experiments with eight data-parallel benchmarks show our technique improves performance on average by 1. 7 X with energy savings of 30 %. We further study the performance sensitivity of DWS to various D-cache sizes and associativities. The performance benefit of DWS is also demonstrated with various SIMD widths and multi-threading depths. While DWS may increase the number of scheduling entities, we propose ways to limit this side effect. The effectiveness of such technique is also analyzed quantitatively. ...|$|R
