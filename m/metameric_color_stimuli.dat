One {{study found that}} newborn infants looked longer at checkered patterns of white and <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli</b> (including red, green, yellow) than they did at a uniform white color. However, infants failed to discriminate blue from white checkered patterns. Another study - recording the fixation time of infants to blue, green, yellow, red, and gray at two difference luminance levels - found that infants and adults differed in their color preference. Newborns and one month did not show any preference among the <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli.</b> It was found that three-month-old infants preferred the longer wavelength (red and yellow) to the short-wavelength (blue and green) stimuli, while adults had the opposite. However, both adults and infants preferred <b>colored</b> <b>stimuli</b> over non-colored stimuli.

If 55 s elapsed with a response not having occurred either through 55 s or after the variable-interval 10 -s had timed out, one of the color-line compound stimuli was presented independently of responding. To control for sensory reinforcement effects and for earlier entrance to the later link, a simple discrimination procedure also was conducted in which reinforcement was not correlated with the <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> but with the line stimuli only. As in the conditional discrimination, the observing response also could produce earlier presentation of blue or red. The observing response occurred more frequently during the conditional discrimination than during the simple discrimination.

40|$|Physiological {{studies of}} color {{processing}} have typically measured responses to spatially varying chromatic stimuli such as gratings, while psychophysical studies of color include color naming, color and light, {{as well as}} spatial and temporal chromatic sensitivities.

Here we show from non-linear analysis of human visual evoked potentials (VEP) the presence of distinct and independent temporal signatures for form and surface color processing. Surface <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> produced most power in the second order Wiener kernel, indicative of a slowly recovering neural system, while chromatic form stimulation produced most power in the first order kernel (showing rapid recovery).

50|$|Using {{materials}} that are <b>metameric</b> <b>color</b> matches rather than spectral color matches is a significant problem in industries where color matching or color tolerances are important. A classic example is in automobiles: the interior fabrics, plastics and paints may be manufactured to provide a good color match under a standard light source (such as the sun), but the matches can disappear under different light sources (fluorescent or halide lights). Similar problems can occur in apparel manufactured from different types of dye or using different types of fabric, or in quality color printing using different types of inks. Papers manufactured with optical brighteners are especially susceptible to color changes when lights differ in their short wavelength radiation, which can cause some papers to fluoresce.|$|R

As an alternative to visual search techniques, the present study investigated eye movement behavior to ascertain whether an unexpected presentation of a fluorescent <b>colored</b> <b>stimulus</b> would be likely to capture initial visual fixations to the onset of a multi-stimulus array.

40|$|A concurrent-chains {{schedule}} {{was used to}} examine how a delay to conditional discriminative stimuli affects conditioned reinforcement strength. Pigeons' key-peck responses in the initial link produced either of two terminal links according to independent variable-interval 30 -s schedules. Each terminal link involved an identical successive conditional discrimination and was segmented into three links: a delay interval (green), a <b>color</b> conditional discriminative <b>stimulus</b> (blue or red), and a line conditional discriminative stimulus (vertical or horizontal lines). Food delivery occurred 45 s after entering the terminal link with a probability of. 5, but its conditional probability (1. 0 or 0) depended on the combination of the color and the line stimuli. One of the <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> occurred independently of further responding, 5 s after entry into the right terminal link, but it occurred 35 s after entry into the left terminal link. One of the line stimuli occurred independently of responding 40 s after entry into either terminal link, synchronized with the offset of the <b>color</b> <b>stimulus.</b> The initial-link relative response rate for the right was consistently higher in comparison with a control condition in which the <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> occurred 20 s after entry into either terminal link. The preference for the short delay to the <b>color</b> conditional discriminative <b>stimuli</b> suggests the possibility of conditioned reinforcement by information about the relation between the line conditional discriminative stimuli and the outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Different IOL materials, {{particularly}} blue-light filtering materials, {{have different}} spectral transmittance characteristics. The <b>color</b> <b>stimuli,</b> which influence retinal receptors objectively, have consequently implications for color perception. We {{report on the}} quantitative determination of IOL-specific transmittance characteristics and present a method visualizing the resultant changes in <b>color</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Methods. A setup was realized to quantify IOL-absorption {{in a range of}} 390 – 780 [*]nm. To visualize the influence of the different spectral transmittance characteristics an algorithm was developed, which converts RGB-pixel values of images into spectra, which performs the corresponding transmittance correction, reconverts to RGB, and reconstructs the image. IOLs of hydrophobic acrylate and hydrophilic acrylate with a hydrophobic surface in each case with/without blue-light filter were examined. Results. Assessment of the reference images verifies the suitability of the pipeline. Evaluation of the transmittance spectra reveals differences of material- and manufacturer-specifics, which are capable of inducing considerable changes in color perception, particularly in the blue color range and mixed colors involving blue. Conclusions. The developed technique provides an approach for determining IOL-specific transmittance behavior and subsequently its influence on the retinal <b>color</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Problems of altered color perception are occasionally reported after cataract surgery and these become obvious with the visualization procedure developed here...|$|R

40|$|We studied brain {{activity}} during retention and retrieval phases of two visual short-term memory (VSTM) experiments. Experiment 1 used a balanced memory array, with one <b>color</b> <b>stimulus</b> in each hemifield, {{followed by a}} retention interval and a central probe, at the fixation point that designated the target stimulus in memory about which to make a determination of orientation. Retrieval of information from VSTM was associated with an event-related lateralization (ERL) with a contralateral negativity relative to the visual field from which the probed stimulus was originally encoded, suggesting a lateralized organization of VSTM. The scalp distribution of the retrieval ERL was more anterior than what is usually associated with simple maintenance activity, {{which is consistent with}} the involvement of different brain structures for these distinct visual memory mechanisms. Experiment 2 was like Experiment 1, but used an unbalanced memory array consisting of one lateral <b>color</b> <b>stimulus</b> in a hemifield and one <b>color</b> <b>stimulus</b> on the vertical mid-line. This design enabled us to separate lateralized activity related to target retrieval from distractor processing. Target retrieval was found to generate a negative-going ERL at electrode sites found in Experiment 1, and suggested representations were retrieved from anterior cortical structures. Distractor processing elicited a positive-going ERL at posterior electrodes sites, which could be indicative of a return to baseline of retention activity for the discarded memory of the now-irrelevant stimulus, or an active inhibition mechanism mediating distractor suppression...|$|R

We investigated the neural basis of the form–color link in macaque primary visual cortex (V 1) by studying orientation selectivity of single V 1 cells for pure color patterns. Neurons that responded to color were classified, based on cone inputs and spatial selectivity, into chromatically single-opponent and double-opponent groups. Single-opponent cells responded well to color but weakly to luminance contrast; they were not orientation selective for color patterns. Most double-opponent cells were orientation selective to pure <b>color</b> <b>stimuli</b> {{as well as to}} achromatic patterns.
