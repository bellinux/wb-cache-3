In one analytical study of feeding and courtship behaviours of the wood-stork family, MP Kahl attributed the same general ethology to all members of the Mycteria genus, with few species-specific variations. These four species are collectively referred to as the wood-storks, which {{should not be confused with}} one alternative common name (wood-stork) for the yellow-billed stork.|$|R

40|$|Logistic {{regression}} {{was applied}} to develop a morphometric sexing method of two closely related stork species that were previously sexed through amplification of the CHD gene. Tarsus length (TL) and bill length (BL) measurements were recorded from captive populations of adult Milky Stork (<b>Mycteria</b> <b>cinerea)</b> (n 5 60) and Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala) (n 5 58) at Zoo Negara Malaysia. Despite having monomorphic plumages, both stork species exhibited normal sexual size dimorphism in which males were significantly larger than females in the tested variables. Based on logistic regression analysis, BL correctly classified the sex of sampled individuals from Painted and Milky stork with an overall predicted accuracy of 94. 8 and 90. 0 %, respectively. However, TL measurements generated a lower predicted accuracy level of 86. 2 % and a same accuracy level of 90 % on the sex classification of individuals from Painted and Milky stork, respectively.

40|$|Botrytis bunch rot, {{caused by}} Botrytis cinerea, is an {{important}} fungal disease of grapevine with high economic importance in wine grape production and postharvest storage of table grapes. Biological control by antagonistic bacteria is a promising strategy for reducing the common use of synthetic fungicides to control this pathogen. A total of 45 bacterial strains, isolated from grapevine tissues in 'Bordeaux' vineyards were screened in vitro for their potential antifungal activity against two major vineyard subpopulations of B. <b>cinerea,</b> <b>i.</b> e., transposa and vacuma. These two transposon genotypes differ significantly in virulence on grape berries. The inhibitory effects of the bacterial strains on the mycelial growth were tested in vitro for detecting the potential production of diffusible metabolites and volatile organic compounds. Furthermore, ten strains among the most effective ones were selected and evaluated in vivo on detached grapevine host organs: leaf discs and grape berries. We showed {{that some of the}} bacterial strains strongly inhibited B. cinerea mycelial growth under in vitro conditions, and also significantly reduced rot severity in vivo.

40|$|Condition-dependent male {{alternative}} {{tactics are}} often driven by competition among males for females. The expression of alternative male mating tactics can {{be influenced by}} the external social environment as well as internal physiological state. Recent models predict that circulating levels of stress hormones (i. e., glucocorticoids) and androgens may be particularly important in determining mating tactic expression under varying social circumstances. This study intergrates both components to investigate the cause of alternative tactic adoption in male green tree frogs, Hyla cinerea. Males of this species produce acoustic signals that are critical for attracting females and male vocalizations stimulate production of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) in rival males, suggesting that CORT plays a pivotal role in male-male competition. By administering CORT to calling male H. <b>cinerea,</b> <b>I</b> show that increased circulating levels of glucocorticoids significantly decrease vocal attractiveness of males and increase the probability of non-calling satellite behavior when males are challenged by another male, these effects occurred independently of changes in circulating androgen levels. My results suggest that males of this species attempt to manipulate the stress physiology of males competitors during vocal contests in ways that decrease the probability of acquiring mates...|$|R
40|$|The {{antifungal}} {{activity of}} polygodial, a secondary metabolite extracted from Canelo, on mycelial growth of different Botrytis cinerea isolates has been evaluated. The {{results show that}} polygodial affects growth of normal and resistant isolates of B. cinerea with EC 50 values ranging between 117 and 175 ppm. In addition, polygodial markedly decreases the germination of B. <b>cinerea,</b> <b>i.</b> e., after six hours of incubation the percentage of germination decreases from 92 % (control) to 25 % and 5 % {{in the presence of}} 20 ppm and 80 ppm of polygodial, respectively. Morphological studies indicate that conidia treated with polygodial are smaller, with irregular membrane border, and a lot of cell debris, as compared to conidia in the control. The existence of polygodial-induced membrane damage was confirmed by SYTOX® Green uptake assay. Gene expression studies confirm that the effect of polygodial on B. cinerea is mainly attributed to inhibition of germination and appears at early stages of B. cinerea development. On the other hand, drimenol, a drimane with chemical structure quite similar to polygodial, inhibits the mycelial growth efficiently. Thus, both compounds inhibit mycelial growth by different mechanisms. The different antifungal activities of these compounds are discussed in terms of the electronic density on the double bond...|$|R
40|$|Postharvest petal specking {{caused by}} Botrytis cinerea {{is a major}} concern for freesia growers and sellers in Holland and the UK. Germicidal and {{inducible}} host defence effects of UV-C irradiation were evaluated. UV-C irradiation of freesia inflorescences after artificial inoculation with B. <b>cinerea</b> (<b>i.</b> e. the germicidal effect) was more effective in reducing petal specking, compared to UV-C treatment before artificial inoculation (i. e. the defence induction effect). Cut freesia inflorescences exposed to 1 kJ m(- 2) UV-C after artificial inoculation with 104 B. cinerea conidia mL(- 1) displayed reduced disease severity scores, lesion numbers and lesion diameters by 74, 68 and 14 %, respectively, compared to non-irradiated control inflorescences. In contrast, UV-C irradiation with I kJ m(- 2) before artificial inoculation reduced lesion numbers and lesion diameters by 13 and 24 %, compared to the non-irradiated controls. Higher UV-C doses of 2. 5 or 5 kJ m(- 2) reduced disease severity scores, lesion numbers and lesion diameters when applied after artificial inoculation, but enhanced disease when applied before artificial inoculation. Vase life of cut freesia inflorescences irradiated with 0. 5, 1 or 2. 5 kJ m(- 2) UV-C was maintained equal to non-irradiated controls. However, 5 kJ m(- 2) resulted in phytotoxicity evident as petal discoloration and reduced vase life compared to non-irradiated inflorescences. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|What place might killing occupy in a more-than-human world, where {{human life}} is always-already {{entangled}} among nonhumans? In this article I attempt to unsettle the assumption that only individual organisms can be killed, and to render other sites and spaces of killing visible. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among winemakers in South Australia I examine pasteurisation, a killing practice that acts not on organisms but on the fluids within which they live. Examining the pasteurisation of wine damaged by the fungus Botrytis <b>cinerea,</b> <b>I</b> argue that this practice shifts the locus of killing from botrytis’ body to metabolic life processes which embrace extracellular enzymes diffused throughout the wine. I suggest that pasteurisation thus displaces killing into spaces, such as wine-in-the-making, within which many metabolic lives coexist and interpenetrate. Pasteurisation therefore renders killing an intervention into the metabolic relationships that tie together numerous species of microbes living within wine. In acting on wine as a whole it kills rather indiscriminately, simultaneously terminating multiple lives that relate to humans in different ways. Pasteurisation therefore both protects and spoils wine, reconfiguring multiple human-nonhuman relationships in conflicting and sometimes economically costly ways. In so doing, it illustrates that in a more-than-human world killing becomes difficult to confine to a single unwanted organism or species. Killing instead becomes disturbingly mobile and communicable, prone to rebound upon the valued human lives of those who kill in unsettling and potentially harmful ways...|$|R

40|$|The {{trade-off}} between gametes and soma {{is central}} to life-history evolution. Oosorption has been proposed as a mechanism that can mediate this trade-off. When conditions are not conducive to successful reproduction, females {{are expected to be}} able to recoup nutrients from unfertilized oocytes and reinvest them into the somatic processes that promote survival and hence future reproduction. Although positive correlations between oocyte degradation and lifespan have been documented in oviparous insects, the adaptive significance of this process in species with more complex reproductive biology has not been explored. Oocyte degradation via apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs in response to enforced virginity in females of the ovoviviparous cockroach, Nauphoeta cinerea. Observed apoptosis may represent oosorption, however, an alternative but not mutually exclusive argument is that oocyte apoptosis may represent oocyte ageing and clearance in order to maintain reproductive synchrony. The aim of this thesis was to test the hypothesis that the function of oocyte apoptosis is oosorption in N. <b>cinerea.</b> <b>I</b> found that in addition to enforced virginity, starvation induces oocyte apoptosis. However, the life history outcome following one form of stress is the opposite of the other. Hence, the functional role of oocyte apoptosis appears to be different depending on whether apoptosis is induced through starvation or age. Following a period of starvation-induced apoptosis females exhibit the increase in survival and future reproduction predicted by oosorption. Whereas, following a period of age-induced apoptosis females suffer fecundity and longevity cuts. However, age-induced apoptosis does not appear to simply be cellular ageing and clearance. In conjugation with age-induced apoptosis, ovariole number declines whilst the size of surviving oocytes increases. Hence, it appears that resources from sacrificed oocytes are being recycled into the survivors, and that this reinvestment in current reproduction trade-offs with future reproductive capacity. My thesis shows the importance of studying proximal mechanisms alongside more traditional measures of life history, as the relationship between isolated biological levels is not always clear.

40|$|In many anuran species (frogs and toads), males {{alternate}} between calling and a non-calling “satellite” mating tactic. Satellite males characteristically associate with calling males {{and attempt to}} intercept females that are attracted to the vocalizations of the calling “host” male. The prevailing hypothesis is {{that the decision to}} adopt a calling or satellite mating tactic is based on relative attractiveness – males are predicted to adopt a satellite mating tactic when the vocalizations of nearby males are more attractive than their own. In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have shown that satellite males can be induced to call by removing the associated calling host male. However, there is considerable variation in the responses of males in host removal experiments, suggesting that the physiological status of males may {{play a central role in}} tactic decisions. For my honors research, I investigated the role of circulating hormone levels in mediating mating tactic decisions in the green tree frog, Hyla <b>cinerea.</b> <b>I</b> performed host removal experiments wherein calling males were removed in natural satellite-caller associations. I then observed whether satellite males adopted a calling tactic or remained as non-calling males and subsequently obtained blood samples for hormone analysis. Based on recent models describing the hormonal basis for calling behavior in anurans, I predicted that satellite males would have lower levels of circulating androgens, higher levels of stress hormones, be in poorer condition, and produce calls that are less attractive than calling males. Moreover, satellite males that did not call subsequent to removal of the calling host male were predicted to have lower circulating androgen levels and higher levels of CORT than satellite males that called subsequent to removal of the calling host male. Consistent with these predictions, satellite male H. cinerea had lower levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), higher levels of corticosterone (CORT), were in poorer condition and invested less energy in their calls than calling host males. Satellite males that called subsequent to host removal also had significantly higher DHT levels; however, circulating CORT levels did not differ for the two groups of males. My results suggest that circulating androgen levels play a central role in mediating mating tactic decisions in H. cinerea...|$|R
40|$|Priming {{of defense}} for a {{stronger}} and faster response to abiotic and biotic stress {{is an important part}} of acquired immunity in plants and animals. Recent findings revealed the involvement of the two mitogen-activated protein kinases MPK 3 and MPK 6 in the regulation of priming in Arabidopsis thaliana. Since the A. thaliana genome encodes 20 MPKs, I wondered, whether one or more of the other MPKs would be involved in priming. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a strong transcriptional upregulation of MPK 11 upon treatment with the priming-inducing chemicals BTH, BABA, and salicylic acid, and upon several biotic and abiotic stress stimuli. In addition, I performed a phenotypic screen of mpk mutants that revealed strong morphological defects in mpk 17 T-DNA knockout plants. To elucidate the potential role of MPK 11 and MPK 17 in plant defense, I treated mpk 11 and mpk 17 mutants with various plant pathogens and analyzed basal plant defense responses. Furthermore, I performed drought stress experiments to investigate one abiotic stress response in mpk 11 and mpk 17 mutants. I found that both mutants are not affected in their response against Pseudomonas syringae and the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis <b>cinerea,</b> whereas <b>I</b> could reveal a slight reduction in basal defense against the biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. In addition, I showed that both mutants are not affected in the production of reactive oxygen species or in deposition of callose, two typical basal defense responses. Furthermore, by analysis of protein phosphorylation, I excluded a compensational effect of MPK 3, MPK 4, and MPK 6, the major players in plant defense signaling, for the loss of mpk 11 and mpk 17. In all experiments, I did not see significant alterations in primed defense responses, suggesting that both kinases do, if at all, only play a minor role in plant defense. According to bioinformatic analysis, I propose a role for MPK 17 in the regulation of developmental processes. Furthermore, I discuss a possible role of MPK 11 as a backup system for other kinases...|$|R
40|$|Botrytis cinerea is {{associated}} with a fungal gray rot in the concomitant regions of north west Spain and northern Portugal, where it is the most damaging pathogen and results in severe economic losses. Also, the physiological interactions of B. cinerea with Penicillium expansum are responsible for the production of geosmin, a volatile metabolite that transmit undesirable earthy odours to must and thus to wine. B. cinerea is not a homogeneous species and may be divided into several sub-species groupings. Some previous studies indicated two groups or cryptic species (I and II). Other work revealed that spore size and vegetative compatibility are characteristic features of these groups. In the present work a survey was taken of the population of B. cinerea from the above mentioned regions. The spore size and compatibility tests allowed characterisation of most isolates of B. <b>cinerea</b> into Group <b>I</b> or Group II taxa. Interestingly, some isolates could not be characterised according to their spore size and also presented ambiguous vegetative compatibility features. Furthermore, the influence of other factors on the spore size and grouping were studied. Grape variety, vineyard, country, sanitary state of the bunch and whether the isolates were obtained from the exterior or the interior of the bunch were compared with spore size and vegetative compatibility. Characterization of strains was affected by whether isolates were obtained from a particular grape variety. Also, isolates from Group II were obtained exclusively from a particular vineyard. The results suggest that there is considerable genetic diversity within the species which may explain patterns of gray rot within grapes. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R
40|$|Amphibians are {{the most}} {{threatened}} taxon on the planet. Declines {{have been associated with}} over-exploitation, habitat loss, pollution, and pathogenic diseases, but of these factors, pollution and disease have been relatively under-studied. Here, I investigated: 1) the impacts of commonly used pesticides on aquatic communities, 2) the effect of these pesticides on amphibian susceptibility to the pathogenic chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and 3) whether there are non-amphibian hosts of Bd and 4) how to best quantify the survival of Bd through ontogeny of the host. In my first research chapter, I quantified the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of the mot commonly used synthetic fungicide in the US, chlorothalonil, on 34 species-, 2 community- and 11 ecosystem-level responses in a multitrophic-level system. Chlorothalonil increased mortality of amphibians, gastropods, zooplankton, algae, and a macrophyte (reducing taxonomic richness), reduced decomposition and water clarity, and elevated dissolved oxygen and net primary productivity. These ecosystem effects were indirect but were predictable based on changes in taxonomic richness. A path analysis suggests that chlorothalonil-induced reductions in biodiversity and top-down and bottom-up effects facilitated algal blooms that shifted ecosystem functions. In my second chapter, I investigated how a wide range of ecologically relevant concentrations of chlorothalonil affected four species of amphibians (Osteopilus septentrionalis, Rana sphenocephala, Hyla squirella and H. <b>cinerea).</b> <b>I</b> also evaluated the effects of chlorothalonil on liver tissue, immune cell density, and the stress hormone, corticosterone. Chlorothalonil killed nearly every amphibian at the expected environmental concentration (EEC) and, at concentrations to which humans are commonly exposed (up to the EEC), it was associated with elevated corticosterone levels and changes in immune cells. Three species (O. septentrionalis, R. sphenocephala, and H. cinerea) showed a non-monotonic dose-response, with low and high concentrations causing significantly greater mortality than intermediate concentrations and controls. Corticosterone exhibited a similar non-monotonic dose response and chlorothalonil concentration was inversely associated with liver tissue and immune cell densities. These studies on chlorothalonil emphasize the need to re-evaluate its safety and to further link anthropogenic-induced changes in biodiversity to altered ecosystem functions. In my third research chapter, I investigated the effects of chlorothalonil and atrazine, one of the most commonly used herbicides in the US, on amphibian susceptibility to Bd, a leading cause of amphibian extinctions. Relative to controls, atrazine monotonically reduced Bd growth in culture and on tadpoles. In contrast, chlorothalonil non-monotonically reduced Bd growth in culture and on tadpoles, with low and high concentrations causing significantly greater mortality than intermediate concentrations and controls. This study is {{one of only a handful}} of studies to document a non-monotonic dose response of an invertebrate (Bd) to a pesticide. Although both pesticides reduced Bd growth on tadpoles and in culture, neither eliminated Bd entirely, and because we know little about the long-term effects of the pesticides on hosts (e. g., immunosuppression), I do not recommend using these chemicals to control Bd. In my fourth research chapter, I investigated whether there are non-amphibian hosts for Bd. Non-amphibian hosts could explain how Bd is able to persist in the environment after amphibians are extirpated, and the extreme virulence and distribution of Bd. In laboratory and field studies, I found that crayfish, but not mosquitofish, were hosts for Bd. I found that crayfish could be infected with Bd, could maintain that infection long term (at least 3 months) and could transfer that infection to susceptible amphibians. I also revealed that exposure to water that previously held Bd caused significant crayfish mortality and gill recession, suggesting that Bd releases a chemical that can cause host pathology in the absence of infection. Most efforts to conserve and restore amphibian populations challenged by Bd have been unsuccessful, but managing alternative hosts offers a new and potentially more effective approach to managing Bd. Likewise, identifying the specific pathology-inducing chemical released by Bd might facilitate the development of new strategies to reduce the risk posed by this pathogen. The fifth and sixth research chapters are aimed to improve the quality and efficiency of Bd research. During amphibian development, Bd infections transition from the mouthparts of tadpoles to the skin of post-metamorphic frogs but this transition has never been quantified and thus researchers might be sampling the wrong parts of amphibian bodies to detect Bd. I showed that Bd abundance in O. septentrionalis mouthparts declined from Gosner stages 35 - 42 and increased on epidermis from Gosner stages 38 - 46. Assuming our findings are general across species, I recommend sampling mouthparts of amphibians less than Gosner stage 41 and hind limbs of amphibians greater than Gosner stage 41. This should provide researchers with guidance on where to sample to maximize detection of Bd. I also investigated whether Trypan blue dye could be used to determine the viability of Bd. I showed that the proportion of zoospores stained with Trypan blue dye matched the proportion of known dead zoospores added to cultures. In contrast, all of the zoosporangia stage (including known dead zoosporangia) of Bd stained blue. These results demonstrate that Trypan blue can be used to determine the viability of Bd zoospores but not zoosporangia. I recommend using Trypan blue to report the number of live zoospores to which hosts are exposed and to help determine whether factors have lethal or sublethal effects on Bd. My work demonstrates that managing exposure to contaminants and biological reservoirs for Bd might provide new hope for imperiled amphibians. Further exploring how pesticides and pathogens are contributing to amphibian declines will allow us to formulate crucial management and conservation plans to begin remediation...|$|R
40|$|Grey mould {{caused by}} the fungus Botrytis cinerea is a common disease on several kinds of {{ripening}} fruits, including grape. In addition to quantitative losses, if strongly affected grapes are processed into wine the enzymatic activity of the fungus can {{have a negative effect}} on the wine quality. Epidemics are usually initiated in Spring from inoculum produced on different overwintering structures. Leaf infections and, with higher impact, floral infections can generate fruit infections through different infection pathways, some of which include a degree of symptomless latency. Not only environmental conditions but also bunch architecture and berry structure can influence disease severity and incidence: grape varieties with compact clusters are more susceptible to the disease. Traditionally, the control of B. cinerea in the vineyard is performed using synthetic fungicides: up to three applications per season, depending on the production line, the weather conditions and the risk a grower wants to take. Within the FP 7 -KBBE project "Pesticide Use-and-risk Reduction in European farming systems with Integrated Pest Management" (PURE) two different strategies were tested to reduce the use of synthetic fungicides against B. <b>cinerea</b> in viticulture: <b>i)</b> create a microclimate less favourable to the pathogen, and ii) use of Biological Control Agents (BCAs). The first strategy was tested at the Julius Kühn-Institute in Siebeldingen (Germany) in the grape growing seasons 2011 and 2012. Manual defoliation of the berry zone was performed before and after flowering to modify the bunch structure of compact varieties and at veraison to enhance ventilation of the berry zone during ripening. Defoliation was compared with one, two and three synthetic fungicides applications. In 2011, with high disease pressure, the defoliation at flowering was as effective as three botryticide treatments, while in 2012 disease pressure was too low to check differences between defoliation and fungicides. In the second strategy, three different BCAs were applied alone or in combination in 3 vineyards located in different geographical areas of Italy. Bacillus subtilis, Aureobasidium pullulans and Trichoderma atroviride were applied at four critical stages for infection: i) before bunch closure, ii) at veraison, iii) 20 days before harvest, and iv) 3 - 7 days before harvest. In the trials carried out in central Italy, both disease incidence and severity were low (disease severity from 8. 9 to 14. 6) and all treatments gave a good control of the disease in both years, even when applied alone. In the Po Valley vineyard (northern Italy) disease pressure was low in 2011 and nil in 2012; nonetheless, in 2011 bunches treated with the different BCAs were less affected than the untreated ones. The tested BCAs appeared very promising, especially when applied at the right phenological stages of the vines and under a moderate disease pressure. Further data are necessary to confirm these results with higher disease pressure. Combing the use of defoliation and BCAs with models able to predict both the phenological stage of the plants and the risk of infection would lead to optimize the control of bunch rot in grap...|$|R
