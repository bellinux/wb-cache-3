2500|$|Malcolm arrives, having {{decided to}} join the Highlanders (Mura felici, ove il mio ben si aggira! / Dopo pi√π lune io vi riveggo / [...] "Happy walls, that shelter my beloved. After so long I will see her again!"). Alone, he recalls fond {{memories}} of Elena: (Aria: Elena! oh tu, che chiamo!, Deh vola a me un istante / [...] "Elena! you whom I call!, Ah!, fly back to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{come back to me}} and say I love you"). Then he swears he will take her away from the strongest man or die in the attempt. Unseen, Malcolm then watches Elena and her father discussing her upcoming marriage to Rodrigo. She is reluctant, but Douglas orders her to obey his command: (Aria: Taci, lo voglio, e basti / [...] "Be quiet! [...] It is my wish...Show me that you're a daughter worthy of her father"). As he leaves, trumpets announce Rodrigo; Douglas [...] orders Elena to follow him.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} head and looked at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> reflectively.|$|E
60|$|The porter left <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> but {{returned}} shaking his head.|$|E
60|$|And here let <b>me</b> pause <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> {{contemplation of}} this {{interesting}} subject.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>me</b> searchingly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then {{abruptly}} {{took up the}} tale.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} <b>me</b> stupidly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Then he laughed in a silly, {{crackling}} fashion.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> doubtfully, {{and then she}} shook her head.|$|E
60|$|She looked wonderingly at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and then}} {{broke into a}} laugh.|$|E
60|$|He confronted <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{white and}} menacing; then {{suddenly}} he stepped aside.|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} <b>me</b> speechlessly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then, {{out of sheer}} impotency, turned to go.|$|R
60|$|This time I {{certainly}} scored. She {{looked at}} <b>me</b> fixedly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Then she laughed softly.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>moment,</b> {{speechless}} in his utter amazement. Then he swallowed hard.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{as though he}} doubted I should understand.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in silence, the cloud upon his brow deepening.|$|E
60|$|Betteredge stopped, {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> nodded his head, and walked on again.|$|E
60|$|Poirot studied <b>me</b> attentively <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two. Then, to my intense surprise, {{he shook}} his head decidedly.|$|R
60|$|Phaidor {{stood looking}} at <b>me</b> intently <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> No anger showed in her eyes this time, only a pathetic {{expression}} of hopeless sorrow.|$|R
60|$|This little scene touched us all, and Mrs. Aleshine {{afterward}} informed <b>me</b> that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> she hadn't <b>a</b> dry eye in her head.|$|R
60|$|On our way {{upstairs to}} our bed-chambers, Mr. Keller {{detained}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> more.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> with anguish {{in her eyes}} that turned my misery into torture.|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. Will you excuse <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Robert? I want to {{give some}} {{directions}} to my servant.|$|E
6000|$|Beatrice {{disengaged}} {{herself from}} <b>me,</b> stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> trembling, {{and then sat}} down on the turf [...] "I'll just sit down <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment," [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|Something in {{the quality}} of my voice gave her an intimation of unusual gravity. She looked at <b>me</b> {{steadily}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and sat down slowly in my armchair.|$|R
60|$|Gip counselled <b>me</b> mutely <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and then}} in a {{profound}} silence put away the four balls, resumed my reassuring finger, and nerved himself for the next event.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked away}} from <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> My {{question}} seemed to disconcert her, perhaps by reason of its directness.|$|E
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. I'll {{go and get}} it for you, if you'll excuse <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> I {{have one}} upstairs.|$|E
60|$|The {{policeman}} {{stood there}} looking at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then 'e began to laugh till he couldn't stop 'imself.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned her}} {{beautiful}} eyes up toward <b>me</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> did not speak. Then she said: [...] "And they got you out? And {{you are in}} your right mind?" ...|$|R
60|$|Louis {{regarded}} <b>me</b> steadily <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, and I fancied {{that there}} was something of that admiration in his gaze which a cautious man sometimes feels for the foolhardy.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned his}} face away from me, and said no more until {{we arrived at the}} station. There, he drew <b>me</b> aside <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> out of hearing of the strangers about us.|$|R
60|$|The Elfin suddenness {{with which}} she pounced upon me with this question, and a searching look, quite disconcerted <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{with an air}} of perplexity, as if she really could not {{remember}} whom I was.|$|E
60|$|James of the Glens {{turned to}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and greeted me courteously enough: the next {{he had turned}} to Alan.|$|E
6000|$|This cool snub rasped me all over, but {{it seemed}} to subjugate <b>me,</b> too, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> The pygmy {{contemplated}} me awhile with his weasel eyes, and then said, in a peculiarly sneering way: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{regarded}} <b>me</b> steadfastly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{under his}} wrinkled brows, {{and then his}} expression softened to a smile. He pointed to a chair beside the table. [...] "I am writing," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|He {{continued}} to glare at <b>me,</b> but <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> made no movement, probably {{because he knew}} not what to do next. I watched him very much as a mouse may watch a cat.|$|R
