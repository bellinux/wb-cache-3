The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur {{astronomer}} the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> other causes.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a third type of cone. However, {{this appears to be}} an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
5|$|Neither the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle nor Æthelweard's Chronicon makes {{mention of}} Sitric {{in the years}} 921924, i.e. between his {{installation}} as King of Northubmria {{and the death of}} Edward the Elder. However, there are coins in existence which were minted at Lincoln during the period that bear Sitric's name. These are an important piece of evidence since they suggest Sitric ruled a large area south of the Humber, a claim contradicted by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which says that all the 'Danes' in Mercia (i.e. south of the Humber) submitted to Edward in 918. These coins might indicate Viking reconquest of a large area in the years 921924, which if it did happen went unremarked upon by the Chronicle. Edward's control of Mercia likely stretched the kingdom's resources to breaking point, allowing Sitric to exploit the ill-will towards Edward that existed among the populace there, with Edward being unable to effectively oppose Sitric. Downham suggests that the silence of the Chronicle <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Edward's failing power in the latter years of his reign, and its tendency to only record successes and not failures. His death in 924 is not recorded by a number of important Frankish, Welsh and Irish annals, suggesting a fall in importance and standing from the zenith of his power in 920.|$|E

25|$|Exposure to the Borrelia {{bacterium}} during Lyme disease possibly {{causes a}} long-lived and damaging inflammatory response, {{a form of}} pathogen-induced autoimmune disease.

25|$|Chloroplasts {{can serve}} as {{cellular}} sensors. After detecting stress in a cell, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which {{can serve as}} defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling—signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{consensus}} for the precise naming of either the different versions, or of the movements, or the numbering of the movements. Different recordings tend to follow different naming conventions. While this partly <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the English translation from the original French names, some recordings of the orchestral suites even avoid referring to the tale by just calling the movements by their tempo markings (i.e., Adagio, Allegro, etc.) or {{the name of the}} musical form (Scherzo, Rondo, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Dedicated {{regions of}} the brain are {{specialized}} for given functions. Increased cross-talk between regions specialized for different functions {{may account for the}} many types of synesthesia. For example, the additive experience of seeing color when looking at graphemes <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> cross-activation of the grapheme-recognition area and the color area called V4 (see figure). This is supported by the fact that grapheme-color synesthetes are able to identify the color of a grapheme in their peripheral vision even when they cannot consciously identify the shape of the grapheme.|$|E
25|$|After 1616, {{there is}} no further record which {{specifically}} relates to Jones's Mayflower until 1624. This is unusual for a ship trading to London, as it would not usually disappear from the records {{for such a long}} time. And no Admiralty court document can be found relating to the pilgrim fathers' voyage of 1620, although this <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the unusual way in which the transfer of the pilgrims was arranged from Leyden to New England.

25|$|After 1922, {{experimental}} interest increased, {{particularly in}} the groups led by Millikan at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, and by Gossling at the General Electric Company in London. Attempts to understand autoelectronic emission included plotting experimental current-voltage (i - V) data in different ways, {{to look for a}} straight-line relationship. Current increased with voltage more rapidly than linearly, but plots of type (log(i) vs. V) were not straight. Schottky suggested in 1923 that the effect <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> thermally induced emission over a field-reduced barrier. If so, then plots of type (log(i) vs. V1/2) should be straight; but they were not. Nor is Schottky's explanation compatible with the experimental observation of only very weak temperature dependence in CFE – a point initially overlooked.|$|E
