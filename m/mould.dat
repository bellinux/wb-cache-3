5|$|A <b>mould</b> {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the <b>mould</b> when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or <b>mould</b> gates, are located below the parting line or <b>mould</b> surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} <b>mould</b> on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the <b>mould)</b> from the runner system on ejection from the <b>mould.</b> Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the <b>mould</b> (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the <b>mould.</b>|$|E
5|$|More complex {{parts are}} formed using more complex moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the <b>mould</b> is opened, the slides are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary <b>mould</b> half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the <b>mould</b> opens. The part is then ejected and the <b>mould</b> closes. The closing action of the <b>mould</b> causes the slides to move forward along the angle pins.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in <b>mould</b> making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened <b>mould</b> by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the <b>mould,</b> followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the <b>mould</b> surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and <b>mould</b> causes spark erosion of the <b>mould</b> surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E

5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection <b>mould</b> of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the <b>mould</b> closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the <b>mould</b> cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the <b>mould</b> opens and the part is ejected.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{determination}} of the initial process parameter settings for injection <b>moulding</b> is mainly performed by <b>moulding</b> personnel, {{and the effectiveness of}} the parameter setting is largely dependent on the experience of these personnel.

40|$|Rotational <b>moulding</b> is {{a process}} {{with a range of}} unique benefits, {{currently}} experiencing significant growth within industry. A primary limitation of the process, however, is the restricted range of suitable materials and the subsequent limitations placed upon the mechanical performance of rotationally <b>moulded</b> products. The aim of this research project was to develop a rotational <b>moulding</b> material which possessed substantially improved mechanical properties over conventional, rotationally <b>moulded</b> polyethylene grades. This was attempted through the development of a fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composite which was amenable to the rotational <b>moulding</b> process. Although the development of rotationally <b>moulded</b> composites has been previously reported in literature, these materials have largely proven to be unsatisfactory in terms of mechanical performance. The composite material developed here is distinct from those previously reported in that it utilises melt-compounded composite granules of a significantly larger size than are normally considered suitable for rotational <b>moulding.</b> These granules are intended to be <b>moulded</b> as an inner layer within a rotationally <b>moulded</b> product, with the outer <b>moulded</b> layer formed from conventional, unfilled polymer powder. In this way, the average length of the fibres within the <b>moulded</b> article is maximised while retaining the benefits of the melt-compounding process and giving an excellent external <b>moulded</b> finish. In order to achieve a sufficient degree of composite granule flow and coalescence during rotational <b>moulding,</b> it was found necessary to base the composite granules on high melt-flow, injection <b>moulding</b> grades of polypropylene and polyethylene. The most successful of the resultant composite materials was shown to be superior to the previously utilised rotational <b>moulding</b> grade of unfilled, high-density polyethylene by approximately 65 % in offset yield strength (0. 5 % offset) and over 95 % in tensile modulus...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to determine the deterioration of <b>moulding</b> sand properties as it is used continually for casting. This is because a lot energy and time is put into the reclamation of <b>moulding</b> sands in the foundry due to its deterioration thereby leading to the production of castings with defects. To be able to determine the deterioration level, three <b>moulding</b> sand samples were collected within Niger State of Nigeria from three locations of Bida, Tagwai and Zungeru and investigated for the deterioration of their <b>moulding</b> properties after fifty consecutive numbers of casting operations. The deterioration level was determined by testing the <b>moulding</b> properties of the sands after usage and compared to the properties of the <b>moulding</b> sands before casting operations. The results obtained after fifty number of casting operations showed that all the sand samples deteriorated in their <b>moulding</b> properties as the number of castings increased with Tagwai <b>moulding</b> sand showing the least level of deterioration compared to those of Bida and Zungeru.

5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the <b>mould</b> closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the <b>mould,</b> and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the <b>mould</b> closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E
