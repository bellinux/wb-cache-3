This mutant, G 978, showed broad-spectrum resistance to BB and blast but did not exhibit LM under normal greenhouse conditions. We characterized the level of resistance of this mutant by artificial inoculation and by field evaluation at both vegetative and reproductive stages. Genetic analyses showed that the mutation is controlled by a recessive gene. By genotyping the phenotypic extremes of a recombinant population, we mapped the G 978 mutation onto a short segment on chromosome 12. Whole-genome gene expression analysis of the mutant revealed 12 down-regulated genes within the <b>mapped</b> <b>interval.</b> Gene expression and co-segregation analysis further delimit the region, leading to identification of a candidate gene that co-segregated with the gain-of-resistance phenotype. The genetically and phenotypically defined mutant provides a vehicle for investigating the important genes responsible for non-race-specific resistance to two distinct diseases.|$|E
40|$|Pinpointing culprit causal {{variants}} along signal {{peaks of}} genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is challenging. To overcome confounding effects of multiple independent variants {{at such a}} locus and narrow the interval for causal allele capture, we developed an approach that maps local shared haplotypes harboring a putative causal variant. We demonstrate our method in an extreme isolate founder population, the pacific Island of Kosrae. We analyzed plasma plant sterol (PPS) levels, a surrogate measure of cholesterol absorption from the intestine, where previous studies have implicated 2 p 21 mutations in the ATP binding cassette subfamily G members 5 or 8 (ABCG 5 or ABCG 8) genes. We have previously reported that 11. 1 % of the islanders are carriers of a frameshift ABCG 8 mutation increasing PPS levels in carriers by 50 %. GWAS adjusted for this mutation revealed genomewide significant signals along 11 Mb around it. To fine-map this signal, we detected pairwise identity-by-descent haplotypes using our tool GERMLINE and implemented a clustering algorithm to identify haplotypes shared across multiple samples with their unique shared boundaries. A single 526 -kb haplotype mapped strongly to PPS levels, dramatically refining the <b>mapped</b> <b>interval.</b> This haplotype spans the ABCG 5 /ABCG 8 genes, is carried by 1. 8 % of the islanders, and results in a striking 100 % increase of PPS in carriers. Resequencing of ABCG 5 in these carriers found a D 450 H missense mutation along the associated haplotype. These findings exemplify the power of haplotype analysis for mapping mutations in isolated populations and specifically for dissecting effects of multiple variants of the same locus...|$|E

Involvement of known adCORD genes was excluded by microsatellite (STR) genotyping and linkage analysis. Subsequently, two independent total-genome scans using STR markers and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were performed. Haplotype analysis revealed a single 6. 7 -Mb novel locus between markers D 10 S 1757 and D 10 S 1782 {{linked to the}} disease phenotype on chromosome 10 q 26. Linkage analysis gave a maximum LOD score of 3. 31 for five fully informative STR markers within the linked interval corresponding to the expected maximum in the family. Multipoint linkage analysis of SNP genotypes yielded a maximum parametric linkage score of 2. 71 with markers located in the same chromosomal interval. There is no previously mapped CORD locus in this interval, and therefore the data reported here is novel and likely to identify a new gene that may eventually contribute to new knowledge on the pathogenesis of this condition. Sequencing of several candidate genes within the <b>mapped</b> <b>interval</b> led to negative findings {{in terms of the}} underlying molecular pathogenesis of the disease in the family.

40|$|The mup- 4 locus is {{a member}} of a class of genes {{essential}} for embryonic body wall muscle positioning in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our characterizations demonstrate that mup- 4 is essential and support that mup- 4 is unique among embryonic muscle position-affecting genes. The mup- 4 phenotype is variably expressed and three discrete arrest phenotypes arise in the stage of development during which the worm elongates from a ball of cells to its worm shape. A small proportion of mutants arrest during early stages of elongation, either before elongation has occurred or in mid-elongation, whereas most mup- 4 mutants arrest after elongation is essentially complete. Mutants that arrest after elongation display catastrophic displacement of dorsal and ventral muscle cells and a characteristic kinked body shape due to muscle position abnormalities (the Mup phenotype). Intriguingly, genetic mosaic analysis of mup- 4 mutants supports that mup- 4 gene function is in the hypodermis (epidermis) of the worm, a tissue with which muscle interacts. Furthermore, phenotypic characterizations reveal that mutants have defects in hypodermis integrity and morphology. Genetic and deficiency mapping placed mup- 4 into a 100 kb physical interval. Transformation rescue attempts using cosmids and YACs from the <b>mapped</b> <b>interval</b> did not rescue the locus. In this interval we have identified a candidate gene, mrp- 1, based on a predicted ORF. This gene is predicted to have motifs consistent with possible functions of mup- 4 and is homologous to another C. elegans gene which affects muscle position. We have undertaken approaches to determine if mrp- 1 is mup- 4. We discuss models for the function of mup- 4 in the hypodermis during morphogenesis and in maintenance of muscle position. We also discuss possible function of the candidate gene in our models. ...|$|E
40|$|The PPCD 1 mouse, a {{spontaneous}} mutant that arose in our mouse colony, {{is characterized by}} an enlarged anterior chamber resulting from metaplasia of the corneal endothelium and blockage of the iridocorneal angle by epithelialized corneal endothelial cells. The presence of stratified multilayered corneal endothelial cells with abnormal patterns of cytokeratin expression are remarkably similar to those observed in human posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) and the sporadic condition, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. Affected eyes exhibit epithelialized corneal endothelial cells, with inappropriate cytokeratin expression and proliferation over the iridocorneal angle and posterior cornea. We have termed this the "mouse PPCD 1 " phenotype and mapped the mouse locus for this phenotype, designated "Ppcd 1 ", to a 6. 1 Mbp interval on Chromosome 2, which is syntenic to the human Chromosome 20 PPCD 1 interval. Inheritance of the mouse PPCD 1 phenotype is autosomal dominant, with complete penetrance on the sensitive DBA/ 2 J background and decreased penetrance on the C 57 BL/ 6 J background. Comparative genome hybridization has identified a hemizygous 78 Kbp duplication in the <b>mapped</b> <b>interval.</b> The endpoints of the duplication are located in positions that disrupt the genes Csrp 2 bp and 6330439 K 17 Rik and lead to duplication of the pseudogene LOC 100043552.

Seven fault modeled surfaces created from mapped seismic horizons in Agbada Formation were depth converted with pseudo interval velocities generated from layer cake velocity model to analyze the effects of structural deformations on depositional pattern. Results obtained indicates that depositional and tectonic control of clastic reservoir developments are mainly influenced by thickness and weight of the prograding clastic sediments, the shale diapirs geometry that triggered up fault formations and mini basins, {{the shape of the}} faults, the proximity of sediments load to the mobile shale layer, and the rate of basin creations, deposition and destructions of accommodation space. The stacked onlap relationship and stacked erosional channel observed in seismic and well data suggest that the geometry of the shale structures influences sedimentation patterns. Evidences from structural contours and reflection intensity maps reveal complex structural deformations at increasing depth and proximity to the mobile Akata shale. The presence of roll over anticline at the downthrown side of fault F 1, Fault F 7 and F 3 suggest that the upwelling of Akata shale triggers up the creation and destruction of accommodation space. Results from time slices, reflection intensity and their cross sections shows that sand deposits with high amplitude are trapped at the roll over structures at the downthrown block of growth fault, F 3, F 1 and synthetic faults F 7, and that the formation of fault, F 3, F 1 and F 7 with respect to thick prograding delta front has created ‘graben’ like depression most likely due to changes in slope equilibrium profile by the uprising mobile shale layer. Turbidity current by hydraulic jump model emanating from these topographic highs has been proposed to fill these basins. Evidences from window based isochore thickness map shows that increasing sediment thickness is associated with the downthrown side of fault F 3, F 1 and F 7 where roll over anticline structures are formed and grows larger within areas where great fault interplays occurs. As analyzed from root mean square (RMS) and maximum amplitude, higher amplitudes occurs mostly at the roll over structures at the downthrown side of fault F 3, F 1 and synthetic faults F 7. The ratification of the roll over structures at the downthrown block of growth fault F 3, F 1 and synthetic faults F 7 as reservoir sand deposits by seismic modeling attributes is further validated by critical evaluation of the gamma ray and resistivity logs at this <b>mapped</b> <b>interval.</b> Results shows that these sedimentary fills are mainly channel fills, distributaries channel fill, tidal channel and point bar, stacked vertically with an upward coarsening sequence which are generally blocky, cylindrical shaped, with sharp contact at the top and base to the shale interval.

40|$|A major {{objective}} for geneticists is {{to decipher}} genetic architecture of traits associated with agronomic importance. However, {{a majority of}} such traits are complex, and their genetic dissection has been traditionally hampered {{not only by the}} number of minor-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) but also by genome-wide interacting loci with little or no individual effect. Soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) seed isoflavonoids display a broad range of variation, even in genetically stabilized lines that grow in a fixed environment, because their synthesis and accumulation are affected by many biotic and abiotic factors. Due to this complexity, isoflavone QTL mapping has often produced conflicting results especially with variable growing conditions. Herein, we comparatively mapped soybean seed isoflavones genistein, daidzein, and glycitein by using several of the most commonly used <b>mapping</b> approaches: <b>interval</b> <b>mapping,</b> composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping,</b> multiple <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> and a mixed-model based composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping.</b> In total, 26 QTLs, including many novel regions, were found bearing additive main effects in a population of RILs derived from the cross between Essex and PI 437654. Our comparative approach demonstrates that statistical mapping methodologies are crucial for QTL discovery in complex traits. Despite a previous understanding of the influence of additive QTL on isoflavone production, the role of epistasis is not well established. Results indicate that epistasis, although largely dependent on the environment, is a very important genetic component underlying seed isoflavone content, and suggest epistasis as a key factor causing the observed phenotypic variability of these traits in diverse environments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Accurate genetic {{maps are}} {{required}} for successful and efficient linkage mapping of disease genes. However, most available genome-wide genetic maps were built using only small collections of pedigrees, and therefore have large sampling errors. A large set of genetic studies genotyped by the NHLBI Mammalian Genotyping Service (MGS) provide appropriate data for generating more accurate maps. Results We collected a large sample of uncleaned genotype data for 461 markers generated by the MGS using the Weber screening sets 9 and 10. This collection includes genotypes for over 4, 400 pedigrees containing over 17, 000 genotyped individuals from different populations. We identified and cleaned numerous relationship and genotyping errors, as well as verified the marker orders. We used this dataset to test for population-specific genetic maps, and to re-estimate the genetic map distances with greater precision; standard errors for all intervals are provided. The map-interval sizes from the European (or European descent), Chinese, and Hispanic samples are in quite good agreement with each other. We found one <b>map</b> <b>interval</b> on chromosome 8 p with a statistically significant size difference between the European and Chinese samples, and several <b>map</b> <b>intervals</b> with significant size differences between the African American and Chinese samples.

For this purpose a RAPD linkage map {{was developed for}} the hybrids (LOD= 3 and r= 0. 40) containing 52 markers and 12 linkage groups. Traits related to wood quality and growth were evaluated in the QTL analyses. QTL analyses were performed using chi-square tests, single-marker, <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> and composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> analyses. All approaches led to the identification of similar QTLs associated with wood density, cellulose pulp yield and percentage of extractives, which were detected and confirmed by both the <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> and composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> methodologies. Some QTLs regions were confirmed only by the composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> methodology: percentage of soluble lignin, percentage of insoluble lignin, CBH and total height.

In order to evaluate the effect of early selection using RAPD molecular data, molecular markers adjacent to QTLs were used genotype selection. The analysis of selection differential values suggests that for all the traits the phenotypic selection at seven years should generate larger genetic gains than early selection assisted by molecular markers and the combination of the strategies should elevate the selection efficiency...|$|R

For the first study, genetic simulation experiments were conducted to address the effects of marker density, method of mapping analysis, and gaps in a marker map on the efficiency of QTL detection and the accuracy of QTL parameter estimation. The simulated genome consisted of seven chromosomes with seven or eight segregating QTL affecting the simulated quantitative trait. A set of six randomly segregating QTL outside the test region was consistently used to represent 40 % of phenotypic variation. An individual QTL or a linkage block of two QTL on a target chromosome contributed 10 % of phenotypic variation. The marker map was either dense (with markers every 4 cM) or sparse (with markers every 20 cM). The gap in the marker map was either 32 cM or 56 cM. <b>Interval</b> <b>mapping</b> and composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> were used to map QTL on the target chromosome. A dense map provided more power of QTL detection, better accuracy of QTL parameter estimation, and higher false-positive error rates for the target chromosome than a sparse <b>map.</b> Composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> provided more power of QTL detection, better accuracy of QTL parameter estimation, and lower false-positive error rates than <b>interval</b> <b>mapping.</b> Presence of a large gap in a marker map affected QTL detection and QTL parameter estimation for a QTL inside or near the gap.
