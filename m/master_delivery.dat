40|$|Despite {{intensive}} research, cancer {{remains one}} of the major causes of worldwide morbidity. It is widely believed, however, that if currently available anti-cancer drugs could be delivered specifically to tumours then the disease would have been <b>mastered.</b> The <b>delivery</b> of prodrug converting enzymes by clostridial spores specifically to the anoxic centres of tumours is one potential delivery mechanism. This is due to the extreme selectivity of spores to germinate solely in the hypoxic regions of tumours. Once germinated, the expression of a prodrug converting enzyme converts a systemical 1 y administered prodrug to a highly toxic drug only in the tumour. Previous studies using Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium beijerinckii as the delivery vehicle highlighted that prodrug converting enzyme expression is only found in tumours. However, no significant anti-tumour affect was observed. Two possible reasons were evolved. Firstly, expression of the prodrug converting enzyme may be low, and/or, secondly, the tumours may not be colonised sufficiently to promote an antitumour effect. Preliminary studies identified that Clostridium sporogenes NCIMB 10696 may represent a more suitable host. Higher spore titres could be prepared and, once administered, higher cell counts are found in the colonised tumours. Prodrug converting enzymes with improved kinetics over pre-existing enzymes have also been identified. Once effective gene transfer systems and expression systems had been developed, suitably high levels of several different prodrug converting enzymes, in particular nitroreductases, were obtained. Initial in vivo studies on one of the early recombinant strains identified a definite anti-tumour effect. Since those initial studies, further improvements to expression have been made. It is hoped that a more significant anti-tumour affect would result from using these improved strains. It is the ultimate aim of CDEPT to have the prodrug converting enzymes integrated into the host genome so as to negate the use of antibiotics. Towards this, studies on the use of both classical and novel integrative technologies have been investigated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The Government has put in place policies such as Performance Management and Developmental System (PMDS) as a gesture of its commitment and seriousness about effecting a better life for all through a business like approach to public service, Unfortunately some governments departments fail to enforce the policy accordingly. This paper is intended to examine the implementation of PMDS within the Department of Education in the North West. A qualitative research was conducted in the Corporate Center (Head Office) of the department. The data was collected from three managers and four staff members, two of whom are union representatives. The correspondence on PMDS and the researcher's observations were also used in this study. The investigation conducted revealed that performance management is not a priority in the department as it is done on an ad ho basis. There are also no specific people appointed to enforce the policy and those supervisors who do not feel like implementing the tool do so. This has a negative impact on the service delivery.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Effective Medicine Control is {{the essence}} of {{pharmaceutical}} service delivery and of financial management in Platinum Health Pharmacies. Platinum Health Pharmacies implement medicine control measures to enhance and optimise service delivery. As Platinum Health Pharmacies deliver a pharmaceutical service as business associates of Anglo Platinum, it serves the same workforce. The requirement of the pharmaceutical service delivery for Anglo Platinum is timely, appropriate and available medicine. Therefore, Platinum Health Pharmacies need to adhere to set criteria, those of ?Good Pharmacy Practice in South Africa? as applied to the control, procurement and prescribing of medication. The ordering and receiving of necessary medication forms {{a significant part of the}} criteria, as this is the source of medication to pharmacies. The subsequent management of medication as inventory and control over recall, storage, excess and disposal of expired medication serves the same purpose. Effective dispensing and distribution methods are therefore mandated to ensure timeously availability of correct medication. Finally, the success of effective medicine control is defined by the accuracy of the stock take ascertaining the results of managerial methods of medication. Platinum Health Pharmacies recorded an overall adherence level of 85 percent to the abovementioned criteria. This is a good indication of a strong, reliable and experienced pharmaceutical workforce that delivers an outstanding pharmaceutical service and is capable of maintaining effective medicine control. Although few shortcomings were identified, it is nevertheless recommended that Platinum Health Pharmacies plan the improvement of their risk management plans, and identify quality improvement projects in areas of medicine procurement. The implementation of key performance indicators, relevant to stock control, is also recommended. These, put into effect will assure optimisation of effective medicine control for Platinum Health Pharmacies, maintaining the benefits of cost containment and cost effective pharmaceutical service <b>delivery.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. HIV/AIDS is the world's {{most urgent}} public health challenge. It {{is the leading}} cause of death for young adults worldwide. There is as yet no vaccine and no cure. The high {{unemployment}} rate and poverty experienced in South Africa contribute to the high HIV/AIDS infection levels experienced in the country. With the vast majority of HIV/AIDS cases and the growth in the number of people infected who will look towards publicly funded hospitals for medical care, the financial strain on government hospitals and pharmacies will be severe, not only as a result of the sheer number of people seeking healthcare, but also because healthcare for HIV/AIDS patients is more expensive than for most other conditions. Antiretroviral treatment is the main type of treatment for HIV/AIDS. It is not a cure, but it can stop people from becoming ill for many years. The treatment consists of drugs that have to be taken every day for the rest of a patient's life. Antiretroviral treatment has complex and rigorous dosing requirements. The aim of antiretroviral treatment is to keep the amount of HIV/AIDS in the body at a low level. This stops any weakening of the immune system and allows it to recover from any damage that HIV/AIDS might have caused already. Medication compliance means taking the medications exactly as prescribed by the doctor for the amount of time intended. Medication noncompliance, on the other hand, means taking medications in any way other than what the doctor prescribed. While noncompliance may not seem like a big deal, it can have serious consequences. The challenge of optimizing adherence to anti-retroviral treatment remains paramount in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The purpose of this study is to establish the cost of a patient defaulting anti-retroviral treatment per month, and to determine the financial and economic impact that defaulting patients has on General de la Rey and Thusong Hospital Complex Pharmacies. The study further aims to prove that the risk of patient defaulting is a barrier to achieve organisational excellence through healthcare <b>delivery.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The Public Service Regulations (PSR) 2001, Part VIII, {{introduced}} a performance management and development {{model for the}} South African Public Service. This model's main aim is to manage performance in a consultative, supportive and non-discriminatory manner {{in order to enhance}} organisational efficiency and effectiveness, accountability for the use of resources and the achievement of results. It is necessary for the public sector institutions to have performance management systems in place in order to measure the overall performance of the institutions. Such systems should also assist to identify skills gaps or training needs amongst employees. A comprehensive Performance Management System (PMS) should be linked with the human resource development within institutions in order to close the skills gaps by sending employees for training. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} analyse the main perceptions of employees and to determine their level of awareness regarding the PMS and its implementation. To reach this primary objective, a number of secondary objectives were considered as relevant. These include exploring the principles, theories and models of Performance Management; identifying the typical elements that should be included in a comprehensive Performance Management System; analysing the statutory and regulatory guidelines pertaining to the development and implementation of a PMS in the South African Public Service; identifying typical challenges that responsible managers in the Office of the Premier experience in the implementation of the PMS; and developing guidelines and recommendations for a more effective implementation of the PMS to enhance best practice and statutory compliance as well as to overcome typical challenges currently experienced with its implementation. The research was conducted at the Office of the Premier in the Limpopo Province. It comprised of a literature study and an empirical survey using a questionnaire to obtain information from selected staff members and managers. Respondents were tested on their perceptions regarding the implementation of the PMS in the Office of the Premier. The findings demonstrated that the existence of performance management system does not guarantee automatic perfection in performance. The merit is how effective an institution can apply performance management in combination with an entire set of functional policies, systems and instruments to improve its impact on service <b>delivery.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R

The vehicle driving {{public participation}} is the system of Ward Committees. legislations such as White Paper on Local Government and the Constitution obligate municipalities to involve communities in facilitating development. Participation {{is an essential part}} of local democracy and is a statutory prerequisite for the local community to be drawn into decision-making through processes such as the integrated development planning. The task of Mafube Local Municipality is not only to provide services that encourage sustainable living standards but, to also guarantee that the Mafube community is involved in council strategies and activities that affect the lives of local community. The study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of ward committees in becoming partners in the developmental role of Mafube Local Municipality. For the purpose of the study, hypothesis was formulated that ward committees are necessary mechanisms for facilitating service delivery and yet social and administrative challenges confront their efficient functioning at Mafube Local Municipality which needs to be resolved. To test the hypothesis, empirical research method of open ended questionnaires and interviews was used to test attitudes and perceptions of councillors, ward committees and the community of Mafube Local Municipality on the effectiveness of ward committees. Amongst other findings, it was found that: * Ward committees as community structures are well known by the community of Mafube. * Ward committees need an on-going training with regard to their roles and responsibilities so that they are empowered to execute their duties as is required of them. * The literacy level among certain ward committee members poses a challenge in enabling them to understand municipal programmes or projects. * Public participation is viewed as consultation because there is minimal participation of the community during the planning and decision making of the municipal programmes or projects. * Majority of community members do not attend ward or public meetings. * Elections of ward committees are sometimes not fair and transparent, depending on political affiliation.

40|$|M Development and Management (Public Management and Governance), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 This study {{concentrates}} on the strategic framework of quality assurance in the South African health sector. The study focused the Community Health Centres (CHCs) situated in the Emfuleni Local Municipality (ELM). The study aimed to analyse the administrative issues of a quality assurance programme for promoting patient satisfaction and safety in the CHCs of the ELM. The position of patients in the health services emanates from the provision made by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act of 1996 (hereafter „the Constitution‟). Two of {{the objectives of the}} Constitution are to “provide services that are sustainable” and to “promote a safe and healthy environment”. In addition the health care sector in South Africa also places patients at the forefront. The Constitution also makes provision whereby municipalities are required to encourage the involvement of communities in the affairs of the local government. Patient satisfaction represents intense interest in giving voice to the patients in the developed world, whereas patients in the developing countries have very little voice. Quality assurance is defined as a process which ensures that any product or service meets a required standard which has been set. Quality assurance as a process can be compared to the framework of a house and the foundation is always linked to customer needs. Quality Assurance as a tool strives to establish and maintain quality improvement activities which are integral and sustainable part in any organization. The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate main models, approaches and indicators used to implement a quality assurance programme within the CHC‟s. The study also provides ecommendations of how quality could be improved, based on the perception of the service users. For this study, a qualitative technique was used for data collection. A qualitative method was also used to report statistical data provided in Chapter 4. The objectives were realised by means of literature reviews, interviews and field work. The study found that a quality assurance programme is meaningful and has reached the needs of the patients. Access to the CHCs was impressive as the services offered were generally of good quality. However, the participants still does not understand the role of the CHCs. The CHCs was established to offer services which are closer to the people as compared to public hospitals. The hospitals provide chronic patient treatment with specialised resources (staff and equipment) whereas the CHCs offer acute treatment. The staff complement was assuring whereby there is a medical doctor allocated to each facility. Many community members still need to be educated about the services offered in the CHCs. Such awareness would empower the health service users about the benefits of the CHCs and to retain public trust for improved health service <b>delivery.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|MSc (Pharmaceutics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{available}} literature {{indicates that}} to date, few {{research has been}} performed on oil powders for topical delivery. The aim of this project {{was to investigate the}} release characteristics of oil powder formulations, as well as their dermal and transdermal delivery properties. Whey protein-stabilised emulsions were used to develop oil powders. Whey protein was used alone, or in combination with chitosan or carrageenan. Nine oil powders, with salicylic acid as the active ingredient, were formulated by using the layer-by-layer method. Three different pH values (pH 4, 5 and 6) were used to prepare the formulations, because of the different charges that polymeric emulsifiers may have. The characteristics of the prepared oil powders were determined, including their droplet sizes, particle size distributions, loss on drying, encapsulation efficiencies, oil leakage and water dispersibility. Release studies (membrane diffusion studies) were conducted by utilising cellulose acetate membranes (0. 2 μm pore size) and Franz-type diffusion cells over a period of eight hours. The release of the active ingredient was determined for all nine powders, their respective template emulsions, as well as their respective oil powders redispersed in water. The release of salicylic acid from the respective redispersed oil powders was then further compared to its release from the template emulsions and from the oil powders. The effect of pH and different polymer types used in preparing the oil powders, their respective redispersed oil powders and the template emulsions were determined with regards to the release of the active ingredient from all these preparations. The effect of pH and different polymers used was furthermore determined on the oil powders and their respective redispersed oil powders, with regards to their dermal and transdermal deliveries. Transdermal delivery and skin uptake were investigated on specifically selected powders only, based on the outcomes of the oil powder characterisation and release data. The qualifying formulations were chitosan pH 4, 5 and 6, whey and carrageenan pH 6 oil powders, together with their respective redispersed oil powders in water. Human abdominal skin was dermatomed (thickness 400 μm) for use in the diffusion studies. Franz-type diffusion cells were used over a period of 24 hours. The results of the membrane release studies indicated that the oil powders had achieved a significantly higher release than their respective redispersed oil powders. The release of salicylic acid from the redispersed oil powders and from their respective emulsions was similar. The transdermal delivery test outcomes showed that the effect of pH could have been influenced by the degree of ionisation, resulting in a decrease in permeation with increasing ionisation of salicylic acid, in accordance with the pH partition hypothesis. Furthermore, biopolymers, such as chitosan had demonstrated a penetration enhancing effect, which had led to the enhanced dermal and transdermal delivery of salicylic acid. A correlation was also found between the powder particle size and transdermal <b>delivery.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010. Within the South African {{framework}} of transition, constitutional development {{and of the}} Municipal Systems Act of 2000, the Integrated Development Planning and budgeting processes represent a significant shift away from past planning approaches in South Africa. Hitherto, planning systems were largely technocratic,sectoral and failed to incorporate the views of local people. The current aim is to create Effective and efficient government systems and to integrate the various administrations of the constituent local governments into the new consolidated local governments. Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM), {{one of the largest}} metropolitan municipalities in the country was a case study to examine this shift away from the past planning approaches to the new integrated approach. For the purpose of this study, integrated approach to service delivery is described as a process to ensure that the objectives and policies determined by the legislature will be uniformly interpreted and applied by all departments in municipal entity. Integrated development planning, budget reviews and performance monitoring systems focus on alleviating poverty and addressing past injustices and inequities through identification of programmes and projects that respond to the needs and priorities of local communities. There is a strong move towards a more integrated and participatory approach to local planning with varying success at incorporating sustainability principles throughout the process. The Municipal Systems Act makes it mandatory that all sectors and interested parties be consulted, and that has led to improved communication and cooperation between different spheres of government and the newly established local authority structures. Along with IDPs as the primary planning tool, Systems Act signify the deepening of democracy and good governance as it is mandatory for the participation of communities and various stakeholders through the ward committees. For the purpose of this study, a hypothesis was formulated that: IDP, Budgetary Planning and SDBIP are mutually dependent and key strategic thrusts in realizing the objectives of public finance within the local government context and yet, ineffective service delivery in EMM results from the inability to integrate its development plan, budget and service delivery budget implementation plans. To validate the hypothesis, theoretical exposition of concepts IDP, budget and service delivery budget implementation plan were explained. Empirical study was conducted which showed that, at Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality: • There is an understanding of the importance of aligning planning systems, • Processes, systems and mechanisms to integrate all the planning systems are established, these are not effective because they are partially or not fully implemented, • Departments function independently. Communication systems and plans are developed; they are not effective, because new procedures are not communicated. Where these are, there is no guideline documentation. • There is much interference in the administrative functions by politicians. Officials who are responsible for budgets are not given space to perform their duties effectively without the influence of external or political thrust. The study concludes with recommendations for action to be taken by the Municipality towards the improvement of service <b>delivery.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|M, Development and Management, Public Management and Administration, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 The {{study is}} based on the context of project management; the {{discipline}} which employs skills and knowledge to achieve project goals through various project activities. The study concentrates on project management applications to deliver low cost houses (LCH) in the Metsimaholo Local Municipality (MLM). The main purpose of project management application is to enable project managers to track the progress of a project that they are working on. Institutions working on a very large project require project management applications to give periodic updates on the progress of the work that is being done on a project. By using a project management application, the process is made somewhat easier, in the sense that a project manager can just refer and check on the progress him/herself. Provision of adequate housing for the homeless and others who are inadequately housed in an attempt to reduce poverty and improve quality of people’s life has been a huge challenge to the South African government, particularly in the MLM over the years. Globally, legislators on the physical infrastructure of Parliament are pushing for the urgent construction of LCH by the government. The abovementioned challenge has resulted in an enormous housing backlog with poverty, unemployment, economic stagnation and negative behaviour. Financial constrains are seen to escalate costs and this makes the task even more enormous. The hypothesis for this study indicated that MLM does not possess sufficient institutional capacity to implement project management for the effective delivery of low cost housing. The hypothesis and research objectives of the study were validated by means of literature review and empirical surveys. Thirty-four (34) semi structured questionnaires were used to interview participants in the provision of LCH in MLM. The study is made up of five chapters. The study specifically focused on the application of project management to deliver LCH in the Metsimaholo Local Municipality (MLM). •This study contends that the application of project management in the public service sector to deliver goods and services has not been scientifically applied in a conscience and systematic manner. •In the MLM the national, provincial and the municipality efforts are challenged to provide houses for the homeless. •The increasing population in the MLM has resulted in an enormous housing backlog with poverty, unemployment, and economic stagnation. •The high demand for housing in the MLM brings about financial constrains and makes the task even more enormous. •It is realised through this study that the application of project management is lacking; whereby important pillars of project based outputs such as time, quality and cost are not necessarily the resultant finished products of the community tend to inherit. It is evident from the above that while the MLM has a mandate to provide service delivery it is limited by protocol to take full responsibility in the provision of low cost houses. The provision of LCH requires strengthened co-operative governance in the Free State Province, since the three spheres have important roles to play. In the face of the huge backlogs in housing and human settlement provision, the country urgently needs to develop the technical knowledge and skills necessary to fast track housing <b>delivery.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
40|$|M. Development and Management, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010 Development {{has been}} one of the highly contested phenomenons yielded by various {{conflicting}} perspectives on what it entails, how it should be implemented and who should be its delivery agents and beneficiaries. Against this backdrop, various local and international institutions have engaged in discussions at various levels since 1994 to ensure that the strives benefit the poorest and vulnerable sectors of society who live in conditions of abject poverty, some deprived of access to even basic resources thereby adopt a shift in approach from a welfarist to social development perspective. The latter was based on the premise that in developing countries, the challenge is to establish a people centered framework for social development and to respond to the immediate needs of those who are affected by human distress. As a result, evolution of school of thoughts within the development fraternity unfolded and various method and approaches to implement the process were borne. At the center of these approaches was the sustainable livelihood approach, which is an integrated development method that brings individual approaches together to achieve sustainable development. It also involves an assessment of community assets, adaptive strategies and technologies contributing to livelihood systems, and the analysis of cross-sectoral policies and investment requirements to enhance livelihoods. Such a framework provides a basis for working with people, not only on issues of local concern, but also when developing wider programmes and policies that will impact on communities and civil society organizations. The role of NGOs as a role player in the promotion of sustainable livelihood has never been as critical as it is today. South Africa is continuously faced with stark inequalities across the spectrum. Poverty, social pathologies and community dependency syndrome on welfare service delivery continues to be major indicators that a large percentage of NGOs is still behind with the promotion of sustainable livelihood approach in their deliverance of services to their beneficiaries. This study was undertaken in order to investigate the role of NGOs in promoting sustainable livelihood in Evaton at Emfuleni municipality. For the purpose of this study, the hypothesis is formulated that :NGOs play a very important role in promoting community development through provision of services to the communities in Evaton; yet their service delivery approaches seem trapped in the previous historical evolution of developmental efforts marked by provision of relief as opposed to sustainable livelihood services. In support of the empirical research, use and analysis of a theoretical study of development and sustainable development was undertaken. The analysis showed amongst other things: * The recognition of the need to promote the goals of sustainable development through the newly negotiated people centered approach based on the strengths of an individual, group or community thus recognizing their capacity for growth and development. * The role of NGOs cannot be overemphasized in the achievement of this goal given the general belief that NGOs have become very important and permanent institutions in the implementation of development programmes and projects. * All stakeholders viz: NGOs, private sector and all spheres of government involved in the deliverance of services to the community have to commit resources to ensure that policies, strategies, and programmes are devised in order to improve the quality of life of all people by tackling poverty from all sides through the application of sustainable livelihood approach. • Welfare services and developmental welfare strategies at local level have not been approached in the same way by all social service NGOs. The study ends with recommendations for improvement of NGO service <b>delivery.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R

In today's {{volatile}} business environment, {{the need}} for gauging employee reaction to organisation change is acute. This {{is especially true in}} the changing South African context. The South African Police Service (SAPS) has experienced rapid organisation change, including the nature and style of policing, the cultures, structures, management styles and policies and the practises, amalgamation and affirmative action. In order to transform the SAPS into a professional, efficient and representative service, the management of SAPS need {{to be in touch with}} the employees' reaction to these changes. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of organisational transformation on the morale of SAPS members and to identify contributory factors and direct causes that impact on morale. Literature on the topic of morale leaves the impression that it is an all-inclusive (holistic) concept and the synergistic result of various processes and practises in the work environment. Also central to the question of low morale is the fact that poor police are already feeling their powers curtailed by the new version of section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Act which deals with the right of the police to use lethal force. The Act amounts to a stipulation that police may only use their fire-arms when,they are threatened. The law refers to the use of force "which may result in serious injury or death". In police language, this can only mean the use of firearms. The police feel betrayed by this because in a practical situation, it means the crucial seconds the police use to decide whether the situation calls for "use of force" could mean the difference between life and death. Further that due to the nature of their work, police officials are regularly exposed to extreme danger. And, if the high levels of violent crime in South Africa, the high level of illegal firearms in circulation, the increase on brutality by criminals and the general lack of respect for law and order are taken into consideration, it is small wonder that police officials are, it seems, specifically targeted. It is also explained that transformation is not a once off process but a long-term one to achieve the best results or outcomes through fundamentally different ways of approaching issues and problems. From the current literature it seems that there is at least one commonality among the diverse group of transformation guru's and it is that transformation and change are not the same thing. Transformation should be regarded as the precursor to change; where change is the physical mode of turning things around, and transformation the preparation of the mind set to enable and to facilitate change. The distinction between change and transformation is that change is a function of altering what you are doing, that is, to improve something that is already possible in your reality. Transformation on the other hand is a function of altering the way you are being, that is to create something that is currently not possible in your reality. In the empirical part of this study, information gathered by means of interviews indicated that: • Members were positive around concepts of equal opportunities; • Affirmative action was blamed for feeling of frustration and low levels of motivation; • Negativity against quotas; • Feeling unsafe at the workplace and at home; • There was a common understanding on the definition of morale and elements/signs of low morale; • Uncertainty about career opportunities; • Disillusionment, grounded in continuing discriminatory practises which is fuelled by the relative deprivation of unmet expectations of improvement engendered by a new, non-racial government especially in the Mafikeng area; and • Racism. Based on the findings of this study, practical suggestions are developed aimed at the enhancement of the morale of members for effective and efficient service <b>delivery.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
