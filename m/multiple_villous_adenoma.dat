40|$|Abstract Background A <b>villous</b> <b>adenoma</b> is an {{extremely}} rare benign tumour in the appendix, in contrast to other benign appendiceal lesions. The clinical features are usually asymptomatic. Acute appendicitis {{is the most common}} complication with the lesion obstructing the orifice of the appendiceal lumen. Thus, a <b>villous</b> <b>adenoma</b> is usually found during surgical intervention for acute appendicitis. Mechanical obstruction induced by acute perforated appendicitis has been previously reported. Acute appendicitis caused by a <b>villous</b> <b>adenoma</b> presenting with acute intestinal obstruction has not been previously reported. Case presentation A 78 -year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness. The abdominal plain film and computed tomography revealed an intestinal obstruction. After surgical intervention, the ruptured appendix was shown to be associated with intestinal obstruction. The post-operative pathologic diagnosis was an appendiceal <b>villous</b> <b>adenoma.</b> Conclusions This is the first report describing an appendiceal <b>villous</b> <b>adenoma,</b> which is an occasional cause of perforated acute appendicitis, presenting as a complete intestinal obstruction. We emphasize that in elderly patients without a surgical history, the occult cause of complete intestinal obstruction must be determined. If an appendiceal tumour is diagnosed, an intra-operative frozen section is suggested prior to selecting a suitable method of surgical intervention. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Villous</b> <b>adenomas</b> of the {{urinary tract}} are an uncommon, well-recognized entity, {{described}} in different locations. However, {{the occurrence of}} this lesion in the female urethral diverticulum is very unusual. We present the first case of a recurrent <b>villous</b> <b>adenoma</b> with high-grade dysplasia unassociated with adenocarcinoma, arising from a urethral diverticulum. A 75 -year-old African-American female presented with urethral prolapse complaining of mild voiding difficulty, stress incontinence, and mild spotting of blood. Histological examination revealed a papillary lesion with finger-like processes lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium with abundant goblet cells. There were focal areas with stratification to the luminal surface and loss of nuclear polarity and atypical mitoses, interpreted as <b>villous</b> <b>adenoma</b> with high-grade dysplasia. The lesion recurred at one year without evidence of malignant transformation.

In a study of 81 patients with endoscopically identified colorectal <b>villous</b> <b>adenoma</b> screened for malignancy with transrectal ultrasonography (US), 15 patients {{were excluded because of}} incomplete follow-up. Twelve carcinomas were present, confirmed with either histopathologic examination after surgical resection (n = 9) or biopsies during laser treatment (n = 3).

In 46 of the 54 adenomas transrectal US helped confirm the benign nature of the lesion (specificity, 85 %). Seven of the eight false-positive cases happened to be previously treated with surgery or coagulation.

40|$|Human <b>villous</b> <b>adenomas</b> {{are thought}} to {{represent}} premalignancies that subsequently give rise to colorectal adenocarcinomas. Currently there is no in vivo model in which to study the dedifferentiation and malignant transformation of these tumors. We establish here that human <b>villous</b> <b>adenomas</b> can be successfully engrafted into severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice. Furthermore, these xenografts remain viable for up to 18 mo after either a subcutaneous or intraperitoneal inoculation of the human tissue. Tumors grew slowly and secreted a clear mucinous fluid. Examination of the tumors histologically at 1, 4, and 12 mo after implantation revealed that the villous polypoid structure was maintained and islands of atypical cells were observed within pockets of mucin surrounding the adenomatous tissue. No gross or histologic evidence of malignancy was detected throughout the 20 -mo observation period. The human identity of the cells in the graft was confirmed by DNA in situ hybridization with a human-specific probe.
