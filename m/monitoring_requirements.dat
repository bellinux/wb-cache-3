25|$|Non-stormwater permits {{typically}} include numeric effluent {{limitations for}} specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration {{allowed in the}} discharge, e.g., 30mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes {{a violation of the}} permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular <b>monitoring</b> <b>requirements.</b> Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.|$|E
