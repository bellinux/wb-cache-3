25|$|Technological {{advances}} in weaving with foot-treadle floor looms {{and the use}} of scissors with pivoted blades and handles in the 13-15th century led to new designs. The upper part of dresses could now be tailored exactly to the body. Men′s dresses were buttoned on the front and women′s dresses got a décolletage. The lower part of men′s dresses were much shorter in length than those for women. They were wide cut and often pleated with an A-line so that horse riding became more comfortable. Even a knights armor had a short <b>metal</b> <b>skirt</b> below the breastplate. It covered the straps attaching the upper legs iron cuisse to the breastplate.|$|E

50|$|Screw caps' {{use as an}} {{alternative}} to cork for sealing wine bottles is gaining increasing support. A screw cap is a metal cap that screws onto threads on the neck of a bottle, generally with a <b>metal</b> <b>skirt</b> down the neck to resemble the traditional wine capsule ("foil"). A layer of plastic (often PVDC), cork, rubber, or other soft material is used as wad to make a seal with the mouth of the bottle.|$|E
50|$|Skypans are {{available}} in different densities. Skypans of around 5,000 Watts can provide soft fill light for backdrops and cycloramas (cycs) in television, film and still photography. Skypans of around 10,000 Watts provide soft and even fill light for large backdrops and cycs, while ones rated up to 20,000 Watts would be more suitable for extremely large cycs. Softer fill light can be provided by adding diffusers. Generally, only two accessories are {{used in conjunction with}} the skypan; <b>metal</b> <b>skirts</b> that can be attached to the skypan to direct the spill of light, and gel frames.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} had <b>metal</b> <b>skirting</b> {{along the}} sides, painted aluminum (as were {{the nose and}} smokestack) with red and yellow stripes, these being outlined by black pinstripes; the tenders were similarly decorated. A yellow [...] "Circle and Cross" [...] emblem backed by red [...] "wings" [...] was emblazoned {{across the front of}} the locomotive above the pilot deck, and {{on each side of the}} tender, which also featured a red [...] "wing." [...] The air-conditioned rolling stock was painted aluminum with red and yellow stripes along their sills, bordered with black pinstripes (somewhat like Santa Fe's passenger diesel locomotives). Stripes on the combine unit split into two sets, with one set sweeping up to align with those on the locomotive tenders. Window shades were painted matte aluminum. The sides of the passenger cars bore [...] "SANTA FE" [...] in black, extra extended Railroad Roman letters. The design of the Valley Flyers drumhead was inspired by that of its counterpart, the Golden Gate.|$|R

Its use as an alternative wine closure is gaining increasing support as an alternative to cork for sealing wine bottles. In markets such as Australia and New Zealand screw caps on bottles have overtaken cork to become the most common means of sealing bottles, right across the wine industry.|$|E
50|$|Many {{connectors}} are keyed, {{with some}} mechanical component which prevents mating except with a correctly oriented matching connector. This {{can be used}} to prevent incorrect or damaging interconnections, either preventing pins from being damaged by being jammed in at the wrong angle or fitting into imperfectly fitting plugs, or to prevent damaging connections, such as plugging an audio cable into a power outlet. For instance, XLR connectors have a notch to ensure proper orientation, while Mini-DIN plugs have a plastic projection, which fits into a corresponding hole in the socket and prevent different connectors from being pushed together (they also have a notched <b>metal</b> <b>skirt</b> to provide secondary keying).|$|E
50|$|Mini-DIN {{connectors}} are 9.5 mm {{in diameter}} and come in seven patterns, {{with the number of}} pins from three to nine. Each pattern is keyed {{in such a way that}} a plug with one pattern cannot be mated with any socket of another pattern. An important aspect of why each of these 7 mini-DIN connectors are official standards is because they are each drastically different from the other, with no simultaneously and directly overlapping similarities in (1) pin arrangement, (2) square key size and position, (3) circular shielding <b>metal</b> <b>skirt</b> notches and metallic additions - unlike the nonstandard mini-DIN connectors which may have directly overlapping characteristics to each other or to the standard mini-DIN connectors.|$|E

50|$|The Rimlock (B8A) base is an 8-pin {{design with}} a pin circle {{diameter}} close to noval, {{and uses a}} nub {{on the side of}} the envelope to engage with a guide and retaining spring in the socket wall. This provides pin registration (since the pins are equi-spaced) and also a fair degree of retention. Early tubes with this base type typically had a <b>metal</b> <b>skirt</b> around the lower ~15mm of the envelope to match the socket wall, and this offered a degree of built-in screening, but these were fairly soon replaced by 'skirtless' versions which had a characteristic widening in the glass to compensate physically for the absence of the skirt. In the European naming scheme, rimlock tubes are numbered in the ranges 40-49, 110-119 (with exceptions), and 400-499, e.g. EF40. Although virtually unknown elsewhere, this was a very common base type in European radios of the late 1940s through the 1950s, but was eventually displaced by the ubiquitous B7G and noval (B9A) base types.|$|E
5000|$|The plugs {{consist of}} a {{circular}} shielding <b>metal</b> <b>skirt</b> protecting a number of straight round pins. The pins are 1.45 mm in diameter and equally spaced (at 90°, 72°, 60° or 45° angles) in a 7.0 mm diameter circle. The skirt is keyed {{to ensure that the}} plug is inserted with the correct orientation, and to prevent damage to the pins. The basic design also ensures that the shielding is connected between socket and plug prior to any signal path connection being made. However, as the keying is consistent across all connectors, it does not prevent incompatible connectors from mating, which can lead to damage; this is changed in Mini-DIN, which keys different connectors. Additionally, some [...] "domino" [...] 5-pin connectors had a keyway on opposing sides of the plug, allowing it to be reversed. If used as a headphone connector, that allowed the left and right channels to be transposed, and similarly if used as a serial data connection the transmit and receive lives could be crossed (although the standard pinout adopted by Acorn did not allow for this).|$|E

40|$|In what is termed "modern Australia" {{the concept}} of beauty has always been tied to {{whiteness}} and has been considerably widened over the years. In contemporary Australian society the beauty ideal is uniformly white, thin, young, energetic, fit, healthy, sexualised, smooth-skinned, desirable and "glamorous", whatever glamorous may mean. It is not "black" or Aboriginal, but may be tanned via tanning in the sun or using a solarium or spray booths, skin mousses or lotions to get that "delicious desirable sun-kissed golden glow". This beauty ideal is promoted sometimes unwittingly and sometimes with great cleverness and subtlety. There are few Australian women who could meet this standard let alone Australian Aboriginal women. In reference to what is considered beautiful within the Australian content, race, culture and gender place Aboriginal women in a cultural context of exile. A quick read of journal and newspaper articles, novels and reference books reveals that Aboriginal women are {{more often than not}} portrayed as lacking in complexity, with little depth, exotic and mysterious beings. We are also generally defined as being down to earth and practical creatures of the mundane. There are few if any references to Aboriginal women as being beautiful and an abundant source of references that use classist and racist stereotypes. Once We Mount Armour, Pamela Croft's lithograph print and mixed media portrays the image of the female body. The body is painted black depicting Croft's body and essence. The image is taken from a 1930 s western dressmaker's mannequin, with an attached <b>metal</b> <b>skirt.</b> The skirt explains Croft represents a cage as she understands that if Aboriginal women adopt and become focused on the western image of the body and what is considered beautiful in the Australian context, then this can cage us, trap us. She adds that in being careful not to become trapped and caged we need to protect ourselves with our armour when we venture out into broader Australian society. Our armour is our self-talk, mental imagery, strategies, tactics, support people and the fortification of our spirits. The body image of what is considered beautiful has changed from the 1930 s image, but the image is still white. The white aspects on the body in the lithograph and mixed media depict those elements that are part of our heritage and colonisation. Croft's imagery brings to the forefront that when most mainstream Australian eyes look at body images, they look at the exterior of the body. When looking {{they may or may not}} determine from their gaze that the person who "owns" that body and the image is healthy, well, fit, young, sexualised, glamorous, smooth-skinned and tanned.

5000|$|The TR-85 is a main {{battle tank}} {{designed}} for {{the armed forces of}} Romania. Based on the TR-77-580 (Romanian-built version of the Soviet T-55 tank), the TR-85 tank was developed from 1978 to 1985 and produced from 1986 until 1990. A modernization program was initiated in March 1994 in order to upgrade the TR-85 tanks to NATO standards. The result was the TR-85M1 main battle tank, currently the most modern tank in service with the Romanian Land Forces. Although a further development of the T-55, the TR-85M1 uses a T-block powerpack (similar to the one used in the Leopard 1) based on a V8 German 830 hp diesel engine, an improved turret, a locally-designed [...] "Ciclop" [...] fire control system (with cross-wind sensor, laser rangefinder and night vision), new 100 mm BM-412 Sg APFSDS-T projectiles and a completely redesigned suspension with 6 road wheels on each side, protected by <b>metal</b> side <b>skirts.</b> Combat weight is 50 tons.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} at {{the southwest corner of}} Peru and Johnson Streets is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building. The Old North End neighborhood it stands in is just north of Burlington's central business district, and is densely built with residential buildings. The building is basically rectangular in shape, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A rectangular gabled section projects from the long east side, facing Johnson Street, with a two-story porch extending to the building's northeast corner. One entrance from the porch provides access to two of the building's three units, while the third is accessed from an entrance {{at the opposite end of}} the northern facade, sheltered by a <b>metal</b> hood. The <b>skirt</b> of the second-floor porch is finished in scallop-cut shingles. The interior finishes date primarily from the 1960s, although original staircase railings survive.|$|R
50|$|The armour of the TR-85M1 tank has {{a maximum}} {{thickness}} of 200 mm (multilayered) for the hull and 320 + 20 mm add-on armour on the turret. The 20 mm add-on armour {{on the front}} of the turret has a modular appearance with a triangular profile. Although it might look like bricks of explosive reactive armour, the add-on composite armour is designed this way for easy replacement after combat damage. The tank also has side skirts as a protection against shaped charges. The <b>metal</b> side <b>skirts</b> have three holes each that form steps for the crew to reach the roof hatches. On the sides of the turret there are ammunition boxes for the heavy antiaircraft DShK machine gun. The upper glacis plate has two track segments, while the lower glacis plate can be fitted with steel screens or a mine roller. The TR-85M1 tank also has NBC protection and an improved, rapid fire suppression system using non-toxic agents. The system, designed by L'Hotellier, protects both the crew and the engine compartment using halon. The modernized version adds an additional mine protection plate and a bar for the driver, which increases protection against mines and improvised explosive devices. Also, the older TR-85 tanks have a conventional driver's seat bolted on the floor of the tank, wherereas the M1 version has a parachute-harness like arrangement. In this way, the driver does not have any contact with the hull except on the pedals and is out of the shockwave area of exploding land mines or IEDs.|$|R
40|$|Littlemoor Wishes was a £ 12, 500 Arts Council funded open-call {{commission}} {{to produce an}} art project with the Littlemoor Community in Dorset. The project emerged through discussion with road builders and local councillors, examining {{the ways in which}} local people make visual and narrative connections across the large physical division within their community, which marked the arrival of the new Relief Road. Responding to a renascent interest in craft as it relates to socially engaged art practice the project involves craft based traditions and activist practices, which employ tactics of ‘craftivism’ (a term coined by Betsy Greer combining craft and activism), placing an emphasis on interaction and participation in the wider social realm. The final outcome resulted in three beaded tie clips and laser cut neoprene tags in a small transparent clip seal bag, individually posted to each 2400 Littlemoor households. A pen was provided for collective community writings onto the tags and instructions to tie them to the temporary <b>metal</b> Heras fencing <b>skirting</b> the four mile perimeter of the Relief Road works. The tradition of coming together to make, particularly in terms of textiles as a group endeavour (such as quilting) is co-opted within Littlemoor Wishes, building on previous projects using collective wishes and questions. Subverting the usual praxis of commercial craft kits, Littlemoor Wishes adopts the relational and social nature of crafted objects that disrupt codes of consumerism. Accessed through the constructed Heras fencing the individual voice is re-valued as a creative gesture against a shifting backdrop of road building, igniting collective ownership during a period of significant environmental change within the community. The work became a form of witnessing everyday people’s concerns, and is re-staged for the format of a publication of the same name, University of Huddersfield Press [paperback ISBN 978 186218 082 6; 57 pages]...|$|R
5000|$|Features: - {{the round}} Yamaha logo on the {{headstock}} {{is not a}} decal, it's a die cast metal piece with chrome tuning forks (the Yamaha logo) raised above a black background. You can turn it with your fingers on my guitar but it doesn't come off - you can also see in the picture that the Yamaha brand name appears on the neck plate. This is also chrome and black but is a stamping not a casting. And this isn't actually a neck plate because it doesn't hold the neck on. If you remove the four screws this plate comes off, you will then see the actual neck plate which has four larger screws holding the neck on. The neck plate has a rectangular [...] "window" [...] in it {{to allow you to}} access the truss rod through a hole through the body {{into the back of the}} neck (that's right, the truss is accessed through the back of the neck). - All three pickups are identical. They have adjustable pole piece screws. The black and silver areas that you see are actually the tops of the pickup bobbins themselves. The black and silver areas are covered by a domed clear plastic piece. I took the guitar apart a few years ago to give it a good cleaning. I found that the pickups are not held in place with springs at the height adjustment screws like normal pickups, but instead had a large foam rubber block under the body of each pickup. The fretboard is quite thin. Thin enough that the side dots are actually located on the split line between the fretboard material and the wood of the neck. The guitar's serial number is stamped directly into the fretboard between two of the lower frets. - Yamaha was obviously proud of this guitar, and put their name and logo all over it. Besides the Yamaha name on the tuning machines, it has the Yamaha decal and die cast logo on the headstock, the name and logo on the neck plate and the name and logo are molded into the bridge pickup ring between the two bridge pickups. - The SG2 and SG3 were Yamaha's first electric guitar models, and finish details (as described above) are amazing for a 1965 Japanese guitar. If I lay it down next to my Strat, the Strat looks like a bargain basement model by comparison. Later 1960s models in Yamaha's SG series have far cruder appointments. - As was already noted, the bridge has roller saddles and each saddle is height adjustable. The bridge also has the normal coarse height adjustment screws on each end. There are two sheet metal springs on the ends of the bridge pinching the saddles together so they don't move side-to-side. - The guitar shown here has either a metal or black plastic nut, mine is white plastic. There is, of course, a zero fret. - The string tree is also a good quality chrome plated die casting, not a metal stamping like many guitars of the period. - The main knobs are chrome-plated <b>metal</b> with plastic <b>skirts.</b> As for the roller controls, the mysterious 3rd thumbwheel nearest to the bridge pickup is a balance control for the two bridge pickups. This functions whether the slide switch is in the up or down position. - The remaining two thumbwheels are just like their Fender counterparts; they're a volume control and a tone control that override the main volume and tone controls when the slide switch is in the up position. [...] Supposedly most of them were sold in Japan, and only a few were exported to the US.|$|R
