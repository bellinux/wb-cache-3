5000|$|On 21 September 2007, the {{original}} Pole 1 <b>mercury-arc</b> <b>converter</b> stations were stood down [...] "indefinitely". However, in December 2007, Transpower announced that {{one-half of the}} capacity of Pole 1 would be returned to [...] "warm standby" [...] service before the winter of 2008 {{in order to meet}} the demand for power in the North Island if needed. The remaining half-pole equipment of Pole 1 was to be decommissioned.|$|E
40|$|High {{overload}} capacity, low residual ripple, exact reproducibility of periodic current pulses {{and very}} great reliability in long-term duty are essential requirements {{for a modern}} power supply system for feeding beam-guide magnets. These requirements can be met with certainty and at reasonable cost {{by the use of}} high-performance single-anode <b>mercury-arc</b> <b>converters</b> with suitable electronic control and protective equipment.

50|$|In 1992, the {{original}} mercury-arc equipment was paralleled {{to create a}} single pole (Pole 1), and a new thyristor-based pole (Pole 2) was commissioned alongside it. The transmission lines and submarine cables were also upgraded to double the link's maximum capacity to 1240 MW. The <b>mercury-arc</b> valve <b>converter</b> equipment was partially decommissioned in 2007, and fully decommissioned in August 2012. Replacement thyristor converter stations (to be known as Pole 3) entered into service on 30 May 2013. Further work to Pole 2 will bring the link's capacity to 1200MW {{by the end of}} the year.|$|R
50|$|The HVDC link was {{commissioned}} in 1965 as a Â±250 kV, 600 MW bipolar HVDC scheme using <b>mercury-arc</b> valve <b>converters,</b> and was {{originally designed to}} transfer surplus South Island hydroelectric power northwards to the more populous North Island. In 1976, the control system of the original scheme was modified to allow power to be sent in the reverse direction, from Haywards to Benmore.The HVDC link provides North Island consumers {{with access to the}} South Island's large hydro generation capacity, which may be important for the North Island during peak winter periods. For South Island consumers, the HVDC link provides access to the North Island's thermal generation capacity, which is important for the South Island during dry periods. Without the HVDC link, more generation would be needed in both the North and South Islands. In addition, the HVDC link is essential for the electricity market, as it allows generators in the North and South Islands to compete, putting downward pressure on prices and minimising the need to invest in costly new generating stations. The HVDC link also plays an important part in allowing renewable energy sources to be managed between the two islands.|$|R
