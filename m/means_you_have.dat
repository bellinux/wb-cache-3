25|$|In the Netherlands, {{bicycles}} are a {{very important}} part of the test. Cyclists are everywhere and cars need to yield to them quite frequently. Not yielding to a cyclist during your exam <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> failed automatically.|$|E
25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to have the coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E
500|$|However, {{during the}} {{unveiling}} of the monster, Burns is blinded by camera flashes. He runs into a camera, which crashes and starts a fire: the crowd panic and flee. Following this disaster, Homer then cheers up Burns {{by pointing out that}} being loved <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be nice to people everyday but being hated means {{you do not have to}} do anything. Burns agrees with that logic, saying [...] "I'm a selfish old crank--and that fits me like a Speedo!" [...] In the aftermath of the incident, Homer and Burns give Nessie a job at the [...] "Vegas Town Casino".|$|E
5000|$|Swami {{gives his}} own {{perspective}} on enlightenment {{in his book}} If Truth Be Told. [...] "Enlightenment does not <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to live like a pauper. It does not <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to subject yourself {{to a life of}} hardship and abstinence. On the contrary, to be enlightened means to live in the light of love, compassion and truthfulness," [...] Swami says.|$|R

500|$|Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times {{gave the}} film 3 out of 5 stars while remarking, [...] "This {{is the kind}} of genuine theatre experience, now getting rare, which remains most {{precious}} {{in the life of a}} film-goer. Reason can take over later. I had a ball!" [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5, and mentioned, [...] "Debut director Karan Malhotra shows great promise in making the film visually arresting and maintaining the consistency of performances. But remaking a cult film <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> big shoes to fill. If you’re a loyalist of the late Mukul Anand’s Agneepath, you’re likely to have reservations with this one. But if you leave the comparisons aside and are willing to forgive the faults, Agneepath is worth a watch essentially to savor Hrithik’s performance." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave Agneepath 3 out of 5 and said, [...] "It is in the end, an old-fashioned revenge drama treated in that melodramatic, over-the-top style. You're not likely to be bored by the intense action and the solid performances, but prepare to be exhausted by just how long this film plays on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Non-religious spiritual {{guidance}} {{may also}} be offered. An American clairvoyant {{by the name of}} Catherine Adams has written, [...] "My philosophy is to teach and practice spiritual freedom, which <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> your own spiritual guidance, which I can help you get in touch with." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Only Pakeezah {{completion}} remains unsettled. You {{have made}} a condition that unless I give you a divorce you will not complete Pakeezah. Even this knot can be untied... I will free you from your marital ties. After this, {{if you wish to}} complete your Pakeezah, I would be the most happy to do so. This is my request, that Pakeezah on which the fortune of many people depends, and which had the good wishes of so many people, should not be left uncompleted if possible. You have better <b>means.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> box office appeal, and most of all Pakeezah needs you personally... Pakeezah that is like a sinking ship will reach a shore under your care." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{powerful}} folk figure is the Ankou or the [...] "Reaper of Death". Sometimes a skeleton {{wrapped in a}} shroud with the Breton flat hat, sometimes described as a real human being (the last dead of the year, devoted to bring the dead to Death), he makes his journeys by night carrying an upturned scythe which he throws before him to reap his harvest. Sometimes he is on foot but mostly he travels with a cart, the Karrig an Ankou, drawn by two oxen and a lean horse. Two servants dressed in the same shroud and hat as the Ankou pile the dead into the cart, and to hear it creaking at night <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> little time left to live.|$|E
2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to take the time to}} sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. My gift happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was so great about that program." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Northwestern University {{professor}} of clinical medical humanities and bioethics Alice Dreger commented on Bailey's {{response to the}} negative reactions: [...] "Bailey may claim he was not insensitive, but {{given the number of}} people he offended with his prose, he is obviously, objectively wrong—being perceived as insensitive by this many people surely <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been insensitive. (Especially if you don’t get that.)" [...] Physician Charles Allen Moser, though, believes that Bailey caused his own controversy by being mean spirited. [...] "To call a transsexual who denies Autogynephilia vigorously autogynephilic or an autogynephile-in-denial is also inflammatory and inappropriate. One can convey the same point with more cautious language. In general, researchers should avoid inciting hostility from their subjects. Stating that a subject is in denial or misleading the researcher usually leads to an angry reaction. Ridiculing someone for their beliefs, religious, political, or gender identification is never a good strategy. Ignoring these common courtesies will probably lead to an ugly confrontation, such as this “controversy.” Being a researcher does not confer immunity from the consequences of incivility." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Grace, rather sharply, [...] "I suppose this <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{given him}} the lease of the station coal yard? No doubt he offered to bring the gravel before you agreed. He's cunning and knew you wanted the terrace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply. [...] "I {{understand}} that by some <b>means</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got the instrument itself in your possession, {{but if you}} had got it because you had paid the amount due, you would have received and had recorded a release from Mr. Massie.
