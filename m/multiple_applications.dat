5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 {{with a program}} called Switcher by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed the user to launch <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher. Also, Switcher did not display windows of other applications beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more mature and widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the Finder would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for it. If enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with the desktop and windows of other applications in the screen's background.|$|E
5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{effectiveness}} of <b>multiple</b> intelligence <b>applications</b> on academic achievement in Turkey. Accordingly, findings of independent research studies aimed to find out effectiveness of <b>multiple</b> intelligence <b>applications</b> are gathered in a meta-analysis. Total of 71 studies, 66 dissertations and 7 articles were included in the meta-analysis meeting the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis calculations resulted that the <b>multiple</b> intelligence <b>applications</b> have a large and positive effect on academic achievement. It was also revealed that the effect of <b>multiple</b> intelligence <b>applications</b> vary by application period. Thus, as the application period increases, the effect of <b>multiple</b> intelligence <b>application</b> also increases. On the other side, effectiveness of the applications does not vary by; the type of the course, level of the class and the type of the research. Some suggestions made according to the research findings. ...|$|R
50|$|Application {{groups do}} not have their own {{accounting}} and scheduling rules.

25|$|With its {{original}} introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought {{a number of}} new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the classic Mac OS. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system's ability to run <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{operating}} system and applications all share a single memory space, {{it is possible for}} a bug in any one of them to corrupt the entire operating system, and crash the machine. This is not particularly annoying under a single-application model, in which case the application crashes anyway. But under MultiFinder, any crash will crash all the other running programs as well. The multitasking of <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> potentially increases the chances of a crash, making the system potentially more fragile.|$|E
25|$|LMDB {{may also}} be used {{concurrently}} in a multi-threaded or multi-processing environment, with read performance scaling linearly by design. LMDB databases may have only one writer at a time, however unlike many similar key-value databases, write transactions do not block readers, nor do readers block writers. LMDB is also unusual in that <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> on the same system may simultaneously open and use the same LMDB store, {{as a means to}} scale up performance. Also, LMDB does not require a transaction log (thereby increasing write performance by not needing to write data twice) because it maintains data integrity inherently by design.|$|E

This expands the game structure from a one-shot {{set up to}} a sequential game. A firm, after being rejected by an applicant, can choose another applicant {{to make him a}} new wage o¤er. This possibility gives firms an outside option after a rejection. This increases the bargaining power of firms, implying a change in their wage offer behavior. The resulting wage distribution is hump-shaped with the density of wage offers concentrated on central values, rather than in extreme values.

25|$|RemoteApp (or TS RemoteApp) is {{a special}} mode of RDS, {{available}} in Windows Server 2008 R2 and later, where remote session configuration is integrated into the client operating system. The RDP 6.1 client ships with Windows XP SP3, KB952155 for Windows XP SP2 users, Windows Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008. The UI for the RemoteApp is rendered in a window over the local desktop, and is managed like any other window for local applications. The end result {{of this is that}} remote applications behave largely like local applications. The task of establishing the remote session, as well as redirecting local resources to the remote application, is transparent to the end user. <b>Multiple</b> <b>applications</b> can be started in a single RemoteApp session, each with their own windows.|$|E
25|$|The Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) is the 32-bit {{protected}} mode kernel {{at the core}} of Windows 9x. Its primary responsibility is to create, run, monitor and terminate virtual machines. The VMM provides services that manage memory, processes, interrupts and protection faults. The VMM works with virtual devices (loadable kernel modules, which consist mostly of 32-bit ring 0 or kernel mode code, but may include other types of code, such as a 16-bit real mode initialisation segment) to allow those virtual devices to intercept interrupts and faults to control the access that an application has to hardware devices and installed software. Both the VMM and virtual device drivers run in a single, 32-bit, flat model address space at privilege level 0 (also called ring 0). The VMM provides multi-threaded, preemptive multitasking. It runs <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> simultaneously by sharing CPU (central processing unit) time between the threads in which the applications and virtual machines run.|$|E

US113 was relocated to the Dover Bypass, which was also known as the Eastern Boulevard, north to US13 (State Street) when the new highway opened by the last weekend of May 1935. DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and Dover and State Street in Dover were designated US113Alternate.|$|E

[...] Crusted scabies may require <b>multiple</b> <b>applications,</b> or supplemental treatment with oral ivermectin (below).

2500|$|Contrast echocardiography, or Contrast-enhanced {{ultrasound}} is {{the addition}} of ultrasound contrast medium, or imaging agent, to traditional ultrasonography.

This allows the microbubbles to circulate through the cardiovascular system and return the ultrasound waves creating a highly reflective image. There are <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> in which contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be useful. The most commonly used application is in the enhancement of LV endocardial borders for assessment of global and regional systolic function. Contrast may also be used to enhance visualization of wall thickening during stress echocardiography, for the assessment of LV thrombus, or for the assessment of other masses in the heart. Contrast echocardiography has also been used to assess blood perfusion throughout myocardium in the case of coronary artery disease.|$|E
