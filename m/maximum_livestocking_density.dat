40|$|International {{trade of}} food and feed has {{facilitated}} the specialization and agglomeration of agricultural production systems in many countries. Confined animals in specialized production systems are increasingly supplied with soybean and maize, imported from other countries. This has increased animal productivity but has also contributed to spatially decoupled crop and animal production systems. We analyzed {{the changes in the}} trade of soybean and maize at the global level in the period 1961 – 2011, and related these to the changes in <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> and nutrient balances in the whole food system for 11 selected countries. Export of soybean and maize remained dominated by few countries (mainly USA, Argentina and Brazil) during the period 1961 – 2011, while the number of importing countries increased. Increases in the import of maize and soybean are positively related with changes in <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> and N and P balances of national food systems. Imported soybean accounted for 12 – 36 % of the calculated N balance at country level, and imported maize for 0 – 26 %. There were large differences between importing countries; increases in the N surplus ranged from 75 to 306 kg N/ha and in the P surplus from 2 to 49 kg P/ha when the mean <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> increased 1 LU/ha.

This can lead to AR exposure of non-target small mammals and their predators, which is known from several regions of the world. However, drivers of exposure variation are usually not known. To identify environmental drivers of AR exposure in non-targets we analyzed 331 liver samples of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) for residues of eight ARs and used local parameters (percentage of urban area and <b>livestock</b> <b>density)</b> to test for associations to residue occurrence. 59. 8 % of samples collected across Germany contained at least one rodenticide, in 20. 2 % of cases at levels at which biological effects are suspected.

The applied model framework includes a macroeconomic CGE-model, an econometric agricultural sector model and a local economic model, and consistent links have been established between these models. The analyses show that the largest relative economic impacts occur in the western parts of Denmark.

We monitored 177 nests across different semi-arid shrub assemblages (clay-sand and salinity gradients) {{and a range}} of <b>livestock</b> <b>densities</b> (0 – 80 km- 2). Nest success (mean 51. 4 %, 95 % CI 42. 4 – 60. 4 %) was similar across four years; predation caused 85 % of those failures for which the cause was known, and only three nests were trampled by livestock. Nesting begins within a few weeks of arrival when food appears scarce, but later nests were more likely to fail owing to the emergence of a key predator, suggesting foraging conditions on wintering and passage sites may be important for nest productivity. Nest success was similar across three shrub assemblages and was unrelated to landscape rugosity, shrub frequency or <b>livestock</b> <b>density,</b> but was greater with taller mean shrub height (range 13 – 67 cm) within 50 m.

The study was conducted at IGER, North Wyke, England, UK, using a system of polytunnels designed specifically for measuring gaseous emissions from housed cattle. To achieve different <b>livestock</b> <b>densities,</b> the floor area {{within each of the}} four polytunnels was kept constant and the number of animals housed was varied. Beef heifers (Red Devon, weight range 350 - 500 kg) were used in the trial with either 3, 4, 5 or 6 housed per polytunnel, achieving area allowance per animal of 11. 7, 8. 8, 7. 0 and 5. 8 m 2 (treatments SD 1, SD 2, SD 3 and SD 4), respectively, all of which comply with the current minimum welfare standard. Mean emission rates per treatment {{for each of the four}} housing periods were in the range 1. 2 - 6. 6 g/lu/d NH 3 -N (where lu is livestock unit = 500 kg liveweight).

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} {{and challenges of}} increasing production of food and feed on existing maize fields in mixed crop-livestock systems in the semi-arid areas of southern Africa. It integrates results from different sources of data and analysis: 1. Spatial stratification using secondary data for GIS layers: Maize mega-environments combined with recommendation domains for dual-purpose maize were constructed for Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, stratifying the countries by demand factors (<b>livestock</b> <b>densities</b> and human population densities) and feed availability. Relative biomass contributions to feed resources from rangelands were compared to those from croplands to explore the usefulness of global datasets for feed supply estimations. 2. Verification through farming systems analysis: the potential demand for maize residues as feed (maize cropping patterns, maize yields and uses, feed deficits) was compared at contrasting sites, based on household survey data collected on 480 households in 2010. 3. Maize cultivar analysis: Genotypic variability of maize cultivars was compared to evaluate the potential contribution (stover quantity and quality) of dual-purpose maize to reduce feed deficits. The study results illustrate high spatial variability in the demand for and supply of maize residues. Northern Malawi is characterized by high <b>livestock</b> <b>density,</b> high human population density and high feed availability. Farmers achieve maize yields of more than 2 t/ha resulting in surplus of residues. Although livestock is important, southwest Zimbabwe has low <b>livestock</b> <b>densities,</b> low human populations and low feed availability; farming systems are more integrated and farmers make greater use of maize residues to address feed shortages. Central Mozambique also has low cattle densities, low human populations and low feed availability. More rangelands are available but maize yields are very low and livestock face severe feed shortages. The investigation of 14 advanced CIMMYT maize landraces cultivars and 15 advanced hybrids revealed significant variations in grain and stover yield and fodder quality traits. Where <b>livestock</b> <b>densities</b> are high and alternative feed resources are insufficient, maize cultivars with superior residue yield and fodder quality can have substantial impact on livestock productivity. Cultivars at the higher end of the quality range can provide sufficient energy for providing livestock maintenance requirements and support about 200 g of live weight gain daily. Maize cultivars can be targeted according to primary constraints of demand domains for either stover quantity or stover fodder quality and the paper proposes an approach for this based on voluntary feed intake estimates for maize stover.

Presence-only records of 193 RVF outbreak locations from 1930 to 2007 together with potential predictor variables were used to model and map the suitable habitats for RVF occurrence using ecological niche modelling. Ground-truthing of the model outputs was conducted by comparing the levels of RVF virus specific antibodies in cattle, sheep and goats sampled from locations in Tanzania that presented different predicted habitat suitability values. Habitat suitability values for RVF occurrence were higher in the northern and central-eastern regions of Tanzania {{than the rest of the}} regions in the country. Soil type and precipitation of the wettest quarter contributed equally to habitat suitability (32. 4 % each), followed by <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> (25. 9 %) and rainfall pattern (9. 3 %).

40|$|About 25 % of European {{livestock}} intake {{is based}} on permanent and sown grasslands. To fulfill rising demand for animal products, an intensification of livestock production may lead to an increased consumption of crop and compound feeds. In order to preserve an economically and environmentally sustainable agriculture, a more forage based livestock alimentation may be an advantage. However, besides management, grassland productivity is highly vulnerable to climate (i. e., temperature, precipitation, CO 2 concentration), and spatial information about European grassland productivity in response to climate change is scarce. The process-based vegetation model ORCHIDEE-GM, containing an explicit representation of grassland management (i. e., herbage mowing and grazing), is used here to estimate changes in potential productivity and potential grass-fed ruminant <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> across European grasslands over the period 1961 - 2010. Here "potential grass-fed ruminant livestock density" denotes the <b>maximum</b> <b>density</b> of <b>livestock</b> that can be supported by grassland productivity in each 25 km × 25 km grid cell. In reality, <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> could be higher than potential (e. g., if additional feed is supplied to animals) or lower (e. g., in response to economic factors, pedo-climatic and biotic conditions ignored by the model, or policy decisions that can for instance reduce livestock numbers). When compared to agricultural statistics (Eurostat and FAOstat), ORCHIDEE-GM gave a good reproduction of the regional gradients of annual grassland productivity and ruminant <b>livestock</b> <b>density.</b> The model however tends to systematically overestimate the absolute values of productivity in most regions, suggesting that most grid cells remain below their potential grassland productivity due to possible nutrient and biotic limitations on plant growth. When ORCHIDEE-GM was run for the period 1961 - 2010 with variable climate and rising CO 2, an increase of potential annual production (over 3 %) per decade was found: 97 % of this increase was attributed to the rise in CO 2, - 3 % to climate trends and 15 % to trends in nitrogen fertilization and deposition. When compared with statistical data, ORCHIDEE-GM captures well the observed phase of climate-driven interannual variability in grassland production well, whereas {{the magnitude of the}} interannual variability in modeled productivity is larger than the statistical data. Regional grass-fed livestock numbers can be reproduced by ORCHIDEE-GM based on its simple assumptions and parameterization about productivity being the only limiting factor to define the sustainable number of animals per unit area. Causes for regional model-data misfits are discussed, including uncertainties in farming practices (e. g., nitrogen fertilizer application, and mowing and grazing intensity) and in ruminant diet composition, as well as uncertainties in the statistical data and in model parameter values...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} proximate threats facing biodiversity is habitat change {{as a result of}} the combined effects of agricultural development and livestock grazing. Extensive livestock systems are increasingly competing with wildlife for access to land and natural resources in African rangelands. Ethiopia has the highest numbers of livestock in Africa with most livestock production taking place in highland systems. The Bale Mountains contain the largest extent of afroalpine habitat in Africa and are the most important conservation area in Ethiopia as one of thirty-four Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspots. The Bale Mountains National Park was established forty years ago to protect the endemic, and rodent-specialist Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) and the afroalpine habitats upon which they depend. I use a 21 year time-series of livestock counts in the park to detect changes in the Oromo traditional livestock production system or godantu. I show that a seasonal transhumant livestock production regime, akin to godantu, only appears to persist in the Web valley today and I also find some evidence that the type of livestock is changing with smaller stock, such as sheep and goats, being more frequently kept. Despite reportedly growing numbers of households in the Web valley, I do not detect an overall increase in livestock numbers, suggesting that the area may have reached its carrying capacity in terms of livestock. In contrast, the number of livestock on the Sanetti Plateau increased over the monitoring period, including the remote and inhospitable western section of the plateau. Furthermore, I detect an increase in the risk of contact and disease transmission between Ethiopian wolves and free-roaming dogs in wolf optimal habitats. I subsequently estimate, through the use of transects, the <b>densities</b> of <b>livestock</b> in the Web valley, Morebawa and Sanetti and calculate the ratio of observed to <b>maximum</b> sustainable <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> (based on rainfall and vegetation productivity). The conservative results suggest that the Web valley and Morebawa are overstocked given the rangeland predicted productivity for those areas, and that the problem of overstocking is at its worst during the dry season. I then establish critical relationships between vegetation conditions, livestock grazing pressure and rodent populations (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus, Lophuromys melanonyx and Arvicanthis blicki) in the afroalpine, under both natural and controlled experimental conditions. Rodent biomass declines as the livestock index increases along a natural grazing gradient, but rodents‟ body condition, use of the habitat or breeding ecology and most vegetation variables measured do not significantly vary across the livestock grazing gradient. Rodent populations do respond to the experimental removal of livestock inside exclosures, although this response is site and species-specific, and I find some evidence that these responses are concurrent with changes in the vegetation. Grazed plots have higher plant species richness and diversity compared to the exclosure sites which harbour reduced bareground cover and taller vegetation. Differences among rodent species in their responses to grazing may be mediated by interaction between the direct effects of grazing on habitat quality and species-specific habitat requirements, although the specific mechanism of this interaction could not be tested. Livestock may negatively affect rodents by increasing their predation risk (through removing vegetation cover), by reducing the soil suitability for maintaining burrow systems (through trampling) or, less likely, by competing for food resources. A series of simple dynamic food chain models are developed to explore the interactions between Ethiopian wolves, rodents and vegetation and how they may be affected by increasing levels of livestock grazing. I also explore how predictions made about these trophic dynamics are affected by the type of functional response linking the different levels. The models suggest that the pastures of the Web valley and Morebawa are likely to be incapable of maintaining wolves at current <b>livestock</b> <b>densities,</b> while the Sanetti plateau may be able to sustain only slight increases in <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> before tipping into a trophic configuration unable to sustain wolves. This model is a first step in assessing the seriousness of conflict between pastoralists and wildlife in BMNP. Resource selection functions are developed and validated for cattle and sheep/goats grazing in the Bale afroalpine in an attempt to understand some of the drivers behind the heterogeneous use of the landscape by livestock. Habitat use by livestock is focused on lower-lying pastures in the vicinity of water sources (rivers or mineral springs). Only cattle strongly select for/against particular vegetation types. The probability of habitat use is also linked to the distance from the nearest villages. The models developed highlight a strong association between livestock use and rodent biomass in Morebawa and Eastern Sanetti, suggesting that livestock grazing poses a threat to Ethiopian wolves‟ persistence in marginal habitats in which rodent availability is already limited. Furthermore, the concentration of livestock around water sources has serious implications for the degradation of the park‟s hydrological system and the livelihoods and food security of the millions of people living in the dependent lowlands. Integrating research and practice is a fundamental challenge for conservation. I discuss how the methodological tools developed and the insights gained into the dynamics of the afroalpine system can contribute to the management of livestock grazing pressure in Bale Mountains National Park and highlight gaps in the knowledge of the afroalpine ecosystem where more research is needed.

40|$|Intensive {{livestock}} production {{is connected with}} a number of environmental effects, including discharges to soils and surface waters and emissions to the atmosphere. In areas with a high <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> the low availability of nearby arable land, together with the preferred use of chemical fertilizer by arable farmers, results in high off-farm disposal costs for manure. Furthermore, ammonia abatement technologies, such as treatment of exhaust air, are important as ammonia emissions may account up to a quarter of the total nitrogen flux. Firstly, the paper describes and discusses the development of manure treatment in the Netherlands since the 1970 ¿s. Manure treatment processes that result in products that compete with and replace the use of chemical fertilizers can (partly) close the nutrient cycle again. From this point of view aerobic treatment of manure (nitrification/denitrification) can not be considered sustainable as nitrogen is taken out of the cycle at high environmental costs. Secondly, the state-of-the-art of techniques for treatment of exhaust air is presented. Besides ammonia, application of air treatment may also reduce environmental emissions of odour and particulate matter (dust). Both manure treatment and treatment of exhaust air are considered essential for sustainable livestock operations in areas with a high <b>livestock</b> <b>density...</b>|$|R

The effects of the {{management systems}} on crop yields and nitrate leaching were measured. In all four years nitrate leaching, as determined using ceramic suction cups, was higher in the three crops following ploughing of grass-clover than under the barley or grass-clover. Overall, {{no significant differences in}} nitrate leaching were observed between the management systems. However, the replacement of the winter wheat crop used in the earlier experimental period (1994 - 97) by spring oats with catch crops in both the preceding and succeeding winters reduced nitrate leaching compared to the earlier rotation. Increasing the <b>livestock</b> <b>density,</b> which increased manure application by c. 60 kg total N ha- 1 increased crop yields by 7 and 9 % on average for FYM and slurry, respectively. Yields were 3 - 5 % lower where FYM was used instead of slurry. The experiment confirmed the overriding importance of grassland N management, particularly the cultivation of the ley, in organic dairy crop rotations...|$|R
40|$|The Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water aims to {{positively}} {{contribute to}} the European Union's Water Policy {{through a series of}} studies to assess {{the quantity and quality of}} this precious resource. An important part of that water balance is the accounting of water removed from rivers or aquifers by different sectorial needs. The map series presented here shows the water requirements for the livestock sector. These maps are calculated based on <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> maps for 2005, normalized by the best available field data at continental scale. Water requirements are calculated for these animal categories: cattle, pigs, poultry and sheep and goats. The cattle category is further disaggregated to calves, heifers, bulls and dairy cows. Using values given in the literature, a relationship using air temperature is inferred for the daily water requirements per livestock category. Daily average temperature maps are used in conjunction with the <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> maps in order to create a temporal series of water requirements for the livestock sector in Europe. This map series is then ingested by the hydrological model along with other water requirements maps for other sectors. The maps cover continental Europe and are generated at 5 km resolution. JRC.

40|$|Plant {{associations}} {{are determined by}} complex interactions with their environment depending on resource availability, landscape features, and periodic disturbances that shape the structure and functions of these communities. Forests, savannas and grasslands extend across the global land surface, contribute to planetary processes and provide ecosystems services sustaining local production. However, the factors that explain the distribution of trees and determine these biomes are still not well understood. In this thesis, long-standing questions about the origins and distribution of these ecosystems are discussed in light of new evidence suggesting that a feedback of fire and grasses may maintain forests, savannas and grasslands as alternative tree cover states. I also address how anthropogenic land use, including the introduction of livestock, may be affecting these dynamics, particularly in the neotropics, with consequences in terms of potential transitions in tree cover regimes. I analyze the distribution of trees in the grasslands of subtropical South America, looking at what may determine current tree cover and change dynamics (Chapters 2 & 3). The results suggest that, in non-cultivated areas, the expansion of trees into grasslands is likely limited by fire, livestock and precipitation, and that livestock likely reduces fire frequency (Chapter 2). The analyses also suggest that in the Uruguayan Campos of southeastern South America, where fire frequency is low and <b>livestock</b> <b>densities</b> are high, a release in <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> may cause a moderate expansion of forests into grasslands (Chapter 3). To understand {{the consequences of a}} potential transition to higher tree cover by increasing precipitation, I looked at the effects of tree cover in subtropical rangelands (Chapter 5). The results indicated that isolated trees can improve the forage quality and abundance of these rangelands, with potential benefits in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Lastly, I analyzed correlational patterns relating <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> to vegetation structure across the global tropics and subtropics (Chapter 4), in an attempt to generalize the findings of Chapter 2. The results indicate that extensive livestock systems reduce fire frequency and impact vegetation structure, maintaining savannas and grasslands with low tree cover, low fire frequency and a higher presence of shrubs and dwarf trees...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus is a non-renewable {{resource}} {{that is essential}} for food production. At the same time, phosphorus may cause environmental problems because excess phosphorus in agricultural soil often leads to eutrophication. For rational and sound phosphorus management in order to mitigate resource scarcity and eutrophication problems, reliable estimates of phosphorus pools and flows and the understanding of phosphorus soil dynamics are needed. Studies in Material Flow Analysis that consider soil phosphorus stocks are few and do not allow a reliable insight in soil phosphorus pools and their contribution to plant production as they mainly analyze global and national phosphorus flows. This study aimed to assess long-term soil phosphorus accumulation in Norway by analyzing the regional phosphorus flows. Three Norwegian regions with contrasting agricultural production systems were chosen: Akershus with dominating cereal production, Rogaland with high <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> and S&# 248;r-Tr&# 248;ndelag with mixed agriculture. Phosphorus flows and soil budget were quantified on a yearly basis from 1950 to 2011 and compared with estimates of available soil phosphorus based on the ammonium lactate soil phosphorus test. It was shown {{that the results of}} soil phosphorus test did not reflect soil phosphorus accumulation over years; this may indicate the accumulation of a large part of phosphorus in the unavailable pool. Comparison of the three-year average for 1997 - 1999 and 2009 - 2011 across the three regions showed the influence of agricultural production system on phosphorus flows and budget. The crop producing region Akershus was found highly dependent on mineral fertilizer import, while the region with high <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> Rogaland accumulated large amount of phosphorus in manure but depended on input of feed concentrates. The phosphorus soil budget was found positive in all three regions over the entire time period. In the mainly crop producing region Akershus the phosphorus soil budget was decreasing since 1970 s while it is increasing in the animal producing region Rogaland since 1990 s. High dependence on the inputs of mineral fertilizer and feed concentrates and simultaneous phosphorus accumulation in soil create an unbalanced situation with respect to phosphorus. From the system perspective, the recycling of phosphorus from the areas with high <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> to crop-producing areas is necessary in order to achieve a better degree of sustainability. </p...|$|R
40|$|Conservation Agriculture (CA) {{is being}} {{advocated}} to enhance soil health and sustain long term crop productivity {{in the developing}} world. One of CA's key principles is the maintenance of soil cover often by retaining a proportion of crop residues on the field as mulch. Yet smallholder crop–livestock systems across Africa and Asia face trade-offs among various options for crop residue use. Knowledge of the potential trade-offs of leaving more residues as mulch is only partial and {{the objective of this}} research is to address some of these knowledge gaps by assessing the trade-offs in contrasting settings with mixed crop–livestock systems. The paper draws from village surveys in 12 sites in 9 different countries across Sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia. Sites were clustered into 3 groups along the combined population and <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> gradients to assess current crop residue management practices and explore potential challenges to adopting mulching practices in different circumstances. Results show that although high-density sites face higher potential pressure on resources on an area basis, biomass production tends to be more substantial in these sites covering demands for livestock feed and allowing part of the residues to be used as mulch. In medium-density sites, although population and <b>livestock</b> <b>densities</b> are relatively lower, biomass is scarce and pressure on land and feed are high, increasing the pressure on crop residues and their opportunity cost as mulch. In low-density areas, population and <b>livestock</b> <b>densities</b> are relatively low and communal feed and fuel resources exist, resulting in lower potential pressure on residues on an area basis. Yet, biomass production is low and farmers largely rely on crop residues to feed livestock during the long dry season, implying substantial opportunity costs to their use as mulch. Despite its potential benefit for smallholder farmers across the density gradient, the introduction of CA-based mulching practices appears potentially easier in sites where biomass production is high enough to fulfil existing demands for feed and fuel. In sites with relatively high feed and fuel pressure, the eventual introduction of CA needs complementary research and development efforts to increase biomass production and/or develop alternative sources to alleviate the opportunity costs of leaving some crop residues as mulc...|$|R
30|$|Raen nomads often herd {{more than}} one species of livestock. Consequently, the {{rangeland}} can be better exploited through a mix of grass (grazed by sheep) and intermediate roughage eaten by goats (Hofmann 1989). This way, <b>livestock</b> <b>density</b> can be increased considerably compared to keeping only one livestock species. In addition, risk of livestock losses is buffered, whether losses are due to disease or extreme environmental conditions. The annual migrations that most Raen nomads undertake and the generally extensive grazing patterns of the herd help to lower the incidence of internal parasites and certain diseases such as anthrax.|$|R
