40|$|Crowd {{simulations}} are a set {{techniques used}} to control groups of agents and are exemplified by scenes from movies such as The Lord of the Rings and Inception. A problem which all crowd simulation techniques suffer from is the balance between control of the crowd behaviour and {{the autonomy of the}} agents. One possible solution to this problem is to use Neuro-Evolution (NE) to evolve the agent models so that the agents behave realistically and the emergent crowd behaviour is controllable. Since this is not an application area which has been investigated much, it is unknown which NE parameters and operators work well. This paper attempts to address this by comparing the performance of a set of crossover operators with a range of probabilities in three simulations: Car Racing, <b>Mouse</b> <b>Bridge</b> Crossing, and a War-Robot Battle. Overall it was found that Laplace crossover worked the best across all our simulations...|$|E

40|$|Because ethanol {{consumption}} is {{commonly associated with}} a high cholesterol diet, we examined whether combined consumption of ethanol and high cholesterol increases liver injury and fibrosis. Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed diets containing: 1) 35 % of calories from corn oil (CTR), 2) CTR plus 0. 5 % (w/v) cholesterol (Chol), 3) CTR plus ethanol (27 % of calories) (EtOH), or 4) EtOH+Chol for 3 months. In mice fed Chol or EtOH alone, ALT increased to ~ 160 U/L, moderate hepatic steatosis occurred, and leukocyte infiltration, necrosis, and apoptosis increased modestly, but no observable fibrosis developed. By contrast in mice fed EtOH+Chol, ALT increased to ~ 270 U/L, steatosis was more extensive and mostly macrovesicular, and expression of proinflammatory molecules (HMGB- 1, TLR 4, TNFα, ICAM- 1) and leukocyte infiltration increased substantially. Necrosis and apoptosis also increased. Trichrome staining and second harmonic generation microscopy revealed hepatic fibrosis. Fibrosis was mostly sinusoidal and/or perivenular, but in some <b>mice</b> <b>bridging</b> fibrosis occurred. Expression of smooth muscle α-actin and TGF-β 1 increased slightly by Chol, moderately by EtOH, and markedly by EtOH+Chol. TGF-β pseudoreceptor BAMBI increased slightly by Chol, remained unchanged by EtOH and decreased by EtOH+Chol. MicroRNA- 33 a, which enhances TGF-β fibrotic effects, and phospho-Smad 2 / 3, the down-stream signal of TGF-β, also increased more greatly by EtOH+Chol than Chol or EtOH. Metalloproteinase- 2 and - 9 were decreased only by EtOH+Chol. High dietary cholesterol and chronic ethanol consumption synergistically increase liver injury, inflammation, and profibrotic responses and suppress antifibrotic responses, leading to severe steatohepatitis and early fibrosis in mice...|$|R
40|$|Binge alcohol {{drinking}} {{is a major}} public health concern world wide and its occurrence is rising among young adults. Using animal and human subjects, this thesis evaluates the impact of binge drinking {{during a time of}} neurodevelopment on aspects of impulse control, and studies the potential of addressing a molecular target, the μ-opioid receptor, to alleviate elevated impulsive-like behaviour. First, the nature of impulsivity is described in a review paper. We demonstrate the suitability of the Five-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5 -CSRTT) for measuring one facet of impulsivity, waiting impulsivity, in <b>mice.</b> <b>Bridging</b> the animal and human laboratories, we developed a novel human analogue of the 5 -CSRTT (paper 2). Elevated impulsive behaviour was detected in both young human binge drinkers and in an ethanol-preferring strain of mice, suggesting impulsivity to occur as a prelude to heavy alcohol use. In a second approach (paper 3), we studied the long term effects of intermittent alcohol exposure using a mouse model of adolescent binge drinking. We revealed disrupted impulsive behaviour in adulthood in two different inbred strains, which differ in baseline impulsivity and ethanol drinking patterns, indicating that impulsivity is also a consequence of ethanol exposure. In paper 4 we studied the ability of an opioid antagonist to improve top-down control of impulsive behaviour. Consilience between species and paradigms will need to be further addressed in future studies, but antagonising μ-opioid systems may aid in preventing binge drinking by facilitating inhibitory control mechanisms. Collectively, from animal and human evidence, this thesis will argue that exaggerated impulsivity may result from repeated ethanol withdrawal in adolescence as well as being a pre-existing endophenotype contributing to adolescent binge drinking. Disentangling such a relationship may help delineate new lines of intervention for at-risk individuals...|$|R

In the last decade the investigation of different humanized mouse models became important in research.

The method of choice to characterize these humanized mice is flow cytometry. Here, we explain facts about human immune cells in mice and show how to detect them...|$|R
40|$|Costimulation {{blockade}} {{can prevent}} rejection of nerve allografts in short-term studies. We tested if costimulation blockade also prevented rejection of nerve allografts in long-term experiments, thereby improving functional recovery. A 7 -mm sciatic nerve defect in C 57 /BL 6 <b>mice</b> was <b>bridged</b> either by nerve allografts from Balb/C mice or by isogenic nerve grafts (isografts) from C 57 /BL 6 mice. Costimulation blockade {{in the form}} of a triple treatment with anti-LFA- 1, anti-CD 40 L, and CTLA 4 Ig was given at post-operative days 0, 2, 4, and 6 (intraperitoneal). Control mice (placebo; allografts) with nerve grafts were treated with isotype antibodies during the same time period. After 49 days, tetanic muscle force, wet weight of gastrocnemius muscle, histology, and morphometry in the tibial nerve were evaluated. Costimulation blockade diminished rejection of the nerve allografts. Axons bridged the graft. Treatment increased wet weight of the gastrocnemius muscle and resulted in a higher mean myelin area/nerve fiber in the tibial nerve distal to the nerve grafts. Tetanic muscle force and number of axons in tibial nerve showed no differences between groups. We conclude that rejection is suppressed by costimulation blockade. Treatment improves recovery of target muscle and myelination after nerve allografting...|$|R
50|$|Apple was by {{this time}} {{hard at work on}} their new computer, MacIntosh, and Mouse Systems wanted the new paint program to capture {{the look and feel of}} MacPaint. Wolfgram {{contacted}} Bridges and the two agreed to develop the commercial version of PCPaint, as it was to be called by <b>Mouse</b> Systems. John <b>Bridges</b> and Doug Wolfgram started reworking Mouse Draw into what became the world's first commercial GUI painting program for the PC. The program was completely re-written using Bridge's graphics library and the top level elements were written in C rather than Assembly language. Bridges developed the core graphics code for the first version of PCPaint while Wolfgram worked on the user interface and top-level code. Mouse Systems signed an exclusive agreement with Wolfgram's company, Microtex Industries, Inc., to bundle PCPaint with every mouse they sold.|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{translation}} of cell-based strategies for regenerative medicine demands predictable in vivo performance where {{the use of}} sera during in vitro preparation inherently limits the efficacy and reproducibility. Here, we present a bioinspired approach by serum-free pre-conditioning of human periosteum-derived cells, followed by their assembly into microaggregates simultaneously primed with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2). Pre-conditioning resulted in a more potent progenitor cell population, while aggregation induced osteochondrogenic differentiation, further enhanced by BMP- 2 stimulation. Ectopic implantation displayed a cascade of events that closely resembled the natural endochondral process resulting in bone ossicle formation. Assessment in a critical size long-bone defect in immunodeficient <b>mice</b> demonstrated successful <b>bridging</b> of the defect within 4 weeks, with active contribution of the implanted cells. In short, the presented serum-free process represents a biomimetic strategy, resulting in a cartilage tissue intermediate that, upon implantation, robustly leads to the healing of a large long-bone defect. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} module named TouchSwype {{allows a}} user to type words into applications like Notepad or Microsoft Word without accessing the keyboard or <b>mouse.</b> Module AbsTouch <b>bridges</b> {{the gap between}} a touch-screen phone and the PC by allowing the user to use the touchpad as a touch-screen for a corresponding click on the screen. The touchpad acts as a scaled down version of the computer screen and makes the monitor a virtual touch-screen, free of cost. Opening any application demands a series of folder traversing or cluttering the desktop with “shortcuts”. The third module in the application, aptly named GestApp is a gestural application launcher where you can gesture a predefined letter onto the touchpad to open any application of your choice. People with motor impairments, often cannot use a conventional mouse and keyboard. They may lack sufficient mobility to reach for these devices, or sufficient endurance to use them {{for more than a}} few minutes.

40|$|A conserved {{feature of}} germ cell {{cytokinesis}} is {{the formation of}} stable intercellular bridges between daughter cells. These intercellular bridges are seen in diverse species from Drosophila melanogaster to Homo sapiens and {{have been shown to}} have roles in communication of large numbers of germ cells. In testis expressed gene 14 (Tex 14) knockout <b>mice,</b> intercellular <b>bridges</b> do not form during spermatogenesis, and male mice are sterile, demonstrating an essential role for intercellular bridges in postnatal spermatogenesis in mammals. Intercellular bridges also form between dividing germ cells in both male and female embryos. However, {{little is known about the}} formation or role of the embryonic intercellular bridges in mammals. In females, embryonic intercellular bridges have been proposed to have a role in development of the presumptive oocyte. Herein, we show that TEX 14 is an essential component of male and female embryonic intercellular bridges. In addition, we demonstrate that mitotic kinesin-like protein 1 (MKLP 1, official symbol KIF 23), which we have discovered is a component of intercellular bridges during spermatogenesis, is also a component of male and female embryonic intercellular bridges. Germ cell intercellular bridges are readily identified by KIF 23 immunofluorescence between the gonocytes and oogonia of control mice but are absent between germ cells of Tex 14 -null mice. Furthermore, by electron microscopy, intercellular bridges are present in all control newborn ovaries but are absent in the Tex 14 knockout ovaries. Despite the absence of embryonic intercellular bridges in the Tex 14 -null mice, male mice initiate spermatogenesis, and female mice are fertile. Although fewer oocytes were present in Tex 14 -null neonatal ovaries, folliculogenesis was still active at 1 yr of age. Thus, while TEX 14 and intercellular bridges have an essential role in postnatal spermatogenesis, they are not required in the embryo...|$|R
40|$|We have {{accumulated}} information of the coding sequences of uncharacterized human genes, which {{are known as}} KIAA genes, {{and the number of}} these genes exceeds 2000 at present. As an extension of this sequencing project, we recently have begun to accumulate mouse KIAA-homologous cDNAs, because {{it would be useful to}} prepare a set of human and mouse homologous cDNA pairs for further functional analysis of the KIAA genes. We herein present the entire sequences of 400 mouse KIAA cDNA clones and 4 novel cDNA clones which were incidentally identified during this project. Most of clones entirely sequenced in this study were selected by computer-assisted analysis of terminal sequences of the cDNAs. The average size of the 404 cDNA sequences reached 5. 3 kb and that of the deduced amino acid sequences from these cDNAs was 868 amino acid residues. The results of sequence analyses of these clones showed that single <b>mouse</b> KIAA cDNAs <b>bridged</b> two different human KIAA cDNAs in some cases, which indicated that these two human KIAA cDNAs were derived from single genes although they had been supposed to originate from different genes. Furthermore, we successfully mapped all the mouse KIAA cDNAs along the genome using a recently published mouse genome draft sequence...|$|R
40|$|T cells {{seem to be}} {{responsible}} for liver damage in any type of acute hepatitis. Nevertheless, the importance of Kupffer cells (KCs) for T-cell-dependent liver failure is unclear. Here we focus on the role of KCs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production after T cell stimulation in mice. T-cell- and TNF-dependent liver injury were induced either by Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PEA), by concanavalin A (Con A), or by the combination of subtoxic doses of PEA and the superantigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB). KCs were depleted by clodronate liposomes. Although livers of PEA-treated mice contained foci of confluent necrosis and numerous apoptotic cells, hardly any apoptotic cells were observed in the livers of Con A-treated <b>mice.</b> Instead, large <b>bridging</b> necroses were visible. Elimination of KCs protected mice from PEA-, Con A-, or PEA/SEB-induced liver injury. In the absence of KCs, liver damage was restricted to a few small necrotic areas. KCs were the main source of TNF. Hepatic TNF mRNA and protein production were strongly attenuated because of KC-depletion whereas plasma TNF levels were unaltered. Our results suggest that KCs {{play an important role in}} T cell activation-induced liver injury by contributing TNF. Plasma TNF levels are poor diagnostic markers for the severity of TNF-dependent liver inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Early in ovarian differentiation, female mouse {{germ cells}} develop in {{clusters}} called oocyte nests or germline cysts. After birth, mouse germ cell nests break down into individual oocytes that {{are surrounded by}} somatic pregranulosa cells to form primordial follicles. Previously, we have shown that mice treated neonatally with genistein, the primary soy phytoestrogen, have multi-oocyte follicles (MOFs), an effect apparently mediated by estrogen receptor 2 (ESR 2, more commonly known as ERbeta). To determine if genistein treatment leads to MOFs by inhibiting breakdown of oocyte nests, mice were treated neonatally with genistein (50 mg/kg per day) on Days 1 – 5, and the differenti-ation of the ovary was compared with untreated controls. Mice treated with genistein had fewer single oocytes and {{a higher percentage of}} oocytes not enclosed in follicles. Oocytes from genistein-treated <b>mice</b> exhibited intercellular <b>bridges</b> at 4 days of age, long after disappearing in controls by 2 days of age. There was also {{an increase in the number}} of oocytes that survived during the nest breakdown period and fewer oocytes undergoing apoptosis on Neonatal Day 3 in genistein-treated mice as determined by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP 1) and deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphos-phate nick end-labeling (TUNEL). These data taken together suggest that genistein exposure during development alters ovarian differentiation by inhibiting oocyte nest breakdown and attenuating oocyte cell death. developmental biology, environment, mechanisms of hormone action, ovar...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Caenorhbditis elegans {{has being}} vigorously {{used as a}} model {{organism}} in many research fields and often accompanied by administrating with various drugs. The methods of delivering drugs to worms are varied from one study to another, which make difficult in comparing results between studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the drug absorption efficiency in C. elegans using five frequently used methods with resveratrol with low aqueous solubility and water-soluble 5 -Fluoro- 2 '-deoxyuridine (FUDR) as positive compounds. The drugs were either applied to the LB medium with bacteria OP 50, before spreading onto Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plates (LB medium method), or to the NGM with live (NGM live method) or dead bacteria (NGM dead method), or spotting the drug solution {{to the surface of}} plates directly (spot dead method), or growing the worms in liquid medium (liquid growing method). The concentration of resveratrol and FUDR increased gradually within C. elegans and reached the highest during 12 hours to one day and then decreased slowly. At the same time point, the higher the drug concentration, the higher the metabolism rate. The drug concentrations in worms fed with dead bacteria were higher than with live bacteria at the same time point. Consistently, the drug concentration in medium with live bacteria decreased much faster than in medium with dead bacteria, reach to about half of the original concentration within 12 hours. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol with low aqueous solubility and water-soluble FUDR have the same absorption and metabolism pattern. The drug metabolism rate in worms was both dosage and time dependent. NGM dead method and liquid growing method achieved the best absorption efficiency in worms. The drug concentration within worms was comparable with that in <b>mice,</b> providing a <b>bridge</b> for dose translation from worms to mammals...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{shows that}} the {{exploration}} of human genetic disorders and animal genetic models can bring understanding of the causes and mechanisms of common psychiatric disorders. The {{first part of the}} thesis contains studies on genetic behavioral phenotypes in boys with Klinefelter syndrome, a human genetic disorder characterized by one or more extra X-chromosomes. The second part describes studies that specify genetic behavioral phenotypes using advanced mouse genetic models and techniques. The studies on Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) captured signatures of supernumerary X-chromosomes on different levels of phenotype expression such as the specifity of genetic autism phenotypes and the impact of the parent-of-origin of the supernumerary X chromosome psychopathology. The Klinefelter studies further showed that particular cognitive defects can be central to problems in social adaptation. A further challenge was to find genes regulating cognitive functions that influence social outcome. Therefore, a genetic mapping study in mice was started to find loci regulating ‘social cognition’ and to evaluate their function in humans. We used quantitative genetic analysis (using chromosome substitution strains) of temporal aspects of social recognition and discrimination to find genetic loci that relate to social information processing. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for long-term social discrimination was genetically mapped to a locus harboring Pchd 9 (Protocadherin 9), a gene that has been associated to human autism and social behavioral regulation in dogs. Pchd 9 -deficient mice were generated and confirmed impairments in long-term but not short-term social discrimination, while nonsocial discrimination was intact. We further showed that long-term social behavior impairments in Pchd 9 -deficient mice were associated with a brain region-specific reduction in cortical thickness in areas of higher order sensory processing. These findings show that complementary genetic mapping of clinically relevant <b>mouse</b> phenotypes may <b>bridge</b> the gap between genotypes and phenotypes in human psychiatric disorders, leading to greater understanding of the underlying biology. Overview of studies in the thesis: Study 1 : Describes a general survey of psychopathology in 51 boys with Klinefelter syndrome. Study 2 : Proves the specificity of phenotypes in autistic subjects with KS and 22 q 11 deletion syndrome through statistical comparison of both disorder autistic symptom profiles with the profiles of genetically heterogeneous autism spectrum disorders. Study 3 : Investigates cognitive executive functioning in boys with KS and its relation to social functioning. Study 4 : Shows that the parent-of origin of the X chromosome influences psychopathogy in KS. Study 5 : Searches for core cognitive features in KS by cross-species comparison of recognition deficits in mice with a supernumerary X chromosome to recognition deficits in boys with KS. Study 6 : Is a large study that describes the genetic mapping of temporal components of social memory in mice using chromosome substitution strains, leading to the identification of genes involved in social information processing and cortical morphogenesis across species...|$|R
