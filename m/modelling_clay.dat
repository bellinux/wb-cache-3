Tessa {{is often seen}} making art works and welding large pieces of metal together, drawing or using <b>modelling</b> <b>clay.</b> She is also seen sketching people with whom she has problems. Tessa believes that [...] "...an artist should never grow complacent. Change is good," [...] and fears the Paris art critics because [...] "...they are the worst".|$|E
500|$|Computer Space debuted at the MOA show on October 15–17, 1971. Dabney's wooden cabinet for {{the initial}} {{prototype}} was replaced with a curvy, futuristic fiberglass cabinet designed by Bushnell with <b>modelling</b> <b>clay</b> and built by a swimming pool manufacturer. A control panel extended from {{the main body of}} the cabinet and contained the four control buttons; Syzygy had hoped to use a joystick to control the rocket's movement, but found that it broke too easily, failing to last a single night in a location test. The Galaxy Game designers had run into the same issue, but had solved it with expensive customized military surplus joysticks. The cabinet displayed the Nutting Associates name and logo, along with the term [...] "Syzygy engineered". Nutting displayed four cabinets at the MOA show, one each in red, blue, white, and yellow, with the implication that the game was already in production, though they were in fact the only four cabinets then produced. These initial cabinets were in solid colors, though later ones would use a sparkle finish. The cabinets were damaged during transport, and one monitor was broken; Syzygy repaired the three working cabinets and opened up the fourth to demonstrate the internals to attendees. Game distributors were hesitant about the game, with concerns raised about the game's potential, reliability, and the embedded monitor's attractiveness to thieves; recollections are mixed as to whether Nutting took a handful or no orders at the show. Nutting, however, ordered a large production run regardless, on the expectation that the distributors would come around with further exposure. The game was displayed again at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions show from November 9–12, and then entered production later that month.|$|E

6000|$|These things Redwood {{arranged}} in a locker in one corner. Along {{one side of the}} room, at a convenient height for a six-or eight-foot child, there was a blackboard, on which the youngsters might flourish in white and coloured chalk, and near by a sort of drawing block, from which sheet after sheet might be torn, and on which they could draw in charcoal, and a little desk there was, furnished with great carpenter's pencils of varying hardness and a copious supply of paper, on which the boys might first scribble and then draw more neatly. And moreover Redwood gave orders, so far ahead did his imagination go, for specially large tubes of liquid paint and boxes of pastels against the time when they should be needed. He laid in a cask or so of plasticine and <b>modelling</b> <b>clay.</b> [...] "At first he and his tutor shall model together," [...] he said, [...] "and when he is more skilful he shall copy casts and perhaps animals.

40|$|Toxic {{metals and}} {{phthalates}} are {{introduced in the}} manufacturing of plastic toys and <b>modeling</b> <b>clays.</b> In Lebanon, inexpensive plastic toys and <b>modeling</b> <b>clays</b> (sold in dollar stores) are affordable and popular, {{and there is no}} legislation to monitor or regulate such toys. This study aimed to assess the quality of inexpensive plastic toys and <b>modeling</b> <b>clays</b> imported in Lebanon. Metal concentrations in toys, namely, zinc [not detectable (ND) to 3, 708 μg/g], copper (ND to 140), chromium (ND to 75 μg/g), tin (ND to 39 μg/g), and cadmium (Cd) (ND to 20 μg/g), were lower than the European Union (EU) Directive limits, whereas lead (ND to 258 μg/g) in 10 % of samples and antimony (Sb) (ND to 195 μg/g) in 5 % of samples were greater than the EU limits. In <b>modeling</b> <b>clays,</b> most of the metals were lower than the EU Directive limits except for Cd and arsenic (As). Cd was detected in 83 % of samples, with a mean level of 9. 1 μg/g, which is far greater than the EU Directive limit (1. 9 μg/g). The As mean level of 4. 5 μg/g was greater than the EU limit (4. 0 μg/g) and was detected in 9 % of samples. Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) were found in 60 % of children’s toys and 77 % of <b>modeling</b> <b>clays.</b> Phthalic acid butyl ester had the highest-level PAE encountered and was ≤ 59. 1 % in one type of clay. However, among children’s toys, di(4 -octyl) ester terephthalic acid was the highest encountered phthalate at a concentration of 25. 7 %. The community survey indicated that 82 % of households purchase their toys from inexpensive shops and that only 17 % of parents were aware of the health hazard of such toys. Consequently, an intervention plan was proposed for the provision of safe toys to children. PublishedN/...|$|R
