[...] He finds that in some points it resembles the ostrich and rhea, and concludes: [...] "It seems therefore to me that, summing these results, the screamer must have sprung from the primary avian stock as an independent offshoot at much {{the same time as}} did most of the other important families." [...] This time, he further tells us, was when there occurred a general break-up of the ancient terrestrial bird-type, when the acquisition of wings brought many intruders into domains already occupied, calling forth a new struggle for existence, and bringing out many special qualities by means of natural selection.|$|E

He was the first to point out the connection between the mastoid cells and the middle ear. His description of the lacrimal ducts in the eye was a marked advance on those of his predecessors and he also gave a detailed account of the ethmoid bone and its cells in the nose. His contributions to the anatomy of the bones and muscles were very valuable. It was in <b>myology</b> particularly that he corrected Vesalius.

5000|$|There are varying {{types of}} {{intervention}} for ankyloglossia. Horton et al., have a classical belief that people with ankyloglossia can compensate in their speech for limited tongue range of motion. For example, if {{the tip of the}} tongue is restricted for making sounds such as /n, t, d, l/, the tongue can compensate through dentalization; this is when the tongue tip moves forward and up. When producing /r/, elevation of the mandible can compensate for restriction of tongue movement. Also, compensations can be made for /s/ and /z/ by using the dorsum of the tongue for contact against the palatal rugae. Thus, Horton et al. proposed compensatory strategies as a way to counteract the adverse effects of ankyloglossia and did not promote surgery. Non-surgical treatments for ankyglossia are typically performed by Orofacial <b>Myology</b> specialists, and involve using exercises to strengthen and improve the function of the facial muscles and thus promote proper function of the face, mouth and tongue ...|$|E
50|$|He was a {{brilliant}} faculty member {{in the college of}} Medicine and, in order to make Anatomy and Physiology studies easier, designed and built life size statues that clearly showed the organs of the human body; the organs could be removed and placed back according to the students needs. The mannequins also helped in the teaching of Osteology, <b>Myology</b> and other related medical sciences. Finally, he also helped in Optics, with lenses that he invented. In 1797, with a scholarship from the government, Flores went on a four-year journey where he visited several American and European medical facilities. In Philadelphia he learned about Luigi Galvani's electrical experiments with frogs and later on he made studies on this of his own. When he arrived in Italia, he not only met Galvani, but Felice Fontana as well, whom he admired as scientist and maker of anatomic wax models. In Madrid, in 1803, he get in contact with Antoni de Gimbernat and made a report before the Surgeons Board about the need of a vaccination campaign in Spanish America, supported by the government.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two methods}} for {{treating}} tongue thrusting. The patient may place an appliance similar to a nightguard in the mouth at night, or may wear a more permanent device that can be removed and adjusted by a dentist. The other method requires oral habit training, an exercise technique called orofacial myofunctional therapy, that re-educates the muscles associated with swallowing by changing the swallowing pattern. Therapy treatment involves doing various tongue exercises to help strengthen the side tongue muscles. Certified Orofacial Myologists are trained professionals who receive specialty training in this field and are qualified to treat tongue thrust, orofacial myofunctional disorders, and oral habits. Myofunctional therapists work with patients to correct eating and drinking habits. Various exercises strengthen {{the sides of the}} tongue muscles to prohibit them from pushing on outer upper teeth. It is extremely important to correct the swallow of the tongue because the long term effects can wear down the enamel causing teeth to corrode. Over time the corroded teeth will cause discomfort in the jaw joints, which often leads to Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ). Therapy has proven to give the highest percentage of favorable results; however, the appliance is still used and is successful in some cases.. However, long term, orofacial <b>myology</b> still offers the highest long term rate of success.|$|E
40|$|As a young {{researched}} I had {{the option}} to work on skeletal muscle at the University of Padova, Italy. Introduced {{to the study of}} muscle denervation/reinnervation, I started a project on long term denervated muscle that still is my primary interest and took me from rodents’ models of chronic muscle denervation to human spinal cord injury-related muscle denervation and its managements. On the way, I organized a series of conferences in Euganei Hills, Padua, Italy and an international journal, the Basic and Applied <b>Myology.</b> From 2010 this journal changed name to European Journal of Translational <b>Myology,</b> whose contents are focused on <b>Myology,</b> though they have important implications in aging, several neurological disorders and cancer cachexia. A relatively large community of Basic Biologists, Clinicians and Biomedical Technologists (usually meeting separately in very different specialty Conferences) recognized the need of a Meeting Series focused on Translational <b>Myology.</b> Thus the Padua Muscle Days (PMD) started more than 25 years ago. The next events of the PMD Series will be in Autumn 2017 an one-day Seminar on Easy Aging and a three-day event: The 2017 Fall Padua Experts’ Meeting. During the 2018 Spring PMD, the Giovanni Salviati Memorial will be organized to honor a beloved friend and excellent scientist, who abruptly disappeared twenty years ago {{at the peak of his}} research activities.
