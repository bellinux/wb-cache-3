25|$|When the men {{return to}} the village with the {{collected}} trash, usually their families are waiting for {{them so that they}} can begin sorting the trash. The majority of those who sort the trash are women, while certain families specialize in sorting certain materials such as paper, plastic, aluminum, glass, etc. The women and children sort the garbage into 16 different types of trash and sort out the recyclables. The sorting of garbage is a time-consuming task in which women and children may spend up to 10 to 12 hours each day separating the garbage. First, the trash is sorted into the main 16 categories, such as paper, plastic, cardboard, cans, etc. So for example, all different types of paper are placed into one pile while all different types of plastic are placed in another pile. Sorting within categories does not take place until after the trash is sorted first into the major categories. Then sorting within the category takes place. For instance, the major category of paper would be sorted into white paper, yellow paper, thick paper, newspaper, thin paper, etc. Each sub-sorted material is then sold to factories and middle-men for a <b>marginal</b> <b>profit.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt to}} {{classify}} {{the function of}} the market of garden yields. The groups of market functions were distinguished. The first group consists of physical functions connected with the transferring of goods stock from production to consumption. The second function concerns the risk involved for both agricultural producer and consumer. The last function concerns the influence of garden markets on production. These functions and activities cannot always be considered separately because of existing mutual connections. The functions of the garden markets have been presented against a background of costs and market <b>marginal</b> <b>profits.</b> The problem is whether the changes in the costs and market <b>marginal</b> <b>profits</b> are connected with the changes of the market functions. If the costs and the market <b>marginal</b> <b>profits</b> are subjected to increases together with simultaneous expansion of market services the growing disparity between retail and wholesale prices of garden products cannot be assessed as negative. This article took into consideration alternative market costs i. e. costs of either consumer or producer. These costs rise in a case of unexecuted or insufficient range of market services.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model to {{reconcile}} the theory of inter-temporal non-renewable resource depletion with well-known stylized facts concerning the exploitation of exhaustible resources such as oil. Our approach introduces geological constraints into a Hotelling type extraction-exploration model. We show that such constraints, in combination with initially small reserves and strictly convex exploration costs, can coherently explain bell-shaped peaks in natural resource extraction and hence U-shapes in prices. As production increases, <b>marginal</b> <b>profits</b> (<b>marginal</b> revenues less marginal extraction cost) are observed to decline, while as production decreases, <b>marginal</b> <b>profits</b> rise at a positive rate {{that is not necessarily}} the rate of discount. A numerical calibration of the model to the world oil market shows that geological constraints have the potential to substantially increase the future oil price. While some (small) non-OPEC producers are found to increase production in response to higher oil prices induced by the geological constraints, most (large) producers’ production declines, leading to a lower peak level for global oil production...|$|R

Secondly, the retailer's advertising and the manufacturer's participation ratios depend on both the retailer's and the manufacturer's <b>marginal</b> <b>profits.</b> Thirdly, the stimulating effect increases the advertising investment while the competition effect decreases it, {{but they have no}} effect on the manufacturer's participation ratio.

5000|$|The {{general rule}} is that a firm maximizes profit by {{producing}} that quantity of output where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. The profit maximization issue can also be approached from the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the variable input? To maximize profits the firm should increase usage [...] "up {{to the point where}} the input’s marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs". So, mathematically the profit maximizing rule is MRPL = MCL. The <b>marginal</b> <b>profit</b> per unit of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor minus the marginal cost of labor or MπL = MRPL − MCLA firm maximizes profits where MπL = 0.|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} a firm's demand and cost {{conditions}} {{are such that}} marginal profits are greater than zero for all levels of production {{up to a certain}} maximum. In this case <b>marginal</b> <b>profit</b> plunges to zero immediately after that maximum is reached; hence the Mπ = 0 rule implies that output should be produced at the maximum level, which also happens to be the level that maximizes revenue. In other words, the profit maximizing quantity and price can be determined by setting marginal revenue equal to zero, which occurs at the maximal level of output. Marginal revenue equals zero when the total revenue curve has reached its maximum value. An example would be a scheduled airline flight. The marginal costs of flying one more passenger on the flight are negligible until all the seats are filled. The airline would maximize profit by filling all the seats.|$|E
