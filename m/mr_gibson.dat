25|$|On May 29, 2006, ABC named Charles Gibson as sole {{anchor of}} ABC World News Tonight. Two months later, ABC renamed the program World News with Charles Gibson. In February 2007, the program {{achieved}} {{the number one}} spot in the Nielsen ratings for nightly news broadcasts, overtaking NBC Nightly News. This was ABC's first victory since the week Peter Jennings died in August 2005, {{and the first time}} since 1996. NBC Nightly News subsequently reclaimed the lead and currently maintains a steady lead over the other programs. On September 2, 2009, ABC announced that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> would retire from broadcasting at the end of 2009, and then be succeeded by Diane Sawyer.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Times, she commented, [...] "I'm very lucky they offered me the chance to follow my dreams, but also {{to allow me to}} produce my own album, which is hardly ever offered to first-time artists. He believes in me that much. I'm really blessed ... It's the most incredible gift that <b>Mr</b> <b>Gibson</b> could have given me." [...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Ed Park {{singled out}} the author's prose for praise, proclaiming that [...] "entence for sentence, few authors equal Gibson's {{gift for the}} terse yet poetic description, the quotable simile – people and {{products}} are nailed down with a beautiful precision approximating the platonic ideal of the catalog". Matt Thorne noted that while he found Gibson's tendency towards hyper-specificity initially irritating, [...] "there's hypnotic quality to the relentless cataloguing". The author's prose was also extolled by Clay Evans of the Daily Camera, and by Benjamin Lytal in The New York Sun, who declared that [...] "the real news, in Spook Country, is {{that much of the}} flair that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> once brought to descriptions of cyberspace seems to fit perfectly, now, on all kinds of things." [...] In The Seattle Times, Nisi Shawl gushed that [...] "ven without the high cool quotient of the novel's contents, the pleasure of Gibson's prose would be enough inducement for most of us to immerse ourselves in this book...." [...] Simon Cooper of The Book Show agreed with the commendations of Gibson's prose, but felt the plot and characterization let the book down: ...|$|E

2500|$|Gibson {{played a}} naïve but ambitious {{journalist}} opposite Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hunt in Peter Weir's atmospheric 1982 film The Year of Living Dangerously, {{based on the}} novel of the same name by Christopher Koch. The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming Australian actor was heavily marketed by MGM studio. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, [...] "If this film doesn't make an international star of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson,</b> then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence." [...] According to John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph, the film did, indeed, establish Gibson as an international talent.|$|E
2500|$|On review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film}} has an 89% rating based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's consensus states: [...] "Both a smart, suspenseful tale of intrigue and a sweeping romance, The Year of Living Dangerously features excellent performances from Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver {{as a pair of}} journalists covering political unrest in Indonesia." [...] Metacritic reports a 65 out of 100 rating based on 9 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and praised Hunt's performance: [...] "Billy Kwan is played, astonishingly, by a woman—Linda Hunt, a New York stage actress who enters the role so fully that it never occurs to us that she is not a man. This is what great acting is, a magical transformation of one person into another". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised Gibson's performance: [...] "If this film doesn't make an international star of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> (Gallipoli, The Road Warrior), then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence".|$|E
2500|$|Gibson gained very {{favorable}} notices from film critics {{when he first}} entered the cinematic scene, as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars. In 1982, Vincent Canby wrote that [...] "Mr. Gibson recalls the young Steve McQueen... I can't define 'star quality,' but whatever it is, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> has it." [...] Gibson has also been likened to [...] "a combination Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart." [...] Gibson's roles in the Mad Max series of films, Peter Weir's Gallipoli, and the Lethal Weapon series of films earned him the label of [...] "action hero". Later, Gibson expanded {{into a variety of}} acting projects including human dramas such as Hamlet, and comedic roles such as those in Maverick and What Women Want. He expanded beyond acting into directing and producing, with: The Man Without a Face, in 1993; Braveheart, in 1995; The Passion of the Christ, in 2004; and Apocalypto, in 2006. Jess Cagle of Time compared Gibson with Cary Grant, Sean Connery, and Robert Redford. Connery once suggested Gibson should play the next James Bond to Connery's M. Gibson turned down the role, reportedly because he feared being typecast.|$|E

2500|$|A joint {{committee}} of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Inter-religious Affairs of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Department of Inter-religious Affairs of the Anti-Defamation League obtained {{a version of the}} script before it was released in theaters. They released a statement, calling {{it one of the most}} troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, that any of us had seen in twenty-five years. It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest Caiaphas, who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed Pilate into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at Vatican II in its document Nostra aetate, and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents. ... Unless this basic storyline has been altered by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson,</b> a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, The Passion of the Christ retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last forty years.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the model}} of an offer {{mirroring}} acceptance makes sense to analyse almost all agreements, it does not fit in some cases. In The Satanita the rules of a yacht race stipulated that the yachtsmen would be liable, beyond limits set in statute, {{to pay for all}} damage to other boats. The Court of Appeal held that there was a contract to pay arising from the rules of the competition between The Satanita's owner and the owner of Valkyrie II, which he sank, even though there was no clear offer mirrored by a clear acceptance between the parties at any point. Along with a number of other critics, in a series of cases Lord Denning MR proposed that English law ought to abandon its rigid attachment to offer and acceptance in favour of a broader rule, that the parties need to be in substantial agreement on the material points in the contract. In Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp Ltd this would have meant that during a [...] "battle of forms" [...] two parties were construed as having material agreement on the buyer's standard terms, and excluding a price variation clause, although the other court members reached the same view on ordinary analysis. In Gibson v Manchester CC he would have come to a different result to the House of Lords, by allowing <b>Mr</b> <b>Gibson</b> to buy his house from the council, even though the council's letter stated it [...] "should not be regarded as a firm offer". This approach would potentially give greater discretion to a court to do what appears appropriate at the time, without being tied to what the parties may have subjectively intended, particularly where those intentions obviously conflicted.|$|E

50|$|A long {{memoir of}} Cogan {{appeared}} in the Christian Reformer, xi. 237-59 (1855), and was printed at Hackney as a pamphlet the same year.

60|$|In {{a narrow}} passage between the High Street and the Close he met <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson.</b> There {{had come to}} be that sort of {{intimacy}} between the two men which grows from closeness of position rather than from any social desire on either side, and it was natural that Burgess should say a word of farewell. On the previous evening Miss Stanbury had relieved her mind by turning <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> into ridicule in her description to Brooke of {{the manner in which the}} clergyman had carried on his love affair; and she had at the same time declared that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> had been most violently impertinent to herself. He knew, therefore, that Miss Stanbury and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> had become two, and would on this occasion have passed on without a word relative to the old lady had <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> allowed him to do so. But <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> spoke his mind freely.|$|E
60|$|But was {{it within}} her aunt's power {{to offer to}} her the husband? <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> had always been very civil to her. She had spoken more to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> than to any other man in Exeter. But it had never {{occurred}} to her for a moment that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> had any special liking for her. Was it probable that he would ever entertain any feeling of that kind for her? It certainly had occurred to her before now that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> was sometimes bored by the Miss Frenches;--but then gentlemen do get bored by ladies.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} a little of them is very nice," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson.</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> was {{certainly}} an awkward man. But there are men so awkward {{that it seems to}} be their especial province to say always the very worst thing at the very worst moment.|$|E
60|$|He even {{forgot that}} he was to be married in October, and in these {{circumstances}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gibson,</b> Miss Banks, and Mrs. Church put their banns up. This acted as a specific, and Captain Barber, putting the best face he could on the matter, went and interviewed the verger on his own behalf.|$|R

50|$|He married Australian actress Billie Carlyle (c1901-1991), who {{appeared}} as a 'straight-woman' in his act. They met whilst acting in the silent film The Adventures of Algy (1925). Carlyle later wrote a book, Claude Dampier, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gibson</b> & Me (1978). 'Mrs. Gibson' was Dampier's gimmick (apparently developed accidentally), a fictitious member of the audience with whom he spoke throughout his act.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gibson</b> (Ethel Owen) {{in various}} episodes of the TV show The Honeymooners {{frequently}} insults her son-in-law Ralph by making jokes about his weight, telling Alice about other men who has courted {{her before she}} married Ralph {{in front of him}} and saying things that make him mad enough that he shouts at her to get out of the house.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{a member}} of the Old Testament Revision Company; and {{accompanied}} Mrs. Lewis and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gibson</b> on the 1893 trip to Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt following the sisters' discovery there the previous year of a palimpsest of the Gospels in Syriac.

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I {{ought to go}} to my aunt now, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson,</b> as perhaps she might want something." [...] Then she did push back her chair, and stand upon her legs,--and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson,</b> after pausing for a moment, allowed her to escape. Soon after that the {{visitors}} went, and Brooke Burgess was left in the drawing-room with Miss Stanbury and Dorothy.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, your aunt;--she {{told me that}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> was {{to marry}} your sister. You know your aunt's way. She spoke of it as though the thing were settled {{as soon as she}} had got it into her own head; and she was as hot upon it as though <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> had been an archbishop.

6000|$|... "Yes;--she is in bed; but {{she thinks}} {{it would be a}} comfort to her.

[...] Now <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> was not only going to be Bella's brother-in-law, but he was also a clergyman. Camilla in her heart {{believed}} that the half-clerical aspect which her mother had given to the request was false and hypocritical. There were special reasons why Bella should not have wished to see <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> in her bedroom, at any rate till <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gibson</b> had become her brother-in-law. The expression of such a wish at the present moment was almost indecent.|$|E
50|$|Holmes {{uses his}} powers of {{deduction}} {{to solve the}} crime, and demonstrates, using Watson's revolver, how it was perpetrated: <b>Mrs</b> <b>Gibson,</b> outraged and jealous of Miss Dunbar's relationship with her husband, resolved to end her own life and frame her rival for the crime. After arranging a meeting with Miss Dunbar, requesting her to leave her response in a note, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Gibson</b> tied a rock {{on a piece of}} string {{to the end of a}} revolver, and shot herself, the rock pulling the revolver over the side of the bridge; the revolver found in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe was the other pistol of the pair, which had been fired off in the woods earlier, and the chip in the bridge was caused by the pistol hitting the stonework as it was pulled off by the rock. Holmes's reconstruction reproduces the damage to the balustrade of the bridge. He asks the police to drag the lake for the revolvers of Watson and Gibson.|$|R
