40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Audubon Nebraska, a state office of the National Audubon Society, {{purchased}} the 610 -acre O 2 ̆ 7 Brien Ranch located three miles south of Denton, Nebraska. The site, now called Spring Creek Prairie Audubon Center (SCPAC), will be devoted to prairie education and restoration. The Center 2 ̆ 7 s size expanded to 626 acres in 2000 when the Wachiska Audubon Society bought an adjacent 16 -acre property on the northwest comer of the section. Historically, most of the ranch was never farmed, probably because of its hills and {{the large number of}} glacial boulders present in the soil. It {{is one of the largest}} native grasslands remaining in Lancaster County, containing nearly 500 acres of unplowed tall grass prairie. Other natural features include Spring Creek and its associated riparian zones, several wetlands, springs, ravines, and a mature bur oak woodland. Six cattle ponds have been constructed on site, two along Spring Creek. There is a 52 -acre crop field in the southeast comer, two small (3 ̆c 5 acres) abandoned alfalfa fields, and disturbed areas north and south of the ranch house. A century of cattle ranching has impacted the floristic composition of the prairie. Overgrazing on portions of several pastures has encouraged the spread of woody and exotic plant species. Large, resilient stands of excellent prairie, though, remain. A three-year research project catalogued more than 340 plant species (Kottas 2000). Current land management targets the removal of invasive and exotic plants - honey locust, Siberian elms, leafy spurge, and <b>musk</b> <b>thistles</b> being priorities - and the establishment of native flora. Because prairie developed naturally under periodic grazing of bison, elk, and other animals, grazing will continue with cattle, but with lower stocking rates than the previous owner 2 ̆ 7 s and a rotation system. All pastures are periodically rested and burned to revitalize vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Drought is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} for South Dakota beef producers. The variation in weed control that ranchers need to manage for is the intensity and duration of the rainfall shortages. The common problem however, {{is what happens when}} grass and forbs become stressed and the changes to the vegetation that occurs. Stresses or disturbances that cause the grasses to slow growth and open up bare areas can include several situations; over grazing, flooding, wild fires, severe hail, growing season freeze, soil disturbances (prairie dogs or pocket gophers), and drought. Weeds are very opportunistic and competitive and will readily invade bare areas of ground that are created by these conditions. Once established weeds will aggressively compete for light, nutrients, moisture and space. This will allow for quick weed establishment and when more favorable conditions occur, weeds will spread to new areas and weed densities will increase. Weeds can be divided into three growth categories; 1. Annuals, 2. Biennials, and 3. Perennials. Within these groups they can further be categorized as cool season or warm season plants or as a broadleaf, grass or sedge plants. The plants we tend to be more concerned with during or following drought are the broadleaf weeds. The broadleaf weeds that cause the biggest problems are those introduced or invasive plants that have gotten a foothold here. In South Dakota the invasive weeds of major emphasis for grasslands include Canada thistle, leafy spurge, hoary cress, the knapweeds, biennial <b>thistles</b> (<b>musk,</b> plumeless, bull and scotch), the toadflaxes, field bindweed, absinth wormwood and common mullein. All of these and others are on South Dakota’s state wide and locally noxious lists. They are considered regulated pests in the state. Another group of plants that can take advantage of drought and become a problem in range settings is some native forbs like the vervains, common sunflower, horseweed or marestail, golden rod family, perennial ragweed and cudweed sagewort. In normal conditions these plants are not considered invasive. They can have good forage value at certain growth stages. This can reduce grazing pressure on desirable grass species recovering form drought...|$|R

Fire is a threat, and a drought in 2002 also reduced the population.|$|E
50|$|Damage to {{the plant}} occurs mainly from larval {{destruction}} of the flower head, which prevents seed production. Some larvae tunnel through the upper stem instead of chambering in a flower head; this can also be destructive {{to the plant}}. Adults do some damage as well when they feed on the foliage. Thistles which reproduce only via seed, such as <b>musk</b> <b>thistle,</b> are controlled well by this weevil and its seed head destroying larvae. Some thistles are able to reproduce vegetatively, and while they are impacted as well, they can sometimes survive.|$|E
50|$|Philmont {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of flora. There are five of the Merriam life zones at Philmont - the Arctic, Hudsonian, Canadian, Transition, and Upper Sonoran zones. Trees at Philmont range from the plains cottonwood to the quaking aspen to the ponderosa pine. Wildflowers at Philmont include prickly poppy, shrubby cinquefoil, skyrocket (scarlet gilia), fairy slipper, blue columbine, and pinedrops. There are also a number of grasses, lichens, ferns, and mushrooms. Locoweed (which is poisonous to livestock), <b>musk</b> <b>thistle,</b> leafy spurge, and tamarisk are all invasive species found at Philmont.|$|E
50|$|The main {{threat to}} this species is {{probably}} biological pest control agents released to control non-native thistle species. For example, the weevil Rhinocyllus conicus was released to control <b>musk</b> <b>thistle,</b> Carduus nutans, {{but once in}} the wild it also attacked many native species, including native thistles such as C. perplexans. The weevil Larinus planus has been released near the habitat of C. perplexans for the biological control of Cirsium arvense. It is not yet known if this weevil will attack C. perplexans. In addition, herbicides used to control invasive thistles may harm native species.|$|E
50|$|This weevil is {{native to}} Eurasia and North Africa. It was first {{introduced}} to the United States for thistle biocontrol in 1969, {{and it is now}} widely established in that country. The weevil was found to be very effective in reducing the spread of invasive thistles, particularly <b>musk</b> <b>thistle,</b> but also welted, Italian, bull, milk, and other thistles. However, the weevil will also readily attack native thistles of genus Cirsium, in some cases contributing to population decline. It {{is for this reason that}} this weevil is no longer recommended for distribution as a biocontrol agent. Further releases of the weevil are prohibited in many areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{protected}} area is covered mainly by beech (Fagus orientalis).

50|$|This thistle is a {{perennial}} herb which can grow to 200 cm (80 inches) in height. The plant is mostly purple, particularly the stems and inflorescences. The rosetted leaves {{are up to}} 50 cm (20 inches) long and are mostly green, edged with yellow spines. Each robust plant produces many flower heads which hang on nodding branches. Flowering occurs during the summer. Each head is 3 to 5 centimeters wide and long and has an involucre of phyllaries which are purple, curve outward, and taper into hard, toothed spines. The head bears many hairlike pinkish purple flowers. The fruit is an achene with a plumelike pappus up to 2 centimeters long. This thistle may resemble <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carduus nutans) in appearance.|$|E
50|$|Exotic {{species of}} flora {{that are not}} native to the region include Canada thistle, <b>Musk</b> <b>thistle,</b> Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax.

Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1000000 acre of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas fir beetle, and that the insects had killed between 25 and 100 percent of {{the trees in the}} impacted areas. The forest service is addressing the situation by performing controlled burns, selling dead trees as firewood, timber harvesting and spraying the highest value areas.|$|E
50|$|The thistle {{depends on}} streams and seeps for its survival. This habitat is {{threatened}} with destruction via {{the diversion of}} water. The wetland habitat can be damaged by logging, road maintenance, and recreational activity. Livestock range {{over much of the}} area and can drastically alter the land by trampling it. The plant once occurred in a wider range of mountain wetland habitat in this area, but now it is mainly limited to steep rocky canyons that are inaccessible to livestock. The effect of livestock on the habitat became clear when animals were excluded from a sensitive area and the thistle proliferated in their absence. Introduced plant species in the area, such as <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> and Fuller's teasel (Dipsacus sylvestris), outcompete the native plant. The teasel is perhaps the worst offender; it has been seen sprouting {{up in the middle of}} stands of the thistle.|$|E
50|$|A 2010 update {{suggests}} that direct plant-plant competition {{is not a}} severe problem at this time, but that climate change could encourage it. A number of insects have been noted to feed on the plant, especially favoring the developing fruits in the seed heads. Noted insects include the gall fly Paracantha gentilis, the artichoke plume moth Platyptilia carduidactyla, the bumble flower beetle Euphoria inda, and the stem borer weevil Lixus pervestitus. Large sections of several thistle populations have been damaged {{by one or more}} of these insects. The non-native flower head weevil Rhinocyllus conicus has the potential to damage the thistle; it was purposely introduced to North America in an attempt to control various species of invasive thistles which are noxious weeds, including <b>musk</b> <b>thistle.</b> The weevil was never released in New Mexico because of its potential to attack the native thistle; unfortunately, it has moved into the area on its own. So far its distribution is limited but it is expected to spread. The extent of the expected damage to the species is not known.|$|E
50|$|According to a legend, an invading Norse {{army was}} {{attempting}} to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots {{to the presence of}} the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which {{marked the beginning of the}} departure of King Haakon IV (Haakon the Elder) of Norway who, having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides, had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years. Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours cotton thistle (Onopordum acanthium), perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in mediaeval times; the spear thistle (Cirsium vulgare), an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate. Other species, including dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carduus nutans), and melancholy thistle (Cirsium heterophyllum) have also been suggested.|$|E

40|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carduus nutans) is an {{herbaceous}} monocarpic herb {{introduced to}} the U. S. from Eurasia. The invasion of <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> can reduce forage area, soil stability, and reduce recreation and open areas for humans and wildlife. Resistance of warm season and cool season perennial grass communities to <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> invasion is important for land managers to consider, especially where disturbance has made an area particularly susceptible. Our results show that disturbances, such as overgrazing can open up niches in canopies of warm season grass communities and facilitate invasion but not in cool season grass communities. The mechanism of invasion by <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> may depend on an overlap in the timing of resource use patterns by the invader and perennial grass communities. Our results showed that an undisturbed (e. g., non-grazed, normal precipitation) stand of warm season perennial grasses can suppress the establishment of <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> by restricting the amount of light that reaches the soil surface. A disturbance of extreme drought creates more niches in warm season perennial grass communities (e. g., reduced growth), but newly germinating <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> plants cannot compete for the reduced amount of soil moisture. High disturbance (e. g., grazing) allowed extensive amounts of light to penetrate into overgrazed warm season perennial grass communities, which facilitated the successful invasion by <b>musk</b> <b>thistle.</b> In cool season perennial grass communities, light is less critical, regardless of soil moisture. The unsuccessful invasion of <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> into cool season perennial grass communities is most likely due to grass root phenology and distribution (88 m m- 2). Root growth and development and distribution patterns {{should be taken into}} account for effective perennial grass restoration in areas with high risk from invasive plant species. The ecology of <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> seed suggests germination is strongly influenced by temperature, light, moisture, salinity, dormancy and habitat types and should be factored into an integrated invasive plant management plan that targets early growth of <b>musk</b> <b>thistle</b> seedlings.
