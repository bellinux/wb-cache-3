40|$|Dragon {{fruit is}} one of the most nutritious and exotic fruit that is {{available}} in Malaysia. In this research,dragon fruit juice was concentrated by using freeze concentration process. Concentrated fruit juice can be preserved longer than non concentrated fruit juice. Besides,due to its small capacity storage,concentrated fruit juice also can minimize the transportation cost to import or export it. Freeze concentration process was used because it eliminates water from the juice at temperature below the water’s freezing point,thus preserving the aromatic compound that originally contained in the fruit juice. In addition to research objective,two process parameters and its effect on the fruit juice final concentration were studied. The process parameters were stirring rate and <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> temperature. The apparatus used to done the freeze concentration process was crystallizer unit. Dragon fruit juice that was blended and standardized its initial concentration was put into the crystallization unit. The fruit juice spent 12 hours in the crystallizer unit. During the time spent in the crystallizer unit,stirring rate and <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> temperature were varied in the range of (600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400) rpm and (- 6, - 8, - 10, - 12 and - 14) °C. To determine the best stirring rate,the temperature of the <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> in the crystallizer unit was constant at - 10 °C while the stirring rate of the fruit juice was varied. Then,the best stirring rate was used to determine the best <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> temperature. The dragon fruit juice initial concentration was standardized at 7 °Brix. After 12 hour spent in the crystallization unit,the concentration of the fruit juice increased.

Exchanger Design & Rating is used to design the plate heat exchangers and the shell and tube heat exchangers, HYSYS is used to create the intermediate <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> loop.

A direct system weighs only 55 % of the total weight of the indirect system, the equipment used costs 31 % more to buy than the equipment used in a indirect system. On offshore platforms there is a shortage on free space to put either equipment or house working staff. Therefore the cooling system that takes up the least space might have an advantage.
