We hypothesised that <b>micro-aggregates</b> of chondrocytes generated in high-throughput prior to implantation in a defect could stimulate cartilaginous matrix deposition and remodelling. To address this issue, we designed a micro-mould to enable controlled high-throughput formation of <b>micro-aggregates.</b> Morphology, stability, gene expression profiles and chondrogenic potential of <b>micro-aggregates</b> of human and bovine chondrocytes were evaluated and compared to single-cells cultured in micro-wells and in 3 D after encapsulation in Dextran-Tyramine (Dex-TA) hydrogels in vitro and in vivo. We successfully formed <b>micro-aggregates</b> of human and bovine chondrocytes with highly controlled size, stability and viability within 24 hours. <b>Micro-aggregates</b> of 100 cells presented a superior balance in Collagen type I and Collagen type II gene expression over single cells and <b>micro-aggregates</b> of 50 and 200 cells. Matrix metalloproteinases 1, 9 and 13 mRNA levels were decreased in <b>micro-aggregates</b> compared to single-cells. Histological and biochemical analysis demonstrated enhanced matrix deposition in constructs seeded with <b>micro-aggregates</b> cultured in vitro and in vivo, compared to single-cell seeded constructs. Whole genome microarray analysis and single gene expression profiles using human chondrocytes confirmed increased expression of cartilage-related genes when chondrocytes were cultured in <b>micro-aggregates.</b> In conclusion, we succeeded in controlled high-throughput formation of <b>micro-aggregates</b> of chondrocytes. Compared to single cell-seeded constructs, seeding of constructs with <b>micro-aggregates</b> greatly improved neo-cartilage formation.

Kenya to elucidate the mechanisms associated with long-term carbon storage. Specifically, {{we looked at}} a top-down model (macro-aggregates form around organic matter particles and <b>micro-aggregates</b> form within the macro-aggregates) and a bottom-up model (<b>micro-aggregates</b> form independently and are incorporated into macro-aggregates) of soil aggregate formation. Soil samples were collected from experiments on improved tree fallows using different species and two tillage treatments; water-stable aggregates were extracted and sorted into three size classes: macro-aggregates (> 212 µm), meso-aggregates (53 – 212 µm) and <b>micro-aggregates</b> (20 – 53 µm). Organic matter characterization of each fraction was based on 13 C isotope abundance, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and the abundance of polysaccharides. Improved fallows increased soil C by 0. 28 and 0. 26 kg m­ 2 in the top 20 cm of the soil profile in Luero and Teso, respectively. Tillage altered the distribution of aggregates among size classes. Changes in the d 13 C signature in each fraction indicated that more of the new carbon {{was found in the}} macro-aggregates (35 – 70 %) and meso-aggregates (18 – 49 %) in Luero and less (9 – 17 %) was found in the <b>micro-aggregates.</b> In Teso, about 40 – 80 % of the new aggregate C was found in the meso-aggregates, 14 – 45 % was found in the <b>micro-aggregates</b> and only 4 – 26 % was found in the macro-aggregates. The meso-aggregates and macro-aggregates to a lesser extent, in both sites, were enriched in carboxylic-C and aromatic-C, indicating the importance of OM decomposition and plant-derived C in the stabilization of larger aggregates, supporting the top-down model of aggregate formation. Microbially derived polysaccharides play {{a leading role in the}} formation of stable <b>micro-aggregates</b> and carboxylic-C promotes stabilization through surface occlusion. This bottom-up process is essential to promote long-term carbon sequestration in soils. Additionally, the <b>micro-aggregates</b> at both sites were enriched in polysaccharides and had elevated ratios of galactose + mannose:arabinose + xylose than the other aggregate fractions, indicating the importance of microbial processes in the formation of stable <b>micro-aggregates</b> and supporting the bottom-up model...|$|R

However, how these abiotic and biotic entities interact in a microhabitat is not fully understood.

40|$|Soil {{structure}} {{is a key}} characteristic of soil functioning. More, silt and clay-sized organo-mineral fractions are usually considered as the most reactive soil fractions. As transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) appeared to be well-suited to study soil microstructures, {{it was used to}} test the sensitivity of <b>micro-aggregates</b> to land use and cultivation practices. The aims of this study were therefore (1) to use TEM to characterize the organic materials involved in the stable 0 - 20 mu m <b>micro-aggregates</b> of a cultivated topsoil and (2) to highlight any impact of cultivation practices and of inter-annual variation on micro-aggregation. For this, the study was conducted on a Calcic Cambisol (pH of 7. 1, organic matter content of 33 g kg(- 1), C-to-N ratio around 10), developed in Eastern France and sampled two consecutive years before and after the exceptional dry period occurring in 2003. It was cropped under maize following moderate tillage and fertilisation within an experimental station. Digested sewage sludge has been applied since 1996 according to regulations for environmental controls at the rate of 10 Mg ha(- 1) year for 4 years. Granulometric soil fractionations of samples from plots with or without sewage sludge addition were performed. Then, morphological and analytical characterization by TEM of the water-stable < 20 mu m <b>micro-aggregates</b> were carried out to specify their aggregative organic matter. 0 - 20 mu m water-stable fraction contained more than 60 % of the soil carbon. A typology of < 20 mu m <b>micro-aggregates</b> was established according the nature of aggregative organic matter. It appeared that among 0 - 2 mu m and 2 - 20 mu m <b>micro-aggregates,</b> those containing young organic matter of plant and microbial origin were involved in the most stable associations. The impact of the dry period on soil microstructure between 2002 and 2003 corresponded to both an increase in the 0 - 2 mu m water-dispersibility and a decrease in the mean size of the 2 - 20 mu m water-stable aggregates. Sewage sludge addition slightly increased the proportion of the 50 - 200 mu m water-stable macro-aggregates and induced the formation of <b>micro-aggregates</b> containing sludge flocs, which could be considered as specific sewage sludge fingerprints. Descriptors of 0 - 20 mu m stable <b>micro-aggregates,</b> i. e. size, stability and typology, appeared as a promising tool to specify the dynamics of the organo-mineral associations in soils subjected to environmental changes or cultivation practices.

40|$|Extract] Studies of {{the fate}} of fine {{sediment}} {{at the mouth of}} muddy rivers have revealed that the sediment generally falls rapidly out of suspension and does not follow the brackish water in the river plume. The Amazon River plume is a well-documented example (Geyer et a 1. 1991; Kineke et al 1996). This observation has been attributed to the formation in coastal waters of large flocs, also called <b>micro-aggregates,</b> that accelerate the settling of the fine sediment. Such flocs have also been found in the Dutch coastal zone (Eisma et a 1. 1990), the North Carolina inner shelf (Wells 1989) and the Amazon shelf (Berhane et al. 1997). These floes can exceed many hundreds, sometimes thousands, of µm in diameter. Their settling velocity is thus much higher than that of the floes usual 1 y found in very turbid estuaries, these flocs are seldom much larger than 100 µm in diameter (Gibbs 1985; Gibbs et at 1989; Wolanski and Gibbs 1995). The formation of <b>micro-aggregates</b> is thus important in controlling {{the fate of}} riverine sediment The processes generating the <b>micro-aggregates</b> have been little studied, though it has been speculated they were biological in nature (Cloern et al. 1983; Nelsen and Trefry 1986; Monaco et al. 1990). Recently Zimmerman and Kausch (1996) and Ayukai and Wolanski (1997) documented the planktonic origin of these <b>micro-aggregates</b> in respectively the Elbe River estuary and the Fly River plume in Torres Strait, Australia. These <b>micro-aggregates</b> essentially formed a mud-affected “marine snow “. The marine snow was previously documented only for the open ocean where there was negligible sediment in suspension (Alldredge and Silver 1988; Alldredge et al. 1993), In the Fly River, plume microphotographs of the undisturbed flocs (Ayukai and Wolanski 1997) revealed that the fine sediment particles that have escaped trapping in the estuary attach themselves to the sticky surface of the marine snow. The resulting <b>micro-aggregates</b> settle out of suspension near the mouth of the Fly River while the plume extends tens of kilometers further offshore. In the case of the Fly River the extremely high turbidity in the estuary prevents significant plankton growth in the estuary itself where the flocs are small (typically < 100 µm in diameter; Wolanski and Gibbs 1995). Thus the Fly River estuary behaves like a physical filter while the coastal zone behaves as a biological filter. Presumably in less turbid systems the plankton growth can be significant in the estuary which behaves both as a physical filter and a biological filter; this indeed {{seems to be the case}} in the Elbe River estuary (Zimmermann and Kausch 1996). In all these systems the fine sediment settling zone extends onto the inner shelf several kilometers to several tens of kilometers away from the river mouth. ...|$|R
40|$|Micro-wells {{can be used}} as {{a system}} for {{high-throughput}} generation of micro-aggregates [1]. By seeding cells on a non-adhesive substrate such as agarose, the cells effectively de-wet from the surface and become spherical three-dimensional aggregates. The formation of these aggregates is characterized by two phases. First, the cells actively migrate towards one another to form a loose cluster of cells. Next, the clusters condensate into smooth, spherical micro-aggregates. The three-dimensional micro-environment in these micro-aggregates stimulates auto- and paracrine signalling [2]. Moreover, micro-aggregates allow the cells to establish a favourable mechanical niche by remodelling their cytoskeleton, strengthening adhesion and depositing extracellular matrix, all of which affect the cell phenotype and cell fate in in vitro systems. In this study, we use cell-based models to simulate the dynamics of <b>micro-aggregate</b> formation and investigate the most important parameters affecting the final shape and dynamics of the <b>micro-aggregate</b> (see Figure 1). The influence of cell seeding density and mechanical properties of the cells on the aggregation process are of special interest. Furthermore, the model is used to gain insights into the stress distribution inside the aggregates. Mechanical properties of the cells have been determined by means of atomic force microscopy measurements and have been used to estimate model parameters. The first phase of aggregation, cell migration, is modelled as a persistent random walk. The second phase is represented by increasing the adhesion energy for a given contact between two cells over a specific timespan. Cell positions are updated by solving equations of motion for an overdamped system. The simulated outcome is compared to time-lapse microscropy images as well as confocal images of in vitro micro-well micro-aggregates of hPDC cells. By conducting a parameter study, critical parameter intervals were determined for optimal <b>micro-aggregate</b> production. A single spherical <b>micro-aggregate</b> will be created as long as migration forces are high enough to overcome the initial forces of adhesion, and the directed component of cell migration is high enough to prevent the formation of multiple aggregates. In the future, the distribution of mechanical stress inside aggregates will be cross-correlated with the phenotypical heterogeneity. This will further our understanding of the effect of mechanical signals on cell fate, and help improve the design of cell culture systems which make use of guided self-assembly processes.

This study was conducted to determine changes in {{hydraulic conductivity}} and macro- and <b>micro-aggregate</b> stability of a fine-textured submerged soil under intense cattle grazing for 15 years. Hydraulic conductivity of the cattle grazing soil ranged from very slow (0. 46 cm hr- 1) to slow (19. 56 cm hr- 1) in the top 0 - 25 cm depth, and attained near zero permeability (0. 15 cm hr- 1) before 75 cm depth. Permeability was rapid (21. 1 to 30. 06 cm hr- 1) throughout the profile in the non-cattle grazing soil. Organic residues from cattle grazing activities raised the soil total organic carbon to as high as 72 g kg- 1 in the top 0 - 25 cm depth. Wet trampling of organic residues from cattle excreta induced greater soil swelling and loss of soil strength resulting in low aggregated silt and clay (ASC) and clay flocculation index (CFI) within the 25 - 75 cm depth.

40|$|Summary In {{order to}} {{understand}} better the mechanisms of structural crust formation on coarse-textured soils, mixtures of 92. 5 % sand and 7. 5 % Ca 2 +-kaolinite are exposed to simulated rainfall in experiments- involving a range of sand particle sizes, drop diameters and drop kinetic energies. For each combination of these variables, clay illuviation is measured and the changes in surface structure are observed on thin sections. The intensity of clay illuviation is inversely proportional to sand particle size and is shown {{to be determined by}} both rainfall and drop kinetic energy. A washed-out layer forms at the surface of all samples exposed to drop impact. The lower boundary of this layer is generally marked by a relative concentration of clay <b>micro-aggregates</b> {{in the form of a}} band. These <b>micro-aggregates</b> are probably fragments derived from grain coatings initially present in the washed-out layer. They accumulate at a depth that increases, on average, with drop kinetic energy and with the particle size of the sand fraction. Based on similarities with natural crusts, it is proposed that clay-band formation in structural crusts formed on coarse-textured soils may be initiated by the displacement of <b>micro-aggregates</b> or other small particles from the washed-out layer, followed by their accumulation due to mechanical straining. The experiments also point to the potential importance of the particle size of the sand fraction on the morphology of structural crusts...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the sustainability and efficiency of soil carbon sequestration measures {{and the impact of}} different management and environmental factors, information on soil organic matter (SOM) stability and mean residence time (MRT) is required. However, this information on SOM stability and MRT is expensive to determine via radiocarbon dating, precluding a wide spread use of stability measurements in soil science. In this paper, we test an alternative method, first developed by Conen et al. (2008) for undisturbed Alpine grassland systems, using C and N stable isotope ratios in more frequently disturbed agricultural soils. Since only information on carbon and nitrogen concentrations and their stable isotope ratios is required, it is possible to estimate the SOM stability at greatly reduced costs compared to radiocarbon dating. Using four different experimental sites located in various climates and soil types, this research proved the effectiveness of using the C/N ratio and δ 15 N signature to determine the stability of mOM (mineral associated organic matter) relative to POM (particulate organic matter) in an intensively managed agro-ecological setting. Combining this approach with δ 13 C measurements allowed discriminating between different management (grassland vs cropland) and land use (till vs no till) systems. With increasing depth the stability of mOM relative to POM increases, but less so under tillage compared to no-till practises. Applying this approach to investigate SOM stability in different soil aggregate fractions, it corroborates the aggregate hierarchy theory as proposed by Six et al. (2004) and Segoli et al. (2013). The organic matter in the occluded <b>micro-aggregate</b> and silt & clay fractions is less degraded than the SOM in the free <b>micro-aggregate</b> and silt & clay fractions.

30|$|Acacia oerfota, Acacia Senegal and Acacia nilotica {{which have}} {{increased}} the soil organic matter accumulation. The higher soil organic matter content in exclosure can potentially improve the soil physical properties such as soil structure and total porosity.

Acacia etbaica tree in exclosure produces higher amount of woody litter, which has lower rate of decay (Descheemaeker et al. 2006). Conversely, the soil organic carbon content is significantly lower in the grazing land compared to the exclosure, probably the consequence of reduced amount of organic materials (litter fall) and exposure of <b>micro-aggregate</b> organic matter to microbial decomposition through weaker physical protection of organic matter in the soil.

The extra C uptake may also be stored in forest floor litter and in forest soil. After five years of FACE treatment at the EuroFACE short rotation poplar plantation, the increase of total soil C% was larger under elevated than under ambient CO 2. However, the fate of this additional C allocated belowground remains unclear. The stability of soil organic matter {{is controlled by the}} chemical structure of the organic matter and the existence of protection offered by the soil matrix and minerals. Fresh litter entering the soil enhances microbial activity which induces the binding of organic matter and soil particles into macro-aggregates. As the enclosed organic matter is decomposed, microbial and decomposition products become associated with mineral particles. This association results in the formation of <b>micro-aggregates</b> (within macro-aggregates) in which organic matter is stabilized and protected. FACE and N-fertilization treatment did not affect the micro- and macro-aggregate weight, C or N fractions obtained by wet sieving. However, Populus euramericana increased the micro- and small macro-aggregates weight and C fractions. The obtained macro-aggregates were broken up in order to isolate recently formed <b>micro-aggregates</b> within macro-aggregates (iM-micro-aggregates). FACE increased the iM-micro-aggregate weight and C fractions. This study reveals that: 1) Species has an effect on the formation of macro-aggregates. The choice of species in a plantation or the effect of global change on species diversity, may therefore affect the stabilization and protection of soil C in aggregates.

40|$|Soil plays a {{key role}} in the global carbon (C) cycle. Most current {{assessments}} of SOC stocks and the guidelines given by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) focus on the top 30 cm of soil. Our research shows that, when considering only total quantities, most of the SOC stocks are found in this top layer. However, not all forms of SOC are equally valuable as long-term stable stores of carbon: the majority of SOC is available for mineralisation and can potentially be re-emitted to the atmosphere. SOC associated with <b>micro-aggregates</b> and silt plus clay fractions is more stable and therefore represents a long-term carbon store. Our research shows that most of this stable carbon is located at depths below 30 cm (42 % of subsoil SOC is located in <b>micro-aggregates</b> and silt and clay, compared to 16 % in the topsoil), specifically in soils that are subject to clay illuviation. This has implications for land management decisions in temperate grassland regions, defining the trade-offs between primary productivity and C emissions in clay-illuviated soils, as a result of drainage. Therefore, climate smart land management should consider the balance between SOC stabilisation in topsoils for productivity versus sequestration in subsoils for climate mitigation.

40|$|Micro-aggregation of {{precursor}} cells enhances cell performance upon differentiation both in vitro and in vivo [1]. Although {{the underlying mechanisms}} have remained largely unknown, it has been demonstrated that micro- aggregation creates a three-dimensional environment that recapitulates aspects of embryonic differentiation via auto- and paracrine signaling [2]. Moreover, micro-aggregation allows cells to establish a favorable mechanical micro-environment, by remodeling their cytoskeleton, depositing ECM and strengthening adhesion. Patterning micro-wells into a substrate is an ideal platform to generate micro-aggregates in a controlled and high throughput manner. The use of a non-adhesive substrate - e. g. agarose – prevents the cells from attachment and hence results in spherical micro-aggregates. In general, the formation of cell aggregates is characterized by two phases. First, the cells actively migrate towards each other to form a loose cluster of spherical cells. Next, the cell cluster condensates and contracts into a smooth spherical <b>micro-aggregate.</b> The dynamics of <b>micro-aggregate</b> formation differ depending on cell type, dimensions of the micro-well and number of cells per well. In this study, we developed a model which describes the mechanism of micro-aggregation {{by focusing on the}} behavior and mechanics of individual cells (See Figure 1). The model includes two important biological phenomena. Firstly, the cells perform a directed random walk which is influenced by chemo-taxis. Secondly, the adhesion energy for a given contact between two cells increases over a specified time. The cells’ positions are updated by solving the equation of motion which is formulated for an over-damped system. The simulations are compared to time lapsed microscopy images of in vitro micro-well cell aggregation of ATDC 5 cells. The model predicts that the same cell behavior that results in realistic single cell migration also gives rise to the observed collective cell migration of the complete aggregate. Furthermore, a parameter study shows that spherical aggregates will be created as long as cell migration forces are high enough to overcome the initial forces of adhesion, and the directed component of cell migration is high enough to prevent the formation of multiple aggregates.

30|$|The yellow–brown earths, forming on the Quaternary {{red clay}} or {{weathered}} material of limestone in hot, humid and rainy climate conditions in Guizhou karst areas, {{are viewed as}} {{the main body of}} soil erosion inherently and considered to be problematic in poor water-holding capacity, unstable structures, and even lean crop productivity (Gao and Li, 2007). As the basic unit of soil structure of the yellow–brown earth, the stability of aggregate {{is one of the most}} important factors controlling soil erodibility (Duiker et al., 2001). Soil aggregates are formed by the primary soil particles and soil cemented materials with the coagulation, cementation and cohesive actions, the stability of which is an important indicator for the soil quality evaluation. According to the different ways to destroy the soil aggregates, the stability of soil aggregates can be divided into mechanical stability, water stability, chemical stability, acidic and basic stability and biostability (Domżł et al., 1993). Water stability can be defined as the property and capacity of soil aggregates to resist hydraulic damage, and this stability may include wet aggregate stability (macro-aggregate stability > 250  μm) and dispersible clay (<b>micro-aggregate</b> stability < 250  μm) (Amezketa, 1999).|$|E
40|$|Pedologic {{alterations}} after long-term {{sugar cane}} (Saccharum officinarum) cropping cycles under traditional soil management systems were studied {{on a farm}} in Bariri, SP, Brazil. A toposequence was established to evaluate the effects of the soil position in the relief in changing soil physical attributes. Morphological field descriptions and laboratory analyses were carried out on vertical profiles of the upper, middle and lower thirds of a Typic Haplorthox slope. Soil bulk density and macroporosity changed along the toposequence reflecting on soil hydrodynamics, especially in the lower slope parts. At sites with high clay levels, empty spaces were filled forming block shaped structures together with the <b>micro-aggregate</b> structure. The intensive cultivation induced the greatest soil structure alterations, even at the deepest layers. The study pointed out the importance of performing detailed morphological observations in vertical profiles, due to the great variation on pedological attributes over short distances. Compacted soil sections were observed side-by-side with desaggregated mottles in the same soil profile. This fact evidenced that both vertical (in each profile) and horizontal gradients (along a toposequence) need to be considered in studies of time sequence variation of pedological parameters...|$|E
40|$|Structure is {{the most}} striking, visual aspect of {{vertisol}} morphology. The type and degree of structure development in a vertisol provides a digest of its genesis, constituent properties and agriculture management potential. The present study includes {{the results of the}} investigations of aggregate composition and water stability of structural aggregates in all horizons (Ap, A, AC, C) of 7 vertisol profiles formed over tertiary clayish and pyroclastic sediments in the central part of Macedonia (Štip, Probištip and Ovče Pole valleys). The main objectives were to determine and compare aggregate composition and water stability of structural aggregates of vertisols which have been used as long-term arable fields (6 of the analyzed profiles) or as pasture (1 profile). The most represented fraction of aggregates in the process of dry sieving of the soil samples is the fraction of cloddy macro-aggregates (> 10 mm), which {{is the most}} unfavourable from the agricultural point of view. Micro- aggregates fraction (< 0. 25 mm) is barely present, which means that in the dry state nearly all <b>micro-aggregates</b> and mechanical elements are associated in larger structural aggregates. The researched soils are characterized by different water stability of the structural aggregates. In the process of wet sieving, except surface horizon of the vertisol under natural vegetation, the cloddy macro-aggregates showed the greatest instability. With decrease of the dimension their stability increases so <b>micro-aggregates</b> have the highest water stability...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{development}} of nanoparticles {{in the form of}} inhalable <b>micro-aggregates</b> of biodegradable chitosan (CS) loaded with nicotine hydrogen tartrate (NHT) for potential pulmonary delivery of nicotine from dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations with prolonged release profile. The NHT-loaded CS particles were prepared using a water-in-oil emulsion crosslinking method. The prepared particles were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for morphological studies; Zetasizer and Mastersizer were applied for particle size analysis. The in vitro aerosolization of the formulations was studied using a twin-stage-impinger (TSI) and promising aerosolization characteristics were shown. The nanoparticles were spherical with size ranges between 167 and 411  nm while <b>micro-aggregates</b> (3. 73 – 4. 73  μm) were formed among nanoparticles. According to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, the NHT crystallinity was lost when in the particles, indicating it was uniformly dispersed as a solid solution. On the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the amount of NHT loaded on the surface of CS increased proportionally with increasing drug loading in the bulk so there was no surface enhancement. The fine particle doses (FPD) of NHT ranging between 1. 7 and 3. 2  mg from DPI formulations were concentration dependent and increased with increased drug loading. Based on the in vitro release study, NHT released from CS particles with a burst release in the first 8  h and subsequent prolonged release of nicotine...|$|R
