Okara, the residue remaining after soyamilk extraction is the main byproduct of the soyamilk industry. Currently okara is being utilized as a <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>food</b> ingredient, feed ingredient, or {{as a source of}} fertilizer. Although okara is a rich source of nutrients, it has not been fully exploited as an important food source. This study was conducted to evaluate the proximate composition of okara and to investigate the possibility of utilizing okara in bread making to improve the nutritional quality of bread. Fresh okara was analyzed for proximate composition. Fresh okara was dried in a cross flow cabinet dryer (Pheonix TK – Mini 10) at 60 0 C, 20 m/s air flow velocity for 3 hours. The dried okara was ground into flour and sieved [standard test sieve (ASTM), size 20]. Bread was prepared by substituting okara for wheat flour (w/w) at 10, 20 and 30 % levels. Sensory evaluation was conducted by 30 untrained panelists using five-point Hedonic scale on crust colour, crumb colour, taste, odour, appearance, mouth feel and overall acceptability.

At the final stage, two firms determine prices. We provide serval insights. First, we characterize the market conditions in which only one firm, both firms or neither firm will choose to offer organic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> We find that the higher the production costs or credence investment costs for organic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> are, the more likely firms are to choose to produce non-organic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> Second, if it is expensive enough to invest in organic credence, offering organic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> may still be uncompetitive, even if organic production cost appears to have no disadvantage compared to non-organic <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> Third, we highlight how the prices of organic <b>food</b> <b>products</b> in equilibrium are affected by market parameters. We show that when only one firm offers organic <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> this firm tends to offer a relatively low price if organic credence investment is expensive. Fourth, we highlight how one firm’s credence investment decision in equilibrium can be affected by the product type choice of the other firm.

Combinations of greenhouse gas intensities (per DB) with annual household expenditures results in the greenhouse gas emissions from annual food consumption. An energy analysis methodology is elaborated with greenhouse gas emissions to calculate greenhouse gas intensities. The CO 2 emission pattern resembles closely the household expenditure pattern. Emission patterns of CH 4 and N 2 O differ strongly from the expenditure pattern. <b>Food</b> <b>products</b> from cattle farming determine the CH 4 emissions, while <b>food</b> <b>products</b> from agriculture determine the N 2 O emissions. The non-CO 2 greenhouse gases contribute 25 % to the total emissions of CO 2 equivalents from Dutch household food consumption, significantly above their share in the total Dutch emission of greenhouse gases.
