That’s {{a question on}} the minds of a lot of operators as they prepare to go to the field. The economic structure of agriculture has changed dramatically in the past 12 months. Unfortunately, this is the off-year to conduct our biennial Nebraska <b>Custom</b> <b>Rates</b> Survey. The survey was last conducted a year ago, in the January to March time period of 2010...|$|R

Accurate per unit costs give confidence when constructing enterprise budgets and evaluating new technologies, such as no-till. <b>Custom</b> <b>rates</b> are often used as a proxy for per unit costs; however, this research, using entropy and jackknife estimation procedures, found that <b>custom</b> <b>rates</b> understate total ownership and operating costs by approximately 25 % for an average Kansas farm.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this program is to aid the farm manager in making {{decisions}} relative to owning and operating farm machinery. It does two things: 1) It calculates total fixed and total operatlng costs and sums them to get total costs, then calculates these costs on a per hour and per acre basis. And 2) Based on these costs, and the going <b>custom</b> <b>rates,</b> it will estimate {{the amount of money}} you can justify spending for a machine, or tell you the minimum size of operation to justify the investment.

40|$|Machinery {{costs for}} grain and forage {{production}} are {{often difficult to}} accurately estimate, but are {{an important component of}} production costs. Controlling machinery costs is important for maintaining or improving profitability, as machinery costs often separate profitable farms from unprofitable farms. Machinery costs often equal or even exceed total costs for variable inputs such as fertilizer, seed, and herbicides. Also, farmers can do little to profitably change these input costs, but they can affect their machinery costs. The goal here is to describe a fast and simple method to estimate machinery costs for a “typical ” farmer to develop a quick cost of production estimate or to provide benchmark for comparison. More complex methods provide more detailed and accurate cost estimates, but require more records and time to develop. This fast and simple adjusts easily obtainable <b>custom</b> <b>rates</b> to estimate machinery costs. Beaton, Dhuyvetter, and Kastens (2003) developed the method using data from Kansas farmers. They used detailed cost data to calculate per acre machinery costs for each farmer, and then calculated a relative cost ratio—the ratio of each farmer’s cost to the state average <b>custom</b> <b>rate</b> for that operation. They found that farmer machinery costs ranged from as low as 55 % to almost 250 % of the <b>custom</b> <b>rate,</b> indicating a wide variation in farmer machinery costs and one of the majo...|$|R

40|$|As I write this, {{there is}} still snow in some ditches and fence rows, and many fields look like they are just about right for rice {{planting}} rather than corn or soybeans. Nonetheless, spring fever has hit and the field work will soon be going at full throttle. This raises a frequently asked question: “What are <b>custom</b> <b>rates</b> this year?” The Nebraska <b>Custom</b> <b>Rate</b> Survey is conducted every two years, {{and we are in}} the process of analyzing the data from our 2010 survey. We will publish those numbers as soon as possible. At this point we are working on the data for Part I, Spring and Summer Activities, and surveys are still coming in for Part II on Fall and Miscellaneous Operations. We thank all responders who helped out by completing surveys and sending us their information.

There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{engineers}} and economists {{use a variety}} of engineering and economic principles in calculating a machine's use and costs. An effective farm manager must also know these principles and apply them when deciding to buy, lease, rent or share machinery. The most accurate method of determining machine costs is complete records of the actual costs incurred. Estimating costs is an alternative. When estimating costs, methods that require more data specific to your situation, the more accurate will be the estimate. The state <b>custom</b> <b>rate</b> guides provide some indication of machines costs based on what is being charged (Wisconsin <b>Custom</b> <b>Rate</b> Guide, 2004). The guides do not take into account your specific conditions, which may be quite different for you. Data in the guide may be impacted by the supply and demand of custom operators in a geographical area. Available machine cost tables provide an estimate based assumed input data such as machine list price, recommended acreage, fuel price, and labor. These tables often do not use of information specific to your operation. A frequently used table is the Minnesota Machine Cost Estimates published annually (Lazarus and Selley, 2005). They obtained list prices from machinery dealer surveys and used American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineer...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in machinery costs {{this year has}} created uncertainty about what are fair costs for custom services. Fuel costs certainly are a major factor, but the purchase or “sticker” prices of machinery and the repair costs have increased as well.

Over the same period, overhead costs which include taxes, interest and insurance went up 14 percent and labor costs increased 10 percent. These increases are measured by input cost indexes reported by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. Fuel costs may account for less than 10 percent of the total costs of some field operations such as planting or as much as 20 percent of total costs for operations such as combining...|$|R
