40|$|Eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in {{the southeastern}} United States are found {{predominantly}} in the intertidal zone. In this study, mesh bags (3 and 6 mm) were deployed over collecting frames, and the patterns of oyster settlement on these collectors were compared against unmeshed controls at three tidal heights (intertidal, low water, and subtidal) over three sampling regimes (biweekly, monthly, and seasonal) at two sites. Within the biweekly sampling regime, the meshed collectors and controls had similar patterns of settlement at the respective tidal heights. For monthly samplers, mesh treatments maintained higher settlement subtidally whereas controls had highest settlement on the collectors at <b>mean</b> <b>low-water</b> <b>level.</b> Controls had highest recruitment intertidally for seasonal collectors, whereas mesh treatments had higher recruitment lower in the intertidal zone. Conclusions from this experiment were {{that the use of}} mesh-covered collectors enhanced subtidal oyster recruitment. Causes of observed increases in subtidal settlement in mesh collectors over unmeshed controls over time could be the result of a combination of factors: predator exclusion, larval entrainment, or reduced desiccation, which seemed to overcome the detrimental effects of increased fouling, resulting in reduced flow and possible hypoxic conditions within the mesh bags. Given the degree of recruitment and the sizes of the recruits attained within the mesh bags, the use of these methods to attain juveniles for commercial purposes would appear to be both feasible and viable, particularly for long periods (up to 6 1110) of deployment.

40|$|The Holocene {{coastal plain}} of Suriname is a chenier plain. Its actual sedimentological {{development}} has been studied during three field-work periods (1966, 1967 / 1968, 1972). Clay is the predominant sediment in this low- to medium-energy environment. It accumulates in extensive shoreface-attached mudflats (sometimes considered as giant mudwaves), which migrate continuously to the west due to deposition of slingmud at their west side and simultaneous erosion of the east side. In between the mudflats cheniers may develop. Thin-section analysis of the clay deposits revealed that they are built up of an alternation of thick clayey laminae and thin laminae of silt and fine sand. The clayey laminae chiefly show a unistrial plasmic fabric. Disturbaces in the upper zone are caused by bioturbation. Two types of cheniers can be distinguished. One type contains fine sand which has been winnowed out of the pelite deposits. Since this sand is brought from the shelf the chenier formation begins at approximately <b>mean</b> <b>low-water</b> <b>level.</b> Longshore bars are formed and these are driven shoreward by wave action. The other type is built up of medium to coarse sand supplied by a local river. It is transported westward by beachdrift in a narrow zone around the mean high-water line. These cheniers develop therefore at or just above the mean high-tide level. The sedimentary structures of both types of cheniers have many characteristics in common. However, each type also has its own distinct features...|$|E

The zone from <b>mean</b> <b>low-water</b> neap <b>level</b> to 1. 5 m depth was mostly devoid of organisms {{as a result}} of the seasonal formation of the encrusting ice foot.

Within the bryozoans a succession of colonisation of different species was observed, the most abundant two of which occupied > 80 % of substratum in places. Substratum type seemed to be the main factor influencing community development in the shallow sublittoral at Signy Island, although ice impact prevents community development in the top 1. 5 m and limits it over the rest of the transect down to 5. 5 m.

The results suggested that the variation in the silt fraction and the food quality positively affected the total biomass. Mangrove clearance has caused a shift from a unimodal to a bimodal biomass size spectrum at all water levels, owing to an increase in smaller-bodied opportunistic non-selective deposit feeding nematodes.

To {{better understand the}} influence of mangrove clearance on the intertidal benthic community, we investigated the composition, biodiversity and standing stock of the macrofauna communities at high-, mid- and <b>low-water</b> <b>levels</b> in three contrasting habitats: a bare sand flat, a cleared mangrove and an intact mangrove. In addition, a community-wide metric approach based on taxon-specific carbon and nitrogen isotope values {{was used to compare}} the trophic structure between the three habitats. The habitats differed significantly in terms of macrofaunal standing stock, community composition and trophic structure. The high- and mid-water levels of the intact mangroves showed a distinct macrofaunal community characterized by elevated densities and biomass, largely governed by higher decapod and gastropod abundances. Diversity was similar for cleared and intact mangroves, but much lower for the bare sand flat. Community-wide metrics indicated highest trophic diversity and community niche breadth in the intact mangroves. Differences between the cleared and intact mangroves can be partly attributed to differences in sediment characteristics resulting from mangrove clearance. These results suggest a significant impact of mangrove clearance on the macrofaunal community and trophic structure.

Those on the wall have a ‘cornflake’ appearance and those affixed to the ceiling hang as fibrous membranes. PCR of DNA in the active biofilm, combined with morphologic data from the tubes in SEM micrographs, point to Leptothrix sp., a common Fe-oxidizing bacteria, as the primary organism in the biofilm.

A lower, well-developed accretional reef terrace between 3 and 5. 5 m above MLWS (<b>mean</b> <b>low-water</b> springs; hereafter denoted as "+") represents an extended interval of stable sea level. An upper erosional terrace and incipient coralgal rim between + 8. 5 to 10. 5 m represents a brief sea-level stillstand at this higher elevation. These features suggest the lower and upper terraces developed during discrete sea-level events. In {{an attempt to}} better define the timing of emplacement of each marine unit, 20 coral samples collected along vertical and lateral reef growth axis from both terraces were analysed with U-series dating. Unfortunately, all coral samples exhibited elevated δ 234 Uinitial values, suggesting that pervasive uptake of 234 U-enriched uranium and 230 Th thorium had occurred. Despite the shortcomings of absolute dating, a succession of events can be resolved though morphostratigraphic relationships. Comparison of the facies relationships, coral growth, and morphostratigraphic features between the lower and upper terraces indicates that an early to mid MIS 5 e stillstand at + 3 to 5 m {{was followed by a}} late rise to + 8. 5 to 10. 5 m.

This means that the landward boundary between shoreface and beach is the line of the average low-water mark. However this definition is not universal and frequently varies from author to author in the literature. Whilst some define the beach as the landward transition to the shoreface that extends from the low-water mark to the highest high-water mark, i.e. the zone that is only periodically or episodically (after a storm surge) flooded by water; other authors do not use the term [...] "beach" [...] for the landward element of a flat coast at all.

40|$|The {{availability}} of water shapes {{life in the}} western United States, {{and much of the}} water in the region originates in the Rocky Mountains. Few studies, however, have explicitly examined the history of water levels in the Rocky Mountains during the Holocene. Here, we examine the past levels of three lakes near the Continental Divide in Montana and Colorado to reconstruct Holocene moisture trends. Using transects of sediment cores and sub-surface geophysical profiles from each lake, we find that mid-Holocene shorelines in the small lakes (4 – 110 ha) were as much as ~ 10 m below the modern lake surfaces. Our results are consistent with existing evidence from other lakes and show that a wide range of settings in the region were much drier than today before 3000 – 2000 years ago. We also discuss evidence for millennial-scale moisture variation, including an abruptly-initiated and -terminated wet period in Colorado from 4400 to 3700 cal yr BP, and find only limited evidence for low-lake stands during the past millennium. The extent of <b>low-water</b> <b>levels</b> during the mid-Holocene, which were most severe and widespread ca. 7000 – 4500 cal yr BP, is consistent with the extent of insolation-induced aridity in previously published regional climate model simulations. Like the simulations, the lake data provide no evidence for enhanced zonal flow during the mid-Holocene, which has been invoked to explain enhanced mid-continent aridity at the time. The data, including widespread evidence for large changes on orbital time scales and for more limited changes during the last millennium, confirm the ability of large boundary-condition changes to push western water supplies beyond the range of recent natural variability...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the paradox of}} why Amazonian manatees Trichechus inunguis undergo seasonal migrations to a habitat where they apparently fast. Ten males were tracked using VHF telemetry between 1994 and 2006 in the Mamirauá and Amanã Sustainable Development Reserves, constituting the only long-term dataset on Amazonian manatee movements in the wild. Their habitat was characterized by analysing aquatic space and macrophyte coverage dynamics associated with the annual flood-pulse cycle of the River Solimões. Habitat information came from fieldwork, two hydrographs, a three-dimensional model of the water bodies and classifications of Landsat-TM/ETM+ images. We show that during high-water season (mid-May to end-June), males stay in várzea lakes in association with macrophytes, which they select. We then show that, during low-water (October–November), the drastic reduction in aquatic space in the várzea leads {{to the risk of}} their habitat drying out and increases the manatees' vulnerability to predators such as caimans, jaguars and humans. This explains why males migrate to Ria Amanã. Based on data on illegal hunting, we argue that this habitat variability influences females to migrate too. We then use published knowledge of the environment's dynamics to argue that when water levels are high, the habitats that can support the largest manatee populations are the várzeas of white-water rivers, and we conjecture that rias are the species' main low-water refuges throughout Western Amazonia. Finally, we warn that the species may be at greater risk than previously thought, because migration and <b>low-water</b> <b>levels</b> make manatees particularly vulnerable to hunters. Moreover, because the flooding regime of Amazonian rivers is strongly related to large-scale climatic phenomena, there might be a perilous connection between climate change and the future prospects for the species. Our experience reveals that the success of research and conservation of wild Amazonian manatees depends on close working relationships with local inhabitant...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn southwestern France, {{groundwater}} {{resources are}} withdrawn for various uses (drinkable water, irrigation, industry, geothermal energy, forestry, conservation of wetlands, shellfish breeding among others) which can sometimes cause conflicts between users. To help {{the management of}} these resources, regional hydrodynamic models have been developed. These models have been a support to the public policies for over 20 years. In the northern region, groundwater is in close relation with rivers, especially during periods of <b>low-water</b> <b>levels.</b> Indeed, groundwater used for irrigation impact not only the stream flows, but also the water supply for the second large wetland of France: the Marais Poitevin. The developed models have permitted to test the impact of several scenarios of water withdrawals. These tests help to determinate {{the amount of water}} that can be pumped to respect defined objectives as water levels in piezometer and river flows. These models were also used to test the impact of the eventual implementation of water tanks (400, 000 to 800, 000 m 3). Further south, the major problem is the important reduction of the level of the Eocene aquifer in the department of Gironde. In this area, the regional hydrodynamic model has been developed since 1990. Its development allows the management of deep groundwater resources and contributes to validate strategies of exploitation based on different simulations. This model also allows to answer problems of overexploitation and to analyse areas where water savings could be done to avoid this overexploitation, and to estimate the impact of new resources. The extreme southern region has a significant particularity: on two different sites, groundwater is used for the storage of gas. The cyclic injection and withdrawal of gas impacts significantly the aquifer level. The proposed model is adapted for the groundwater resources knowledge and management of this case. Finally, these models were used to evaluate impacts of climate change on groundwater resources in order to allow authorities to evaluate strategies to adapt to this change (Project Explore 2070 for example) ...|$|R
