Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their bulk and lack of body {{language}} makes a reaction impossible to be definitive. However, studies on the brains of humpback whales revealed spindle cells, which, in humans, control theory of <b>mind.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, {{it is thought that}} baleen whales, or at least humpback whales, have consciousness.|$|E
5|$|While the {{previous}} two films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe, Goldfinger was chosen by Eon for the third film, with the American cinema market in <b>mind.</b> <b>Because</b> Terence Young was refused {{a share of the}} profits, he declined to direct Goldfinger and worked on The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders instead, although he had done some pre-production work before he left. In his place, Eon turned to Guy Hamilton to direct; he was keen to inject elements of humour into the series, have more gadgets and build bigger and more elegant sets.|$|E

25|$|This {{picture of}} Spinoza's {{determinism}} is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in Ethics: ″the infant {{believes that it}} is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the <b>mind</b> <b>because</b> we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience {{that we have a}} false ideal of choice predicated upon this.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Ira Steven Behr {{had long}} sought {{to introduce a}} Rat Pack-style character to [...] since the , as he was a lifelong fan of 1960s-era Las Vegas and the music of that period.

In preparation, Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe wrote a scene in order to flesh out the character, while Behr immediately had a performer in mind to play the new character: Frank Sinatra, Jr., a known fan of Star Trek.

500|$|In {{the bottom}} of the ninth, rookie pitcher Adam Wainwright – filling in as {{emergency}} closer – found himself in a two-out, bases-loaded situation against center fielder Carlos Beltrán, who had already homered three times in the NLCS. [...] Molina called for a mound conference. [...] Initially, he wanted a sinker from Wainwright but changed his <b>mind</b> <b>because</b> he suspected Wainwright would overthrow it and give Beltrán an easy pitch to hit. [...] Molina made an unconventional choice by calling for a changeup to start the sequence against Beltrán. [...] It was called for a strike. [...] Had Beltrán successfully got a base hit, the scheme may have caused tension for the third-year catcher with La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan because throwing a first-pitch changeup ran contrary to Duncan's teaching. [...] Molina then called for two curveballs. [...] Beltrán fouled off the first, but Wainwright struck him out looking at a [...] "bender that started up and away and bit hard to the low inside corner" [...] for the final out of the game.

500|$|The first {{principal}} {{actor to}} be cast was Daniel Dae Kim {{for the role}} of Chin Ho Kelly. Before he was cast, Dae Kim was working on the final season of Lost, in which he portrayed regular character Jin-Soo Kwon.

Dae Kim spent some time with HPD officers, as well as viewing some episodes of the original series as [...] "homework" [...] for the character. Alex O'Loughlin was next to be cast as the main protagonist Steve McGarrett. Despite playing two series on CBS, Moonlight and Three Rivers, that were cancelled in their first year, CBS was still interested in having O'Loughlin headline another series. However, the producers initially had reservations casting the actor, until they realized his dedication towards the role. Grace Park was later cast as Kono Kalakaua. It is the second time she starred in a re-imagined television series in which her role was previously portrayed by a male in its original incarnation, the first being Battlestar Galactica in which she portrayed Sharon [...] "Boomer" [...] Valerii, a part that was played by Herbert Jefferson, Jr. in the original series.
