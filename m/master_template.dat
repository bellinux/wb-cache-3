50|$|Wood had an {{interest}} in scoring tests automatically, instead of using many clerks or teacher's time to tabulate the test results by hand. One argument was that in the old way of doing exams was for the teacher or professor to ask a question and the student to complete a lengthy written answer. This limited the amount of questions in a timed examination and therefore was {{a small portion of the}} course given. The instructor then had to read over and grade the student's paper, a very time consuming labor-intensive process. An experiment was done in 1919 where a standardization method of testing was tried. Instead of handwritten essay answers by the student, a new method of testing was devised at Columbia University which consisted of printed up pamphlets. The first part had a set of true or false statements and a mark next to it indicated by the student, which answer they chose. The second part was a multiple choice and the student could choose from a possible 3 or 4 answers. Since the answers to either part were exact, then all the clerk had to do was score the test compared to a correct <b>master</b> <b>template.</b> This required no skill on the part of the clerk on the knowledge of the subject.

30|$|Nonetheless, {{there are}} a few {{drawbacks}} involved with using silicon stamps: due to the high elastic modulus of silicon, such stamps can in general not easily adapt to inhomogeneous surfaces or particles on the substrate. As a result, the reliability of the transfer process is limited. Additionally, remaining metal on the stamp can significantly impede the establishment of conformal contact in subsequent transfer attempts and thus prevent a successful transfer of the metal film. As a result, nTP stamps in general can be mostly used only once. Consequently, a better approach is to use the silicon stamp as a <b>master</b> <b>template</b> for replication of a daughter, or working stamp based on a cheaper and preferably more flexible material. Those working stamps would still be one-time-use-only, yet the replication process can be very fast and results in a fresh and clean stamp for each metal transfer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} continuum {{simulations of}} polymer flow during nanoimprint lithography (NIL). The simulations capture the underlying physics of polymer {{flow from the}} nanometer to millimeter length scale and examine geometry and thermophysical process quantities affecting cavity filling. Variations in embossing tool geometry and polymer film thickness during viscous flow distinguish different flow driving mechanisms. Three parameters can predict polymer deformation mode: cavity width to polymer thickness ratio, polymer supply ratio, and Capillary number. The ratio of cavity width to initial polymer film thickness determines vertically or laterally dominant deformation. The ratio of indenter width to residual film thickness measures polymer supply beneath the indenter which determines Stokes or squeeze flow. The local geometry ratios can predict a fill time based on laminar flow between plates, Stokes flow, or squeeze flow. Characteristic NIL capillary number based on geometry-dependent fill time distinguishes between capillary or viscous driven flows. The three parameters predict filling modes observed in published studies of NIL deformation over nanometer to millimeter length scales.
