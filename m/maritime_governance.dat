Through the emergence of deregulation and procedural simplification, the reasons behind overregulation need to be revisited. The future of <b>maritime</b> <b>governance</b> is expected to hollow out several functions for alternative institutions and keep the governance simple for performing other roles such as advisory services, mainstreaming, amongst others. Therefore, the concept of <b>maritime</b> <b>governance</b> without a government can be thought as a driving force for the future.

40|$|Driven by {{the global}} nature of shipping, <b>maritime</b> <b>governance</b> is {{characterized}} by a long history of intergovernmental decision making with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as central locus of authority. Since the 1980 s, <b>maritime</b> <b>governance</b> for the European Union (EU) and its member states is subject to processes of regionalization, especially in the environmental domain. Dissatisfaction with the ambition level of the IMO as well as lack of effective implementation and enforcement of IMO standards has driven the emergence of four regionally-based initiatives: the use of special areas in IMO Conventions, the adoption of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Port State Control, the development of the European Union shipping policy domain and the emergence of market based initiatives by ports and cargo-owners. This article analyses how each of these regional initiatives are based on cooperation between a regional group of actors and how each initiative has become integrated in <b>maritime</b> <b>governance.</b> The article concludes that although IMO remains a central locus of authority, the emergence of the Paris MoU on PSC and EU legislation for shipping has resulted in a move from a centralized, intergovernmental <b>maritime</b> <b>governance</b> system between the 1950 s and 1980 s to a more polycentric governance system for EU member states today...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPiracy in the Gulf of Guinea regularly exceeded {{that of the}} Gulf of Aden between 2000 and 2007. But the major maritime powers established counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden without replicating {{the same in the}} Gulf of Guinea. Since 2004, theUnited States has closely monitored counter-piracy operations in the Malacca Strait after a failed earlier attempt to materially provide such services. Why are theUnited States and other maritime powers interested in the Gulf of Aden and Malacca Strait? If the Gulf of Guinea states would allow these powers to establish a counter-piracy task force, does the region have the strategic heft to attract these powers? The search for answers to these questions informs this study. The study, which is essentially comparative, synthesizes and analyzes existing quantitative and qualitative data. It reveals that the strategic importance of the Gulf of Guinea is minor compared to the Malacca Strait and the Gulf of Aden.

40|$|Abstract Analysts {{frequently}} {{label the}} BRICS grouping of states (Brazil, India, Russia, China, and South Africa) as primarily an economic club emphasising economic performances as primary objectives. Co-operation of international groupings are rarely, if ever, set {{within the context}} of their access to maritime interests, security, and benefits. A second void stems from the lack of emphasis upon the economic benefits of secured maritime domains. In this vein, a common, but neglected aspect of the BRICS grouping’s power and future influence resides in their maritime domains, the value of which ultimately depends upon the responsible governance and use of ocean territories. The maritime interests of BRICS countries only become meaningful if reinforced by <b>maritime</b> security <b>governance</b> and co-operation in the respective oceans. Presently China and India seem to dominate the maritime stage of BRICS, but the South Atlantic is an often overlooked space. For BRICS the value of the South Atlantic stems from how it secures and unlocks the potential of this maritime space through co-operative ventures between Brazil, South Africa as a late BRICS partner, and West African littoral states in particular. Unfortunately, BRICS holds its own maritime tensions, as member countries also pursue competing interests at sea...|$|R

40|$|Owing {{to their}} style and {{economic}} impact, Brazil, Russia, India and China (the BRIC countries) {{are destined to}} become relevant actors in the new ocean governance. The following working hypothesis is sustained: the BRIC countries, due to the potential of their maritime territories, can {{be considered to be}} emerging maritime powers capable of displacing some of the historical maritime powers. This would also entail a shift of strategic maritime space towards the southern hemisphere. Other emerging maritime scenarios associated with the BRIC countries include the Russian Arctic, and the Indo-Pacific ocean belt, or "string of pearls", as it is known. Factors such as competitiveness, maritime leadership and ocean governance are thus placed in a new economic and political context where they might be redefined and adapted to the circumstances of the BRIC block and other emerging countries, the majority of which are subject to demographic pressure and a high degree of poverty.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, European Union rhetoric has communicated a desire {{to take on a}} {{normative}} power role in advancing human rights and sustainable development approaches in the context of global fisheries policy.

40|$|Because {{any trace}} on water {{seems to be}} {{immediately}} dissolved by currents, the seas have long been associated with a permanent present that resists any writing of history. The infinite liquid expanse has equally represented a challenge for governance: the impossibility of drawing stable boundaries in ever changing waters has led to consider the seas as a space of absolute freedom and flow – the “free seas”. In this article, we demonstrate that on the contrary, the seas are increasingly documented and divided, and inextricably so. A complex sensing apparatus is fundamental {{to a form of}} governance that combines the division of maritime spaces and the control of movement, and that instrumentalises the partial, overlapping, and “elastic” nature of maritime jurisdictions and international law. It is in these conditions that the EU imposed migration regime operates, selectively expanding sovereign rights through patrols in the high seas but also retracting from responsibility, as in the many instances of non-assistance to migrants at sea. Through the policies and the conditions of <b>maritime</b> <b>governance</b> organized by the EU the sea is turned into a deadly liquid – the direct cause of over 13. 000 documented deaths over the last fifteen years. However, by using the Mediterranean’s remote sensing apparatus against the grain and spatialising violations of migrants’ rights at sea, it is possible to re-inscribe responsibility into a sea of impunity...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as a geopolitical focal area is increasingly being recognized. The strategic interests of multiple actors involved in the IOR overlap and converge at sea to a significant extent. The major maritime trade routes of the Indian Ocean are central to extra and intraregional trade that {{is vital to the}} global economy. The primary coalescing factor for the IOR is the interconnected, systemic nature of the regional and global maritime context. Requirements to husband the Indian Ocean environment, protect freedom of navigation, maintain maritime territorial sovereignty, and impose law and order at sea across the entire maritime expanse should support a strong case for regionalism. Comprehensive, collective and cooperative maritime security is a paramount requirement {{for the future of the}} IOR. A foundational tenet of this work recognizes that the interests of IOR actors, mainly regional and external nation-states along with other international and non-government participants come together to a significant extent at sea. Common risks and shared vulnerabilities to the achievement of mutual objectives in the Indian Ocean maritime domain are substantial and will continue to mount. In the complex and dynamic IOR context with its diverse geography and lack of effective regionalism, known for divisions and dissonance rather than unity and coherence, formulating realistic, workable approaches to providing effective maritime security presents significant challenges. This thesis critically analyzes IOR maritime security risks and vulnerabilities and assesses the utility of risk-based approaches, in concert with other approaches, in developing policy proposals to enhance maritime security. Regional <b>maritime</b> security <b>governance</b> options are explored. The intent of this thesis is to make a significant contribution toward filling a gap in IOR maritime security international policy research, and to advocate policy solutions. One such policy area involves investigating the nexus between maritime security, economic development and the forecast environmental implications of climate change on vast and vulnerable coastal populations, and on marine resources. Climate change impacts, particularly in the coastal zone and for low lying islands, present existential risks that are likely to require responses beyond the capabilities of individual or collective IOR states; this has the potential to generate enormous security challenges in the medium term. There are clear requirements for security-focused cooperative dialogue entities in the IOR driven by the scale of emerging maritime security challenges. A core, initial objective for enhancing maritime security in the IOR, advocated by this research as a constructive way forward, should be to commission a sophisticated and appropriately resourced risk analysis. Credible risk assessments can provide the bases for developing cooperative and collective regional strategies to treat risks and reduce vulnerabilities. A major outcome of the research is the presentation of insights into the utility of risk-based approaches in developing policy options that can help persuade key decision-makers to take collective and cooperative security actions in a complex international context.

40|$|The {{report is}} the result of {{fruitful}} collaboration between EASAC and the JRC. It has been prepared by a working group of experts drawn from the European National Science Academies, which was supported by the JRC. It is hoped that the report will prove useful in the further development and implementation of European Union marine and maritime policy as well as the organisation of supporting science needed to inform and guide these policies. The last ten years have seen a growth in marine and maritime policymaking within the European Union with a key feature being the concept of the ecosystem approach to guide sustainable use of the seas. In view of this increasing focus on coherent marine and <b>maritime</b> policy and <b>governance</b> within the EU, as well as globally, the EASAC Council decided in December 2013 to conduct a study on the issue of marine sustainability. This decision particularly acknowledged the need to provide advice {{from the point of view}} of the European science academies on this new direction of marine policy and to highlight the particular challenges that this poses to the organisation of science. The report has the aim of contributing to the governance challenge of how to integrate the various aspects of marine policy (fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and marine environmental protection) as part of a coherent ecosystem approach. It considers how current science knowledge on marine ecosystems and the organisation of science can support an integrated approach to management of the seas. The report looks at a number of key aspects for sustainable development in changing oceans and seas, and particularly highlights the key scientific challenges in addressing these issues. The report presents both recommendations from science for policy development, and recommendations on policy for science. The health of the oceans and coastal seas is vital for the future well-being of all of Europe, indeed of entire mankind, and sustainable management of this sensitive and fast changing component of the global ecosystem is essential.

40|$|Competing spatial {{claims and}} {{conflicts}} between maritime economic activities and biodiversity in Europe's seas continue to challenge governments and non-governmental actors. Responses {{to these problems}} {{have resulted in a}} fragmented patchwork of EU policies, private initiatives, and regulations on different levels.

40|$|The highly globalized and {{competitive}} {{nature of the}} shipping industry poses serious governance challenges. Recently, the use of voluntary measures, such as corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, has been explored in terms of moving towards environmentally and socially responsible as well as safe shipping industry practices. Limited {{attention has been paid}} on the role of stakeholders such as consumers, employees, NGOs, and academia in pressuring the shipping industry towards greater environmental and social responsibility. Here, by applying stakeholder theory and drawing on examples of already materialized stakeholder actions and multistakeholder initiatives, we study the potential ways that stakeholders can promote CSR in the shipping industry: we explore the resource dependencies between stakeholders, the stakeholder influence strategies, and the importance of multi-stakeholder pressure. We show that stakeholders can gain more power by using indirect strategies such as working via and/or in alliances with NGOs, trade unions, banks and financers, and/or different national or international regulatory bodies, {{as well as with the}} industry itself. Our results reveal the potential of multi-stakeholder pressure and action to promote the adoption of CSR activities, support the transparency, legitimacy, and enforcement of the practices, as well as widen the scope and focus of CSR initiatives and practices by focusing on a broad range of social and environmental issues. Finally, stakeholder pressure can push towards improved regulations.

40|$|Item Embargoed. Embargo ends 12 / 31 / 2018. Ba, Alice D. This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} evolution of Chinese policy towards the South China Sea dispute {{over the past six}} decades. The South China Sea dispute {{is one of the most}} dangerous and intractable territorial rows in Asia, involving China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei. This dispute also entangles countries outside the region, such as the United States, Japan, India, and Australia, whose maritime interests are heavily invested in the Sea Lanes of Communication in the South China Sea. As the biggest claimant to the South China Sea, China's handling of the South China Sea dispute has significant bearing on the regional security of Asia. The evolving path of China's policy towards the South China Sea has been shaped by two sets of factors. The first is the legal, normative, and institutional dynamics of the maritime regime at both international and regional levels. The second concerns shifts in the geostrategic environment in the South China Sea region. These factors have operated in two general ways. First, developments in the international maritime regime have exerted an incremental and sustained influence in shaping China's conceptualization of the South China Sea dispute and promoted domestic institutionalization of modern <b>maritime</b> <b>governance.</b> Second, the normative and institutional dynamics of the maritime regime interact with concurrent geopolitical flux, offering a blend of incentives and pressure that shapes the calculus of the Chinese leadership. By and large, China's handling of the South China Sea issue is characterized by a pattern of legalization and self-adjustment that fits into the regional institutional engagement architecture and modern international maritime order.

40|$|This Atlas was {{initiated}} {{as part of}} Ireland's preparation for the Water Framework Directive (WFD) which, inter alia, required mapping the distribution of mobile fishing gears in coastal waters (inside 1 n mile outside the base lines). The Atlas subsequently expanded the geographical extent of the review out to 12 n miles. The history, descriptive terminology and extent of subdivisions of the territorial sea are provided. The Atlas {{is a collection of}} 1, 885 polygons showing the distribution of fishing and fishery related activities, including aquaculture and mariculture within the Republic of Ireland's territorial sea and internal marine waters. The Atlas demonstrates that the greatest range and intensity of fishing and related activities are undertaken in the internal waters of the State. Hook and line fishing emerged as the most widely used metier and a combined array of mobile gears, ranging from pelagic otter trawls to hydraulic dredges, took second place. The total area occupied by fishing and fishing related activities was just under 125, 000 km 2. The principal metier groupings within 12 n miles were: hook and line occupying 57, 000 km 2 (45 % of the total), mobile gears (towed enclosing nets and dredges) accounting for 27, 530 km 2 (22 %). Passive nets (static tangle and gill nets and the now defunct salmon drift nets) made up 18, 000 km 2 (14 %). Pots targeting crustaceans and molluscs occupied 13, 250 km 2 (11 %). Aquaculture and mariculture occupied 172 km 2, some 0. 4 % of the area within 12 n miles. To supplement the polygons, a table of metier and species combinations in internal and territorial waters opposite each county with a long shoreline is supplied. The table includes fisheries whose existence is known but not their extent. The consequences for benthic community structure of the use of a particular metier, the purpose of the exercise for the WFD, are considered. "Community" refers to fish or invertebrate species assemblages. Applications for the data are discussed {{in the context of a}} growing appreciation of the need to plan the use of inshore waters for fishery conservation and to accommodate a wide range of stakeholder interests and to embrace the ecosystem approach to <b>maritime</b> <b>governance.</b> Difficulties inherent in conserving fish species rather than biological communities are illustrated by reference to a case history. Data presented in the document were sourced from the tacit knowledge of stakeholders. Planning jurisdiction in the Republic of Ireland is described with reference to inshore waters. Recent thinking by fishery commentators is reviewed. Finally, current thinking on inshore spatial planning within the EU and particularly among our nearest neighbours is discussed and the possibility of implementing ICZM is briefly considered.
