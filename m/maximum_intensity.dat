5|$|Typhoon June, {{also known}} in the Philippines as Typhoon Maring, {{was the first of}} two {{tropical}} cyclones to affect the Philippines in a one-week time span in August1984. June originated from an area of convection that was first witnessed on August15 in the Philippine Sea. Despite initial wind shear, the area intensified into a tropical storm three days later as it tracked westward. After tracking over Luzon, June entered the South China Sea on August30. Despite remaining poorly organized, June re-intensified over land, and it was estimated to have briefly attained typhoon intensity before striking China, just to the east of Hong Kong, at <b>maximum</b> <b>intensity,</b> although its remnants were last noticed on September3.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Kelly, {{known as}} Typhoon Oniang in the Philippines, struck Japan {{during the middle}} of October1987.

The disturbance became a tropical depression on October9, and a tropical storm the next day. While moving generally north-northwest towards Japan, Kelly attained typhoon intensity on October12. Continuing to intensify, Typhoon Kelly reached its <b>maximum</b> <b>intensity</b> on October15, but a weakening trend began thereafter. The next day, the typhoon passed over the islands of Shikoku and Honshu. By October17, Kelly completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fox was {{the strongest}} and deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone of the below average 1952 Atlantic hurricane season. The seventh tropical storm, sixth Atlantic hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the season, Fox was a small and intense Caribbean storm that developed northwest of Cartagena, Colombia, in the southern Caribbean Sea. It moved steadily northwest, intensifying to a tropical storm on October 21. The next day, it rapidly strengthened into a hurricane and turned north. The cyclone attained peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) as it struck Cayo Guano del Este {{off the coast of}} Cienfuegos. Fox made landfall on Cuba at <b>maximum</b> <b>intensity,</b> producing peak gusts of 170–180mph (275–290km/h). It weakened over land, but it re-strengthened as it turned east over the Bahamas.

5|$|Once in the Gulf of Mexico on August 28, the {{hurricane}} moved northwest on a nearly linear path towards the Texas coast as it steadily intensified. By 0600 UTC on August 29, the storm reached Category 3 intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h)–this {{would be the}} storm's <b>maximum</b> <b>intensity.</b> However, {{the hurricane}} weakened back down to Category 1 strength before making landfall just after midnight on August 30 near Matagorda and Palacios, Texas. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), with hurricane-force winds extending out 150mi (240km) from the storm's center of circulation. The hurricane's minimum central pressure at landfall was estimated at 950mbar (hPa; 28.06inHg), though a pressure reading of 952mbar (hPa; 28.16inHg) in Seadrift, Texas marked the lowest recorded pressure. Once inland, the storm quickly weakened, and degenerated to tropical storm strength at 1200UTC on August30 while located near Hallettsville, Texas. Weakening to a tropical depression the following day, it dissipated at 1200UTC on August30 near Sweetwater, Texas.|$|E
5|$|The storm quickly strengthened, being {{upgraded}} twice by the JMA on September 11, at 0600 UTC to {{a severe}} tropical storm and at 1800 UTC to a typhoon, becoming the seventh official typhoon of the season. It then {{took on a}} more north-northwesterly track, weakening while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle on September 14. However, it restrengthened, reaching its <b>maximum</b> <b>intensity</b> of 110 knots (205km/h, 125mph) from the JMA and 120knots (220km/h, 140mph) from the JTWC before passing Iriomote on September 15. Originally expected by the JTWC to pass {{to the east of}} Okinawa Island, a subtropical high-pressure ridge south of the main Japanese islands forced the storm to take a more westward track, pushing it towards Taiwan. Shortly later, Shanshan passed directly over Iriomote.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Clara, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Rubing, left {{flooding}} in the northern Philippines and southern China during September1981. An area of disturbed weather was first detected on September11 near Ponape. After moving westward, the system gradually became better organized and thunderstorm activity increased. On September16, the system attained tropical storm status. Two days later, Clara attained typhoon intensity and subsequently began to deepen at a faster rate. On September19, Clara reached <b>maximum</b> <b>intensity,</b> before making landfall along {{the northern tip of}} Luzon. Clara steadily weakened after interacting with land, but by late on September20, Clara leveled off in intensity over the South China Sea.

5|$|Typhoon Ruby, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Unsang, was the strongest typhoon to strike the Philippines in 18years. The tenth typhoon of the 1988 Pacific typhoon season, Ruby formed from an area of low {{pressure}} situated east of the Philippines on October20. The storm steadily intensified as it moved west, and then west-northwest. After developing an eye, Ruby attained typhoon intensity on October23 and began to strengthen at a brisker clip. Ruby reached <b>maximum</b> <b>intensity</b> later that day, before moving ashore along the central portion of Luzon early on October24. The storm steadily weakened over land and this trend only continued after Ruby entered the South China Sea. On October27, Ruby made a second landfall as a tropical storm on Hainan Island before dissipating the next day.|$|E

5|$|A {{subtropical}} ridge {{to the north}} of the cyclone resulted in it continuing generally westward. Deep convection continued to develop over the center of circulation, and the storm steadily strengthened as outflow improved throughout the circulation. By late on December 25, a rainband wrapped tightly into the center, and it intensified into a severe cyclonic storm as it approached the coast of Sri Lanka. The next day the cyclone developed an eye as it turned west-southwestward. On December 26, the cyclone made landfall on near Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. The JTWC assessed the cyclone as attaining peak winds of 75mph (120km/h). However, the IMD estimated the cyclone reached a <b>maximum</b> <b>intensity</b> of 105mph (165km/h), making it a very severe cyclonic storm. It weakened slightly over land and emerged into the Gulf of Mannar early on December 27 as a tropical storm. Initially, forecasters predicted it to slowly re-intensify; instead it weakened as its convection degraded in organization and intensity. After turning west-northwestward, the storm struck southern India near Kanyakumari on December 28 with winds of 45mph (70km/h), with minimal convection due to land interaction and increased wind shear. It rapidly weakened to tropical depression status over land, and its remnants degenerated into a low pressure area after emerging into the eastern Arabian Sea early on December 29.|$|E

At 18:00UTC, Kelly was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JMA. Six hours later, the JTWC reported that Kelly attained typhoon intensity. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began to monitor the storm, with the agency assigning it the local name Oniang. At 12:00UTC on October12, the JMA followed suit and classified the storm as a typhoon. Twelve hours later, the JMA raised the intensity to , its peak intensity.
