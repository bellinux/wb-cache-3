Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, {{and said}} he began the script to try to {{understand}} [...] "how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> much better, and so much less alone." ...|$|E

I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.' It made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|MacFarlane {{has also}} {{appeared}} on news shows and late night television {{shows such as}} Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Late Show with David Letterman. On January 19, 2007, MacFarlane appeared on Countdown with Keith Olbermann on MSNBC to discuss Stephen Colbert's appearance on The O'Reilly Factor and Bill O'Reilly's return appearance on The Colbert Report. MacFarlane introduced the segment by saying in Stewie's voice [...] "Oh, wait Bill. Hold still, allow me to soil myself on you. Victory is mine!" [...] Three months later on March 24, 2007, MacFarlane was interviewed on Fox's Talkshow with Spike Feresten, and closed the show by singing the Frank Sinatra song [...] "You Make <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>So</b> Young". He also provided Stewie's voice when he appeared as a brain tumor-induced hallucination to Seeley Booth in an episode of Bones, writing his own dialogue for the episode. On May 8, 2009, MacFarlane was a guest on Real Time with Bill Maher.|$|E

500|$|Ferrier {{spent two}} months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought {{to her at the}} {{hospital}} by a friend. Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she would {{no longer be able to}} negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate. Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this [...] "unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything to make <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> much better". This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. [...] As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival. Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service. She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was [...] "not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day".|$|E

Captain & Tennille's co-stars on the show included Phyllis Diller, James Belushi, Dan Castellaneta, and Bob Saget.|$|E

I damn-near cried, it made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> terrible." [...] A sequence where a school teacher's collection of 78rpm jazz records is smashed by a group of rebellious students is a key moment in the film Blackboard Jungle.|$|E
2500|$|The songs [...] "Becoming" [...] and [...] "Rock & Hammer" [...] were {{originally}} on Takashi Taniguchi's 1998 album Becoming.

30|$|Am I the Israeli or the American in the Mifgash?

5000|$|The song {{starts with}} stabbing, near-industrial beats.

I was wondering: were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women? Or were you really dead? And now that you're on the run, what goes on in your mind? Your sisters they sit by the window. You know, your mama does sit and cry. And your daddy—well, you know what your daddy said Patty. You know what your daddy said, Patty?

2500|$|The opening track, [...] "Bright Side of the Road" [...] was a {{successful}} single in the UK, charting at #63. The healing power of music would be subtly introduced on [...] "And the Healing Has Begun" [...] and would be a continuing theme in Morrison's music. [...] Although a celebration of love and life was the predominant theme of the album: [...] "Troubadours", [...] "Steppin' Out Queen" [...] and [...] "You Make <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>So</b> Free" [...] were especially so. [...] "Troubadours" [...] is an uplifting celebration of the singer-songwriter from ancient days walking through towns [...] "singin songs of [...] love and chivalry". [...] "Rolling Hills" [...] is a joyful song in which the singer [...] directly refers to Christianity and of living his life [...] "in Him" [...] and reading The Bible. The album is notable for its interpolation of an elegiac version of the fifties pop hit [...] "It's All in the Game", that was voted #813 on Dave Marsh's list of 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made. It was a B-side to the Morrison song [...] "Cleaning Windows".|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings with [...] "a sassy attitude", {{setting a}} [...] "futuristic tone", {{as stated by}} Jocelyn Vena. According to Dombal, [...] "Countdown" [...] finds Knowles as the female protagonist {{delivering}} her [...] "message of ten years of loyalty" [...] to her love interest. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, who described [...] "Countdown" [...] as a [...] "monogamous romance", added {{that it is a}} love song that is [...] "no less sexy for being unblinkingly true to life", and Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "all about the rapture of true love". Kicking off with a reggae-ish beat, horns and drums, Knowles starts to chant the introductory lines, which also serves as the pre-chorus lines, [...] "Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling / Still the one I need, I will always be with you / Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go / Say it real loud if you fly / If you leave me you're out of your mind", followed by the chorus lines, which is a literal count backwards where Knowles counts down the ways in which she loves her man, [...] "My baby is a ten / We dressing to the nine / He pick me up at eight / Make <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> lucky seven / He kiss me in his six / We be making love in five / Still the one I do this four / I’m trying to make a three / From that two / He still the one." ...|$|E

He explained: [...] "I been working with a people on some ideas," [...] he explained. [...] "I don’t wanna say who yet, because everything isn’t confirmed yet. It should be pretty solid in the next few days. The biggest thing about that song is that a lot of women come up to me and say, ‘That's my song, because it really makes <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> special.’ <b>So</b> I told the directors that were interested that I just want the visuals to coincide with that feeling. I want women to feel special when they watch the visual and say, ‘I wish that was me,’ or ‘I know that feeling [...]’ That's the goal with the video — to be genuine and not sappy. Be sexy and keep it together, but still make women smile." ...|$|R
