50|$|<b>Marriage</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} {{a very important}} part in ancient Egyptian society. <b>Marriage</b> <b>was</b> an almost completely private affair, and as a result, not many records of <b>marriage</b> <b>were</b> kept.

40|$|Before we can {{properly}} {{answer the}} question “What is marriage?,” we must first be able to {{answer the question}} “What <b>is</b> <b>marriage</b> for?” Defining what <b>marriage</b> <b>is,</b> before fully understanding what <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> for, presumes we already know what <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> for, when in fact we do not. In a moral sense, <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> for love. And in a legal sense, <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> for everyone (regardless of sexuality or race). In this paper I discuss how, regardless of whether you view marriage in a purely moral or in a purely legal light, <b>marriage</b> equality should <b>be</b> afforded to all citizens...|$|R

5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal <b>marriages</b> <b>are</b> one of {{the great}} wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater wrong is women's lack of independence. Because they are unable to find respectable, well-paid work, they are reliant upon men. Women such as Jemima are reduced to hard {{physical}} labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting themselves in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of themselves because of it.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 8000 Normans {{and other}} continentals settled in England {{as a result}} of the conquest, although exact figures cannot be established. Some of these new residents intermarried with the native English, but the extent of this practice in the years immediately after Hastings is unclear. Several <b>marriages</b> <b>are</b> attested between Norman men and English women during the years before 1100, but such marriages were uncommon. Most Normans continued to contract marriages with other Normans or other continental families rather than with the English. Within a century of the invasion, intermarriage between the native English and the Norman immigrants had become common. By the early 1160s, Ailred of Rievaulx was writing that intermarriage was common in all levels of society.|$|E
