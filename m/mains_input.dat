40|$|A voltage {{regulating}} circuit comprising {{a rectifier}} (2) for receiving an AC voltage (Vmains) and for generating a rectified AC voltage (vrec), and a capacitor (3) {{connected in parallel}} with said rectified AC voltage for providing a DC voltage (VDC) over a load (5), characterized by a unidirectional current switch (4) provided between the rectifier (2) and the capacitor (3), and a control block (6) arranged to activate the switch (4) at selected instances (7) during negative slopes of the rectified AC voltage (vrec) so that said DC voltage (VDC) does not exceed a predetermined voltage limit. By controlling the voltage provided by the rectified mains, the DC voltage can be regulated to any preset value (lower than the AC mains peak value).

50|$|In a {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} (SMPS), the AC <b>mains</b> <b>input</b> is directly rectified and then filtered to obtain a DC voltage. The resulting DC voltage is then switched on and off at a high frequency by electronic switching circuitry, thus producing an AC current that will pass through a high-frequency transformer or inductor. Switching occurs {{at a very high}} frequency (typically 10 kHz — 1 MHz), thereby enabling the use of transformers and filter capacitors that are much smaller, lighter, and less expensive than those found in linear power supplies operating at mains frequency. After the inductor or transformer secondary, the high frequency AC is rectified and filtered to produce the DC output voltage. If the SMPS uses an adequately insulated high-frequency transformer, the output will be electrically isolated from the mains; this feature is often essential for safety.|$|E

50|$|Audio {{frequency}} chokes (AFC) {{usually have}} ferromagnetic cores {{to increase their}} inductance. They are often constructed similarly to transformers, with laminated iron cores and an air gap. A major use in the past was in power rectifiers and direct current motor controllers to produce direct current (DC), where they were {{used in conjunction with}} large electrolytic capacitors to remove the voltage ripple (AC) at the output DC. A rectifier circuit designed for a choke-output filter may produce too much DC output voltage and subject the rectifier and filter capacitors to excessive in-rush and ripple currents if the inductor is removed. However, modern electrolytic capacitors with high ripple current ratings, and voltage regulators that remove more power supply ripple than chokes could, have eliminated heavy, bulky chokes from mains frequency power supplies. Smaller chokes are used in switching power supplies to remove the higher-frequency switching transients from the output and sometimes from feeding back into the <b>mains</b> <b>input.</b> They often have toroidal ferrite cores.|$|E
40|$|The {{converter}} topologies {{identified as}} Diode Clamped Multilevel (DCM) or, equivalently as Multi Point Clamped (MPC), are rarely used in industrial applications, owing to some serious drawbacks involving mainly the stacked-bank of capacitors that constitutes their multilevel DC-link.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the test results}} on several largescale lighting systems based {{on a range of}} high-intensity-discharge (HID) lamps. The study focuses on the energy-saving, energy efficiency and dimming characteristics of magnetic-ballast-driven HID lamp systems that are suitable for public lighting networks. A central energy-saving unit that can change the <b>input</b> <b>mains</b> voltage of 220 V to a variable voltage within 220 V to 170 V is used to control a large lighting network. This central dimming unit offers a new freedom for users to use lighting energy when and where it is needed and to an appropriate power level. Lamp characteristics under full and reduced voltage operation for 6 types of highintensity-discharge (HID) lamps have been measured. Six largescaled networks of ballast-lamp sets have been set up and dimmed with a central energy-saving unit with a rated power of 13. 2 kVA per phase. The full load current under test was set at about 40 A per phase. The loss of the energy-saving unit on a per-lamp-set basis was measured at different voltage levels. It is found that the energy-saving unit can reduce overall system power at least 40 % without causing lamp flickering. Through the controllable voltage range, there is no obvious change in color temperature. The lamp power and light output decrease almost linearly with input voltage within the range from 170 V to 220 V, and the power loss of the energy-saving unit is less than 2. 4 % of the full power in all tests. For these large-scaled lighting networks, it is envisaged an 25 %- 35 % of energy-saving can be achieved in large public lighting applications. (c) 2006 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of the needs of}} future light-weight, low-power spacecraft, arcjet power electronics in the 100 to 400 W operating range were developed. Limited spacecraft power and thermal control capacity of these small spacecraft emphasized the need for high efficiency. Power topologies similar to those in the higher 2 kW and 5 to 30 kW power range were implemented, including a four transistor bridge switching circuit, current mode pulse-width modulated control, and an output current averaging inductor with an integral pulse generation winding. Reduction of switching transients was accomplished using a low inductance power distribution network, and no passive snubber circuits were necessary for power switch protection. Phase shift control of the power bridge was accomplished using an improved pulse width modulation to phase shift converter circuit. These features, along with conservative magnetics designs allowed power conversion efficiencies of greater than 92. 5 percent to be achieved into resistive loads over the entire operating range of the converter. Electromagnetic compatibility requirements were not considered in this work, and control power for the converter was derived from AC <b>mains.</b> Addition of <b>input</b> filters and control power converters would result in an efficiency of on the order of 90 percent for a flight unit. Due to the developmental nature of arcjet systems at this power level, the exact nature of the thruster/power processor interface was not quantified. Output regulation and current ripple requirements of 1 and 20 percent respectively, as well as starting techniques, were derived from the characteristics of the 2 kW system but an open circuit voltage in excess of 175 V was specified.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Induction heating and melting applications often require a power source to convert 3 -phase <b>mains</b> <b>input</b> power to single-phase output power at a higher and variable frequency. Amongst various power conversion schemes, solid-state power converters using the most modern devices provide the best power control techniques available for this application. In designing for this purpose, careful consideration {{must be given to}} the characteristics of the load, which presents a very low power factor and an impedance possibly varying widely as the heating cycle proceeds. From the variety of thyristor commutation techniques commonly employed in high-power inverters, series load commutation is particularly suited to high-frequency applications, as it has an intrinsically high turn-off time for the circuit thyristors (clearly essential at high operational frequencies) and much reduced switching losses. However, series commutation circuits are load sensitive, and therefore require careful design, especially with an induction heating load. Recent developments in power conversion techniques have led to the elimination of the d. c. link in a. c. to a. c. power conversion, enabling both high operational efficiencies and substantial savings in the initial cost of the device to be achieved. This new type of converter (called a cycloinverter) power and frequency control facilities. However, in a cycloinverter, since high-frequency switching is performed simultaneously with rectification, these control schemes are dependent on the operational frequency. The direct power conversion in a cycloinverter causes, unfortunately, distortion currents in the input lines and the output circuit, and it is the designer's task to minimise these undesirable components. The project aims to investigate the potential uses, both of the series inverter in its high-frequency form and of the cycloinverter, as power sources for induction heating. Design criteria are established for each circuit, with consideration given to turn-off time, efficiency, power factor, component ratings and predicted load variations. Computer simulations of the converters are employed to investigate the different voltage and current waveforms in the circuits, and to establish how the performance of each inverter may be optimised and these are verified by results obtained an experimental prototypes...|$|E
