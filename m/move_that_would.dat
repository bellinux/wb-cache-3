5|$|Prior to the 2016 season, Obafemi Martins {{abruptly}} {{left the}} club to sign with Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C. in the Chinese Super League, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> hamper the Sounders' offense during the season. The move was mitigated somewhat by the signing of homegrown product Jordan Morris. GM Lagerwey also traded Marco Pappa and Lamar Neagle to other clubs in the offseason.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Warner Bros. {{bought the}} rights to the Nancy Drew book series from the Stratemeyer Syndicate, for a {{reported}} $6,000. Warner Bros. wanted to make a series of B-films based on the character, to serve as a companion to their popular Torchy Blane B-film series, which starred Glenda Farrell, Barton MacLane, and Tom Kennedy. Adams sold {{the rights to}} Jack L. Warner without an agent or any consultation; thus, she sold all and any film rights to Warner Bros., a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> later come into question following the rise of television.|$|E
5|$|The bus tunnel was {{originally}} intended to be converted for use by light rail trains {{at some point in}} the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> later make them unusable for rail service.|$|E

5|$|The tournament was put {{in further}} {{jeopardy}} in January 1979 when General Motors withdrew as a major sponsor; Eagleson argued GM withdrew {{as a result of}} the dispute with the CAHA. The disputes put the two bodies on the verge of severing all ties, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have led to Hockey Canada refusing to release any professional or university player to any of Canada's national teams. The tournament was ultimately postponed by a year until September 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{summer of}} 2003 saw the club change {{ownership}}, as Elwood sold {{the club to}} Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy in a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> see Sale play their home games at Edgeley Park. A new company was created, called 'Cheshire Sport', which would have ownership of Stockport County, Sale Sharks and the Edgeley Park stadium. The 2003–04 season saw Palmer sacked after another poor start to the season, following home defeats to Hartlepool and Blackpool {{in the space of}} a week. John Hollins, who had been Director of Football during Palmer's reign, took over as caretaker manager, but was replaced full-time by former Northern Ireland manager Sammy McIlroy.|$|E
5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with the Cypress Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana and Pleasant Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon Road to a developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> effectively block construction of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted that the road had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build it at the time. Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way {{would be in the}} public interest when making their decision. Osceola County had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{would still}} be {{vulnerable}} to civil lawsuits from passengers' families. Compensation awarded (or settlements reached out-of-court) during civil trials will likely vary widely among passengers based on country of the court. An American court could likely award upwards of US$8–10million, while Chinese courts would likely award {{a small fraction of}} that. Despite the announcement that Flight 370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean, it was not until 29 January 2015 that the Malaysian government officially declared Flight 370 an accident with no survivors, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow compensation claims to be made. The first lawsuit related to the disappearance was filed in October 2014–before Flight 370 was declared an accident–on behalf of two Malaysian boys whose father was a passenger, for negligence in failing to contact the aircraft soon after it was lost and for breach of contract for failing to bring the passenger to his destination. Additional lawsuits against Malaysia Airlines have been filed in China and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|On , 1889, the Land Run saw the {{founding}} of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites; {{by the next morning}} a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence legislatures to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, it made sense to attempt to secure the state's first university instead (a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be far less controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman approximately 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 6, around 8:00 or 8:30a.m., Grant's {{flagship}} stopped alongside Wallace's boat moored at Crump's Landing and gave orders for the 3rd Division to be held ready to move in any direction. Wallace concentrated his troops at Stoney Lonesome, although his westernmost brigade remained at Adamsville. He then waited for further orders, which arrived between 11 and 11:30a.m. Grant ordered Wallace to move his unit up to join the Union right, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been in support of Sherman's 5th Division, which was encamped around Shiloh Church when the battle began. The written orders, transcribed from verbal orders that Grant gave to an aide, were lost during the battle and controversy remains over their wording. Wallace maintained {{that he was not}} ordered to Pittsburg Landing, which was to the left rear of the army, or told which road to use. Grant later claimed that he ordered Wallace to Pittsburg Landing by way of the River Road (also called the Hamburg–Savannah Road).|$|E

5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E
5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a <b>move</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E

25|$|The superko rule is {{designed}} to ensure the game eventually comes to an end, by preventing indefinite repetition of the same positions.
