2500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} written from the {{perspective}} of Vikings rowing west from Scandinavia in search of new lands. The lyrics, such as [...] "Fight the horde, sing and cry, 'Valhalla, I am coming!'" [...] make explicit reference to Viking conquests and the Old Norse religion. In a 1970 radio interview, Plant jokingly recalled, [...] "We went to Iceland, and it <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of Vikings and big ships ... and John Bonham's stomach ... and bang, there it was – Immigrant Song!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Luis Paez-Pumar of Rolling Stone {{described}} WrestleMania as [...] "two-faced as a Gemini"—the {{first half}} [...] "was a brisk hybrid of styles and matches that <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that WWE {{knew what it}} was doing all along with this lackluster build", but once Triple H appeared, the rest of the event [...] "was a slog of plodding wrestling, brief matches and boos". Paez-Pumar described that The Undertaker as [...] "should have retired when the Streak was broken", but [...] "lived on to pass the rub on to Reigns in the sloppiest, saddest manner possible". Paez-Pumar proclaimed that [...] "WWE has no idea how to handle Bray Wyatt", writing that Orton [...] "definitely did not need the title" [...] and ridiculing Wyatt's conjuring of [...] "projected video screen grossness" [...] as [...] "the dumbest crap". Paez-Pumar called for [...] "fresh blood or new ideas" [...] in both women's divisions and for Triple H to retire given that he [...] "has not put on a good Mania match" [...] since 2005 or 2006 once WrestleMania XXX was discounted. For the positives, Goldberg–Lesnar was a [...] "revitalizing adrenaline shot to the spine", Cena's proposal was [...] "magic in a way that no other entertainment can match", The New Day [...] "were excellent hosts; funny when called upon and out of the way when not", while [...] "a stale-ass tag team division just became the most must-see part of Raw" [...] due to the return of the Hardys.|$|E

6000|$|... 'My mind is <b>made</b> up. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I {{have not}} watched your patient care, {{and the manner}} in which it has been repaid? You have {{sufficient}} occupation without being the slave of those children's misconduct.' ...|$|R
6000|$|LORD GORING. [Gravely.] Yes; you {{certainly}} paid a great price for it. But what first <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of doing such a thing? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{there was}} {{something}} wrong with our internal machinery, whereby we might be wanting in a proper regard for victuals?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{wait till}} you clear your character; I'm not going {{to care for a}} {{deceitful}} impostor. What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of this prank?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{else could}} it have been <b>made,</b> Bob? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I went into the woods, and worked by myself, like some romantic damsel who had an unmeaning secret to keep against the curious eyes of persecuting friends!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Danny Mains!" [...] she said, tremulously and smilingly. [...] "If {{you are as}} glad as {{your news}} has <b>made</b> me--if <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> I merit such a reward--you may kiss me outright." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enjoy it? So <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I enjoy it! What do <b>you</b> suppose I'm <b>made</b> of? Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I enjoyed catechizing {{the child}} about her {{feelings}} toward him? Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I enjoy the whole confounded affair? Well, I give it up. I will let it go. If I can't have your full and hearty support, I'll let it go. I'll {{do nothing about}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{of searching}} the place again? Anything {{in the last}} {{instructions}} you got from Regina? You didn't show them to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what {{happened}} to those Ducks that were swimming about there and <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it was safe?" [...] asked Peter, with a puzzled look on his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of that, pop?" [...] {{said the}} boy, {{with a slight}} wonder in his eyes. [...] "Why, that's the very thing we DID talk about." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was all {{important}} that I should reach Marshal Grouchy, and yet I could not show my nose without being <b>made</b> prisoner. <b>You</b> can <b>think</b> how I cursed and tore my hair. How little {{do we know}} what is in store for us! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This morning?" [...] She {{felt herself}} trembling, and she {{scarcely}} recognized Peter with such words on his lips. [...] "I am happy--indeed I am. Only--I am overwrought--seeing <b>you</b> again--and <b>you</b> <b>made</b> me <b>think</b> of home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good mornin', missy," [...] cried Stevens, as she approached. [...] "You don't look extra bright this mornin', but you ain't {{as bad as}} {{your good}} {{guardian}} <b>made</b> me <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> don't seem to feel no difficulty in gettin' about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, on your oath, {{have you}} ever, in the prisoner's presence, heard such {{language}} used respecting Captain Ussher as <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{that he was}} to be killed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Matter? Nothin' as I knows of," [...] Bill Jepson {{said as if}} {{surprised}} that I should have asked such a question. [...] "What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> anything was wrong?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He laughed harshly. [...] "I {{should think}} they were dead from your manner, Mrs. Brinkley. But I didn't {{come to see the}} Van Hooks. What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I did?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] he said suddenly. [...] "I seen {{an opera}} once, where fellows wandered {{over the country}} with guitars slung on their backs just like you with that strummy-strum. <b>You</b> <b>made</b> me <b>think</b> of them. They was always singin' songs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, {{not that}} ship. That was open, or half decked because----. By Jove you're right. <b>You</b> <b>made</b> me <b>think</b> {{of the hero}} as a red-haired chap. Of course if he were red, the ship would be an open one with painted sails." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have been some sort of little vegetable, Bensington," [...] said Cossar--"that's what you {{ought to have}} been. Something growing over a rockery. Here you are, fearfully and wonderfully <b>made,</b> and all <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're <b>made</b> for is just to sit about and take your vittles. D'you think this world was made for old women to mop about in? Well, anyhow, you can't help yourselves now--you've got to go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of him?" [...] and Frank looked thoughtfully at the letter, as if turning {{carefully}} over in {{his mind}} the idea that Jill's quick wits had jumped at.|$|E
6000|$|And she {{was moving}} on when Coventry asked, with a {{suspicious}} look, [...] "What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it was lost? You seem to take an uncommon interest in my affairs today." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{started at}} the word [...] "ambitious." [...] He repeated, [...] "No. What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: {{but how did you}} find it out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I don't {{know what}} I have done," [...] he said, simply, [...] "to have merited such regard from two such women. It is like undeserved praise, Laura--or too much good fortune, which frightens one--or a great post, {{when a man}} feels {{that he is not}} fit for it. Ah, sister, how weak and wicked we are; how spotless, and full of love and truth, Heaven <b>made</b> <b>you!</b> I <b>think</b> for some of you there has been no fall," [...] he said, looking at the charming girl with an almost {{paternal}} glance of admiration.

2500|$|Andrea Kremer: [...] “What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> {{vulnerable}} to him?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very little. In fact, {{only that}} he had told you the way to Westerhouse; but that was quite enough. I {{do not know whether}} you told him that you loved him or not; but it is quite plain to me that <b>you</b> <b>made</b> him <b>think</b> so. Men of his kind do not betray those who believe in them without a reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is being {{engaged to be married}} that has <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{patience}} good," [...] said Celia, as soon as she and Dorothea were alone together, taking off their wrappings.|$|E
6000|$|She {{spoke as}} if the fact {{scarcely}} concerned her, and Lanfear drew a breath of relief in his surprise. He asked, at another tangent: [...] "What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I was sad yesterday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tommy, Miss Matheson {{tells me}} that it was you who saved my flowers from the frost the other night. I'm very much obliged to you indeed. Whatever <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of doing it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancied {{now that}} you might be a sailor, Mr. Gulston, though I didn't make so bold as to ask. Somehow or other there was {{something}} about your way that <b>made</b> me <b>think</b> <b>you</b> was bred up to the sea. I was not sure about it, for I can't recollect as ever we have had a sailor gentleman staying here for the fishing before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do {{not believe}} it is pride,' said Sophy, meekly; 'at least, I hope not. I feel humiliated enough, and I think it may be a sort of shame, as well as {{consideration}} for them, that would make me wish that no difference should be <b>made.</b> Do <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> we may let things go on?' she said, in so humble a manner, that it brought Albinia's tears, and a kiss was the only answer. 'Please tell me,' said Sophy; 'for I don't want to deceive myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; but <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I kept Bonita {{up in the}} mountains, that I went {{secretly}} to meet her, {{that all}} the while I served you I was--Oh, I know what <b>you</b> <b>think!</b> I know now. I never knew till I <b>made</b> <b>you</b> look at me. Now, say it! Speak!" ...|$|R
