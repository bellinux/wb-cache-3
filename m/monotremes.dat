5|$|One of the {{earliest}} known <b>monotremes</b> was Teinolophos, which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia. <b>Monotremes</b> have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (cloaca) – as lizards and birds also do – and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{description}} in 1999, Ambondro was {{interpreted as a}} primitive relative of Tribosphenida (marsupials, placentals, and their extinct tribosphenic-toothed relatives). In 2001, however, an alternative suggestion was published that united it with the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos and the <b>monotremes</b> (the echidnas, the platypus, and their extinct relatives) into the clade Australosphenida, which would have acquired tribosphenic molars independently from marsupials and placentals. The Jurassic Argentinean Asfaltomylos and Henosferus and the Cretaceous Australian Bishops were later added to Australosphenida, and new work on wear in australosphenidan teeth has called into question whether these animals, including Ambondro, did have tribosphenic teeth. Other paleontologists have challenged this concept of Australosphenida, and instead proposed that Ambondro is not closely related to Ausktribosphenos plus <b>monotremes,</b> or that <b>monotremes</b> are not australosphenidans and that the remaining australosphenidans are related to placentals.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell {{and colleagues}} in their {{description}} of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, Tribactonodon, agreed with the relationship between Ausktribosphenos and <b>monotremes,</b> but argued that Ambondro was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to Ausktribosphenos and <b>monotremes.</b> As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in Ambondro {{as well as some}} boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in Ambondro (flat) and Ausktribosphenos (squared); and the contrast between the talonids of Ambondro (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and Ausktribosphenos (squared).|$|E

40|$|We have {{reviewed}} published data on haemoglobin and myoglobin DNA {{and protein}} sequences from marsupial and <b>monotreme</b> mammals, and drawn {{attention to the}} difficulties that have been encountered in using these data to estimate dates of evolutionary divergence. We argue that continuing studies of marsupial and <b>monotreme</b> globins, particularly molecular studies on gene organisation and regulation, are likely to contribute significantly {{to our understanding of}} gene and organismal evolution. In this context we suggest that studies on the globin genes of a <b>monotreme</b> and a South American marsupial would be especially rewarding...|$|R
5|$|However, in 2003 Michael Woodburne {{and colleagues}} revised the phylogenetic {{analysis}} published by Luo and colleagues, making several {{changes to the}} data, particularly in the <b>monotremes.</b> Their results (Figure 3, bottom) challenged the division between Australosphenida and Boreosphenida, as proposed by Luo et al. Instead, they excluded <b>monotremes</b> from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to Eutheria, with Ambondro most closely related to Asfaltomylos. In 2007, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described another australosphenidan, Henosferus, from the Jurassic of Argentina; they argued against a relationship between Eutheria and Australosphenida (Figure 3, top), but were ambivalent about the placement of <b>monotremes</b> within Australosphenida. Based in part on Martin and Rauhut's earlier work on wear facets in australosphenidans, they questioned {{the presence of a}} true functional protocone on the upper molars of non-monotreme australosphenidans—none of which are known from upper teeth—and consequently suggested that australosphenidans may not, after all, have had truly tribosphenic teeth.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the original function of lactation (milk production) was to keep eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on <b>monotremes,</b> the egg-laying mammals.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro mahabo was {{described}} {{from the middle}} Jurassic (Bathonian, about 167million years ago) of northwestern Madagascar in 1999. It is known from a single lower jaw fragment with three teeth, probably the last premolar and first two molars. The molars have been interpreted as showing the tribosphenic pattern that is characteristic of modern mammals; Ambondro is the oldest known mammal with such a pattern. This led its discoverers to propose that the ancestors of tribosphenic mammals arose in the south (Gondwana), not, as generally assumed, in the north (Laurasia). In 2001, however, paleontologist Zhe-Xi Luo and colleagues alternatively proposed that Ambondro {{was part of a}} clade with Ausktribosphenos from the Cretaceous of Australia and the <b>monotremes</b> that developed tribosphenicity independently from other mammals (Boreosphenida). This clade, Australosphenida, has since been expanded with more recently discovered species from Argentina (Asfaltomylos and Henosferus) and Australia (Bishops). Other paleontologists have disagreed with this interpretation and proposed different models; for example, in 2001 Denise Sigogneau-Russell and colleagues proposed that although Ausktribosphenos and <b>monotremes</b> were related, Ambondro was not and was in fact more similar to boreosphenidans, and in 2003 Michael Woodburne and colleagues excluded <b>monotremes</b> from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to placentals. The deposits that produced Ambondro have yielded some reptiles, but no other mammals.|$|E

5|$|Louse (plural: lice) is {{the common}} name {{for members of the}} order Phthiraptera, which {{contains}} nearly 5,000 species of wingless insect.

5|$|The mammary glands {{of mammals}} are {{specialized}} to produce milk, {{the primary source}} of nutrition for newborns. The <b>monotremes</b> branched early from other mammals and do not have the nipples seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands.

5|$|In 2001, Zhe-Xi Luo {{and colleagues}} {{alternatively}} proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice (compare Figure 3, top)—once {{giving rise to}} the marsupials and placentals (Boreosphenida), and once producing Ambondro, the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos, and the living <b>monotremes,</b> which {{first appeared in the}} Cretaceous (united as Australosphenida). They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a cingulum on the outer front corner of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a triangulated last lower premolar.|$|E

5|$|K–Pg {{boundary}} mammalian {{species were}} generally small, comparable {{in size to}} rats; this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that some early <b>monotremes,</b> marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.|$|E
5|$|Mammals are amniotes, {{and most}} are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The {{exception}} to this are the egg-laying <b>monotremes,</b> the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.|$|E
5|$|Most mammals are viviparous, {{giving birth}} to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, lay eggs. The <b>monotremes</b> have a sex {{determination}} system {{different from that of}} most other mammals. In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal.|$|E

5|$|Progression {{towards an}} erect limb posture, which would {{increase}} the animals' stamina by avoiding Carrier's constraint. But this process was slow and erratic: for example, all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern <b>monotremes</b> still have semisprawling limbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of mammals have seven cervical vertebrae (bones in the neck), including bats, giraffes, whales and humans. The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which have just six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine cervical vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike <b>monotremes</b> and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|When endothermy first {{appeared}} in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids. Modern <b>monotremes</b> have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals, but there is evidence that some of their ancestors, perhaps including ancestors of the therians, may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians. Likewise, some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete — living and fossil <b>monotremes</b> have sprawling limbs. The parasagittal (nonsprawling) limb posture appeared {{sometime in the}} late Jurassic or early Cretaceous; it {{is found in the}} eutherian Eomaia and the metatherian Sinodelphys, both dated to 125 million years ago. Epipubic bones, a feature that strongly influenced the reproduction of most mammal clades, are first found in Tritylodontidae, suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and mammaliformes. They are omnipresent in non-placental mammaliformes, though Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium appear to have lacked them.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Luo {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a more thorough}} analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian Bishops to Australosphenida. They mentioned {{the condition of the}} hypoconulid, which is inclined forward, rather than backward as in boreosphenidans, as an additional australosphenidan character and noted that Ausktribosphenos and <b>monotremes</b> were united, to the exclusion of Ambondro, by the presence of a V-shaped notch in the distal metacristid. In the same year, Asfaltomylos was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to Ambondro, this animal lacked a distal metacristid and did not have as well-developed a lingual cingulum.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They could find no resemblance to australosphenidans including <b>monotremes,</b> metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
