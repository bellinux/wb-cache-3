5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did not <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by some as {{a turning point in the}} Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks played Glamorgan in Swansea on 21 December. The All Blacks had the {{advantage}} of the wind in the first 30 minutes. Late in the first half Roberts worked a <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> scrum to pass to Smith, who passed to Harold Abbott. Abbott then passed back to Smith who scored in the corner. In the second half Glamorgan attacked but could not score, and late in the game the All Blacks scored tries to McDonald and Wallace to win 9–0.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the English Poor Law system {{can be traced back}} to late medieval {{statutes}} dealing with beggars and vagrancy but it was only during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system became codified. Monasteries, the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudors Reformation causing poor relief to <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level. Early legislation was concerned with vagrants and making the able-bodied work, especially while labour was in short supply following the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|While North Korea {{had already}} begun to <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> foreign policy based upon proletarian internationalism at the Conference of Party Representatives in 1966, the WPK {{leadership}} had never explicitly broken with proletarian internationalism as it did at the 6th Congress. In theory, a communist party supports policy contributing to the world revolution. Communist regimes rarely lived up to this ideal; by the 1950s, ideological schisms within the world communist movement made it all but impossible. From 1966 onwards, North Korea strengthened relations with neutral countries in the global Cold War. Proletarian internationalism was replaced with a national, independent foreign policy; if a socialist and non-socialist country were at war, North Korea could (in theory) support the non-socialist country if it benefited North Korea. At the 6th Congress, Kim Il-sung attached more importance to relations with Third World countries than to unity in the socialist camp. Nevertheless, North Korea still received massive funds and aid from the Soviet bloc, the People's Republic of China and relations with the United States would remain bitterly cold. While North Korea argues that independence and proletarian internationalism are not exclusive, in orthodox communist theory they are.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of his scientific papers dealt with the systematics and biogeography of the Mollusca. In the early period of his career he published on both marine and non-marine taxa, but the former more or less stopped after 1963, possibly related to his <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> marine institute at Port Elizabeth to the Natal Museum at Pietermaritzburg.|$|E

25|$|According to Vianu, {{there is}} a {{manifest}} difference between Ion Luca Caragiale's comedies and his Momente şi schiţe: the former are, in his view, driven by situations and circumstances, whereas the latter sees Caragiale developing his original perspective to its fullest. This, he argues, was determined by important social changes—a <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> traditional world—awkwardly attempting to digest Westernization, modernization, and Francized culture—, to a more stable and prosperous environment. A similar division was applied by Ibrăileanu.|$|E
25|$|After a {{stint as}} a Fulbright {{lecturer}} in the universities of Rome and Bologna lasting from 1951 to 1953, Fiedler became the Chair of the Department of English in the University of Montana. He held this post from 1954 to 1956, during which time he fought against opposition to hire an African American professor. In 1955, Fiedler's book An End to Innocence was published; it was concerned with the necessity for America as a nation to <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> state of innocence {{to a state of}} experience (or adulthood).|$|E

Evans accepted the job, on the condition that he could retain his position as a sportswriter. In 1906, he received a spectacular career boost from fellow Youngstowner Jimmy McAleer, an ex-major leaguer who was so impressed with the young man's ability that he recommended Evans to American League president Ban Johnson. This gesture enabled Evans to <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Class C Division minor league club to the major leagues.|$|E
25|$|Cereal crops {{were first}} domesticated around 9000 BCE in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. The first domesticated crops were {{generally}} annuals with large seeds or fruits. These included pulses such as peas and grains such as wheat. The Middle East was especially suited to these species; the dry-summer climate was {{conducive to the}} evolution of large-seeded annual plants, and the variety of elevations led to a great variety of species. As domestication took place humans began to <b>move</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> hunter-gatherer society to a settled agricultural society. This change would eventually lead, some 4000 to 5000 years later, to the first city states and eventually the rise of civilization itself.|$|E

This will help in increased operational awareness. The network {{is referred to as the}} Navy Enterprise Wide Network (NEWN). The Indian Navy has also provided training to all its personnel in Information Technology (IT) at the Naval Institute of Computer Applications (NICA) located in Mumbai. Information technology is also used to provide better training, like the usage of simulators and for better management of the force.|$|E
