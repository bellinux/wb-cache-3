40|$|Parental {{involvement}} {{has become}} a popular approach to addressing the achievement gap between various racial/ethnic groups. Given the burgeoning presence of Hispanic children in public schools, {{the purpose of this}} study was to examine the causal influences between one dimension of parental involvement, parental expectations, and academic achievement (measured by standardized and teacher-reported measures). A sample of 293 first-grade Hispanic students from a larger longitudinal study examining the impact of retention on academic achievement was included in the study. Cross-lagged and autoregressive path modeling tested causal associations between parental expectations and students? academic achievement over the course of three years. Differences were also examined among gender and English language learner (ELL) status. Findings from this study indicate an inconsistent relationship between parental expectations and academic achievement, moderated by gender, achievement <b>measure,</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> of assessment. Specifically, results indicated a stronger relationship for male participants and for teacher-reported achievement indicators. More causal relationships were also noted in the later years of assessment. Additional analyses reveal Hispanic parents have lower educational expectations for ELLs than non-ELL students, regardless of academic abilities. Limitations, future directions, and study implications are discussed...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: Burgeoning {{evidence}} that modifiable parental factors can influence children's and adolescents' risk for {{depression and anxiety}} indicates that parents can {{play a crucial role}} in prevention of these disorders in their children. However, it remains unclear whether preventive interventions that are directed primarily at the parent (i. e. where the parent receives more than half of the intervention) are effective in reducing child internalizing (including both depression and anxiety) problems in the longer term. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Compared to a range of comparison conditions, parenting interventions reduced child internalizing problems, at a minimum of 6 months after the intervention was delivered. Mean effects were very small for <b>measures</b> of internalizing <b>and</b> depressive symptoms, <b>and</b> small for <b>measures</b> of anxiety symptoms. Pooled effects for anxiety diagnoses were significant and indicated a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. Pooled effects for depression diagnoses approached significance but suggested a NNT of 11. These results were based on effects reported at the longest follow-up interval for each included study, which ranged from 6 months up to 15 years for internalizing measures, 5. 5 <b>years</b> for depressive <b>measures,</b> <b>and</b> 11 <b>years</b> for anxiety measures.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} {{utilized}} a prospective, longitudinal design {{to examine the}} role of temperament and maltreatment in predicting the emergence of borderline (BPD) and antisocial (ASPD) personality disorder symptoms during adolescence. METHOD: Two hundred and forty-five children aged between 11 <b>and</b> 13 <b>years</b> were recruited from primary schools in Melbourne, Australia. Participants completed temperament, maltreatment, BPD <b>and</b> ASPD symptom <b>measures,</b> <b>and</b> approximately two <b>years</b> later, 206 participants were again assessed for BPD and ASPD symptoms. RESULTS: The findings indicate that childhood neglect is {{a significant predictor of}} an increase in BPD symptoms, while childhood abuse is a significant predictor of an increase in ASPD symptoms. Moreover, abuse and neglect acted as moderators of the relationship between temperament dimensions and increase in BPD and ASPD symptoms, respectively. Abuse was associated with an increase in BPD symptoms for children with low Affiliation, while neglect was associated with an increase in ASPD symptoms for children with low Effortful Control. CONCLUSIONS: The current study contributes much needed prospective, longitudinal information on the early development of symptoms of BPD and ASPD, and supports importance of both temperamental and environmental factors in predicting the emergence of these mental health problems early in life.
