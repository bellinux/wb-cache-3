5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and {{what can only be}} conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance <b>mind-set</b> projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E

Writers like Russell Shorto argue that the large influence of New Amsterdam on the American psyche {{has largely been}} overlooked in the classic telling of American beginnings, because of animosity between the English victors and the conquered Dutch.|$|E

In June 2015, the government announced that it intends to build capacity at the MEA through recruitment from academic circles and the private sector.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mind-sets</b> play an {{important}} role in orienting the decisions and activities that an individual engages in when he or she is designing, and designing involves interaction with complex, open-ended and ambiguous situations. This means that the individual disposition of a person influences the way that he or she reacts, and in designing, the complexity of the conditions that the individual interacts with, can increase due to the nature of the design problems. The processes that an individual engages in while designing is in turn, expected to influence the quality of design solutions that he or she produces. This thesis focusses on investigating the phenomena of <b>mind-sets</b> in the context of design and design learning, and its effects on the process of designing and quality of design solutions. Prevalent <b>mind-sets</b> that design students have toward design learning are identified and examined. Two categories of <b>mind-sets</b> are proposed, validated and tested across three different empirical studies. The two categories of <b>mind-sets</b> include the discerning and opportunistic <b>mind-sets.</b> Distinct differences between the two <b>mind-sets</b> provide significant insights toward the effects of <b>mind-sets</b> on the process and quality of outcomes in designing. Findings from these studies carry implications and recommendations for design education. Design Theory and Methodolog...|$|R
40|$|By {{comparing}} {{reality to}} what might have been, counterfactuals promote a relational processing style characterized by a tendency to consider relationships and associations among a set of stimuli. As such, counterfactual <b>mind-sets</b> were expected to improve performance on tasks involving the consideration of relationships and associations but to impair performance on tasks requiring novel ideas that are uninfluenced by salient associations. The authors conducted several experiments to test this hypothesis. In Experiments 1 a and 1 b, the authors determined that counterfactual <b>mind-sets</b> increase mental states and preferences for thinking styles consistent with relational thought. Experiment 2 demonstrated a facilitative effect of counterfactual <b>mind-sets</b> on an analytic task involving logical relationships; Exper-iments 3 and 4 demonstrated that counterfactual <b>mind-sets</b> structure thought and imagination around salient associations and therefore impaired performance on creative generation tasks. In Experiment 5, the authors demonstrated that the detrimental effect of counterfactual <b>mind-sets</b> is limited to creative tasks involving novel idea generation; in a creative association task involving the consideration of relationships between task stimuli, counterfactual <b>mind-sets</b> improved performance...|$|R

He studied there until 1929, narrowly escaping the 1929 Hebron massacre because he was away for the weekend. During his stay in Palestine, Hutner became a disciple of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the first chief rabbi of Palestine. Both men had a philosophical and mystical <b>mind-set</b> that made them kindred spirits. Like Kook, the young Hutner eventually developed a warm attitude toward non-religious Jews who were seeking to become more religious.

25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in 1950, Hayashi, who did not have prewar military background, was chosen by Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, with the endorsement of the American occupation authority, to head the newly formed National Police Reserve (NPR) in the capacity as Superintendent-General. Since Japan had been demilitarized after the Second World War, one of his major tasks was to build up the NPR as the foundation of Japan's self-defense power in post-war era. He was also responsible for developing a new <b>mind-set</b> for the NPR so as to adapt to post-war changes. When the NPR was restructured as the National Safety Force (NSF) in 1952, he was appointed Chief of the 1st (Ground) Staff of the First Staff Office, which was the top decision making body of the NSF.|$|E

H.D. wrote Trilogy out of her experiences in London during World War II and Helen in Egypt, a reworking of the Helen of Troy story {{from the perspective of}} the female protagonist, as a kind of feminist response to the masculine <b>mind-set</b> behind Pound's epic. Eliot's experiences of war-torn London also underpinned his Four Quartets. A number of Objectivists also wrote long poems, including Zukofsky's A, Charles Reznikoff's Testimony, and Basil Bunting's Briggflatts. Brian Coffey's Advent is the key long poem by an Irish modernist. All these poems, to one extent or another, use a range of techniques to blend personal experience with materials from a wide range of cultural and intellectual activities to create collage-like texts on an epic scale.|$|E

25|$|The war also {{witnessed}} the Israeli Merkava MBT make its first combat debut, squaring off against Syrian T-72 tanks. During these engagements, the Israelis {{claimed that the}} Merkava proved superior to the T-72, destroying {{a number of them}} without sustaining a single loss to T-72 fire. Former IAF commander, David Ivri would later recall a meeting with a high-ranking member of the Warsaw Pact, in which he was told that the dominance of Israeli and U.S. technology and tactics during the war was one of the factors that changed Soviet <b>mind-set,</b> leading to Glasnost and ultimately, the fall of the Soviet Union. However, defense analysts and the Syrians claimed the opposite, saying that their T-72s were highly effective and that none were lost. The T-72 tanks of the Syrian 2nd Armored Division were credited with not only halting the advance of an Israeli armored brigade on Rashaya on 10 June but pushing them back. They tallied the destruction of 33 tanks and the capture of an M60 Patton, which was sent to Damascus and thence transported to Moscow. Syrian tanks saw similar success against Israeli armor in Ain Zhalta and Sultan Yacoub in fighting on 8–10 June, stemming their advance to capture the Beirut-Damascus highway.|$|E

2500|$|Hayashi's {{first task}} as the Superintendent-General was {{to lay down}} a new <b>mind-set</b> for the NPR, since the [...] "spiritual training" [...] (seishin kyoiku) in the prewar Imperial Japanese Army had been scrapped. Although the post-war forces were no longer be {{required}} to pledge absolute allegiance to the Emperor under the post-war [...] "Peace Constitution", the general public was still unfamiliar with the democracy concept that was newly introduced to them and therefore, {{it was difficult to}} follow the practice of the US to inject democracy concept into the fundamental <b>mind-set</b> of the NPR. As the senior management of the NPR was deeply anxious about the lack of a new and appropriate <b>mind-set,</b> Hayashi attempted to explore one by striking a balance between old and new concepts. The new <b>mind-set</b> was finally introduced in a speech he made in March 1951, in which he emphasized, [...] "The fundamental spirit of the NPR I firmly hold [...] patriotism and love of our race". He pointed out that the NPR was loyal to the country and the people, instead of the Emperor. In another speech to the officers of the NPR, he said, [...] "Needless to say, if this organization is to play its rightful role in the new Japan, it must be ‘an organization of the people.’ This must be the fundamental principle upon which this defense force should be established" [...] By formulating the new <b>mind-set,</b> he connected the new post-war defense force with the people and cut-off its lineage with the prewar Japanese armed forces.|$|E

40|$|Mindfulness, {{achieved}} with out meditation, is discussed with particular reference to learning. Being mindful is {{the simple act}} of drawing novel distinctions. It leads us to greater sensitivity to context and perspective, and ulti mately to greater control over our lives. When we engage in mindful learning, we avoid forming <b>mind-sets</b> that unnec essarily limit us. Many of our beliefs about learning are <b>mind-sets</b> that have been mindlessly accepted to be true. Consideration is given to some of the consequences that result from a mindful reconsideration of these myths of learning. Keywords mindfulness; mindlessness; learning One of the primary issues in education today concerns the ques tion of what should be taught in our schools. The research my col leagues and I have been conduct ing over several years now sug gests that "what we teach " may be less important than "how we teach it. " Moreover, the reconsidered rules for learning speak as much to learning outside the classroom as inside. Whenever we attempt to learn something, whether it is a new con tent area, a sport, the way to play a musical instrument, or a new way to approach our businesses or our relationships, we rely on ways of learning that typically work to our detriment and virtually prevent the very goals we are trying to accom plish. The <b>mind-sets</b> we hold re garding learning more often than not encourage mindlessness, al though learning requires mindful engagement with the material in question. Before examining some of these <b>mind-sets,</b> it may be useful to define mindlessness and mind fulness and briefly review the re sults of research that reveals some of the costs of mindlessness, to make apparent why we might want to pursue mindful learning...|$|R

For equity and equality in accessing resources for education, for all regardless of a person?s sex or gender, a deconstruction of stereotype gender traits and roles has to take place first, through changing <b>mind-sets</b> so that members of communities and societies see gender and roles as nothing but labels that have come about through socialization and then come to appreciate that any human being regardless of sex or gender is capable of achieving any endeavor if given the requisite support.
