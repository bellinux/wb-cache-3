Scully receives a package containing a book on Native American beliefs, which describes how one <b>man</b> <b>will</b> prevent the impending apocalypse. Again visiting Kritschgau, she notices he has a stolen copy of her information on the alien spaceship. After he admits hacking her computer, she deletes the files from his laptop.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Lundgren starred {{alongside}} Steve Austin in The Package. Directed by Jesse Johnson, principal photography {{wrapped in}} March 2012, {{and the film}} was released on February 9, 2013. For a direct-to-DVD film, The Package was not a financial success. In its first week of release, the film debuted at no. 81; grossing $1,469 at the domestic box office. He starred {{in a number of}} other films later that year, including Legendary: Tomb of the Dragon, Battle of the Damned, Ambushed, Blood of Redemption, and the uncompleted comedy-western A <b>Man</b> <b>Will</b> Rise.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, Jean-Claude Van Damme {{was rumored}} to be co-starring {{alongside}} Jaa; in reality, he was never available due to scheduling issues, and as a result, Lundgren was cast as an alternative. The film entered production in April 2013, but {{came to an abrupt}} halt after three months of filming. Sahamongkol Film International filed a $49–50 million lawsuit against Jaa, Universal Pictures, and United International Pictures, claiming Jaa was in breach of his contract by accepting a role in Fast and Furious 7. After two years of legal proceedings, Sahamongkol dropped the lawsuit in July 2015. Despite this, production of A <b>Man</b> <b>Will</b> Rise has not continued, and the film remains uncompleted.|$|E
5|$|The Well-Manicured Man prefers subtlety to brute force, {{and will}} attempt to {{manipulate}} those in his way before using physical violence. Although the Syndicate's goals are opposed to those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the Well-Manicured <b>Man</b> <b>will,</b> at times, aid them with clues or information, believing that letting out {{a certain amount of}} information would help to keep the two close, and consequently allow for them to be controlled. The Well-Manicured Man openly despises The Smoking Man, seeing him as impulsive and unprofessional. The two maintain a bitter relationship within the Syndicate throughout the series. The Well-Manicured Man is instrumental in the Syndicate's secondary agenda, to develop a vaccination against the black oil used by the aliens as a means of mind control. To this end, he works with Russian double agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) to develop a vaccine, eventually testing it—successfully—on a Syndicate mole, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden).|$|E

25|$|The next leg of {{the journey}} takes the prince into a deep forest {{inhabited}} by the evil Spânul, or Bald Man. There follow three consecutive encounters between the protagonist and the Bald Man: after twice refusing the latter's insidious offer of services, the prince is eventually forced by dire circumstance into accepting it. After another elaborate deception, the creature is able to trap the prince into a well, and only leaves him out in exchange for swearing on his backsword that they would exchange roles: the Bald <b>Man</b> <b>will</b> be introduced as the king's son to his uncle, while the young <b>man</b> <b>will</b> become a slave {{under the name of}} Harap Alb. They proceed to the Green Emperor's palace, who innocently welcomes the Bald Man as his son. During the meeting, the master makes a point of mistreating and hitting his slave. This upsets the emperor's daughter, who asks him to behave with more reserve, and secretly begins to wonder about his actual identity.|$|E
25|$|For we {{all agree}} that the most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this <b>man</b> <b>will</b> choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent <b>man</b> <b>will</b> choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E

Therefore, more than women, <b>men</b> <b>will</b> choose more physically attractive and dominant companions in a mating context than in a neutral context...|$|R

Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given {{insufficient}} food they become difficult to handle. The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility. Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.|$|E
25|$|British authors such as Lord Byron, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mary Shelley, and John William Polidori, who are {{frequently}} linked to Gothic fiction, are also {{sometimes referred to}} as Dark Romantics. Their tales and poems commonly feature outcasts from society, personal torment and uncertainty as to whether the nature of <b>man</b> <b>will</b> bring him salvation or destruction. Some Victorian authors of English horror fiction, such as Bram Stoker and Daphne du Maurier, follow in this lineage.|$|E
25|$|Life {{expectancy}} projections are averages for {{an entire}} male population, and many medical and lifestyle factors modify these numbers.

25|$|Sonnet 32 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare.

The writer is {{reflecting}} on a future in which the young <b>man</b> <b>will</b> probably outlive him. The writer takes a melancholy tone, telling the young man to remember the writer not because of the strength of the sonnets, but because the love that has been shown to the young man far surpasses any love shown by another poet.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} what happens, {{consider the following}} analogy. Someone throws one ball every second at a man. Assume that balls travel with constant velocity. If the thrower is stationary, the <b>man</b> <b>will</b> receive one ball every second. However, if the thrower is moving towards the man, he will receive balls more frequently because the balls will be less spaced out. The inverse is true if the thrower is {{moving away from the}} man. So it is actually the wavelength which is affected; as a consequence, the received frequency is also affected. It may also be said that the velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes; hence frequency also changes.|$|E
25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded <b>man</b> <b>will</b> quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E
