40|$|In {{this modern}} era all the high rise {{buildings}} are designed as multi story and <b>multi-bay</b> <b>frame</b> structures. When such structures {{are subjected to}} various loads or displacements they behave both statically and dynamically. When the loads act slowly the inertia forces are neglected so only static load analysis is justified but when the load act very fast dynamic analysis is also considered. This project deals with two dimensional analysis of plane frame under arbitrary ground motions and load conditions. Finite Element method {{has been used for}} numerical analysis. Static and dynamic response of the plane frame element was obtained by writing a code in matlab. A study of variation static properties and dynamic properties with different numbers of storeys and bays in the frame element has been done. The effect of dampers in reducing the displacement under forced vibration has been studied. The numerical analysis has been experimentally verified by determination of natural frequency of plane frame model using FFT analyzer. ...|$|E
40|$|Session - Concrete and Composite Structures (II) The {{long-term}} effects of shrinkage often give rise to serious cracking problems in reinforced concrete buildings with large floors. To identify the problematic areas, shrinkage movement analysis {{can be carried out}} by finite element method with proper creep and shrinkage models using step-by-step time integration. The typical multi-storey building considered is constructed in stages and the construction period for each floor and the supporting columns is 20 days. The time-dependent stresses and strains of the building are studied with respect to various parameters including the number of bays, number of storeys and time lag of the staged construction sequences. Results of <b>multi-bay</b> <b>frame</b> models show that the restrained shrinkage stress increases with the number of bays in the frame. However, results of the shear-wall frame show that the first floor slab has the maximum shrinkage stresses and is therefore subjected to the most severe cracking. The stress initially decreases with height until it reaches its minimum value roughly at the upper quarter height of the building and then the stress increases again. The trend continues up to the roof. Furthermore, results of shear-wall building show that the shrinkage stresses at the lower floors may exceed the tensile strength of concrete even though late-cast strips are provided, implying that measures such as provision of anti-crack reinforcement may be required. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 7 th International Conference on Tall Buildings (ICTB- 7), Hong Kong, China, 29 - 30 October 2009.

40|$|In this thesis, masonry churches under {{horizontal}} actions are studied. Such structures feature strong seismic vulnerability, {{both because of}} the mechanical properties of the material and the particular configuration. Besides, uncertainty of the conventional seismic action is detected. Different codes provide different spectra and, subsequently, different total seismic actions. In order to assess such difficulties, the four basilicas of SGMR, SI, SGMG and SP have been selected. These study cases are analysed with a two step procedure in which the whole structure is analyzed in the linear field through a complete 3 D model, and then the single structural elements are assessed in non linear field through FEA and limit analyses. The following remarks can be stated: Certain uniformity in the global plan-altimetric apparatus can be recognised so that the four churches {{can be regarded as}} deriving from a sort of three-dimensional global model that changes only for a scale factor. Similarly, a common structural behaviour is expected and in the analyses confirmed. The modal shapes for the analyzed buildings show low torsional and transversal stiffness and great out of the plane deformation. When rigid diaphragms are inserted to model retrofit interventions, greater global stiffness (especially in terms of torsion) and a more monolithic behaviour is detected. It is noticed, furthermore, a stress concentration in the stiffer elements of the buildings (façade elements and in the transept zone) which absorb a larger amount of the total shear. Given the already stated uncertainty in the characterisation of seismic actions, assessment of the behaviour at collapse through spectrum-independent analyses is preferable. In this aim, advanced nonlinear analyses using the code ABAQUS are carried out on the single macro-elements constituting the structural complex. This approach is apparently the most accurate methodology for structural analyses. The results, in fact, are reliable only providing that very precise material characterisation is made. This can be very tricky for historical existing structures. Additional difficulties also derive from the complex geometrical configuration of the studied non-conventional structures. Load-displacement curves providing the collapse multiplier, the horizontal stiffness and the maximum displacement of some control points are obtained for all the macro-elements. These curves are compared with the elastic demands derived through global analyses. It has been shown that generally the bearing capacity of these elements is smaller than the strength demand. Therefore, these constructions are prone to damage and retrofit techniques are necessary. The presence of a rigid slab {{at the height of the}} roof has not improved at all the seismic behaviour of the study cases. On the contrary, the effective use of such retrofit technique has to be carefully evaluated specially when adopted in ancient constructions. In the light of the analyses conducted on these complex constructions it is derived that is quite hard following a unique procedure able to define with consistency the most influencing quantities. Therefore, the necessity of defining a handy and suitable methodology for designers is strongly felt. In order to seek a simplified procedure on churches macroelements, a basic structural element in historical buildings, such as the portal frame, has been studied in detail. An analytical exact expression, derived using the kinematic theorem, and an approximate formula have been used for performing a parametric analysis varying geometrical proportions. The extension of the single portal frame to the <b>multi-bay</b> <b>frame</b> has been applied in order to perform the comparison between non linear analyses and simplified analyses. The use of approximate expressions derived for the portal frame implies an averaging of the pier widths. When the medium value is taken into account, generally, greater error percentages are encountered in the model with the load condition considering the only self weight: in this case, the non linear analyses give higher values; on the contrary the limit analysis gives small values of the collapse multiplier. In the load condition of self weight plus dead load, the scatters are smaller. When the maximum pier is taken into account, the values of non linear analysis will be the same but limit analysis values will assume greater values, moving on the right side so that are inside the domain. This evidence has been confirmed for the churches of SGMR, SI and SP. On the contrary, in the church of SGMG, medium values have shown a better comparison with non linear procedure. In the last part of the thesis, the structural behaviour of another typical element in ancient structures is sought: it is the masonry arch. In order to determine the thrust ranges and the minimum thickness, a parametric analysis has been carried out on whole and half arches. A theory for the displacement of the supports has been developed: pointed arches can bear greater displacement than circular arches. This result is confirmed moving one of the supports in any direction into the plane and tracing the domains of possible positions. All the theoretical values have been checked with two different codes and the results agree well. Later, in order to verify these values, an extensive experimental campaign has been held on rigid concrete blocks in small scale representing eight different pointed arches varying eccentricity, the thickness and the angle of embrace. Five types of test were made on the arches: first, friction coefficient measures were taken on the blocks; then moving the supports horizontally apart and together, and vertically up and down. The comparison of theoretical and experimental results has allowed to emphasize the limits of both of them. Perfect hinges, sharp blocks, exactly symmetric structures, absence of friction, all accepted hypothesis in the theory, can never exist in reality; as a consequence the theoretical numerical results are greater than those measured in the experiments. At the same time the presented methods correctly predicted the final collapse mechanisms for the circular and specially the pointed arches. In the light of the conducted experiences in this study, in terms of modelling, analysis and testing, it is believed that masonry structures deserve great attention in the design and assessment process. Many mistakes can be made regarding the basic assumptions on the constitutive model of the material, the suitable structural modelling, the choice of the seismic action and an effective retrofit techniques. Furthermore, churches are more sensitive to damages than other “conventional” structures for their characteristic typology. The main features of these structures have been drawn throughout this work so that whatever similar building will fairly show the same topics here presented. About the material properties, only experimental campaigns on the structural constituents of the building under study could provide a good characterization. Regarding the suitable analysis types, undoubtedly, a global three-dimensional analysis is necessary to get the general idea of the construction and understand its behaviour. On the other side, a useful quantitative result is the evaluation of the ultimate condition at collapse on bi-dimensional elements. This consideration is also made since the definition of the seismic forces for masonry structures according to different code provisions is not unique. Simplified approaches do prove their appeal. Though some approximations are unavoidably to be made, in the aim of assessing the structural behaviour of ultimate capacity, such techniques seem to provide a very interesting path to follow in the futur...|$|E

40|$|In common {{structural}} design practice the foundation loads from structure analysis are obtained without allowance for soil settlements, and the foundation settlements are estimated assuming a perfectly flexible structure.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the behaviour {{and design of}} unbraced rigid-jointed multi-storey steel frameworks subjected to combined vertical and horizontal loading. Design charts are presented which enable guidance to be given on whether the serviceability limit on sway or ultimate limit state under combined loading will be critical for the choice of sections in preliminary design. Parametric studies on forty-three multi-storey, multi-bay rectangular frameworks provide the verification of the Merchant-Rankine formula {{for the design of}} such frames. An alternative semi-empirical expression based on the study of the deterioration of overall frame stiffness has been developed. Comparison with the parametric study indicated a significant improvement on the Merchant-Rankine approach to estimate the failure load of frameworks. The expression has then been used as the basis of an approximate optimization procedure for the design of frames to satisfy ultimate strength under combined loading. An approximate hand method to trace the formation of plastic hinges has been developed. The method is applicable to single bay frames, and has also been extended to <b>multi-bay</b> <b>frames.</b> The latter are transformed into equivalent single bay frames. A computer analysis program for semi-rigid connections has been presented using the matrix displacement method.

40|$|Abstract: Double-bay or <b>multi-bay</b> portal <b>frames</b> of {{hot-rolled}} steel {{have been}} in existence since {{the development of the}} plastic analysis theory, and the behaviour of the eaves connections of these frames are well established. With the increasing use of cold-formed steel in portal frames, it is necessary to develop connecting structural systems that are favourable to these elements, and to understand the behaviour of these connections. The purpose of this investigation is to develop internal eaves connections of double-bay portal frames of cold-formed steel channels, with the main frames members connected back-to-back. In double-bay portal frames, the columns of two single-bay portal frames, positioned adjacent to each other, are replaced by one internal column. Two internal eaves connections were developed and investigated, and are referred in this paper as Eaves Connection Type 1 (ECT- 1) and Eaves Connection Type 2 (ECT- 2). Tests were then performed to determine the capacity and failure mechanism of these connections, including the members forming these connections. Although the failure mechanisms included local buckling of the compression zone of the web and flange of the channels, and bolt-bearing deformations, all frames finally failed by local buckling of the web and flange of the channels. The moment-curvature graphs show that enough plasticity could not be achieved in both connections...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- U sing {{approximation}} by a micropolar continuum, the extensional buckling of a multi-story, <b>multi-bay</b> rectangular <b>frame</b> with rectangular boundary {{is solved}} by formulating {{the problem in}} terms of a system of six linear ordinary differential equations. The buckling loads must be computed by a trial-and-error pro-cedure because all coefficients of the 6 x 6 determinant to vanish depend on explicitly inexpressible complex roots and eigenvectors of another 6 x 6 determinant which in tum depends nonlinearly on the initial stress. It is shown that for tall frames consideration of long-wave buckling loads is important. Also, the continuum approximation is found to give very accurate results, as compared with the exact solutions oflarge frames. WHILE in low building frames the axial extensions of members may be usually neglected, in tall frames they must be taken into account. Buckling modes of such frames are then of long-wave character and the whole building frame appears to buckle as a single column. Analysis of such buckling modes with the usual methods becomes intractable for truly large frames, because of the overwhelmingly large number of unknown dis-placements of joints. As a rule, however, large frames are of regular character. This fact may be advantageously utilized introducing a continuum approximation of the frame, which has been developed in detail in a previous article[1] and has been foun...|$|R

It was found that at about eleven percent (11 %) stiffened length ratio, a 3 -floor dual-bay r. c. frame with stiffened joints model exhibited dynamic response equal to that of its equivalent shear building model.

40|$|Since {{the climate}} and seismic {{conditions}} vary significantly among European countries (and sometimes even in {{different areas of the}} same country) the European Standard for the design and construction of greenhouses for commercial production (EN 13031 - 1) contains strict provisions concerning load combinations in both serviceability (SLS) and ultimate limit states (ULS) for each individual country. Hence, a standard commercial (steel in particular) greenhouse structure, designed for a specific country, is not likely to meet the requirements for structural efficiency of a different EU country, if constructed as is it. This fact, combined with the overall tendency of growers to import standard commercial greenhouses, raises a very important issue, as far as official approval and structural adequacy are concerned. In the context of the above, the present work deals with the structural analysis of a steel Venlo - type multi-span greenhouse, originally designed and dimensioned in Italy, acted upon by the loads specified in EN 13031 - 1 for Greece, in conjunction with the Hellenic Anti-Seismic Code. Initially, the sides, gable ends and primary internal bearing steel frames of the structure were modeled as <b>multi-bay</b> single-story <b>frames,</b> including the braces of the original design, and loaded only at the external column tips with the equivalent horizontal seismic forces for both primary directions, as specified by the aforementioned Hellenic Code. The results of the nonlinear elastic analysis showed that the columns and vertical members of the trellis girders were heavily overstressed. The structure was re-designed, without any changes in the geometric characteristics (i. e. distances between columns, member lengths and connectivity), utilizing larger cross-sections and a different bracing system. After numerous attempts, the final design proved efficient in fulfilling all the design requirements of both SLS and ULS, without loss of functionality and global performance...|$|R
