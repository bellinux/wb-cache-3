5|$|Education in Zimbabwe became {{under threat}} since the {{economic}} changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike {{because of low}} pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger {{and the price of}} uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the <b>main</b> <b>targets</b> of Mugabe's attacks because he thought they were not strong supporters.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>main</b> <b>targets</b> {{chosen by}} the HOPE study was Callisto. The {{possibility}} of building a surface base on Callisto was proposed, because of the low radiation levels at its distance from Jupiter and its geological stability. Callisto is the only Galilean satellite for which human exploration is feasible. The levels of ionizing radiation on Io, Europa, and Ganymede are hostile to human life, and adequate protective measures {{have yet to be}} devised.|$|E
5|$|The key {{geographical}} {{features that}} had influenced the landings also influenced {{the next phase}} of the battle: the draws, the natural exits off the beaches, were the <b>main</b> <b>targets</b> in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault. In the areas between the draws, at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.|$|E
40|$|Multi-target models, which predict {{multiple}} target variables simultaneously, may predict some of {{the targets}} more accurately, and other targets less accurately than a single-target model. This raises the question whether {{it is possible to}} find, for a given <b>main</b> <b>target,</b> a subset of the other targets that, when combined with the <b>main</b> <b>target</b> in a multi-target model, results in the most accurate model for the <b>main</b> <b>target.</b> We propose Selective Inductive Transfer, an algorithm that automatically finds such a subset. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Before UML 2, {{the only}} {{transition}} semantics in use was the external transition, {{in which the}} main source of the transition is always exited and the <b>main</b> <b>target</b> of the transition is always entered. UML 2 preserved the [...] "external transition" [...] semantics for backward compatibility, but introduced also a new kind of transition called local transition (see Section 15.3.15 in Unified Modeling Language (UML), Infrastructure Version 2.2). For many transition topologies, external and local transitions are actually identical. However, a local transition doesn’t cause exit from and reentry to the main source state if the <b>main</b> <b>target</b> state is a substate of the main source. In addition, a local state transition doesn’t cause exit from and reentry to the <b>main</b> <b>target</b> state if the <b>main</b> <b>target</b> is a superstate of the main source state.|$|R
5|$|Around 1912, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's {{political}} influence {{was on the}} rise. He had begun associating with an inner faction of the Conservative Party, which had as its leader Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest. Afterward, Bogdan-Pitești became the publisher of Seara, but was reportedly a front for Cantacuzino, who used him to test the impact of his agenda on the Romanian public. Searas main negative campaign at the time focused on Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democrats, who, to Cantacuzino's displeasure, had been co-opted in government by the other mainstream Conservatives. The paper published gossip columns and lampoons having Ionescu, Alexandru Bădărău and Nicolae Titulescu for their <b>main</b> <b>targets.</b>|$|E
5|$|August 1945 {{began with}} further {{large-scale}} raids against Japanese cities. On the 1st of the month, 836 B-29s staged {{the largest single}} raid of World War II, dropping 6,145 tons of bombs and mines. The cities of Hachiōji, Mito, Nagaoka and Toyama were the <b>main</b> <b>targets</b> of this operation; all four suffered extensive damage and 99.5 percent of buildings in Toyama were destroyed. The cities of Imabari, Maebashi, Nishinomiya and Saga were attacked on 5August. These raids had also been preceded by propaganda leaflets and radio broadcasts from Saipan warning that the cities would be attacked.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{offensive}} {{began with}} an artillery bombardment on 8March. At 5:45am Japanese artillery began firing into the beachhead; the Piva airfields were the <b>main</b> <b>targets</b> of this shelling, and three aircraft were destroyed and 19 damaged. The Americans quickly located the Japanese guns, and their artillery began counter-battery fire. American aircraft also bombed several of the hills outside the perimeter. However, {{as a result of}} the bombardment all aircraft based at the Piva airfields other than six TBFs were moved to the nearby island of New Georgia. The next day Japanese artillery targeted the fighter strip at Torokina. Few shells landed on the American front line positions on either day.|$|E

5|$|After {{testing the}} engine for several years, {{both in the}} air and on the ground, CFMI searched for {{customers}} outside of a possible AMST contract. The <b>main</b> <b>targets</b> were re-engine contracts for the Douglas DC-8 and the Boeing 707 airliners, including the related military tanker, the KC-135 Stratotanker. There was little initial interest in the engine, but Boeing realized that the CFM56 might be a solution to upcoming noise regulations. After announcing that a 707 would be configured with the CFM56 engine for flight tests in 1977, Boeing officially offered the 707-320 with the CFM56 engine as an option in 1978. The new variant was listed as the 707-700. Due to limited interest from the airlines in a re-engined 707, Boeing ended the 707-700 program in 1980 without selling any aircraft. Despite the lack of sales, having the commercial 707 available with the CFM56 helped the engine's competitiveness for the KC-135 re-engine contract.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 1964, the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam {{was ordered}} {{to carry out a}} series of {{military}} operations as part of the Communist winter-spring offensive. The NLF Nam Bo (Mekong Delta) Regional Command established a sub-command under the leadership of Trần Đình Xu, with Nguyễn Hòa as the deputy commander, and Lê Trọng Tấn as the political commissar. Their mission was to inflict damage on the regular units of the ARVN and destroy the strategic hamlets constructed by the former Ngô Đình Diệm regime. The Viet Cong identified the regions of Bình Long-Phước Long and Bà Rịa-Long Khánh, along Route 14, as the <b>main</b> <b>targets</b> for their offensive. Meanwhile, the Central Military Commission in Hanoi appointed General Nguyen Chi Thanh as the commander of North Vietnamese military operations in southern Vietnam. Other high-ranking officers such as Major Generals Lê Trọng Tấn and Trần Độ, and Colonel Hoàng Cầm were sent to South Vietnam to supervise the military build-up which would commence in November 1964.|$|E
5|$|The fourteenth week of {{the season}} {{featured}} a game between 5–7 teams as the Washington Redskins visited Soldier Field. In 48 games, the Redskins led the series 24–23–1 and had won the last five meetings. The Chicago offense took on a Washington defense that excelled against passers, being ranked tenth in the category; Dashon Goldson led all defensive backs in tackles with 95, while Bashaud Breeland led the team in passes defended with 13. The Redskins defensive rush, which had 20 sacks in 2015, was led by Ryan Kerrigan, who has 6.5. Despite such performances, the Redskins rush defense was ranked 29th in yards per carry with 4.64 and 25th in average rushing yards at 124.2. Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears could exploit this with the three-man rushing attack of Matt Forte, Jeremy Langford, and Ka'Deem Carey. On defense, the Bears faced a Kirk Cousins-led offense that focuses on quick passes; Cousins completed a league-high 68.6 percent of his passes, with 7.1 yards per pass. One of Cousins' <b>main</b> <b>targets</b> was tight end Jordan Reed, who scored six touchdowns and led the Redskins in yards after the catch. Rankings-wise, the pass attack was ranked 17th in the league in passing yards per game and 16th for yards per play. Joniak states that the Bears had to force turnovers, and an area was on third down, as five of Cousins' interceptions had been on third down.|$|E

25|$|The CIA had {{different}} demands placed on {{it by the}} different bodies overseeing it. Truman wanted a centralized group to organize the information that reached him, the Department of Defense wanted military intelligence and covert action, and the State Department wanted to create global political change favorable to the US.

One of the <b>main</b> <b>targets</b> for intelligence gathering was the Soviet Union, which had also been a priority of the CIA's predecessors.|$|E
25|$|Other {{cities with}} extant bomb shelters from the Spanish Civil War include Madrid, Guadalajara, Alcalá de Henares, Santander, Jaén, Alcañiz, Alcoy, Valencia and Cartagena.

Cartagena suffered between 40 and 117 bombings (sources are mixed about the number of attacks). The most dramatic was one carried on by the German Condor Legion on November 25, 1936. The hugest anti-raid shelter in Cartagena, which could accommodate up to 5.500 persons, is since 2004 a museum site.|$|E
