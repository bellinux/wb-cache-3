5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen <b>matte</b> techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black <b>matte</b> lines (where the <b>matte</b> area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E

40|$|Image matting {{deals with}} finding the {{probability}} that each pixel in an image belongs to a user specified ‘object’ or to the remaining ‘background’. Most existing methods estimate the <b>mattes</b> for two groups only. Moreover, most of these methods estimate the <b>mattes</b> with a particular bias towards the object and hence the resulting <b>mattes</b> do not sum up to 1 across the different groups. In this work, we propose a general framework to estimate the alpha <b>mattes</b> for multiple image layers. The <b>mattes</b> are estimated as {{the solution to the}} Dirichlet problem on a combinatorial graph with boundary conditions. We consider the constrained optimization problem that enforces the alpha <b>mattes</b> to take values in [0, 1] and sum up to 1 at each pixel. We also analyze the properties of the solution obtained by relaxing either of the two constraints. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can be used to extract accurate <b>mattes</b> of multiple objects with little user interaction. 1...|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, most sulfide ores {{have been}} {{processed}} using pyrometallurgical techniques {{to produce a}} <b>matte</b> for further refining. Recent advances in hydrometallurgical techniques resulted in significantly purer metallic nickel product. Most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction. In hydrometallurgical processes, nickel sulfide ores are concentrated with flotation (differential flotation if Ni/Fe ratio is too low) and then smelted. The nickel <b>matte</b> is further processed with the Sherritt-Gordon process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide, leaving a concentrate of cobalt and nickel. Then, solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel, with the final nickel content greater than 99%.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} film remake of Caligari edited, {{written and directed}} by David Lee Fisher was released in 2005, in which new actors were placed in front of the actual backdrops from the original film. The actors performed in front of a green screen, then their performances were superimposed in front of <b>matte</b> shots based on the original sets. Doug Jones played the role of Cesare.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of <b>matte</b> paintings was also made, with <b>Matte</b> World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E

50|$|Completed artwork was copied under top {{lights on}} a pin-registered camera {{on a high}} {{contrast}} film such as Kodaline or Kodalith to create 35mm <b>mattes</b> used in the optical slide printing process. When needed, pin-registered positive <b>mattes</b> known as countermattes were made by contact printing from the <b>mattes.</b> When a set of <b>mattes</b> and countermates were completed, the optical slide camera was used to assemble the separate images onto a single frame of film by making multiple exposures through the <b>mattes.</b> Accuracy in positioning the separate elements of the slide is {{made possible by the}} film sprockets, which were also used to position the finished color slides and masks in the slide mounts.|$|R

5|$|The {{scenes in}} Calgary were {{actually}} {{shot in the}} back of the Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles.

5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a <b>matte</b> shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a <b>matte</b> painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a <b>matte</b> painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E

5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not bother to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain.

5|$|CIS Vancouver and Pac Title created most of {{the visual}} effects, under the overall {{supervision}} of Michael Owens. CIS' work was headed by Geoff Hancock and Pac Title's by Mark Freund. Each studio created around 90 shots. Pac Title focused primarily on 2D imagery; VICON House of Moves handled the motion capture. The effects work consisted mainly of peripheral additions: architecture, vehicles, crowds and furniture. CIS used 3D modeling package Maya to animate city scenes before rendering them in mental ray; they generated <b>matte</b> paintings in Softimage XSI and Maya, and used Digital Fusion for some 2D shots. The team's work began with research into 1928 Los Angeles; they referenced historical photographs and data on the urban core's population density. CIS had to generate mostly new computer models, textures and motion capture because the company's existing effects catalog consisted primarily of modern era elements. CIS supplemented exteriors with skylines and detailed backdrops. They created set extensions digitally and with <b>matte</b> paintings. CIS created city blocks by using shared elements of period architecture that could be combined, rearranged and restacked to make buildings of different widths and heights; that way, the city could look diverse {{with a minimum of}} textural variation. CIS referenced vintage aerial photographs of downtown Los Angeles so shots would better reflect the geography of the city, as Hancock felt it important to have a consistency that would allow audiences to understand and become immersed in the environment.|$|E
