40|$|We {{address the}} question: How many edge guards {{are needed to}} guard an {{orthogonal}} polyhedron of e edges, r of which are reflex? It was previously established [3] that e/ 12 are sometimes necessary and e/ 6 always suffice. In contrast to the <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> guardsused for these bounds, we introduce a new model, open edge guards (excluding the endpoints of the edge), which we argue are in some sense more natural in this context. After quantifying the relationship between <b>closed</b> and open <b>edge</b> guards, we improve the upper bound to show that, asymptotically, (11 / 72) e (open or <b>closed)</b> <b>edge</b> guards suffice, or, in terms of r, that (7 / 12) r suffice. Along the way, we establish tight bounds relating e and r for orthogonal polyhedra of any genus. ...|$|R
40|$|Dangling bonds at {{the edge}} of a {{nanopore}} in monolayer graphene make it susceptible to back-filling at low temperatures from atmospheric hydrocarbons, leading to potential instability for nanopore applications, such as DNA sequencing. We show that <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> nanopores in bilayer graphene are robust to back-filling under atmospheric conditions for days. A controlled method for <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> nanopore formation starting from monolayer graphene is reported using an in-situ heating holder and electron beam irradiation within an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. Tailoring of closed-edge nanopore sizes is demonstrated from 1. 4 - 7. 4 nm.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> detection method {{based on a}} level lines selection approach. The proposed method {{is based on an}} unsupervised probabilistic scheme using an a contrario method. A level line is considered meaningful if its contrast and length is unlikely to be due to chance. Besides being unsupervised, this method exploits a tree structure. The first step of the proposed approach is to reduce the meaningful level lines set using this hierarchical structure. Compared with a previous method using the same principle, our method achieve a 67 % reduction rate of irrelevant levels lines. The second step of the proposed approach illustrates the high flexibility of using <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> boundaries such as levels lines. Using a rather simple curvature analysis, the proposed method detects anatomical structures boundaries from CT scan images...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid image segmentation method based edge detection and seeded region growing (SRG) methods. Our method is robust for selecting the initial seeds automatically. Also, the segmentation process is simplified and becomes very fast due to applying the proposed method to edge pixels instead of whole pixels as well-known image segmentation techniques. The method begins by obtaining closed unit-width segment boundaries using an optimum edge detection method suitably modified {{to detect and}} fill the edge holes and thinned if required. Automatically seeded SRG is used to obtain all <b>closed</b> <b>edges</b> in the image. The image is partitioned into sub-images according to the <b>closed</b> <b>edges,</b> where each sub-image contains segments, again detected using SRG, by eliminating all pixels contained in or on the sub-image. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated using acquired images {{from a range of}} different shapes and compared with established methods...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{research}} on the two-dimensional crystal structure of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) {{has suggested that the}} physical properties of h-BN can be tailored for a wealth of applications by controlling the atomic structure of the membrane edges. Unexplored for h-BN, however, is the possibility that small additional edge-atom distortions could have electronic structure implications critically important to nanoengineering efforts. Here we demonstrate, using a combination of analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory, that covalent interlayer bonds form spontaneously at the edges of a h-BN bilayer, resulting in subangstrom distortions of the edge atomic structure. Orbital maps calculated in 3 D around the <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> reveal that the out-of-plane bonds retain a strong π* character. We show that this <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> reconstruction, strikingly different from the equivalent case for graphene, helps the material recover its bulklike insulating behavior and thus largely negates the predicted metallic character of open edges...|$|R

Furthermore, the Zn nanocluster in a faulted half unit cell empties the filled surface dangling bond state of the <b>closest</b> <b>edge</b> Si adatoms in the nearest neighboring uncovered unfaulted half unit cells at about - 0. 3 V, leading to the suppressed height of the <b>closest</b> <b>edge</b> Si adatoms in the filled-state STM images...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a method and a device for classifying remote images by integrating edge {{information and a}} support vector machine. The method includes the steps: performing pixel-wise support vector machine classification for the remote images which are subjected to preprocessing and characteristic extraction; performing edge detection for the remote images which are subjected to preprocessing and characteristic extraction so as to obtain a discontinuous one-pixel wide edge map; performing edge connection for the discontinuous one-pixel wide edge map subjected to noise edge removal so as to obtain a <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> map; and integrating the <b>closed</b> <b>edge</b> map to a map subjected to pixel-wise support vector machine classification so as to obtain a classified result map integrating the edge information.
