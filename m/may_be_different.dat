5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, which were more typical action role-playing games, Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler, {{and the majority of}} the gameplay takes place in selected locations rather than on an open world map. The player selects these areas on the world map to reach them. The primary objective in each location is to clear the dungeon of monsters. Each dungeon is divided into different randomly generated floors, and to progress between each zone, the player must find an item called a Gleamdrop, then carry it to a pillar of light called a Gleamwell. The player must repeat this process on each floor of the dungeon until the last floor is reached, where a boss monster lies. The player can not return to previous floors unless they die or leave the dungeon; upon returning, they start the dungeon over at the beginning. When not clearing dungeons, the player stays in the Mana Village, which contains shops to purchase equipment. Dungeons can be returned to later by accepting quests from townsfolk in the Dudbear shop. During these quests, the dungeon itself is slightly altered: the player's starting position <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> the number of floors can change, and the monsters and boss monster contained may change. Like the main quests, Dudbear quests involve clearing the dungeon of monsters, sometimes to acquire an item {{from the end of the}} dungeon.|$|E

25|$|The kernel has {{full access}} to the system's memory and must allow {{processes}} to safely access this memory as they require it. Often {{the first step in}} doing this is virtual addressing, usually achieved by paging and/or segmentation. Virtual addressing allows the kernel to make a given physical address appear to be another address, the virtual address. Virtual address spaces <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> for different processes; the memory that one process accesses at a particular (virtual) address <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> memory from what another process accesses at the same address. This allows every program to behave as if it is the only one (apart from the kernel) running and thus prevents applications from crashing each other.|$|E
25|$|By {{incorporating}} {{specific information}} on a species’ diet, reproduction, dispersal and habitat specialisation Verberk et al. could successfully explain the contribution of individual species to the overall relationship and they showed that the main mechanisms in operation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> for different species groups.|$|E

25|$|It is a {{challenge}} for scientists and philosophers to define life. This is partially because life is a process, not a substance. Any definition must be general enough to both encompass all known life and any unknown life that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from life on Earth.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the study}} on magpies, {{self-recognition}} {{was thought to}} reside in the neocortex area of the brain. However, said brain region is absent in birds. Self-recognition in birds and mammals may be a case of convergent evolution, where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviours or traits, although they arrive at them via different routes and the underlying mechanism <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>different.</b>|$|E

25|$|Auditory {{processing}} deficits {{have also}} been proposed {{as a cause of}} stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered, such as by masking, delayed auditory feedback (DAF), or frequency altered feedback. There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> in people who stutter.|$|E
