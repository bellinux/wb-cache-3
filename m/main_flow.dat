5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many places}} in London, the Old Kent Road area {{did not suffer}} {{significant}} bomb damage during World War II. In 1968, a flyover opened at the northern end allowing access to New Kent Road which catered for the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of traffic. During the 1970s, run-down Victorian properties on and around Old Kent Road were demolished {{to make way for}} new housing estates. Burgess Park was created as part of the County of London Plan in 1943, which recommended new parkland in the area. Several tower blocks were built along the road, although some earlier 19th-century buildings, such as Nos.360–386, survived.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash plumes {{can form}} above {{pyroclastic}} density currents, these are called co-ignimbrite plumes. As pyroclastic density currents travel {{away from the}} volcano, smaller particles are removed from the flow by elutriation and form a less dense zone overlying the <b>main</b> <b>flow.</b> This zone then entrains the surrounding air and a buoyant co-ignimbrite plume is formed. These plumes tend to have higher concentrations of fine ash particles compared to magmatic eruption plumes due to the abrasion within the pyroclastic density current.|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} {{is named after}} the two primary rivers: the <b>Main</b> <b>flows</b> along the south-west corner of the district. The Kinzig, {{a tributary of the}} <b>Main,</b> <b>flows</b> through the district.|$|R

25|$|The {{centre of}} Würzburg is {{surrounded}} by hills. To the west lies the 266 metre Marienberg and the Nikolausberg (359 m) {{to the south of}} it. The <b>Main</b> <b>flows</b> through Würzburg from the south-east to the north-west.|$|R
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of {{the game}} is {{different}} from the other Dragon Quest games; instead of exploring one large world, the party goes to separate continents by placing stone shards into their appropriate pedestals in Estard Fane. Once all of the missing shards are located and placed for a particular pedestal, the party is transported to the trapped location in the past. After solving whatever problems plague the location, the party then travels back to Estard, the beginning island. From there, they can travel via boat, carpet, or skystone to the modern version of the location they just saved. These saved lands appear on the main map, although the originals (from the past) can be revisited through the ruins.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> {{of traffic}} leads through {{the centre of}} the city and through inner and outer ring roads (partially in operation).|$|E
25|$|The sediments entrained in a flow can {{be transported}} along the bed as bed load {{in the form}} of sliding and rolling grains, or in {{suspension}} as suspended load advected by the <b>main</b> <b>flow.</b> Some sediment materials may also come from the upstream reaches and be carried downstream {{in the form of}} wash load.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccuracy of {{existing}} measurement models for <b>main</b> steam <b>flow</b> in power plants is always unsatisfied. In this paper, a model with higher accuracy for <b>main</b> steam <b>flow</b> measurement was proposed. Accurate values of <b>main</b> steam <b>flow</b> {{can be obtained}} based on principle of mass balance when unit is at a steady state. Because of volume sections such as cooling wall and super heater, this model isn’t suitable for dynamic-state unit. Another measuring model based on Flugel formula can give exact change trends of <b>main</b> steam <b>flow</b> when unit is at a dynamic state. However, its accuracy is unsatisfied. Therefore, this paper took advantages of the two models, fusing them together in frequency domain with complementary filter method. Simulation results show that new model not only gives accurate steam flow when unit is at a steady state but also provides exact change trends of <b>main</b> steam <b>flow...</b>|$|R

50|$|The highest ever flood reached Niedernberg in February 1784 {{during spring}} runoff as the <b>Main</b> <b>flowed</b> almost 10 m {{higher than normal}} through the valley. The flood tore away whole ships, huts and stables, {{sometimes}} along with the animals in them.|$|R
25|$|The {{section of}} the bridge {{crossing}} the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of the river was destroyed in floods in 1795 and was replaced between 1795 and 1797, {{at a cost of}} £3,550, with the present section of bridge. The work was reputedly designed by Thomas Sykes, the County Surveyor. However, according to Nikolaus Pevsner, it was designed by Thomas Harrison.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the late}} 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly {{distributary}} {{was the main}} channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the Adi Ganga. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels {{were more or less}} equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges. It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges. One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.|$|E
25|$|In case of {{a sudden}} {{reduction}} of pipe diameter, without streamlining, the flow {{is not able to}} follow the sharp bend into the narrower pipe. As a result, there is flow separation, creating recirculating separation zones at the entrance of the narrower pipe. The <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> is contracted between the separated flow areas, and later on expands again to cover the full pipe area.|$|E

50|$|Second, the <b>main</b> <b>flowing</b> river {{channels}} show a curvature that bends {{towards the}} east-southeast. The curvature seems to {{a result of}} gradual uplift of rocks towards the east-southeast and shows resemblance to the patterns of deflected streams during lateral fold growth. Under this assumption, this evidence supports the growth of fold towards the east-southeast.|$|R
25|$|Industries {{are located}} {{mostly in the}} {{southern}} and eastern districts. The Innere Stadt is situated away from the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of the Danube, but is bounded by the Donaukanal ("Danube canal"). Vienna's second and twentieth districts are located between the Donaukanal and the Danube River. Across the Danube, where the Vienna International Centre is located (districts 21–22), and in the southern areas (district 23) are the newest parts of the city.|$|E
25|$|In 1794 Elgin's {{successor}} built a {{new line}} from Limekilns to recently acquired coal mines around Baldridge and Rosebank. The <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> on the second line was to Charlestown harbour. It is not certain when the line was relaid with edge rails, but {{it may have been}} completed in 1841. The system was expanding with branches to Netherton in 1812, Lady Elgin in 1823, to Francis and Bruce pits in 1826 and to Wellwood pit about 1840. Hunter and Tom pits were connected in 1850 and Balmudo pit about 1857.|$|E
25|$|In Louisiana, the Atchafalaya River is an {{important}} distributary of the Mississippi River. Because the Atchafalaya takes a steeper route to the Gulf of Mexico than the main channel, over several decades it has captured {{more and more of}} the Mississippi's flow, after the Mississippi meandered into the Red River of the South. The Old River Control Structure, a dam which regulates the outflow from the Mississippi into the Atchafalaya, was completed in 1963. It is intended to prevent the Atchafalaya from capturing the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of the Mississippi and stranding the ports of Baton Rouge and New Orleans.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>main</b> <b>flows</b> of {{emigration}} marked {{the evolution of}} the population: in 1915 a first wave (approximately one quarter) moved to Roma, Milano, Paris, Berlin etc.; after 1960 a second wave (half of the population) left the village to go to foreign countries in Northern Europe, but also to the United States and Brazil.|$|R
50|$|The Red <b>Main</b> <b>flows</b> {{initially}} in a southeasterly direction, {{before it}} swings northeast and passes through Creußen. From there it heads almost due north {{and then turns}} west beyond Eremitage. It passes through the town of Bayreuth from east to west. In the town centre it has been confined since the 1970s in a concrete channel and partially covered.|$|R

25|$|The {{variable}} {{temperature of}} the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as , the boiling point of water. The authors suggest that elements of {{the bottom of the}} flow were decoupled from the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|Another dispute {{was created}} after {{the signing of}} the Salomón–Lozano Treaty in March 1922 by the governments of Colombia and Peru, which at that time was ruled by Augusto B. Leguía. The treaty, which was kept secret, set the {{boundary}} between Peru and Colombia to be the Putumayo River, {{with the exception of a}} small strip of land controlled by the city of Leticia that would connect Colombia to the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of the Amazon River. Along with that, Colombia effectively recognized Peruvian control of the rest of the disputed region south of the Putumayo River.|$|E
25|$|The airfoil {{profiles}} are optimized and matched {{for specific}} velocities and turning. Although compressors can be run at other conditions with different flows, speeds, or pressure ratios, this {{can result in}} an efficiency penalty or even a partial or complete breakdown in flow (known as compressor stall and pressure surge respectively). Thus, a practical limit {{on the number of}} stages, and the overall pressure ratio, comes from the interaction of the different stages when required to work away from the design conditions. These “off-design” conditions can be mitigated to a certain extent by providing some flexibility in the compressor. This is achieved normally through the use of adjustable stators or with valves that can bleed fluid from the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> between stages (inter-stage bleed).|$|E

50|$|Model five {{encompasses}} {{elements of}} both model 3 and 4. The <b>main</b> auxin <b>flow</b> in this model comes {{from the top of}} the plant vertically down towards the base of the plant with some of the auxin travelling horizontally from the <b>main</b> auxin <b>flow</b> to both sides of the plant. Receiving light inhibits the horizontal auxin <b>flow</b> from the <b>main</b> vertical auxin <b>flow</b> to the irradiated exposed side. And according to the study by Sakai and Haga, the observed asymmetric auxin distribution and subsequent phototropic response in hypocotyls seems most consistent with this fifth scenario.|$|R
25|$|Plant species {{diversity}} is relatively low, since the flora must be tolerant of salt, complete or partial submersion, and anoxic mud substrate. The most common salt marsh plants are glassworts (Salicornia spp.) and the cordgrass (Spartina spp.), which have worldwide distribution. They {{are often the}} first plants to take hold in a mudflat and begin its ecological succession into a salt marsh. Their shoots lift the <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> of the tide above the mud surface while their roots spread into the substrate and stabilize the sticky mud and carry oxygen into it so that other plants can establish themselves as well. Plants such as sea lavenders (Limonium spp.), plantains (Plantago spp.), and varied sedges and rushes grow once the mud has been vegetated by the pioneer species.|$|E
25|$|From the 16th century onwards, Stoke Newington {{has played}} a {{prominent}} role in assuring a water supply to sustain London's rapid growth. Hugh Myddleton's New River runs through the area and still makes a contribution to London's water. It used to terminate at the New River Head in Finsbury, but since 1946 its <b>main</b> <b>flow</b> has ended at Stoke Newington reservoirs. A slow ornamental trickle flows past the West Reservoir, goes underground for a stretch on Green Lanes, reappears for a time in Clissold Park, and disappears underground again on its way to Canonbury. The river bank, the New River Path, can be walked for some distance to the north through Haringey and on to its source near Hertford, though not all sections are open.|$|E

40|$|Two {{numerical}} {{approaches are}} used to model {{the interaction between the}} turbine <b>main</b> gas <b>flow</b> and the wheelspace cavity seal flow. The 3 -D, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved with a CFD code based on a structured grid to study the interaction between the turbine <b>main</b> gas <b>flow</b> and the wheelspace cavity seal flow. A CFD code based on an unstructured grid is used to solve detailed flow feature in the cavity seal which has a complex geometry. The numerical results confirm various observations from earlier experimental studies under similar flow conditions. When the flow rate through the rim cavity seal is increased, the ingestion of the <b>main</b> turbine <b>flow</b> into the rim seal area decreases drastically. However, a small amount of <b>main</b> gas <b>flow</b> is ingested to the rim seal area even with very high level of seal flow rate. This is due to the complex nature of 3 -D, unsteady flow interaction near the hub of the turbine stage...|$|R
