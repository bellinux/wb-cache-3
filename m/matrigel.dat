50|$|The {{ability of}} <b>Matrigel</b> to stimulate complex cell {{behavior}} {{is a consequence}} of its heterogeneous composition. The chief components of <b>Matrigel</b> are structural proteins such as laminin, entactin, collagen and heparan sulfate proteoglycans which present cultured cells with the adhesive peptide sequences that they would encounter in their natural environment. Also present are growth factors like TGF-beta and EGF that prevent differentiation and promote proliferation of many cell types. A growth-factor-reduced <b>Matrigel</b> is also available. <b>Matrigel</b> contains other proteins in small amounts and its exact composition can vary from lot to lot. For this reason, <b>Matrigel</b> may not be appropriate for experiments that require precise knowledge of all proteins and concentrations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Matrigel</b> is {{also used}} as an {{attachment}} substrate in embryonic stem cell culture. When embryonic stem cells are grown {{in the absence of}} feeder cells, extracellular matrix components are needed to maintain the pluripotent, undifferentiated state (self-renewal). One of these matrices that can be used is diluted <b>Matrigel.</b> When used undiluted, <b>Matrigel</b> promotes stem cell growth and differentiation.|$|E
50|$|Cells cultured on <b>Matrigel</b> {{demonstrate}} complex cellular {{behavior that}} is otherwise difficult to observe under laboratory conditions. For example, endothelial cells create intricate spiderweb-like networks on <b>Matrigel</b> coated surfaces but not on plastic surfaces. Such networks are highly suggestive of the microvascular capillary systems that suffuse living tissues with blood. Hence, <b>Matrigel</b> allows them to observe {{the process by which}} endothelial cells construct such networks that are of great research interest.|$|E
50|$|A common {{laboratory}} {{procedure is}} to dispense small volumes of chilled (4 °C) liquid <b>Matrigel</b> onto plastic tissue culture labware. When incubated at 37 °C (body temperature) the <b>Matrigel</b> proteins polymerise (solidify) producing a gel {{that covers the}} labware's surface.|$|E
5000|$|Pharmaceutical {{scientists}} use <b>Matrigel</b> {{to screen}} drug molecules. A typical experiment consists of adding a test molecule to <b>Matrigel</b> and observing cellular behavior. Test molecules that promote endothelial cell network formation are candidates for tissue regeneration therapies whereas test molecules that inhibit endothelial cell network formation are candidates for anti-cancer therapies. Likewise, test molecules that inhibit tumor cell migration {{may also have}} potential as anti-cancer drugs. <b>Matrigel</b> is also commonly used to prepare human tumor xenografts in rodents {{as part of a}} cancer drug discovery program. [...] <b>Matrigel</b> is mixed with immortalized human cancer cells and the mixture is injected subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice. A human tumor usually forms in two to four weeks. This model system allows a researcher to test an anti-cancer compound in a surrogate host.|$|E
50|$|Myogel is a human-based {{extracellular}} matrix used {{mainly in the}} cancer research field to provide 3D cell culture environment for cancer cells. Unlike <b>Matrigel,</b> originated from mice sarcoma, and other synthesized matrices, myogel is extracted from human benign tumor tissue “leiomyoma”.Myogel was developed in Professor Tuula Salo's lab at the University of Oulu/Finland. The idea started by culturing cancer cells on myoma discs (Nurmenniemi et al., 2009). Later on, these myoma tissues were processed (following <b>Matrigel</b> receipt) to extract a gel form called Myogel (Salo et al., 2015).Myogel was compared with <b>Matrigel</b> and found to be superior in term of enhancing cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion (Salo et al., 2015).|$|E

50|$|In some {{instances}} researchers may {{prefer to use}} greater volumes of <b>Matrigel</b> to produce thick three-dimensional gels.

50|$|The {{development}} of a protocol involving the directed generation of pancreatic progenitors has been performed on hESCs (human embryonic stem cells). These cells showing immense potential in therapy for metabolic diseases of the pancreas like diabetes, have been programmed to pancreatic progenitors using factors mimicking the developmental cues a developing endoderm would require to form functional pancreatic tissue. hESCs have are grown on <b>matrigel</b> and then allowed to differentiate into endoderm and later defined cells {{under the influence of}} bFGF, EGF, BMP4.|$|E
50|$|Decellularized ECM {{biomaterials}} can {{be further}} processed into a fine powder and then lyophilized (freeze-dried). This powder can then be mixed with collagenase to form an ECM derived hydrogel (self-healing hydrogels). These hydrogels are then used in cell culture to help maintain cell phenotype and increase cell proliferation. Cells cultured on ECM hydrogels maintain their phenotype better than cells cultured on other substrates such as <b>matrigel</b> or type 1 collagen. Though hydrogels {{do not yet have}} direct clinical relevance, they have shown promise as a method of assisting in organ regeneration.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea and}} general {{principle}} behind his technique is described below. Mice were immunized with the oral vaccination and then subjected to tumour challenges by injecting {{them in the}} chest with {{a certain number of}} tumour cells and a <b>Matrigel</b> pre-formed extracellular matrix to hold the tumour cells together. The mice were sacrificed and the endothelium tissue was stained with a fluorescent dye that would aid in the quantification of tumour neovascularisation using a <b>Matrigel</b> assay. There was found to be {{a significant difference between the}} control and test groups, whereby mice given the vaccine had less angiogenesis from the tumour challenge than the control mice that were not given any of the vaccine prior to tumour challenge. In vitro assays and other tests were also performed to validate the idea of the occurrence of an actual immune response to support what they observed in the mice. For example, the spleen on the challenged mice were isolated and measured for the presence of any cytokines, and specifically activated immune cell groups that would indicative that a specific immune response did occur upon vaccination. The isolated CTLs specific for the survivin protein after vaccination of the mice were used in cytoxicity assays where mice tumour cells expressing survivin were shown to be killed upon incubation with the specific CTLs.|$|E
5000|$|One {{study showed}} that mice with a genetic {{deletion}} of the αvβ3 integrin showed accelerated tumor growth and that when tumstatin was replaced into the system, the tumor growth was disrupted and the tumor shrunk. [...] It {{has also been shown}} that tumstatin has antiangiogenic properties in prostate cancer cells (PCa). PCa was introduced onto a <b>Matrigel</b> and treated with tumstatin, and the formation of new blood vessels as seen in the control did not occur with tumstatin. [...] These studies suggest that tumstatin may be a viable treatment for many types of cancer, including but not limited to melanoma and prostate cancer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{neurotrophic}} electrode is an intracortical device {{designed to}} read the electrical signals that the brain uses to process information. It consists of a small, hollow glass cone attached to several electrically conductive gold wires. The term neurotrophic means [...] "relating to the nutrition and maintenance of nerve tissue" [...] and the device gets {{its name from the}} fact that it is coated with <b>Matrigel</b> and nerve growth factor to encourage the expansion of neurites through its tip. It was invented by neurologist Dr. Philip Kennedy and was successfully implanted for the first time in a human patient in 1996 by neurosurgeon Roy Bakay.|$|E
50|$|To make an organoid, an embryoid (tissue {{that has}} some {{embryonic}} features) grown from natural stem cells is used. Embryos have three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. Each turns into various body parts. The nervous system grows from the ectoderm (which also contributes dental enamel and the epidermis). Ectodermal cells were placed into gel droplets and floated in a nutrient broth in a rotating bioreactor, which supported cell growth without forming by the container. After ten days the organoid developed neurons. After 30 days it displayed regions similar to parts of brains. Lacking a blood supply, cerebral organoids reach about 4 mm across and can last a year or more. The general procedure {{can be broken down}} into 5 steps. First human pluripotent stem cells are cultured. They are then allowed to cultivate into an embryoid body. Next the cell culture is induced to form a neuroectoderm. The neuroectoderm is then grown in a <b>matrigel</b> droplet. The <b>matrigel</b> provides nutrients and the neuroectoderm starts to proliferate and grow. However, the lack of vasculature limits the size the organoid can grow. This has been the major limitation in organoid development, however new methods using a spinning bioreactor have allowed an increase in the availability of nutrients to cells inside the organoid. This last step has been the key breakthrough in organoid development. Spinning bioreactors have been used increasingly in cell culture and tissue growth applications. The reactor is able to deliver faster cell doubling times, increased cell expansion and increased extra-cellular matrix components when compared to statically cultured cells.|$|E
50|$|Organoid {{formation}} generally requires culturing {{the stem}} cells or progenitor cells in a 3D media. The 3D media can be made using an extracellular matrix hydrogel <b>Matrigel,</b> which is a laminin-rich extracellular matrix that is secreted by the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor line. Organoid bodies can then be made through embedding stem cells in the 3D media. When pluripotent stem cells are used {{for the creation of}} the organoid, the cells are usually, but not all the time, allowed to form embryoid bodies. Those embryoid bodies are then pharmacologically treated with patterning factors to drive the formation of the desired organoid identity. Organoids have also been created using adult stem cells extracted from the target organ, and cultured in 3D media.|$|E
50|$|One of the resounding {{arguments}} against {{the validity of}} in vitro results of cell culture on 2D plastic plates is that the environment does not accurately reflect that of the cells in the organism. This problem is being dealt with by developing 3D cell cultures using {{a wide variety of}} substrates as the scaffolds or environments for the cells. In this kind of setting the expression of ECM genes has the potential to more closely resemble that of the native expression profile. 3D scaffolds, the structures on which the cultured cells grow, can be composed of other cells, i.e. cocultures, synthetic polymers mimicking the cells natural environment or purified ECM such as <b>matrigel,</b> and any mixture of these three components.|$|E
5000|$|Compared to CAOV-3 human {{ovarian cancer}} cells, SKOV-3 and CAOV-3 human ovarian cancer cells over express BLT4 receptors, LTB4 and 12-HETE {{metabolizing}} enzymes, two key metabolites of these enzymes, LTB4 and 12-HETE, and activated STAT3 also {{are far more}} invasive in animal models. Inhibition of BLT2 receptors by LY255283 but not of BLT1 receptors by U75302 and suppression of BLT2 receptors by siRNA treatment reduced the expression of NOX4 (i.e. NADPH oxidase 4, the reactive oxygen species made by this enzyme, activated STAT3, the invasion-promoting enzyme, MMP 2, and the in vitro invasiveness (<b>Matrigel</b> invasion assay) of SKOV-3 and CAOV-3 cells. LY255283 also inhibited the peritoneum metastasis of intra-peritoneal injected SKOV-3 cells in athymic mice. [...] These studies indicate that the stimulation of BLT4 receptors by LTB4 and/or 12-HETE operate through a NOX4-reactive oxygen species-STAT-3-MMP2 pathway to promote the metastasis of SKOV-3 and CAOV-3 cancer cells in mice and may act similarly to promote metastases in human ovarian cancer.|$|E
50|$|LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE {{stimulate the}} invasivenes in an in vitro <b>Matrigel</b> {{invasion}} assay of highly malignant human 253 J-BV unirnary bladder cancer cell; their activity in this assay is completely inhibited by an pharmacological inhibition or siRNA knockdown of BLT2 receptors. The expression of 5-lipoxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, 12-lipoxygenase (enzymes synthesizing LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE, respectively) as wells as LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE were substantially elevated in these cells. Pretreatment of these cells with an inhibitor of BLT2 receptos, reduced their tumor forming ability after injection into mice; intraperetoneal injections of LY255283 into the mice also decreased the metastasis-forming {{ability of the}} cells after injection in the urinary bladder. Finally, BLT2 receptor protein was over expressed by the malignant tissues of human urinary bladder cancer and this expression was positively associated with the severity of this cancer. The action of BLT2 receptors, similar to their actions on prostate cancer cells, appeared to involve the receptors activation of the NOX, reactive species of oxygen, NK-κB pathway. These results suggest that BLT2 receptors contribute to the aggressiveness and progression of human urinary bladder cancer.|$|E
50|$|While Perlecan {{suppression}} causes substantial {{inhibition of}} tumor growth and neovascularization in null mice, in contrast, when perlecan-null cells are injected into nude mice enhanced tumor growth is observed {{when compared to}} controls.Cancer progression and pathogenesis is intimately linked to extracellular matrix composition {{and the role of}} perlecan and other ECM molecules in cancer is being studied by a large number of laboratories. Since the basement membrane is the first obstacle in the way of extravasating carcinoma cells, the functions of perlecan in this process are multiple. One model system used to study perlecan expression in carcinoma cell lines is that of the MeWo/70W melanoma metastatic progression cell lines. MeWo cells are characteristically less invasive than their clonal variant cell line 70W. One lab studied perlecan expression in 27 invasive melanomas and 26 of the 27 samples showed a significant increase in perlecan message when compared to normal tissue from the same patients. They then used the MeWo and 70W cell lines to study if perlecan expression changed during treatment with neurotrophins, which can stimulate cell invasion through <b>matrigel</b> in vitro. The more invasive 70W cells began expressing perlecan message ten minutes after stimulation with the neurotrophins, and the MeWo cells did not produce any pln message regardless of treatment. This study took special note of the fact that perlecan upregulation occurred even before that of heparanase, an essential protein involved in the process of extravasation.|$|E
5000|$|Compared to non-malignant IMR-90 and immortalizeed but non-malignant MCF-10A human {{breast cancer}} cell lines, MCF-7, ZR-75-1, T47-D, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cell lines (see list {{of breast cancer}} cell lines) overexpress BLT2 mRNA and protein but show {{relatively}} little expression of BLT1 mRNA; treatment of the malignant but not non-malignant cells with a BLT2 antagonist, LY255283, but not a BLT1 antagonist, U75302, blocked proliferation of the cells in culture. LY255283 concurrently caused apoptosis in estrogen receptor negative MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453 but not estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 and T47-D malignant cells. Since LY255283 also inhibits the BLT1 receptor, the apoptosis-inhibiting action of BLT2 receptors was also demonstrated by showing that siRNA-induced transient Gene knockdown of BLT2 receptors caused appotosis in the MDA-MB-468 cell line. BLT2 receptors link to the activation of thee NADPH oxidase, NOX1 (a synthesizer of the Superoxide anion which is a reactive oxygen species that, when inappropriately overproduced, causes cell death and tissue injury); the attendant increased production of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF-κB appeared responsible for these BLT-2 receptor dependent effects. [...] Lipopolysaccharide (i.e. endotoxin) stimulates MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells to increase their invasiveness as determined with in vitro <b>Matrigel</b> Invasion Chamber assays; this effect appears due to the its ability to induce the overexpression of BLT2 receptors, the enzymes which produce LTB4 and 12(S)-HETEs, and the key metabolites of these enzymes, LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE; furthermore, the latter the binding of the latter metabolites to cells overexpressed BLT2 receptors leads to the activation of NF-κB. [...] These {{results indicate that the}} 12-HETE/BLT2 interaction reduces the survival of cultured human breast cells by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species and the activation of NF-κB.|$|E
5000|$|Primary hepatocytes are {{commonly}} used in cell biological and biopharmaceutical research. In vitro model systems based on hepatocytes have been of great help {{to better understand the}} role of hepatocytes in (patho)physiological processes of the liver. In addition, pharmaceutical industry has heavily relied on the use of hepatocytes in suspension or culture to explore mechanisms of drug metabolism and even predict in vivo drug metabolism. For these purposes, hepatocytes are usually isolated from animal or human [...] whole liver or liver tissue by collagenase digestion, which is a two-step process. In the first step, the liver is placed in an isotonic solution, in which calcium is removed to disrupt cell-cell tight junctions by the use of a calcium chelating agent. Next, a solution containing collagenase is added to separate the hepatocytes from the liver stroma. This process creates a suspension of hepatocytes, which can be seeded in multi-well plates and cultured for many days or even weeks. For optimal results, culture plates should first be coated with an extracellular matrix (e.g. collagen, <b>Matrigel)</b> to promote hepatocyte attachment (typically within 1-3 hr after seeding) and maintenance of the hepatic phenotype. In addition, and overlay with an additional layer of extracellular matrix is often performed to establish a sandwich culture of hepatocytes. The application of a sandwich configuration supports prolonged maintenance of hepatocytes in culture. Freshly-isolated hepatocytes that are not used immediately can be cryopreserved and stored. They do not proliferate in culture. Hepatocytes are intensely sensitive to damage during the cycles of cryopreservation including freezing and thawing. Even after the addition of classical cryoprotectants there is still damage done while being cryopreserved. Nevertheless, recent cryopreservation and resuscitation protocols support application of cryopreserved hepatocytes for most biopharmaceutical applications.|$|E
5000|$|To resume, {{stem cells}} and {{delivery}} routes aforementioned {{are suitable for}} cardiomyoplasty as demonstrated safe {{with some degree of}} benefit for the patient. However, cardiac remodling remains limited due to limited cell residency, impact of mechanical forces onto cell survival and tissue hypoxia. Furthermore, lack of cellular electrochemical coupling can lead to arrhythmias. Another point of consideration concerns the use of embryonic stem cells, whereby indifferentiation yields uncontrolled proliferation and possible consequent formation of teratomas. Also iPSCs have been associated with viral infection and eventual oncogenicity. Cardiac tissue engineering is a new technology based on the use of combinations of cells with regenerative capacity, biological and/or synthetic materials, cell signaling agents to induce the regeneration of an organ or damaged tissue. In an ideal scenario, regenerated tissue would reproduce sophisticated asymmetric helicodoidal architecture of the myocardium with the production of specialized extracellilar matrix to stimulate vascularization in the implanted tissue. From a cellular perspective, available techniques are monolayer cell construct onto temperature-sensitive polymer, where their detachment is driven by behavior of the mechanical properties of the synthetic support without the need of any enzymatic digestion such as trypsin. Cardiomyocites sheets have also been successfully implanted with an observed contractile function as a result of inter-cellular communication between the host and graft. However, from a practical point of view, such approach lacks of translational character as all studies share the lack of reproducibility, i.e. a construct of similar characteristics of the native tissue does not guarantee the same results. Another approach resides in the use of hydrogels. Natural hydrogels such as <b>Matrigel,</b> collagen and fibrin have been used as entrapement matrices, wherein the cells to be injected are embedded. However the associated high pressure of injection is associated with a high mortality rate for the cells thereby negatively impacting the benefit ratio of this approach. Furthermore, from a technical point of view, due to the polydispersite of these natural hydrogels, purification is a requisite but very difficult step. Synthetic hydrogels, such as polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, polylactic acid-co-glycolic acid, polycaprolactone, polyacrilamide and polyurethane have been proposed. Metalloproteinase-sensitive polyethylene is of particular interest. Indeed, this polymer modulates its mechanical and biophysical properties accordingly to enzymatic activities associated with cardiomyogenic differentiation of implanted cells. To date, no hydrogel matrix is FDA-approved for stem cell therapy use despite a large number of biomaterials currently commercially available. [...] A general comment on hydrogel based technologies: Natural hydrogel are well-tolerated by the host and cells due to their mimicking the natural ECM in terms of backbone and microstructure. However they suffer from batch to batch variation (a drawback for current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) required for clinical application), high degradation rates, and poor tenability. Synthetic hydrogels are reproducible, tunable and amenable regulatory and manufacturing protocols. Their chemical modification permits the integration of cellular attachment sites and a certain control over degradation rates. Semi-synthetic hydrogels share characteristics of both classes. Indeed, they permit either the modification of the purified natural biopolymers or by coupling the synthetic component with integrin and/or growth factor binding sites.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{invasive}} {{potential of}} cancer cells is usually assessed in vitro using <b>Matrigel</b> {{as a surrogate}} basement membrane. Yet cancer cell interaction with collagen I matrices is critical, particularly for the peritoneal metastatic route undertaken by several cancer types including ovarian. Matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity is important to enable cells to overcome the barrier constraints imposed by basement membranes and stromal matrices in vivo. Our objective was to compare matrices reconstituted from collagen I and <b>Matrigel</b> as representative barriers for ovarian cancer cell invasion. Methods The requirement of MMP activity for ovarian cancer cell penetration of <b>Matrigel</b> and collagen matrices was assessed in 2 D transwell and 3 D spheroid culture systems. Results The broad range MMP inhibitor GM 6001 completely prevented cell perforation of polymerised collagen I-coated transwell membranes. In contrast, GM 6001 decreased ES- 2 cell penetration of <b>Matrigel</b> by only ~ 30 % and {{had no effect on}} HEY cell <b>Matrigel</b> penetration. In 3 D culture, ovarian cancer cells grown as spheroids also migrated into surrounding <b>Matrigel</b> matrices despite MMP blockade. In contrast, MMP activity was required for invasion into 3 D matrices of collagen I reconstituted from acid-soluble rat-tail collagen I, but not from pepsin-extracted collagen I (Vitrogen/Purecol), which lacks telopeptide regions. Conclusion <b>Matrigel</b> does not form representative barriers to ovarian cancer cells in either 2 D or 3 D culture systems. Our findings support the use of collagen I rather than <b>Matrigel</b> as a matrix barrier for invasion studies to better approximate critical interactions and events associated with peritoneal metastasis. </p...|$|E
