40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{address the}} problem of {{determining}} all sets which form <b>minimal</b> <b>covers</b> of maximal cliques for interval graphs. We produce an algorithm enumerating all <b>minimal</b> <b>covers</b> using the ⊂-minimal elements of the interval order, as well as an independence Metropolis sampler. We characterize maximal removable sets, which are the complements of <b>minimal</b> <b>covers,</b> and produce a distinct algorithm to enumerate them. We use this last characterization to provide bounds on the maximum number of <b>minimal</b> <b>covers</b> for an interval order with a given number of maximal cliques, and present some simulation results on the number of <b>minimal</b> <b>covers</b> in different settings...|$|R
40|$|An {{independence}} {{system is}} a family I of subsets of a ground set V with the property that any subset of any member of I also belongs to I. The inclusion-minimal sets not in I are called <b>minimal</b> <b>covers.</b> We prove several complexity results related to computation, enumeration, and counting of the <b>minimal</b> <b>covers</b> of an independence system. Our motivation to study these problems is their importance in the solution of resource- constrained scheduling problems. There the <b>minimal</b> <b>covers</b> correspond to <b>minimal</b> subsets of jobs that must not be scheduled simultaneously, so-called minimal forbidden sets. In this context, <b>minimal</b> <b>covers</b> are the <b>minimal</b> infeasible 0 / 1 -solutions of a linear inequality system. We propose and analyze a simple backtracking algorithm that generates a complete representation of all <b>minimal</b> <b>covers</b> of the independence system induced by a linear inequality system. The practical performance of this algorithm is evaluated {{on the basis of}} instances from the project scheduling library PSPLIB. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} general method for {{constructing}} a <b>minimal</b> <b>cover</b> of high-dimensional chaotic attractors by embedded coherent structures, such as (but not limited to) periodic orbits.
