Mandatory retransmission consent gave broadcasters the ability to seek compensation from distributors and established the basis for carriage disputes going forward. At first, the larger broadcasters negotiated not for higher fees, but for inclusion of their newer, lesser known, non-terrestrial channels.

40|$|An {{important}} {{field of application}} of non-smooth optimization refers to decomposition of large-scale or complex problems by Lagrangian duality.

The evaluation of each sub-function requires solving a specific optimization sub-problem, with specific computational complexity. Typically, some sub-functions are hard to evaluate, while others are practically straightforward. When applying a bundle method to maximize this type of dual functions, the computational burden of solving sub-problems is preponderant in the whole iterative process.

Here we present advances in several areas of statistical learning that are important for gaining insight from large amounts of data, and ultimately using predictive models to make better decisions. The {{first part of the}} thesis develops methods and theory for constructing interpretable models from association rules. Interpretability is important for decision makers to understand why a prediction is made. First we show how linear mixtures of rules {{can be used to make}} sequential predictions. Then we develop Bayesian Rule Lists, a method for learning small, ordered lists of rules. We apply Bayesian Rule Lists to a large database of patient medical histories and produce a simple, interpretable model that solves an important problem in healthcare, with little sacrifice to accuracy. Finally, we prove a uniform generalization bound for decision lists. In the second part of the thesis we focus on decision making from sales transaction data. We develop models and inference procedures for using transaction data to estimate quantities such as willingness-to-pay and lost sales due to stock unavailability. We develop a copula estimation procedure for <b>making</b> optimal <b>bundle</b> pricing decisions. We then develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for inferring demand and substitution behaviors from transaction data with stockouts. We show how posterior sampling can be used to directly incorporate model uncertainty into the decisions that will be made using the model. In the third part of the thesis we propose a method for aggregating relevant information from across the Internet to facilitate informed decision making. Our contributions here include an important theoretical result for Bayesian Sets, a popular method for identifying data that are similar to seed examples. We provide a generalization bound that holds for any data distribution, and moreover is independent of the dimensionality of the feature space. This result justifies the use of Bayesian Sets on high-dimensional problems, and also explains its good performance in settings where its underlying independence assumption does not hold. by Benjamin Letham.

40|$|AbstractUsing a ‘metal-first’ approach, we {{computationally}} designed, prepared, and characterized a four-iron four-sulfur (Fe 4 S 4) cluster protein with a non-natural α-helical coiled-coil fold. The {{novelty of}} this fold {{lies in the}} placement of a Fe 4 S 4 cluster within the hydrophobic core of a four-helix <b>bundle,</b> <b>making</b> it unique among previous iron–sulfur (FeS) protein designs, and different from known natural FeS proteins. The apoprotein, recombinantly expressed and purified from E. coli, readily self-assembles with Fe 4 S 4 clusters in vitro. UV–Vis absorption and CD spectroscopy, elemental analysis, gel filtration, and analytical ultracentrifugation confirm that the protein is folded and assembled as designed, namely, α-helical coiled-coil binding a single Fe 4 S 4 cluster. Dithionite-reduced holoprotein samples have characteristic rhombic EPR spectra, typical of low-potential, [Fe 4 S 4]+ (S= 1 / 2), with g values of gz,y=(1. 970, 1. 975), and gx= 2. 053. The temperature, and power dependence of the signal intensity were also characteristic of [Fe 4 S 4]+ clusters with very efficient spin relaxation, but almost without any interaction between adjacent clusters. The new design is very promising although optimization is required, particularly for preventing aggregation, and adding second shell interactions to stabilize the reduced state. Its main advantage is its extendibility into a multi-FeS cluster protein by simply duplicating and translating the binding site along the coiled-coil axis. This opens new possibilities for designing protein-embedded redox chains {{that may be used}} as “wires” for coupling any given set of redox enzymes...|$|R
40|$|When {{processing}} visual objects, we integrate visual, {{linguistic and}} spatial information {{to form an}} episodic trace. Re-activating {{one aspect of the}} episodic trace of an object re-activates the entire <b>bundle</b> <b>making</b> all integrated information available. Using the blank screen paradigm [1], researchers observed that upon processing spoken linguistic input, participants tended to make eye movements on a blank screen, fixating locations that were previously occupied by objects mentioned in the linguistic utterance or were related. Ferreira and colleagues [2] suggested that 'looking at nothing' facilitated memory retrieval. However, this claim lacks convincing empirical support. In Experiment 1, Dutch participants looked at four-object-displays. Three objects were related to a spoken target word. Given the target word 'beker' (beaker), the display featured a phonological (a bear), a shape (a bobbin), a semantic (a fork) competitor, and an unrelated distractor (an umbrella). Participants were asked to name the objects as fast as possible. Subsequently, the objects disappeared. Participants fixated the center of the screen and listened to the target word. They had to carry out a semantic judgment task (indicating in which position an object had appeared that was semantically related to the objects) or a visual shape similarity judgment (indicating the position of the object similar in shape to the target). In both conditions, we observed that participants re-fixated the empty target location before responding. The set-up of Experiment 2 was identical except that we asked participants to maintain fixating the center of the screen while listening to the spoken word and responding. Performance accuracy was significantly lower in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1. The results indicate that memory retrieval for objects is impaired when participants are not allowed to look at relevant, though empty locations. [1] Altmann, G. (2004).
