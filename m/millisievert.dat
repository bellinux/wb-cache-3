5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, {{who met the}} doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found {{that they were not}} radioactive. They then headed to the scrapyard, and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 <b>millisievert</b> per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E

25|$|The workers wore hazmat {{suits and}} hazmat masks, {{carrying}} dosimeters that alerted at 80 millisieverts. Each worker {{had to stop}} the operation once the dosimeter alerted. According to TEPCO, seven TEPCO workers were exposed to radiation over the limit of 100 <b>millisievert</b> by the morning of 20 March.|$|E

This zone contained most of Fukushima Prefecture, southern parts of Miyagi Prefecture, and northern parts of Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures.|$|E
25|$|To assuage fears, the {{government}} enacted {{an order to}} decontaminate over a hundred areas with a level contamination greater than or equivalent to one <b>millisievert</b> of radiation. This is a much lower threshold than is necessary for protecting health. The government also sought to address the lack of education {{on the effects of}} radiation {{and the extent to which}} the average person was exposed.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{results were}} {{obtained}} for a three-month period from September 2011: {{among a group of}} 36,767 residents in Fukushima city, 36,657 had been exposed to less than 1 <b>millisievert,</b> and the average dose was 0.26 millisieverts. For 10 residents, the readings ranged from 1.8 to 2.7 millisieverts, but these values are mostly believed to be related to usage errors (dosimeters left outside or exposed to X-ray luggage screening).|$|E

25|$|On 6 October 2011 a {{government}} panel proposed {{to ease the}} legal restrictions for exposure to radiation in the contaminated areas with radioactive fallout, because in their opinion it would be extremely difficult to limit exposure below the legal limit of 1 <b>millisievert</b> per year. Instead the target should be set between 1 and 20 millisieverts {{in line with the}} recommendations by the International Commission for Radiological Protection. Targets should be lowered in steps as decontamination proceeded. Targets might differ by region and residents should have a voice in setting the targets.|$|E
25|$|Subatomic charged particles, {{primarily}} protons from {{cosmic rays}} and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is {{visible to the}} naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 <b>millisievert</b> each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth. This results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA and chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system, and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.|$|E
25|$|Radioactive {{material}} is found throughout nature. Detectable amounts occur naturally in soil, rocks, water, air, and vegetation, {{from which it}} is inhaled and ingested into the body. In addition to this internal exposure, humans also receive external exposure from radioactive materials that remain outside the body and from cosmic radiation from space. The worldwide average natural dose to humans is about 2.4 <b>millisievert</b> (mSv) per year. This is four times the worldwide average artificial radiation exposure, which in 2008 amounted to about 0.6mSv per year. In some rich countries, like the US and Japan, artificial exposure is, on average, greater than the natural exposure, due to greater access to medical imaging. In Europe, average natural background exposure by country ranges from under 2mSv annually in the United Kingdom to more than 7mSv annually for some groups of people in Finland.|$|E
2500|$|As of August 2011, the {{crippled}} Fukushima nuclear plant is still leaking {{low levels of}} radioactive material and areas surrounding it could remain uninhabitable for decades due to high radiation. It could take [...] "more than 20 years before residents could safely return to areas with current radiation readings of 200 <b>millisieverts</b> per year, and a decade for areas at 100 <b>millisieverts</b> per year".|$|R

2500|$|All {{citizens}} of the town Fukushima received dosimeters to measure the precise dose of radiation {{to which they were}} exposed. After September the city of Fukushima collected the 36,478 [...] "glass badges" [...] of dosimeters from all its citizens for analysis. It turned out that 99 percent had not been exposed to more than 0.3 <b>millisieverts</b> in September 2011, except four young children from one family: a girl, in third year elementary school, had received 1.7 <b>millisieverts,</b> and her three brothers had been exposed to 1.4 to 1.6 <b>millisieverts.</b> Their home was situated near a highly radioactive spot, and after this find the family moved out of Fukushima Prefecture. A city official said that this kind of exposure would not affect their health.|$|R
25|$|On 23 June 2013 {{during a}} meeting with {{evacuees}} from the Miyakoji district of Tamura, Fukushima Prefecture and central government officials, the announcement was made that the residents {{would be allowed to}} return to their homes in mid-August 2013, although the radiation levels in residential areas still ranged between 0.32 and 0.54 microsieverts per hour, much higher than the government's goal of 0.23 microsieverts per hour. However, decontamination efforts in the Miyakoji district were declared completed. When asked, the officials refused to prolong the decontamination efforts, arguing that exposure to radiation would differ for every person. The 0.23 microsievert per hour limit would lead to an accumulated radiation exposure exceeding 1 <b>millisievert</b> for people that would stay outdoors for eight hours a day. Instead the officials offered the evacuees a new type of dosimeter so that they could check their own radiation exposures, and in this way take responsibility for their own safety.|$|E
25|$|Substances {{containing}} {{natural radioactivity}} {{are known as}} NORM (Naturally occurring radioactive material). After human processing that exposes or concentrates this natural radioactivity (such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash), it becomes technologically enhanced {{naturally occurring radioactive material}} (TENORM). A lot of this waste is alpha particle-emitting matter from the decay chains of uranium and thorium. The main source of radiation in the human body is potassium-40 (40K), typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams/day intake. Most rocks, due to their components, have a low level of radioactivity. Usually ranging from 1 <b>millisievert</b> (mSv) to 13mSv annually depending on location, average radiation exposure from natural radioisotopes is 2.0mSv per person a year worldwide. This makes up the majority of typical total dosage (with mean annual exposure from other sources amounting to 0.6mSv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace, 0.4mSv from cosmic rays, 0.005mSv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing, 0.005mSv occupational exposure, 0.002mSv from the Chernobyl disaster, and 0.0002mSv from the nuclear fuel cycle).|$|E
500|$|During {{the inauguration}} of the {{conveyor}} in July 2013 Minister of Water and Irrigation Hazim El-Nasser said that after mixing Disi water radiation is less than 0.5 <b>millisievert</b> per year. The worldwide average natural dose of human’s exposure to radiation is about 2.5-3 <b>millisievert</b> per year. [...] "Disi water is purer than bottled water and I take full responsibility for what I’m saying,” [...] the Minister said during a press conference.|$|E
25|$|Total {{recorded}} doses {{to individual}} workers in Chernobyl recovery operations {{during the period}} through 1990 ranged from less than 10 <b>millisieverts</b> (less than 1 rem) to more than 1 sievert (100 rems), due primarily to external radiation. The average dose is estimated to have been 120 <b>millisieverts</b> (12 rem) and 85% of the recorded doses were between 20 and 500 <b>millisieverts</b> (2 to 50 rems). There are large uncertainties in these individual doses; estimates {{of the size of}} the uncertainty range from 50% to a factor of five and dose records for military personnel are thought to be biased toward high values. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) estimates the total collective dose to the total of about 530,000 recovery operations workers as about 60,000 person-sieverts (6,000,000 person-rem).|$|R
25|$|The {{radioactive}} {{water treatment}} system {{is forced to}} shut down because a filter exceeds its radioactivity limit. The separation unit, which removes caesium from the water, had been expected to last about a month before its cartridge required replacing—at a radiation level of 4 <b>millisieverts</b> per hour. The radiation levels near the filter cartridge replacement valves reach 4.7 <b>millisieverts</b> per hour after just 5 hours of operation, reportedly due to oil and sludge in the water which contained more radioactivity than expected.|$|R
2500|$|In the non-evacuated areas, the {{exposure}} limit for schoolyards {{was raised to}} 20 <b>millisieverts</b> per year. This non-negligible value (less than the 50 <b>millisieverts</b> yearly limit for nuclear workers in many countries) led to a large public reaction, including the resignation of Toshiso Kosako, special adviser on nuclear matters to the Japanese Government.

2500|$|On 4 November 2011 in {{the city}} of Hamamatsu, Goshi Hosono, {{minister}} in charge of the nuclear crisis, made a remark about plans to set up a study regarding the health consequences of radiation levels of about 20 <b>millisieverts</b> per year. Studies done after nuclear accidents in the past suggested that radiation levels of more than 100 <b>millisieverts</b> at once would have negative effects on human health, but negative effects from lower levels were never found. The Japanese government hoped to be able to accept 20 <b>millisieverts</b> per year as below the limit harmful to human health. This exposure limit is recommended by the International Commission for Radiological Protection. Concerning the government project of disposing of debris in areas outside northeastern Japan, Hosono said that rubble from Iwate and Miyagi was not radioactive, burning the rubble was harmless, and the ashes would be disposed of safely. Local governments would be asked for cooperation, with the national government ensuring safety and taking overall responsibility [...]|$|R

25|$|Radiation {{levels on}} the ISS are {{about five times}} greater than those {{experienced}} by airline passengers and crew. Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost {{the same level of}} protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 <b>millisieverts</b> of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 <b>millisieverts</b> per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.|$|R
25|$|The {{next day}} at 7:55a.m. the steam was gone. Because the {{radiation}} levels were too high all work to remove rubble was done by remote control. Operations stopped after the steam was found. According to TEPCO the rain on 17 and 18 July was to blame. On 18 July the actual dosage measurement was 562 <b>millisieverts</b> per hour, therefore the NRA ordered TEPCO to make further investigations. On 23 July at 9:05 the steam was seen again {{coming out of the}} fifth floor just above the reactor containment. The night before a rain shower did hit the building, and water might have reached the - 38C - reactor container lid, or might have reached hot fuel left behind in the reactor vessel. At that moment the ambient temperature was 20.3 C and the humidity was 91.2 percent. All work removing rubble from the place was halted. During the last event, radiation levels were measured at 24 locations around the fifth floor of the reactor building.
