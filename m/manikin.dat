The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a <b>manikin</b> sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws.

Comparison was carried out based on: • tight versus loose clothing; • serial versus parallel calculation model; • even versus uneven clothing (insulation) distribution; • effect of donning clothes. In order to do the comparison and eliminate several uncertainties both <b>manikins</b> were tested at the same lab. The garments with right fit were chosen and the <b>manikins</b> were dressed in a same way. The tests were carried out simultaneously on both <b>manikins</b> at + 5 °C and < 0, 3 m/s, and the same calculation and data control routine was used. There were observed differences between female and male <b>manikins</b> depending on body shape and fit. However, the differences laid within the range that was observed within Subzero project and were comparable with differences within <b>manikins</b> of male body shape <b>Manikins</b> behaved differently to clothing adjustments. Tight clothes allowed less difference. The differences were more pronounced when using serial than parallel calculation method. Effect of donning clothes was more pronounced within serial model.

500|$|Beginning in 1967, the {{advertising}} focused exclusively on Wonderbra brand brassieres. In 1968, Nadler hired Goodis Advertising {{to develop the}} new campaign. The Wonderbra ads were based on fashion and emotional appeal. In various ads, the man would appear as fashion photographer (in a fashion shoot) or fashion buyer (at a fashion show). The storyline suggested an attraction or budding romance between {{the man and the}} women. The voice-over and jingle featured a man's voice and the commercial showed an actual woman's torso naked except for a bra. All other television ads before this era showed brassieres on a <b>manikin</b> or a dressmaker's dummy to promote the functional features of the product. Every Wonderbra advertisement contained versions of the musical theme, [...] "We care about the shape you're in. Wonderful, wonderful, Wonderbra". The 1979 television campaign included a commercial directed by Richard Avedon which won a Silver award for television advertisements shown in Canada.|$|E

500|$|Wishing to {{complement}} her involvement in performance, Simonovich-Efimova began publishing works [...] "to establish puppetry's validity {{as a unique}} discipline" [...] within the visual arts realm. She published books and pamphlets on design and movement, including {{a history of the}} art and descriptions of the contributing puppeteers. One of her best known works, Notes of a Petrushkanist ( [...] , 1925) gives details of her performances and theories, together with drawings and texts of her plays. In 1930, she spoke at the first USSR Soviet Puppet Theaters Conference presenting her ideas on puppetry. She disavowed claims that puppets are lifeless automatons, maintaining that the puppeteer must convince the audience they are alive. The artistry in creating vitality involved an intimate connection between puppet and puppetmaster, a feat she felt could not be achieved in the same way with marionettes. She viewed the connection between <b>manikin</b> and manipulator as symbiotic collaboration: rather than the puppeteer forcing [...] choreography upon the puppet, the doll's limitations helped the puppeteer learn to communicate in new ways. The lack of facial expressions must be compensated by gesture. Unlike an actor who interacts with other performers, the puppet communicates both with the other actors and the puppetmaster himself.|$|E

He said, [...] "Bhandarkar takes us through {{a labyrinth of}} emotions, some devastating in their gut-level directness. But at the end, we come away with a film that gives us something {{to hold on to}} permanently even as the characters on screen lose practically everything worth holding on to". Jha also wrote that the sequences between Chopra and Ranaut as the highlights of the film. Gaurav Malani from The Economic Times rated the film a 3 out of 5, praised Chopra's performance and wrote, [...] "Chopra's character graph [...] skillfully sketched from an aspiring model to an ambitious showstopper to a brash supermodel and subsequently to a faded <b>manikin,</b> desperate to make her comeback. In each phase her character exudes [...] contrasting gamut of emotions". Khalid Mohamed rated Fashion 3 out of 5, called the film a [...] "must-try", and wrote, [...] "Excelling on the catwalk {{as well as in the}} moments of self-destruction, Ranaut’s is the terrific, show-stopping performance". Sonia Chopra of Sify criticised the film's superficial portrayal of the fashion industry and called the film a superficial take on the lives of models and a dumbed-down version of the workings of the fashion industry. However, she praised the performances.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics, although {{with the occasional}} caveat. Variety praised the performances of the entire main cast but felt that the [...] "sordid aspects" [...] of the story prevented the film from achieving the [...] "goal of being pure entertainment." [...] Variety also felt the film was far too long. Stanley Kauffmann, writing for The New Republic, concurred in part with this assessment. Kauffmann strongly praised the principal cast, calling Newman [...] "first-rate" [...] and writing that Scott's was [...] "his most credible performance to date." [...] Laurie, he writes, gives her part [...] "movingly anguished touches" [...] (although he also mildly criticizes her for over-reliance on Method acting). While {{he found that the}} script [...] "strains hard to give an air of menace and criminality to the pool hall" [...] and also declares it [...] "full of pseudo-meaning", Kauffmann lauds Rossen's [...] "sure, economical" [...] direction, especially in regard to Gleason who, he says, does not so much act as [...] " [...] for a number of pictures which are well arranged by Rossen. It is the best use of a <b>manikin</b> by a director since Kazan photographed Burl Ives as Big Daddy." [...] The New York Times, despite finding that the film [...] "strays a bit" [...] and that the romance between Newman and Laurie's characters [...] "seems a mite far-fetched", nonetheless found that The Hustler [...] "speaks powerfully in a universal language that spellbinds and reveals bitter truths." ...|$|E

500|$|The Demi-fiend goes {{in search}} for his friends and faces these groups. Both Chiaki and Isamu are distraught by the Vortex World and decide to move on their own {{rather than relying on}} their friend's power, while Takao realizes she is being used by Hikawa and decides to go on her own quest to create her desired world. To do this, she allies with Aradia, a former deity from the Shadow Vortex. After this point, all the {{supporting}} characters are seeking to ally with a powerful entity from the Shadow Vortex and create their own Reason, a powerful inner philosophy of life {{that can be used to}} mold the new world. To do this, a large quantity of an energy called Magatsuhi is needed, which each character begins hoarding. Hikawa's Shijima Reason wants a world of stillness and conformity in the service of a peaceful world; Chiaki's Yosuga Reason seeks a world where the strong rule supreme and destroy the weak; and Isamu's Musubi Reason wishes for a world where everyone is an individual who can live without reliance on others. Others also attempt to form a Reason, including Futomimi, who wishes to free the world's Manikins from their servitude, and Takao, who wants a world where people value life and have freedom. Both die before they can realize their wishes, and Takao gives the Demi-fiend an artifact that will enable him to remake the world. Hijiri, revealed to be a <b>manikin</b> doomed to reborn and suffer repeatedly for an unspecified [...] "sin" [...] against the Great Will, also attempts to gather enough Magatsuhi to remake the world, but is thwarted and sacrificed by Isamu to create his own Reason. Additionally, the Demi-fiend can fulfill a request from Lucifer to collect eight Candelabra from Fiends.|$|E

2500|$|Upon its {{theatrical}} {{release in}} the United States, critics generally responded with enthusiasm to Bava's film, {{many of whom}} recognized the director as a potential master of the horror genre. Variety noted, [...] "There is sufficient cinematography ingenuity and production flair [...] to keep an audience pleasantly unnerved." [...] Time said the film was [...] "a piece of fine Italian handiwork that atones for its ludicrous lapses with brilliant intuitions of the spectral." [...] The Motion Picture Herald stated that [...] "A classic quality permeates this gruesome, shocking, horrifying story of a vengeful, bloodthirsty vampire." [...] Castle of Frankenstein described the film as [...] "one of the best horror thrillers of recent years." [...] David Pirie, in The Time Out Film Guide, called the movie, [...] "A classic horror film [...] The exquisitely realized expressionist images of cruelty and sexual suggestion shocked audiences in the early '60s and occasioned a long-standing ban by the British censor. The visual style still impresses..." [...] Carlos Clarens felt that [...] "the quality of the visual narrative was superb—the best black-and-white photography to enhance a horror movie {{in the past two}} decades. Bava also showed himself as a director of a certain promise..." [...] Eugene Archer in The New York Times, however, hated the film, noting that [...] "Barbara Steele, a blank-eyed <b>manikin</b> with an earthbound figure and a voice from outer space, is appropriately cast as a vampire: not the Theda Bara kind, but the genuine blood-drinking variety. Mario Bava, ostensibly the director of this nonsense, allows this female Bela Lugosi to quench her thirst four times before she burns, screaming, at the stake [...] As a setting for unadulterated horror, it will leave its audiences yearning for that quiet, sunny little motel in Psycho." [...] Ivan Butler opined that the film [...] "appears to offer horror, beauty and the ludicrous in about equal proportions." ...|$|E

Background. Investment in simulated learning environments has increased at an unprecedented pace. One of the driving forces is the potential for simulation experiences to improve students’ learning and engagement. A cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to inform decisions related to investment in and use of simulation equipment. Method.
