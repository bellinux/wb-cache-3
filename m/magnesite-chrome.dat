40|$|Abstract. Unfired {{specimens}} {{were made}} with different aluninum content (0, 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 %) respectively,using high pure magnesia, magnesia-spinel and Aluninum as the main raw material. Unfired specimens were treated under the condition: 110 ℃× 24 h drying,then 300 ℃× 6 h heating treatment. The properties and microstructure of the specimens were analyzed to investigate the reaction mechanism of these speciments and RH refinery slag. The result are shown that the addition of aluninum improves cold crushing strength of specimens,reaching to 63 Mpa. The specimen with aluninum content of 8 % shown the best slag resistance. The reaction mechanism between aluninum-magnesia-spinel complosite material and RH slag is different from <b>magnesite-chrome</b> brick. The major penetration element is Ca, and the Ca elment penetrated into the matrix reacts with corundum turning out a CA 2 protective layer which can stop penetrating of slag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{reaction}} mechanisms occurring when MgO-MgR 2 O 3 refractories {{are exposed}} to SO 2 -containing gas atmospheres were examined. The study examined the characteristic structures of <b>magnesite-chrome,</b> chrome-magnesite and magnesite refractories exposed to SO 2 -O 2 gas mixture at temperatures of 700 °C to 1350 °C. The phase characterization was conducted with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The {{results show that the}} physical characteristics of the refractory matrix along the grain boundaries are important refractory features during chemical attack from SO 2 -containing gas. Upon heating in SO 2 -containing gas, the changes in phase-chemical compositions and accompanying grain growth causes loosening of the structure and the pore volume promotes gas diffusion. The chemical reactions that occur form stable sulfate compounds identified as MgSO 4, CaSO 4 and CaMg 3 (SO 4) 4, and lead to disintegration of various phase structures and consequently erosion of the refractory. In conclusion, the reaction mechanisms in MgO-MgR 2 O 3 refractories exposed to SO 2 -containing gases progress through a combination of structural disintegration and chemical attack...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} reaction mechanisms, when unused chrome-magnesite, <b>magnesite-chrome</b> and magnesite refractories {{are exposed}} to sulfur-bearing gas mixtures of SO 2 -O 2, SO 2 -N 2 and SO 2 at 700 °C to 1350 °C, were investigated. The investigations comprised chemical analyses, thermodynamic analyses and microstructural examination. The extent of the conversion reactions was measured {{as a function of}} temperature and reaction time. Six basic refractories were investigated and characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) methods. The microstructural examination indicated that physical changes in the original microstructure of the refractory could possibly influence the reactions with sulfur-bearing gases and the chemical analyses of the product phases confirmed the formation of secondary sulfates within pores, along grain boundaries and cracks. The structural features in the original refractory were determined by technological processes employed during original firing in production. The factors attributed to the principal physical changes of the original microstructure were related to the diffusion processes, which affected the phase distribution, pore size distribution and grain size. The fundamental reactions involved in the pore size distribution and microstructure were attributed to the differential diffusion mechanism of individual components that resulted in the development of magnesia spinels. The effects on the microstructure demonstrated that the reactions were limited to the grain boundary region due to the product layer formed as the reactions progressed. The chemical product analyses indicated that in the sulfates formed, the sulfation reactions were significantly affected by the equilibrium thermodynamics of the oxygen and sulfur dioxide gas combination in the products of 1 / 2 SO 2 O 2 P P. The phase changes led to the dissolution of the refractory components and crystallization of MgO and CaO. This influenced the permeability of the sulfur-bearing gases that reacted to form MgSO 4 and CaSO 4 found as grain boundary and pore space fillings. Resistance to sulfur-bearing gas infiltration and sulfation in fine-grained direct bonded refractories were found to be better than that of the coarse-grained direct bonded refractories. The decreased sulfation of the fine-grained refractory was related to the restricted diffusion processes due to the stable magnesia spinel phases and retention of the closed pore structure at different temperatures. However, the dissolution and crystallization mechanism described in sulfation, demonstrated that MgSO 4, CaSO 4, CaMg 3 (SO 4) 3 and compound mixtures of sulfate, silica, magnesia and sesquioxides (Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3) were formed along the grain boundaries...|$|E
