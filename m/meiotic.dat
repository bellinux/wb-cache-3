5|$|Consequences of {{selection}} can include <b>meiotic</b> drive (unequal transmission of certain alleles), nonrandom mating and genetic hitchhiking.|$|E
5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo <b>meiotic</b> sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the process}} of <b>meiotic</b> cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form <b>meiotic</b> spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E
25|$|Males do {{not show}} <b>meiotic</b> recombination, facilitating genetic studies.|$|E
25|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} {{exhibit a}} range of reproductive modes, including sexuality (amphimixis), facultative sexuality, <b>meiotic</b> parthenogenesis (automixis) and mitotic parthenogenesis (apomixis).|$|E
25|$|Amon's {{research}} has investigated how cells control and organize the segregation of their chromosomes during cell division. More specifically, her research examines {{the regulation of}} exit from mitosis, the regulation of the <b>meiotic</b> cell cycle, and effects of aneuploidy on normal physiology and tumorigenesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{nematode}} model species Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae exhibit androdioecy, {{which is}} very rare among animals. The single genus Meloidogyne (root-knot nematodes) exhibit a range of reproductive modes, including sexual reproduction, facultative sexuality (in which most, but not all, generations reproduce asexually), and both <b>meiotic</b> and mitotic parthenogenesis.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>meiotic</b> {{metaphase}} I, the cytoskeleton put the bivalents under tension {{by pulling}} each homolog in opposite direction (contrary to mitotic division where the forces are exerted on each chromatid). The anchorage of the cytoskeleton to the chromosomes {{takes place at}} the centromere thanks to a protein complex called kinetochore. This tension results in the alignment of the bivalent {{at the center of the}} cell, the chiasmata and the distal cohesion of the sister chromatids being the anchor point sustaining the force exerted on the whole structure. Impressively, human female primary oocytes remains in this tension state for decades (from the establishment of the oocyte in metaphase I during embryonic development, to the ovulation event in adulthood that resume the <b>meiotic</b> division), highlighting the robustness of the chiasma and the cohesion that hold the bivalents together.|$|E
25|$|Trisomy 18 (47,XX,+18) {{is caused}} by a <b>meiotic</b> {{nondisjunction}} event. With nondisjunction, a gamete (i.e., a sperm or egg cell) is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 18; the gamete thus has 24 chromosomes. When combined with a normal gamete from the other parent, the embryo has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 18.|$|E
25|$|Upon penetration, the oocyte {{is said to}} {{have become}} activated. It {{undergoes}} its secondary <b>meiotic</b> division, and the two haploid nuclei (paternal and maternal) fuse to form a zygote. In order to prevent polyspermy and minimise the possibility of producing a triploid zygote, several changes to the egg's zona pellucida renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg.|$|E
25|$|In {{a process}} called microsporogenesis, four haploid microspores are {{produced}} from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or meiocyte), after <b>meiotic</b> division. After {{the formation of the}} four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis <b>meiotic</b> steps I and II are completed prior to cytokinesis, whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the monocots is successive, but there are important exceptions.|$|E
25|$|In angiosperms, during flower {{development}} the anther {{is composed}} of a mass of cells that appear undifferentiated, except for a partially differentiated dermis. As the flower develops, four groups of sporogenous cells form within the anther. The fertile sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile cells that grow into {{the wall of the}} pollen sac. Some of the cells grow into nutritive cells that supply nutrition for the microspores that form by <b>meiotic</b> division from the sporogenous cells.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of cases where monosomy occurs, the X chromosome comes from the mother. This may be due to a nondisjunction in the father. <b>Meiotic</b> errors that lead to the production of X with p arm deletions or abnormal Y chromosomes are also mostly found in the father. Isochromosome X or ring chromosome X on the other hand are formed equally often by both parents. Overall, the functional X chromosome usually comes from the mother.|$|E
25|$|Infertility {{is often}} {{described}} as a characteristic of A-T. Whereas this is certainly the case for the mouse model of A-T, in humans it may be more accurate to characterize the reproductive abnormality as gonadal atrophy or dysgenesis characterized by delayed pubertal development. Because programmed DSBs are generated to initiate genetic recombinations involved in the production of sperm and eggs in reproductive organs (a process known as meiosis), <b>meiotic</b> defects and arrest can occur when ATM is not present.|$|E
25|$|The cohesin {{complex is}} {{responsible}} for keeping together sister chromatids and provides binding sites for spindle attachment. Cohesin is loaded onto newly replicated chromosomes in oogonia during fetal development. Mature oocytes have only limited capacity for reloading cohesin after completion of S phase. The prolonged arrest of human oocytes prior to completion of meiosis I may therefore result in considerable loss of cohesin over time. Loss of cohesin is assumed to contribute to incorrect microtubule-kinetochore attachment and chromosome segregation errors during <b>meiotic</b> divisions.|$|E
25|$|Giardia {{had been}} {{assumed to be}} primitively asexual and with no means of {{transferring}} DNA between nuclei. These assumptions made {{it very difficult to}} explain the remarkably low level of allelic heterozygosity (< 0.01%) in the genome isolate, WB. However, all those assumptions of asexuality are now in doubt, with population genetics providing evidence for recombination and the identification of <b>meiotic</b> genes, evidence for recombination among isolates and the evidence for exchange of genetic material between nuclei during the process of encystation.|$|E
25|$|However, outcrossing may be {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} parthenogenesis or selfing (which retain the advantage of <b>meiotic</b> recombinational repair) under conditions in which the costs of mating are very high. For instance, costs of mating are high when individuals are rare in a geographic area, such as when {{there has been a}} forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones to arrive. At such times mates are hard to find, and this favors parthenogenic species.|$|E
25|$|Diploidy {{might be}} {{restored}} by the {{doubling of the}} chromosomes without cell division before meiosis begins or after meiosis is completed. This {{is referred to as}} an endomitotic cycle. This may also happen by the fusion of the first two blastomeres. Other species restore their ploidy by the fusion of the <b>meiotic</b> products. The chromosomes may not separate at one of the two anaphases (called restitutional meiosis), or the nuclei produced may fuse or one of the polar bodies may fuse with the egg cell at some stage during its maturation.|$|E
25|$|While {{recombination}} of chromosomes is {{an essential}} process during meiosis, {{there is a large}} range of frequency of cross overs across organisms and within species. Sexually dimorphic rates of recombination are termed heterochiasmy, and are observed more often than a common rate between male and females. In mammals, females often have a higher rate of recombination compared to males. It is theorised that there are unique selections acting or <b>meiotic</b> drivers which influence the difference in rates. The difference in rates may also reflect the vastly different environments and conditions of meiosis in oogenesis and spermatogenesis.|$|E
25|$|A healthy egg and/or {{sperm cell}} {{contains}} individual chromosomes, {{each of which}} contributes to the 23 pairs of chromosomes needed to form a normal cell with a typical human karyotype of 46 chromosomes. Numerical errors can arise at {{either of the two}} <b>meiotic</b> divisions and cause the failure of a chromosome to segregate into the daughter cells (nondisjunction). This results in an extra chromosome, making the haploid number 24 rather than 23. Fertilization of eggs or insemination by sperm that contain an extra chromosome results in trisomy, or three copies of a chromosome rather than two.|$|E
25|$|For these transformations {{to lead to}} the {{eukaryotic}} cell cycle, the VE hypothesis specifies a pox-like virus as the lysogenic virus. A pox-like virus is a likely ancestor because of its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic nuclei. These include a double stranded DNA genome, a linear chromosome with short telomeric repeats, a complex membrane bound capsid, the ability to produce capped mRNA, and the ability to export the capped mRNA across the viral membrane into the cytoplasm. The presence of a lysogenic pox-like virus ancestor explains the development of <b>meiotic</b> division, an essential component of sexual reproduction.|$|E
25|$|By this time, the oocyte has {{completed}} meiosis I, yielding two cells: the larger secondary oocyte that contains {{all of the}} cytoplasmic material and a smaller, inactive first polar body. Meiosis II follows at once but will be arrested in the metaphase and will so remain until fertilization. The spindle apparatus of the second <b>meiotic</b> division appears {{at the time of}} ovulation. If no fertilization occurs, the oocyte will degenerate between 12 and 24 hours after ovulation. Approximately 1-2% of ovulations release more than one oocyte. This tendency increases with maternal age. Fertilization of two different oocytes by two different spermatozoa results in fraternal twins.|$|E
25|$|In this XX/XO sex {{determination}} system, gene expression on the X chromosome is equalized by downregulating expression of genes on both X chromosomes of hermaphroditic XX organisms by half. In these XX organisms, the dosage compensation complex (DCC) is assembled on both X chromosomes {{to allow for}} this tightly regulated change in transcription levels. The DCC is often compared to the condensin complex, which is conserved across the mitotic and <b>meiotic</b> processes of many species. This complex {{is crucial to the}} condensation and segregation of chromosomes during both meiosis and mitosis. Because data substantiates the theory that dosage compensation in other species is caused by chromatin-wide modifications, many theorize that the DCC in particular functions similar to the condensin complex in its ability to condense or remodel the chromatin of the X chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Two {{differences}} between these two groups (although with exceptions) are: the mode of microsporogenesis and {{the position of the}} ovary. The 'lower Asparagales' typically have simultaneous microsporogenesis (i.e. cell walls develop only after both <b>meiotic</b> divisions), which appears to be an apomorphy within the monocots, whereas the 'core Asparagales' have reverted to successive microsporogenesis (i.e. cell walls develop after each division). The 'lower Asparagales' typically have an inferior ovary, whereas the 'core Asparagales' have reverted to a superior ovary. A 2002 morphological study by Rudall treated possessing an inferior ovary as a synapomorphy of the Asparagales, stating that reversions to a superior ovary in the 'core Asparagales' could be associated with the presence of nectaries below the ovaries. However, Stevens notes that superior ovaries are distributed among the 'lower Asparagales' {{in such a way that}} it is not clear where to place the evolution of different ovary morphologies. The position of the ovary seems a much more flexible character (here and in other angiosperms) than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meiotic</b> {{division}} in the VE hypothesis arose because of the evolutionary pressures placed on the lysogenic virus {{as a result of}} its inability to enter into the lytic cycle. This selective pressure resulted in the development of processes allowing the viruses to spread horizontally throughout the population. The outcome of this selection was cell-to-cell fusion. (This is distinct from the conjugation methods used by bacterial plasmids under evolutionary pressure, with important consequences.) The possibility of this kind of fusion is supported by the presence of fusion proteins in the envelopes of the pox viruses that allow them to fuse with host membranes. These proteins could have been transferred to the cell membrane during viral reproduction, enabling cell-to-cell fusion between the virus host and an uninfected cell. The theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other as uninfected. After the fusion of the two cells, incompatibilities between the two viruses result in a meiotic-like cell division.|$|E
25|$|Triploidy may be {{the result}} of either digyny (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or diandry (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by {{reduplication}} of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) fertilization of the egg. Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one <b>meiotic</b> division during oogenesis leading to a diploid oocyte or failure to extrude one polar body from the oocyte. Diandry appears to predominate among early miscarriages, while digyny predominates among triploid zygotes that survive into the fetal period. However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases <8.5 weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present. There are also two distinct phenotypes in triploid placentas and fetuses that are dependent on the origin of the extra haploid set. In digyny, there is typically an asymmetric poorly grown fetus, with marked adrenal hypoplasia and a very small placenta. In diandry, a partial hydatidiform mole develops. These parent-of-origin effects reflect the effects of genomic imprinting.|$|E
25|$|If, as {{evidence}} indicates, sexual reproduction arose {{very early in}} eukaryotic evolution, the essential features of meiosis may have already been present in the prokaryotic ancestors of eukaryotes. In extant organisms, proteins with central functions in meiosis are similar to key proteins in bacterial transformation. For example, recA recombinase, that catalyses the key functions of DNA homology search and strand exchange in the bacterial sexual process of transformation, has orthologs in eukaryotes that perform similar functions in <b>meiotic</b> recombination (see Wikipedia articles RecA, RAD51 and DMC1). Both bacterial transformation and meiosis in eukaryotic microorganisms are induced by stressful circumstances such as overcrowding, resource depletion and DNA damaging conditions. This suggests that these sexual processes are adaptations for dealing with stress, particularly stress that causes DNA damage. In bacteria, these stresses induce an altered physiologic state, termed competence, that allows active take-up of DNA from a donor bacterium and the integration of this DNA into the recipient genome (see Natural competence) allowing recombinational repair of the recipients’ damaged DNA. If environmental stresses leading to DNA damage were a persistent challenge {{to the survival of}} early microorganisms, then selection would likely have been continuous through the prokaryote to eukaryote transition, and adaptative adjustments would have followed a course in which bacterial transformation naturally gave rise to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|One of the best-recognized {{theories}} {{that leads to}} copy number variations as well as deletions and inversions is non-allelic homologous recombinations. During <b>meiotic</b> recombination, homologous chromosomes pair up and form two ended double-stranded breaks leading to Holliday junctions. However, in the aberrant mechanism, during the formation of Holliday junctions, the double-stranded breaks are misaligned and the crossover lands in non-allelic positions on the same chromosome. When the Holliday junction is resolved, the unequal crossing over event allows transfer of genetic material between the two homologous chromosomes, and as a result, {{a portion of the}} DNA on both the homologues is repeated. Since the repeated regions are no longer segregating independently, the duplicated region of the chromosome is inherited. Another type of homologous recombination based mechanism that can lead to copy number variation is known as break induced replication. When a double stranded break occurs in the genome unexpectedly the cell activates pathways that mediate the repair of the break. Errors in repairing the break, similar to non-allelic homologous recombination, can lead to an increase in copy number of a particular region of the genome. During the repair of a double stranded break, the broken end can invade its homologous chromosome instead of rejoin the original strand. As in the non-allelic homologous recombination mechanism, an extra copy of a particular region is transferred to another chromosome, leading to a duplication event. Furthermore, cohesin proteins are found to aid in the repair system of double stranded breaks through clamping the two ends in close proximity which prevents interchromosomal invasion of the ends. If for any reason, such as activation of ribosomal RNA, cohesin activity is affected then there may be local increase in double stranded break repair errors.|$|E
25|$|One type of non-homologous based {{mechanism}} is the non-homologous end joining or micro-homology end joining mechanism. These mechanisms are {{also involved in}} repairing double stranded breaks but require no homology or limited micro-homology. When these strands are repaired, oftentimes there are small deletions or insertions added into the repaired strand. It is possible that retrotransposons are inserted into the genome through this repair system. If retrotransposons are inserted into a non-allelic position on the chromosome, <b>meiotic</b> recombination can drive the insertion to be recombined into the same strand as an already existing copy of the same region. Another {{mechanism is}} the break-fusion-bridge cycle which involves sister chromatids that have both lost its telomeric region due to double stranded breaks. It is proposed that these sister chromatids will fuse together to form one dicentric chromosome, and then segregate into two different nuclei. Because pulling the dicentric chromosome apart causes a double stranded break, the end regions can fuse to other double stranded breaks and repeat the cycle. The fusion of two sister chromatids can cause inverted duplication and when these events are repeated throughout the cycle, the inverted region will be repeated leading {{to an increase in}} copy number. The last mechanism that can lead to copy number variations is polymerase slippage, which is also known as template switching. During normal DNA replication, the polymerase on the lagging strand is required to unclamp and re-clamp the replication region continuously. When small scale repeats in the DNA sequence exist already, the polymerase can be ‘confused’ when it re-clamps to continue replication and instead of clamping to the correct base pairs, it may shift a few base pairs and replicate a portion of the repeated region again. Note that although this has been experimentally observed and is a widely accepted mechanism, the molecular interactions that led to this error remains unknown. In addition, because this type of mechanism requires the polymerase to jump around the DNA strand and {{it is unlikely that the}} polymerase can re-clamp at another locus some kilobases apart, therefore this is more applicable to short repeats such as bi-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide repeats.|$|E
500|$|In {{the plant}} Arabidopsis thaliana, {{loss of the}} BRCA2 homolog AtBRCA2 causes severe defects in both male meiosis and in the {{development}} of the female gametocyte. [...] AtBRCA2 protein is required for proper localization of the synaptonemal complex protein AtZYP1 and the recombinases AtRAD51 and AtDMC1. [...] Furthermore, AtBRCA2 is required for proper <b>meiotic</b> synapsis. [...] Thus AtBRCA2 is likely important for <b>meiotic</b> recombination. [...] It appears that AtBRCA2 acts during meiosis to control the single-strand invasion steps mediated by AtRAD51 and AtDMC1 occurring during <b>meiotic</b> homologous recombinational repair of DNA damages.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of Dmc1 in {{several species of}} Giardia, {{one of the earliest}} protists to diverge as a eukaryote, suggests that <b>meiotic</b> homologous recombination—and thus meiosis itself—emerged very early in eukaryotic evolution. [...] In addition to research on Dmc1, studies on the Spo11 protein have provided information on the origins of <b>meiotic</b> recombination. Spo11, a type II topoisomerase, can initiate homologous recombination in meiosis by making targeted double-strand breaks in DNA. Phylogenetic trees based on the sequence of genes similar to SPO11 in animals, fungi, plants, protists and archaea have led scientists to believe that the version Spo11 currently in eukaryotes emerged in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and archaea.|$|E
500|$|DMC1 (DNA <b>meiotic</b> {{recombinase}} 1) is a meiosis specific homolog of RAD51 that mediates strand exchange during homologous recombinational repair. [...] DMC1 {{promotes the}} formation of DNA strand invasion products (joint molecules) between homologous DNA molecules. [...] Human DMC1 interacts directly with each {{of a series of}} repeat sequences in the BRCA2 protein (called BRC repeats) that stimulate joint molecule formation by DMC1. [...] BRC repeats conform to a motif consisting of a sequence of about 35 highly conserved amino acids that are present at least once in all BRCA2-like proteins. [...] The BRCA2 BRC repeats stimulate joint molecule formation by promoting the interaction of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with DMC1. [...] The ssDNA complexed with DMC1 can pair with homologous ssDNA from another chromosome during the synapsis stage of meiosis to form a joint molecule, a central step in homologous recombination. Thus the BRC repeat sequences of BRCA2 appear to {{play a key role in}} recombinational repair of DNA damages during <b>meiotic</b> recombination.|$|E
500|$|In 1914, Michael Levine was {{the first}} to report {{successfully}} cultivating C. micaceus from spores in the laboratory. In his experiments, fruit bodies appeared roughly 40 to 60 daysafter initially inoculating the growth media (agar supplemented with soil, horse dung, or cornmeal) with spores. Like other coprinoid species, C.micaceus undergoes synchronous meiosis. The chromosomes are readily discernible with light microscopy, and all of the <b>meiotic</b> stages are well-defined. These features have made the species a useful tool in laboratory investigations of Basidiomycete cytogenetics. [...] The chromosome number of C.micaceus is n=12.|$|E
500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a major}} DNA {{repair process}} in bacteria. [...] It is also important for producing genetic diversity in bacterial populations, although the process differs substantially from <b>meiotic</b> recombination, which repairs DNA damages and brings about diversity in eukaryotic genomes. [...] Homologous recombination has been most studied and is best understood for Escherichia coli. [...] Double-strand DNA breaks in bacteria are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of homologous recombination. [...] Breaks that occur on {{only one of the}} two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of S. cerevisiae bear on the {{adaptive}} function of meiosis and recombination. [...] Mutations defective in genes essential for <b>meiotic</b> and mitotic recombination in S. cerevisiae cause increased sensitivity to radiation or DNA damaging chemicals. [...] For instance, gene rad52 is required for both <b>meiotic</b> recombination and mitotic recombination. [...] Rad52 mutants have increased sensitivity to killing by X-rays, Methyl methanesulfonate and the DNA cross-linking agent 8-methoxypsoralen-plus-UVA, and show reduced <b>meiotic</b> recombination. [...] These findings suggest that recombination repair during meiosis and mitosis is needed for repair of the different damages caused by these agents.|$|E
