5|$|Homer is {{relaxing}} on a Saturday when Marge {{tells him}} {{that he should be}} doing work around the house and yard. Homer overcomes his reluctance and takes Bart to Mom & Pop Hardware to get some equipment. But while there, Homer sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. Homer tries to install the pit, but bungles the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement. He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens, but only makes things worse. In the end, Homer is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement, which angers him. He vents his rage on the construct, <b>mangling</b> it further. Later, Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund, which he does not receive. On the way home, Homer loses control of the wagon containing the jumbled mess of concrete and bricks. It rolls down the highway and crashes into a woman's car, wrecking it. Homer flees the scene of the accident, but the woman tracks him down. It turns out that she is an artist named Astrid Weller (voiced by Isabella Rossellini), and sees Homer's handiwork as being a masterpiece of outsider art. Homer's exhibit goes to the Louvre: American Style museum and when Mr. Burns buys his work, Homer becomes a success.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>mangle</b> (or [...] "wringer"in American English) was {{developed}} in the 19th century — two long rollers in a frame and a crank to revolve them.

25|$|Roy's Top Ten – Roy Bellamy {{performs}} {{this list}} {{on a regular}} basis, and the humor of the segment is multi-faceted. Part of it is derived from Bellamy's sometime <b>mangling</b> of the delivery, part is the often uproarious laughter from Stugotz, but the underlying, veiled theme is that nine of the ten {{on the list is}} Afrocentric in nature, and the number one answer is always Caucasian in nature. Written by Roy and producer Mike Ryan, and previously former producer and co-host Marc Hochman, the list is always subject to being misconstrued by a casual listener as racist, but the show's (and Le Batard's) racial color-blindness allows for a lot of latitude in this regard.|$|E

Although initially reluctant to engage with the play, with several protesters infiltrating the audience to stage a direct protest, the play gradually wins the audience over.

25|$|Recruits are to {{be taught}} the art of {{throwing}} stones both with the hand and sling. The inhabitants of the Balearic Islands {{are said to have}} been the inventors of slings, and to have managed them with surprising dexterity, owing to the manner of bringing up their children. The children were not allowed to have their food by their mothers till they had first struck it with their sling. Soldiers, notwithstanding their defensive armour, are often more annoyed by the round stones from the sling than by all the arrows of the enemy. Stones kill without <b>mangling</b> the body, and the contusion is mortal without loss of blood. It is universally known the ancients employed slingers in all their engagements. There is the greater reason for instructing all troops, without exception, in this exercise, as the sling cannot be reckoned any encumbrance, and often is of the greatest service, especially when they are obliged to engage in stony places, to defend a mountain or an eminence, or to repulse an enemy at the attack of a castle or city.|$|E

The song had LFO sweeps at its beginning, panning from its left and right, which created the backdrop of the track. To achieve this, Ahmadzaï used a Nord Lead synthesizer, passed through an audio filter. The bass used in the song was subdued, and did not contain any music in high or mid-range. Instead of using a Minimoog synthesizer, Ahmadzaï used a Korg Prophecy analog-modelling synthesizer which added a different texture to the song.

As the storm crossed U.S. Highway 72 in eastern Limestone County, the tornado destroyed a Doppler radar operated by NBC affiliate WAFF (channel 48) and continued into East Limestone, a heavily populated area of Limestone County where homes in multiple subdivisions were damaged or destroyed at high-end EF3 strength. As the storm crossed into Madison County, it approached the densely populated suburban communities of Harvest and Toney, where it either damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes, especially in the Anderson Hills and Carter's Gin subdivisions. Many homes were reduced to rubble, and the damage in this area was rated mainly EF3 with a small pocket of EF4 damage in Harvest. The tornado completely destroyed a Piggly Wiggly grocery store in Harvest and severely damaged a convenience store and local bank, which was shut down for months following the event. The storm progressed across Pulaski Pike in northwest Madison County, damaging many homes.
