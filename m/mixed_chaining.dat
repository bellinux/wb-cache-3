40|$|Summary. This paper {{introduces}} first {{an expert}} system shell based on stratified forward chaining. The stratified forward chaining was proposed as a generalization for the inheritance networks with exception since it allows more than one antecedent in the premises part of a rule. Expert systems built with this tool are rule based and the user interface is web based. The practical use of this chaining is presented here through the three chaining methods: forward chaining, backward chaining and <b>mixed</b> <b>chaining.</b> Our current aim is {{to make use of}} these inference mechanisms to help the user in his interaction with administration to identify in an efficient way the relevant information he needs. This is done through a question-response dialog to determine the user profile. The paper considers also in a second part a special kind of inference called deontic inference. The rationale behind this kind of inference is the possible presence of deontic rules which may impose a change in the base of current facts to make it comply with the obligations they prescribe. ...|$|E

The tetrahedra have a phosphorus ion P in the middle, and oxygen ions O {{at each of}} the four vertices, and the octahedra have an aluminium ion Al in the middle surrounded by six oxygen ions O, as in the octahedral chains. At each linked vertex one O is shared between a tetrahedron and an octahedron, and each tetrahedron and octahedron must have two linked vertices to form the <b>mixed</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each {{octahedral}} {{chain is}} flanked by two <b>mixed</b> <b>chains,</b> one on either side, linked through the vertices of the chains, making an infinite triple chain. The triple chains are further interlinked by yet more phosphorus tetrahedra (not {{the ones in the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>chains),</b> which share vertices with both kinds of octahedra in the octahedral chains, and with the aluminium octahedra in the <b>mixed</b> <b>chains.</b> Water molecules (H2O) and hydroxyl ions (OH) are also incorporated into this chain, giving a complex chain with composition FeAl3(PO4)4(OH)4(OH2)25−. These complex chains, which are parallel to the c crystal axis, are linked {{in the direction of the}} an axis by further aluminium octahedra (not the ones in the chains) and in the direction of the b axis by further Fe octahedra, and there are more water molecules within channels in the structure, giving the final formula for vauxite as FeAl2(PO4)2(OH)2.6H2O.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} true or {{grammatical}} resumption arises through the generalisation of intrusive resumption, a resumptive strategy available in most grammars {{as a last}} resort device to overcome processing complexity. Intrusive resumptive structures involve <b>mixed</b> <b>chains,</b> specified for movement, thus, incurring processing costs associated with movement, but in which the involvement of a pronominal, providing an argument locally, gives rise to an anaphoric resolution of the dependency. Generalising the resumptive strategy involves shifting from such <b>mixed</b> <b>chains</b> to chains where the movement option is cancelled altogether and, complexity associated with movement is dispensed with. Technically, this amounts to dispensing with the Op feature of C. The hypothesis immediately explains why variation in resumption is associated with C rather than the pronominal. A crucial trigger in this process is the presence of rich agreement in a grammar in two areas: i) the association of C of relative clauses with nominal features that enter in agreement relations with the relativised element and ii) the existence of pronominal clitics that can be (re-) analysed as agreement features on verbal forms...|$|R

The vortex phases in high-quality Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +δ single crystals were studied by in-plane resistivity measurement and local ac magnetic permeability. The sharp crossover was shown by both techniques, deep in the vortex solid state separating the Abrikosov dominant 'strong pinning' phase from the Josephson dominant 'weak pinning' phase.

50|$|Polyubiquitination is the {{formation}} of a ubiquitin chain on a single lysine residue on the substrate protein. Following addition of a single ubiquitin moiety to a protein substrate, further ubiquitin molecules can be added to the first, yielding a polyubiquitin chain. These chains are made by linking the glycine residue of a ubiquitin molecule to a lysine of ubiquitin bound to a substrate. Ubiquitin has seven lysine residues and an N-terminus that serves as points of ubiquitination; they are K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63 and M1, respectively. Lysine 48-linked chains were the first identified and are the best-characterised type of ubiquitin chain. K63 chains have also been well-characterised, whereas the function of other lysine <b>chains,</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>chains,</b> branched chains, M1-linked linear chains, and heterologous chains (mixtures of ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like proteins) remains more unclear.|$|R

The structure of the monolayer was determined with the surface pressure maintained at 28 and 34 mN/m, where the individual surfactant molecules are calculated to occupy areas of 125 ± 1 and 116 ± 2 Å 2, respectively. At 28 mN/m, the widths of the Gaussian distributions for the surfactant hydrophobe and head group layers are determined to be 16. 5 ± 1 and 20 ± 1 Å, respectively, with the associated solvent modeled with a tanh distribution of thickness 9 ± 1 Å. An extensive overlap is observed between the hydrophobe and head group layers, with the <b>mixed</b> <b>chain</b> region having a thickness of around 12 Å. As the result of the modest increase in surface pressure to 34 mN/m, the surfactant monolayer is made slightly thicker and more ordered as expected, with the widths of the hydrophobe, head group, and solvent layers increased to 17 ± 1, 22 ± 1, and 9. 5 ± 1 Å, respectively. The higher pressure, however, also leads to an increased thickness for the <b>mixed</b> <b>chain</b> region (13 Å), and causes a greater proportion of the alkyl chains to be immersed in the solvent (∼ 58 % versus 38 %) ...|$|R

However, since the two phases must be in osmotic equilibrium with one another, this behavior challenges theoretical models of lipid interactions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a symmetric random walk on a connected graph, where each edge is la-beled with {{the probability of}} transition between the two adjacent vertices. The associated Markov chain has a uniform equilibrium distribution; the rate of convergence to this dis-tribution, i. e., the mixing rate of the Markov chain, {{is determined by the}} second largest eigenvalue modulus (SLEM) of the transition probability matrix. In this paper we address the problem of assigning probabilities to the edges of the graph {{in such a way as}} to mini-mize the SLEM, i. e., the problem of finding the fastest <b>mixing</b> Markov <b>chain</b> on the graph. We show that this problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can in turn be expressed as a semidefinite program (SDP). This allows us to easily compute the (globally) fastest <b>mixing</b> Markov <b>chain</b> for any graph with a modest number of edges (say, 1000) using standard numerical methods for SDPs. Larger problems can be solved by exploiting various types of symmetry and structure in the problem, and far larger problems (say, 100, 000 edges) can be solved using a subgradient method we describe. We compare the fastest <b>mixing</b> Markov <b>chain</b> to those obtained using two commonly used heuristics: the maximum-degree method, and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. For many of th...|$|R
