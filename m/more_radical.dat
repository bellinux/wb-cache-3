5|$|If {{one is a}} materialist and {{believes}} that all aspects of our common-sense psychology will find reduction to a mature cognitive neuroscience, and that non-reductive materialism is mistaken, then one can adopt a final, <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> position: eliminative materialism.|$|E
5|$|A <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene is not necessary for stability, either.|$|E

5|$|After {{assembly}} elections {{across the}} country in 1967, the party entered into a coalition with several other parties, including the Swatantra Party and the socialists. It formed governments in various states across the Hindi heartland, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

5|$|At {{this point}} Díaz {{tried to come}} to terms with Madero, {{particularly}} after the capture of Cuautla by the Zapatistas in south-central Mexico. Together with his finance minister and main advisor, José Yves Limantour, Díaz planned to make concessions to the fairly moderate Madero and, once Madero was pacified, crack down hard on the <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> elements among the rebels. A truce was agreed to on April 23.|$|E
5|$|Harassment and {{censorship}} {{imposed by}} the French colonial authorities led to the commercial failure of the Nam Dong Thu Xa. By the autumn of 1927, the group's priorities turned towards more direct political action, {{in a bid to}} appeal to <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> elements in the north. Membership grew to around 200, distributed among 18 cells in 14 provinces across northern and central Vietnam.|$|E

500|$|As Tyson notes, {{although}} [...] "Johnson's circle" [...] {{is usually}} {{used in the}} singular, {{there were at least}} two such [...] "circles". The first was made up of a group of London associates: Fuseli, Gregory, Bonnycastle, and Geddes. The second consisted of Johnson's writers from farther afield, such as Priestley, Thomas Henry, Thomas Percival, Barbauld, Aikin, and Enfield. Later, <b>more</b> <b>radicals</b> would join, including Wollstonecraft, Wakefield, John Horne Tooke, and Thomas Christie.|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension.

5|$|The {{transition}} to a <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> form of poetry {{seems to have taken}} place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together.

5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, {{that called for}} looser money, government control of the railroads, a graduated income tax, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for {{a break from the}} two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E
5|$|As Roosevelt became <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in {{his resolve}} to achieve re-nomination, {{as he was}} convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E
30|$|In {{this study}} the {{variation}} on concentration of photoinitiators affected all the evaluated properties, confirming the tested hypothesis. The composites with higher concentration of CQ/DMAEMA (C 2 and C 3) showed higher DC than the composite with lower concentration (C 1). In addition, {{the depth of}} cure was also higher for C 2 and C 3 than for C 1. What means that, {{the presence of a}} higher quantity of photoinitiators (CQ/DMAEMA) allows the generation of <b>more</b> <b>radicals,</b> which have resulted increased degree of conversion in some conditions of photocuring. Regarding the parameters analyzed, the most adequate photoinitiator concentration was 1.5  wt% of CQ/DMAEMA. The concentration of 0.5  wt% of CQ/DMAEMA was considered inappropriate for the resin matrix used.|$|R
40|$|An e. s. r. and ENDOR {{study of}} diphenylnitroxide in {{benzophenone}} crystals is presented. Different paramagnetic species {{due to the}} isolated radicals, strongly coupled radical pairs, clusters of three and four radicals and finally weakly coupled radical pairs have been detected. From crystal-like ENDOR spectra in crystalline powders the proton hyperfine tensors have been obtained, and the conformation of the radical has been deduced to be slightly {{different from that of}} benzophenone. 14 N and 1 H ENDOR analysis in single crystals has given the result that the diphenylnitroxide radical is substituted isostructurally for the host molecules, but that a rearrangement of the radical orientation is present when two or <b>more</b> <b>radicals</b> occupy adjacent positions in the host structure...|$|R
40|$|EPR and ENDOR {{spectroscopy}} {{were used}} {{to determine the effects of}} radiation on single crystals of ammonium hydrogen 2, 2 '-oxydiacetate that had been gamma-irradiated at room temperature. Hyperfine tensors of the alpha, gamma and hydrogen-bonded protons were determined from the ENDOR data for the two radicals of the type OOC-CH 2 -O-CH-CO 2 H. The proton couplings were compared with the calculated values, taking into account spin distribution over the carboxylic group and the ether oxygen. In addition, two <b>more</b> <b>radicals</b> characterized by typical alpha-proton couplings were observed. These radicals could not be associated with the parent hydrogen oxydiacetate ion. It is suggested that the radicals are formed by the separation of the ligand halves of the hydrogen 2, 2 '-oxydiacetate ion...|$|R
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the <b>more</b> <b>radical</b> Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E

Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E

25|$|Reductive desulfonylation {{reactions}} lead to {{the replacement}} of a carbon-sulfur bond in the sulfonyl group with a carbon-hydrogen bond. Because the sulfonyl group is by definition attached to two carbons, however, reduction to two sets of products is possible. Mechanistic studies of reductions employing metal amalgams as the reducing agent suggest that upon electron transfer to the sulfone, fragmentation to a sulfinate anion and the <b>more</b> stable organic <b>radical</b> occurs. Immediate reduction of the radical and protonation then occur to afford the sulfur-free product derived from the <b>more</b> stable <b>radical.</b> Thus, S-alkyl bonds are cleaved in preference to S-aryl or S-alkenyl bonds.|$|R
