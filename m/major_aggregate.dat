50|$|Carson quickly {{began to}} rise in many {{national}} polls, eventually polling in double digits and securing second place, only behind Trump. Carson subsequently saw {{a significant increase in}} two <b>major</b> <b>aggregate</b> polls for the Republican nomination, from Real Clear Politics and The Huffington Post - in both cases, he rose to the #3 spot {{in the race for the}} nomination, behind Jeb Bush and Donald Trump, by mid-August. By late August, he had increased his lead in said aggregate polls even further to rise to the #2 position, only behind Trump. His rise has further fueled the perception that candidates with little to no political experience, like Carson and Trump, are the new favorite types of candidates among potential primary voters. It also led some commentators to believe that Carson's soft-spoken and calm mannerisms were actually working in his favor among potential voters, in contrast to more conventional rhetoric or the blunt language of such candidates as Trump; this was also noted in Carson repeatedly having the highest ratings out of all the Republican candidates in regards to personal favorability.|$|E

Using a small open economy DSGE model {{we show that}} non-materialized news about future productivity improvements (i. e. overoptimism) generate boom-bust cycles that replicate the stylized facts of several emerging economies during the 1990 s. We report simulation results for a boom-bust cycle under alternative monetary policy rules. In this context, we show that if the central bank tries to stabilize output, {{there would be a}} large real appreciation of the currency and a deep contraction in the tradable goods sector. When the central bank follows a more strict inflation targeting regime, the boom-bust pattern in <b>major</b> <b>aggregate</b> variables would be exacerbated. Finally, if the central bank attempts to sustain the real exchange rate, the perverse effects on the domestic tradable goods sector are only prevented in the short-run, but the boom-bust cycle in other variables is amplified. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the evolution of}} balance sheets of monetary financial institutions (MFI) in Portugal before, during, and after the sovereign debt crisis of the late 2000 ’s. We account for several dimensions of heterogeneity including size, type, and nationality.

Many of the <b>major</b> <b>aggregates,</b> such as lending and deposits, follow this pattern. We observe a steady rise of non-traditional banking activities {{on both sides of the}} balance sheet of domestic institutions. The crisis weakened the international integration of the Portuguese financial sector, as domestic banks became less exposed to international counterparties. Finally, the Eurosystem and the Portuguese government have become relevant sources of funding as a result of the recent unprecedented monetary and fiscal interventions in the domestic financial system.

PF is defined by a range of values which indicate the quality of rock in term of excellent, good, fair and poor. However, PF depends upon the physical characteristics of the rock and geological characteristics of the particular area.

40|$|Aggregate {{stability}} {{tends to}} give a better availability of soil water. Clay dispersion makes the soil dense, difficult for root penetration. The better understanding of these two soil properties is necessary to evaluate the suitability of soils for plant production. We collected soil samples from 10 sites from the southeast coast and northeast plateau of Thailand, at upper (0 - 5 cm depth) and lower (5 - 20 cm depth) levels for under udic and ustic Oxisols soil samples. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the contribution of <b>major</b> <b>aggregate</b> binding agents such as soil organic carbon (SOC), Fe and Al oxides, clay minerals and kaolin crystal size to the stability of soil aggregates. Soils were acidic (pH - 1), SOC ranged from 2. 08 - 4. 56 % for udic and 1. 11 - 1. 56 % for ustic soils. The udic soils showed higher contents of crystalline, non-crystalline, and organic forms of Fe and Al than those for ustic soils. The mean coherently scatterings domain (CSD) values for kaolin crystal size were 115 and 152 nm for udic and ustic soils, respectively. The mean water dispersible clay (WDC), water dispersible silt (WDSi), and dispersion ratio (DR) were 92, 43 g kg - 1, and 0. 17 for udic soils, and 218, 45 g kg - 1, and 0. 30 for ustic soils, respectively. Mean weight diameters (MWD) were 1. 01 and 0. 62 mm for udic and ustic soils, respectively. The clay flocculation index (CFI) and aggregated silt and clay (ASC) were 0. 83 and 650 g kg - 1 for udic soils and 0. 66 and 619 g kg - 1 for ustic soils. The SOC, non-crystalline, organic form of Fe and Al oxides, and crystalline Al oxide showed positive correlation to MWD and CFI.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{empirical}} performance of Canadian weighted monetary aggregates (in particular, Fisher ideal aggregates) {{with the current}} summation aggregates, for their information content and forecasting performance in terms of prices, real output and nominal spending for the period 1971 Q 1 to 1989 Q 3. The properties of money-demand equations for these aggregates, particularly their temporal stability, are also examined. The <b>major</b> <b>aggregates</b> considered are M 1, M 2, M 3, M 2 +, and their Fisher ideal counterparts. Also considered are M 3 + (which adds near-bank deposits to M 3) and two liquidity aggregates, {{as well as their}} Fisher ideal counterparts. Over all, {{on the basis of the}} in-sample fit of indicator models, the out-of-sample forecasts by indicator models, the specification of money-demand functions, and the temporal stability of money-demand functions, Canadian simple-sum monetary aggregates appear to be empirically superior to Fisher ideal aggregates. Specifically, broad monetary aggregates are generally the best in predicting inflation, M 1 works well in predicting nominal spending, and real M 1 is the best predictor of real output. These conclusions generally agree with earlier studies, which have shown that weighted monetary aggregates rarely do better than simple-sum <b>aggregates</b> in predicting <b>major</b> Canadian macroeconomic variables. ...|$|R

The first essay (Döring et al., 2016, Systemic risk measures and their viability for banking supervision) {{contributes to the literature}} by proposing a criteria-based framework to assess the viability of systemic risk measures as a monitoring tool for banking supervision and investigates the bank characteristics that determine the banking system's overall level of systemic risk. We assess the monitoring qualities of the former systemic risk measures by focusing on their forecasting capabilities for a set of <b>major</b> <b>aggregated</b> bank-specific and macroeconomic state variables. The second essay (Döring et al., 2016 a, Systemic importance, default risk, and profitability in the European banking system) examines the relation between banks' systemic importance and their default risk and return characteristics on a broad sample of listed European banks. To be more specific, we analyze whether systemically important banks exhibit default risk and return patterns that are distinctively different from those of non-systemically important banks. The third essay (Döring, 2016, Risk-adjusted bank performance and income diversification) contributes to the academic literature by analyzing the effects of income diversification on banks' profitability patterns for a broad sample of listed and unlisted euro area banks covering the period from 2007 to 2014.

Using concrete as solid storage material is most suitable, as {{it is easy to}} handle, the <b>major</b> <b>aggregates</b> are available {{all over the world and}} there are no environmentally critical components. Long term stability of concrete has been proven in oven experiments and through strength measurements up to 500 °C.

For an up-scaled concrete storage design with 1100 MWh capacity in a modular set-up for a 50 MWel parabolic trough power plant of the ANDASOL-type, about 50, 000 m³ of concrete is required and the investment costs are approximately 38 million Euro. The simulation of the annual electricity generation of a 50 MWel parabolic trough power plant with a 1100 MWh concrete storage shows that such plants could operate for about annually, delivering ca. 3, 500 full load hours in southern Europe, about 30 % of this electricity is generated by the storage system. This number will further increase, when improved operation strategies are applied.
