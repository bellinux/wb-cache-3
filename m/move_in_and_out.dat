5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> {{of the house in}} which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
5|$|Randall pursues them to {{the door}} vault, and a wild chase ensues among the {{millions}} of doors as they <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the storage vault on rails to the factory floor. Boo's laughter causes all the doors to activate, allowing the monsters to pass {{in and out of}} the human world. Randall attempts to kill Sulley, but Boo overcomes her fear and attacks him. Sulley and Mike trap Randall in the human world, where two residents at a trailer park mistake him for an alligator and beat him with a shovel. Sulley and Mike then trick Waternoose into revealing his plot with Randall, while Mike secretly records the entire conversation for the CDA to view. The CDA arrests Waternoose and it is revealed that Roz the monster in charge of paperwork is CDA #1 to which she orders Sulley and Mike to return Boo home and has her door shredded to prevent any more contact with her.|$|E

5|$|The main {{shopping}} area was Jackson Square, with about 20 shops. The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition, but this met with limited success {{due to the}} captive nature of the population, and the requirements of security, which meant that firms and goods could not freely <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out.</b> The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague information about {{how many people were}} in or would be in the town, and concessions were only {{for the duration of the}} war. Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a fixed fee. The Army avoided imposing draconian price controls, but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville. By 1945, community amenities included 6 recreation halls, 36 bowling alleys, 23 tennis courts, 18 ball parks, 12 playgrounds, a swimming pool, a 9,400-volume library, and a newspaper.|$|E

25|$|This {{traditional}} tail vise {{also uses}} one large screw, either wooden or metal. It {{consists of a}} movable block {{with one or more}} dog holes in it, the movable block rides in a large mortise in the workbench. The jaw has a face that contacts the bench top, and the dog holes are in line with the dog holes on the bench top. The two main varieties of this vise depend on whether the screw nut is mounted in the bench or on the dog hole block. When the screw nut is mounted on the dog hole block the installation is more complicated and expensive, but the screw does not <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> as the vise is used.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the five}} living species of monotreme occur in Australia: the platypus and the short-beaked echidna. The {{monotremes}} differ from other mammals in their methods of reproduction; in particular, they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The platypusa venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed amphibious mammalis considered {{to be one of}} the strangest creatures in the animal kingdom. When it was first presented by Joseph Banks to English naturalists it was thought to be so strange that it was a cleverly created hoax. The short-beaked echidna is similarly strange, covered in hairy spikes with a tubular snout in the place of a mouth, and a tongue that can <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the snout about 100 times a minute to capture termites.|$|E
25|$|Within the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{concentrates}} {{its effort}} to restore grizzly bears in six recovery areas. These are Northern Continental Divide (Montana), Yellowstone (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho), Cabinet-Yaak (Montana and Idaho), Selway-Bitterroot (Montana and Idaho), Selkirk (Idaho and Washington), and North Cascades (Washington). The grizzly population in these areas is estimated at 750 in the Northern Continental Divide, 550 in Yellowstone, 40 in the Yaak portion of the Cabinet-Yaak, and 15 in the Cabinet portion (in northwestern Montana), 105 in Selkirk region of Idaho, 10–20 in the North Cascades, and none currently in Selway-Bitterroots, {{although there have been}} sightings. These are estimates because bears <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of these areas, and it is therefore impossible to conduct a precise count. In the recovery areas that adjoin Canada, bears also move {{back and forth across the}} international boundary.|$|E

25|$|The {{enlargement}} of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by {{the lifting of the}} front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air, and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the respiratory airways (Fig. 2). In health these airways (starting at the nose or mouth, and ending in the microscopic dead-end sacs called alveoli) are always open, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The alveolar air pressure is therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100kPa at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients that cause air to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2–3kPa.|$|E
25|$|A major {{design flaw}} {{with the class}} was that the {{traction}} current circuits of each bogie were not isolated. The third rail supply is generated close to the rail line {{and there are many}} areas where it changes from one substation to another. Although great effort is made to ensure the voltages are the same between sections, at the extreme ends of supply there can be very large differences due mainly to voltage drops caused by other electric trains. There are examples of fires in class 73 where the locomotive has acted as an electrical bridge between two different substations causing the traction circuit inside the locomotive to take the brunt of the huge surges in supply as trains <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the sections behind and in front. This problem was particularly noticeable at junctions where conductor rails cannot be separated by a good distance and many of the class were damaged by fire caused in this manner over the years. Class 73s were well known for incredible displays of arcing at the collector shoes for this exact reason.|$|E
25|$|It is Tobias’s friend Harry (and his wife, Edna) {{who bring}} the play to its conclusion, forcing Tobias {{to define what}} {{friendship}} is all about. In the end, Tobias proclaims that friendship is not about wants but rather about rights. Tobias’s friend Harry {{has the right to}} move into Tobias’s house even if that is not what Tobias, or the rest of his family, wants. Contradicting this conclusion is the story concerning his cat that Tobias tells {{in the middle of the}} play. In this case, the cat wanted to be left alone. Tobias was uncomfortable with the cat’s noncompliance, and eventually he hits the cat and then has the cat euthanised. But disregarding the cat, Tobias seems true to his definition of friendship. He has, after all, allowed his sister-in-law to live off him. He allows his thirty-something daughter to continually <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of his house, and he tolerates his wife. He also tolerates his friend Harry’s moving into his house uninvited. At the end of the play, Tobias questions Harry’s efforts at friendship and honesty. Then he apologizes. Albee admits that the character of Tobias is based on his adopted father.|$|E

500|$|Little brown bats are insectivores, eating moths, wasps, beetles, gnats, mosquitoes, midges and mayflies, among others. [...] Since many {{of their}} {{preferred}} meals are insects with an aquatic life stage, such as mosquitoes, they prefer to roost near water. Brown bats forage near bodies of water and <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of adjacent vegetation. Evening forages are done in groups and above the water. They echolocate to find their prey. They are particularly good at hunting insects when they are at close range and packed together. When hunting, little brown bats capture prey both by gleaning and by catching them in the air. When in flight, bats scoop up the prey with their wings, while prey above water is directly grabbed with the mouth.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Overprotected" [...] was {{directed}} by Billie Woodruff and produced under Geneva Films, while choreographed by Brian Friedman. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in 2011, Spears recalled the music video, saying, [...] "I just think it says a lot. It was directed so well, it was really colorful and the dancing was amazing". It begins with Spears driving away from the paparazzi, with {{a part of the}} instrumental version of the song [...] "Bombastic Love", featured on the album Britney, playing. She makes her way into an alleyway and decides to enter an abandoned factory, hoping her pursuers will be thrown off course. When she enters the building she begins to dance her way around the warehouse. Britney's dancers, having spotted her walking into the factory, follow her inside. They find Britney dancing around and joke about it, before heading into a heavy dance routine. Towards the end of the video, segments of Spears in a room with walls covered in pictures and articles about herself are also shown. These walls <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> before the video ends, signifying that she is [...] "overprotected". At the end of the video, Britney walks to a wall, and exits the building.|$|E
500|$|Wario {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as a villain in the 1992 Game Boy video game Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, in which he captured Mario's castle. He {{also served as a}} villain in the 1993 Japan-only puzzle game Mario & Wario, in which he drops a bucket on the head of Mario, Princess Peach, or Yoshi. This was followed by the first game in the Wario Land series, [...] (1994), a platform game which marked Wario's first appearance as a protagonist and introduced his first villains, Captain Syrup and her Brown Sugar Pirates. His next adventure, Virtual Boy Wario Land, plays similarly and incorporates the ability to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the background. A sequel for the Game Boy title, Wario Land II, was released in 1998; it featured Captain Syrup's return as the antagonist. This game also introduces Wario's invulnerability, allowing him to be burnt or flattened without sustaining damage. In 2000 Wario Land 3 was released to the Game Boy Color as another sequel; it used the same mechanics and concepts of its predecessor. The following year, the sequel Wario Land 4 debuted on the Game Boy Advance, incorporating Wario's ability to become burnt or flattened and reintroducing the ability to become damaged from standard attacks. In 2003, Wario World, the first console Wario platforming title, was released for the Nintendo GameCube; it featured three-dimensional graphics and gameplay and did not incorporate any major elements from previous platforming titles. [...] was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007. The game introduced touch screen control of Wario and incorporated puzzles into the gameplay. The series' most recent release, , was released for the Wii in 2008 and reintroduced Captain Syrup. The game uses a hand-drawn animation style, and Wario's design required more than 2,000 frames of animation.|$|E
