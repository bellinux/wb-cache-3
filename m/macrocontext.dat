The Flemish region demonstrates the most positive results in terms of current economic, scientific, and technical restructuring; the situation in the Walloon and Brussels regions is decidedly less positive. Belgium has introduced alternance training for youth under age 18. Those over 18 have a wide choice in postsecondary training courses. Results of case studies of three companies in the Dutch community and two in the French community show considerable contrast between the two communities.

40|$|Rhetorical {{scholarship}} has relied upon textual criticism {{as a method}} of examining discourse. However, in the critical turn, rhetorical theory and praxis have been reconsidered, especially in regard to the types and locations worthy of rhetorical examination. Looking toward vernacular rhetorical discourses, rhetorical scholars examine locally situated discourses as they articulate against oppressive <b>macrocontexts.</b> In this essay, I offer critical-rhetorical ethnography as a method for exploring such discourses in the field of argumentation, using the concepts of invention, kairos, and phronesis. The method offers rhetorical scholars a set of theoretical and methodological guidelines for observing and participating within vernacular advocacy. Finally, I use my time with the health advocacy group, DanceSafe, as an exemplar of the method, illustrating its ability to gauge rhetorical effects, advocacy, and learned wisdom...|$|R

Teachers can use several criteria for deciding what kind of technology-based resources to use; the teacher's level of confidence in science and language arts content and knowledge of technology-based resources is vital to making such innovative curriculum decisions. The following steps can guide teachers: (1) the context chosen for integration must be available on videodisc, videotape, compact disc (CD), or the World Wide Web; (2) the context must be appropriate for student viewing at the elementary levels; (3) the context must be rich in information needed to gain the attention and interest of students; (4) the context must contain explicit information in a language of communication familiar to students; (5) the science and language arts represented in the context must fall within a topic of inquiry in the school science and language curricula; (6) the teacher should be able to clearly identify th...|$|R
40|$|This study {{critically}} contrasts global {{identity with}} domain-specific identities (political, religious and occupational) and considers context and gender as integral parts of identity. In a cross-sectional survey, 1038 Greek Cypriot adolescents (449 boys and 589 girls, mean age 16. 8) {{from the three}} different types of secondary schools (state, state technical and private) and from different SES completed part of the Extended Objective Measure of Ego-Identity Status- 2 (EOMEIS- 2). The <b>macrocontext</b> of Greek Cypriot society is used to understand the role of context in adolescents’ identities. Results showed that Greek Cypriot young people {{were not in the}} same statuses across their global, political, religious and occupational identities. This heterogeneity in the status of global identity and of each identity domain is partially explained by differences in gender, type of school and SES (Socio-Economic Status). The fact that identity status is found to be reactive to context suggests that developmental stage models of identity status should place greater emphasis on context...|$|E
40|$|This study explores broad {{features}} of political culture and {{event of the}} 1930 s and World War 2 years, viewed {{in relation to the}} emergence and rapid early growth of the new therapy of Carl Rogers. The paper traces Rogers' early professional life and examines distinctive emphases in sociopolitical thought and development during Franklin D. Roosevelt's leadership as President over the prolonged emergency of the Great Depression and the crisis of the War. The study includes a focus on the President's own outlook and style, pertinent New Deal innovations, and wartime needs. Twelve {{features of}} this larger context are discriminated as together having vital importance for the new therapy and its founder. The congruent courses of the <b>macrocontext</b> and of Rogers' innovation are followed to the ending of Roosevelt's life. Direct causation is not attributed, but the evidence adduced newly points to particular contours of a larger environment favorable for the expression of Rogers' values and rare ability. In sum, the author concludes that a synergy of highly conducive historical circumstance and individual exceptionality contributed to the philosophical underpinnings, attitudinal values and early momentum of Rogers' client-centered therapy...|$|E

The {{results indicate that the}} grassland productivity in the TRHR will be unstable under all the four scenarios. The grassland productivity will be greatly influenced by the fluctuations of precipitation and the temperature fluctuations will also play an important role during some periods. The local grassland productivity will decrease to some degree during 2010 - 2020 and then will fluctuate and increase slowly during 2020 - 2030. The theoretical grazing capacity was analyzed in this study and calculated {{on the basis of the}} grass yield. The result indicates that the theoretical grazing capacity ranges from 4 million sheep to 5 million sheep under the four scenarios and it can provide quantitative information reference for decision making on how to determine the reasonable grazing capacity, promote the sustainable development of grasslands, and so forth...|$|E
40|$|Chiasmus is {{a bright}} and many-sided means of poetic syntax. Despite the fact that chiasmus {{as a method of}} expressing the text has been used since 10 th- 8 th centuries BC and was {{recorded}} in Hebrew sacred texts, and therefore it has had a long history of research, as indicated by I. Barchyshyn, Е. Berehovska, O. Krylova, I. Parovyak and others, so far there is no single characteristic and definition of this notion. This state of affairs actualizes the study in domestic linguistics. The paper is aimed to characterize chiasmus as a stylistical and syntactic means for reviving the poetic language, to determine its varieties, as well as to find out the stylistic load of this movement figure. The implementation of the outlined purpose involves the use of descriptive, comparative, contextual-interpretation methods, as well as the method of linguistic observation. The results of the analysis of the illustrative material testify that in the Ukrainian poetry of {{the second half of the}} 20 th – early 21 st century the constructions of grammatical and semantic and grammatical chiasmus are actively represented. Chiastic forms do not function in isolation, but often appear in combination with such stylistic techniques as repetition, antithesis, homeoteleuton, anadiplosis, euphonic epanalepsis, and gradation. Equivalence and opposition are the basis of semantic relations in models of semantic and grammatical chiasmus. Chiasmus is a many-sided and complex figure of stylistic syntax, the use of which allows to provide a poetic tale of dynamism, to create a special intonational and semantic pattern of a verse text and to organize a peculiar rhythmic and structural order at the level of micro- and <b>macrocontexts.</b> The continuation of the initiated study is seen in the investigation of the interaction of the chiasmus with other stylistic figures in the organization of the language poetic space...|$|R
40|$|Communication can be understood, {{under an}} {{epistemological}} framework, as a <b>macrocontext</b> from which education participates as a part. One {{of the objectives}} of this work is to contrast this theoretical consideration with the observed interaction between education and communication scientific journals defined by citations and relatedness towards other scientific journals. At the same time, there might be relevant differences between the citation patterns of Spanish and foreign (journals in Journal Citation Reports) communication journals, {{particularly with regard to}} their disciplinary composition. These differences might become a major problem for the interexchange of information between both sets of journals. The authors analyze the citations distribution by subject category for Spanish and JCR journals, {{as well as for the}} journal «Comunicar», and also the frequency of related journals per subject category in the case of JCR. It is concluded: a) that the aforementioned epistemological relationship is valid only for Spanish Communication journals, b) that there are relevant differences between both sets of journals in the disciplinary composition of their citedciting and related journals and that Information Science & Library Science might serve as a suitable communication channel; finally, c) the characteristic multidisciplinarity of the journal «Comunicar» is corroborated, both at the national and international level...|$|E

40|$|With {{reference}} to a typology distinguishing six notions of theory, grounded theory {{is a case of}} the explanation-based type of theory reflecting a pragmatist attitude. This essay evaluates the criticism waged against grounded theory. John Goldthorpe’s criticism, a side effect of his attempt to synthesize two standard notions of theory, leads him to establish an unbridgeable theory/context divide which, in the end, he cannot sustain. Grounded theory is not committed to such a divide and can thus solve one of Goldthorpe’s main problems, which is that he cannot establish any theory (and thus not explain) without some «delimitation of scope » or context. Michael Burawoy’s criticism reflects his commitment to a critical notion of theory, but he fails to argue convincingly how his own «extended case method » can be distinguished from grounded theory. His ability to reflect on ethnographic research is hampered by a social-philosophical attitude (more specifically, a Marxist variety of that attitude). Grounded theory can help Burawoy out of at least one of his main problems, which is that successful pursuit of the extended case method requires that the determining <b>macrocontext</b> is analysed in a grounded way. In terms of concepts that we define in this essay, both the standard and the social-philosophical attitude pursue high-level notions of theory. Our discussion supports the broader conclusion that such notions tend to hamper the accumulation of empirical knowledge in the social sciences. If the pragmatist attitude is one that also standard and social-philosophical social scientists will always be forced to accommodate in some sense, why not consider it – and the low/middle-level notions of theory it implies – in its own right...|$|E
40|$|Postcolonial theory {{posits that}} former colonial and present postcolonial {{relations}} between the Philippines and the United States influence contexts of computer-mediated communication (CMC) use. Beginning from the Spanish and American colonial and postcolonial {{history of the country}} as the <b>macrocontext</b> of CMC use, this study examines: (a) the information and communication technology milieu in the Philippines and the Philippine-American relations in this area and (b) Filipino organizational conditions surrounding the use of CMC to protect coral reefs in the Philippines {{with the help of an}} American organization. This study aims to show how the colonial and postcolonial {{relations between the}} Philippines and the United States are interrelated with Philippine-American relations in the area of information and communication technology and with the personal lived experiences of Filipino organizational members who use CMC to support a Philippine-American inter-organizational relationship. The emphasis on multifaceted contexts is based on the premise that context should not be thought of as a passive, unidimensional backdrop but rather as a dynamic process that aggressively routes organizational communication into specific directions. Findings indicate that the three contexts collectively create complex contradictions where the simultaneous and paradoxical enabling and constraining of Filipino organizational communication strategies inversely lead to either the facilitation or disruption of American technological colonization. While these findings support postcolonial theory 2 ̆ 7 s position that past colonial realities persist in postcolonial life, these findings also reveal postcolonial theory 2 ̆ 7 s inability to explain completely organizational communication processes that require the mediation of tightly coupled technological tools. This deficiency suggests the need to extend postcolonial theory 2 ̆ 7 s frames to include the material conditions and lived experiences of postcolonials in theorizing about computer-mediated communication and its use in postcolonial societies and about the persistence of the colonial past into the postcolonial present. ...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this investigation, {{situated}} in a <b>macrocontext</b> of nominal participation of girls in higher level school mathematics, was to examine, analyse, and describe {{the way in which}} a bounded case of Year 10 - 11 girls viewed their participation in higher-level school mathematics. The focal point of the investigation was the positing of an heuristic model to illuminate why the participants within the bounded case did not wish to participate in higher-level school mathematics. From this model and from the case, it was theorised (a) why some girls avoid higher-level school mathematics; and (b) that, through conceptual generalisations, the heuristic model may help to illuminate, in part, the probability of a girl participating in higher-level school mathematics. This thesis is a construction of the investigation of the beliefs (perceptions, perspectives, intentions and understandings) of five female secondary students relating to their participation in higher-level school mathematics. An idiosyncratic heuristic case study approach was used to investigate the participants' beliefs. From data analyses and interpretative constructions, it was posited that these girls' beliefs relating to participation in higher-level school mathematics were associated with lifestyle construction, including a balance between the constructed self and constructed life environments. The participants seemed to have constructed a participation ecosystem, consisting of a network of parts, which together formed a balance which influenced their participation choices. Their preferred mathematics construction differed markedly from their higher-level school mathematics construction, and it was apparent that the balance in their lives excluded participation in higher-level school mathematics. From the evidences presented, conceptual generalisations were posited for use in further and broader research purposes, and the heuristic model was viewed as a catalyst for the reconceptualising and reinterpreting of further exploratory models for investigating and explaining participation in school subjects and equivalent...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{demonstrate}} the possibilities of application of the contextual approach, developed in pedagogy and psychology, in the process of literary analysis. Initially contextual approach was developed by A. A. Verbitsky as a methodology of education. A key category of this approach was the context, interpreted A. A. Verbitsky as a psychological phenomenon. Accordingly, in this paper on the basis of later research context is understood as a psychological mechanism of semantic, objectified in external forms of test patches, social and communicative situations, etc. Now contextual approach became general psychological methodology, which led to the possibility of its application in various fields of the humanities in particular – in psycholinguistic literary studies, where the notion of «context » is used in-depth psychological interpretation. Methods. The contextual approach developed by A. A. Verbitsky as the main component of methodology of education became the main instrument of the research stated in the publication. Besides a field of the general education, this approach is applicable to various private spheres – to educational aspect of education, and also to methodology of teaching various subject matters – mathematicians, biology, foreign languages, etc. The contextual approach at the level of allpsychological methodology has allowed to apply it in various fields of humanitarian knowledge, in particular in literary researches with a strongly pronounced psychological perspective. The contextual analysis corresponding to approach has been chosen as a method of work. Results. Based on A. A. Verbitsky’s interpretation and results of the latest researches the author shows that the context is a semantic mechanism, objectified in external forms of test fragments, social and communicative situations, etc. The following types of contexts are allocated: microcontext of a personality and works of an author, a mesocontext of socio-cultural influences, and also <b>macrocontext</b> of perception and interpretation of works in culture and science. The critical view of psychoanalysis as the literary criticism tool in the Russian culture is presented. Through the systematization of complementary contexts and psychoanalytic interpretation the myth about F. M. Dostoyevsky’s epilepsy as a source of his creativity is discredited; though by recognition of the writer, personal problems and neuroses nevertheless were reflected in his works. The hypothesis of the opposite influence of creativity of F. M. Dostoyevsky on S. Freud’s concept, i. e. formation of psychoanalysis under impact of art creativity is made. Scientific novelty. Methods of engaging of an intertextual and socio-cultural environment are known in linguistics and literary criticism long ago. However, diverse environments of existence of the personality and works of the artist as the unified system of contexts psychological in essence have not been considered yet. The novelty of the proposed way of a research consists in systematicity of formation of a complex of contexts of the studied phenomenon that makes it possible to correlate the diversified information through its origin. As a result, the researcher receives a number of complementary descriptions in the spirit of «the principle of a complementarity» by N. Bohr that provides dimensions and completeness of perception of the studied phenomenon. Practical significance of the work lies in the hard proof of the prospects of the contextual approach to interdisciplinary psychological and literary research. </p...|$|E
