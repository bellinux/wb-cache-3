5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{generally recognized}} that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> generally not the result of new neuron production. With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.|$|E

Once at the Alys'aril (the center where Nerazim <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> preserved) he met Jake Ramsey (the terran {{carrying}} Zamara's essence) and Zeratul. The latter made ready to leave. Mohandar told him his place was on Shakuras within the Hierarchy. Zeratul promised to return to Shakuras soon.|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by a sequel, , which was broadcast on Japanese television in December 2000 and released worldwide on home video and DVD in 2001. Voiced by Dan Green in English with Ichimura reprising the role in Japanese, Mewtwo and the clones have since found peace in another region. However, Giovanni, whose <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> left intact after the first film, locates and pursues Mewtwo. Assisted by Ash and his companions, Mewtwo comes to terms with its existence and defeats Giovanni, removing any memory of itself from his and his soldiers' minds, while leaving the others unaffected. As everyone departs, Mewtwo sets out on its own.|$|E
50|$|Field vs. Observer: Autobiographical <b>memories</b> can <b>be</b> {{experienced}} {{from different}} perspectives. Field <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> <b>memories</b> recollected {{in the original}} perspective, from a first-person point of view. Observer <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> <b>memories</b> recollected from a perspective outside ourselves, a third-person point of view. Typically, older <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> recollected through an observer perspective, and observer <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> more often reconstructions while field <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> more vivid like copies.|$|R
30|$|Three {{types of}} <b>memory</b> buffer <b>are</b> {{generally}} used in any 2 -D DWT architecture, i.e., frame, transposition, and temporal <b>memory.</b> Frame <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> required to store intermediate LL coefficients, transposition <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> mainly required for storing row processor output, and temporal <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> required to store partial results during column processing. Temporal and transposition <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> on-chip, while the frame <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> on or off-chip, {{depending upon the}} architecture. Size of transposition <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> limited by the method adopted to scan external memory. Different scanning techniques have been proposed, such as line-based, block-based, and stripe-based[14, 19 – 21].|$|R
50|$|Declarative <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> the <b>memory</b> for {{conscious}} events. There are {{two types}} of declarative memory: episodic and semantic. Episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> for remembering experiences whereas semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> remembering specific facts.|$|R
5|$|The Courtyard Cafe and The Fountain {{located within}} the Library also became an institution, well-patronised by library users, office workers and the local arts {{community}} from The Substation. As such, many fond <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> created for those who visited the compounds of the Library. At the same time, the pressure of urban redevelopment in the city was building up, resulting in demolishing of old city fabric that would threaten the Library building's fate and its sentimental memories in the ensuing years.|$|E
5|$|At Eurocorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead {{and send}} him to be rebooted while they plan to {{retrieve}} Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping {{to use it to}} make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was naïve to think that way.|$|E
5|$|Both Ravel's {{parents were}} Roman Catholics; Marie was also {{something}} of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.|$|E
50|$|In {{discussing}} multidirectional <b>memory,</b> it <b>is</b> {{important to}} highlight that screen <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> also {{a kind of}} multidirectional memory, even though screen memory operates more on the personal level while multidirectional <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> primarily collective. Screen <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> “covering up a traumatic event-another traumatic event-that cannot be approached directly”.|$|R
30|$|The {{observation}} of the expert agent shows how spatial <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> connected to his own formative history. When reference <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> richer, then drawn images are more numerous and significant. But <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> stimulated also from the interaction: therefore, new images of old <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> created, {{as well as new}} memories can revive old images, following a permanent and repeated intersection of cognitions and actions.|$|R
25|$|An autobiographical <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> a {{personal}} representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Autobiographical memory also refers to {{memory of a}} person's history. An individual does not remember exactly everything {{that has happened in}} one's past. <b>Memory</b> <b>is</b> constructive, where previous experience affects how we remember events and what we end up recalling from <b>memory.</b> Autobiographical <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person's autobiographical <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> fairly reliable; although, the reliability of autobiographical <b>memories</b> <b>is</b> questionable because of memory distortions.|$|R
5|$|In {{their final}} mission, the killer7 seek Matsuken, {{who leads the}} 10 million UN Party members {{who live in the}} US. The {{government}} fears that if they converge on a single state, they could win a seat in the United States Senate. Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near Seattle, Washington and discovers tapes that reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins. The tapes focus on Emir Parkreiner, a gifted killer trained at the school. Garcian learns that Japan uses Coburn to control the vote of the US presidential election. The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated. Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses visions of the other members being killed in their rooms. At the top, he discovers that his true identity is Emir Parkreiner, the one who killed the killer7 at the Union Hotel over 50 years ago. Following that incident, Harman absorbed Emir as a persona and Emir's <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> lost.|$|E

25|$|Robert Louis Stevenson had {{at least}} one strong {{connection}} with the Bass, as his cousin, David Stevenson, designed the lighthouse there. Amongst his earliest <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> holidays in North Berwick. He often stayed at Scoughall Farm, whence the Bass can be seen, and local lore is credited as the inspiration for his short story The Wreckers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>is</b> a {{very broad}} {{function}} which includes several distinct abilities, {{all of which can}} be selectively impaired and require individual testing. There is disagreement as to the number of memory systems, depending on the psychological perspective taken. From a clinical perspective, a view of five distinct types of <b>memory,</b> <b>is</b> in most cases sufficient. Semantic memory and episodic memory (collectively called declarative memory or explicit memory); procedural memory and priming or perceptual learning (collectively called non-declarative memory or implicit memory) all four of which <b>are</b> long term <b>memory</b> systems; and working memory or short term <b>memory.</b> Semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> for facts, episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> autobiographical <b>memory,</b> procedural <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> for the performance of skills, priming <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> facilitated by prior exposure to a stimulus and working <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> a form of short term memory for information manipulation.|$|R
50|$|Declarative <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> <b>memory</b> {{which can}} <b>be</b> {{consciously}} recalled, such as facts and knowledge, for instance autobiographical memory. Within declarative <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> semantic and episodic <b>memory.</b> Semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> facts, and episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> recalling previous experiences in life. Studies on individuals with ASD has shown impairments to their episodic memory but a relative preservation of their semantic memory. The brain regions that {{play a major}} role in declarative learning and <b>memory</b> <b>are</b> the hippocampus and regions of the medial temporal lobe.Little research has been conducted on M-LFA individuals and memory function. Memory profiles of M-LFA individuals and of HFA individuals seem to be similar, but there is some evidence that declarative <b>memory</b> impairment <b>is</b> consistently greater for M-LFA individuals than for HFA individuals.|$|R

25|$|In the {{original}} anime, weaponizing Luna-P rather than discard the toy when it recognized her, Black Lady's <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> greatly distorted {{to have her}} assumed that she was unloved by both her parents and gave her motivation to kill them and the Sailor Guardians. But Black Lady is purified back to Chibiusa when Sailor Moon assumed the appearance of Neo-Queen Serenity and embraced her.|$|E
25|$|Meri {{was born}} in Tallinn, a son of the Estonian diplomat and later Shakespeare {{translator}} Georg Meri, and Estonian Swedish mother Alice-Brigitta Engmann. With his family, Lennart left Estonia {{at an early age}} and studied abroad, in nine different schools and in four different languages. His warmest <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> from his school years in Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris. In addition to his native Estonian, Lennart Meri fluently spoke five other languages: Finnish, French, German, English and Russian.|$|E
25|$|After {{escaping}} the Raft by time-traveling, the Thunderbolts wound up meeting their counterparts - the first Thunderbolts team. Being as arrogant as they are, present-Fixer and past-Fixer {{got into an}} argument in which Fixer impulsively killed his past self. In order to preserve the timeline, Fixer surgically changed himself to restore his younger appearance and preserved his age by a blood-transfusion from Centurius. Fixer and the past Thunderbolts' <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> wiped, stranding Fixer in a stable time-loop and preserving the timeline after his mistake.|$|E
50|$|Delay line <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} {{computer}} memory, now obsolete, that was used {{on some of the}} earliest digital computers. Like many modern forms of electronic computer memory, delay line <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> a refreshable <b>memory,</b> but as opposed to modern random-access memory, delay line <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> sequential-access.|$|R
50|$|Decay {{theory is}} similar to {{interference}} theory {{in the way that}} old <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> lost over time. <b>Memories</b> <b>are</b> lost in Decay Theory by the passing of time. In Interference Theory, <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> lost due to newly acquired memories. Both Decay and Interference Theories are involved in psychological theories of forgetting.|$|R

25|$|An equally {{important}} {{reason was that}} main <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> quite slow (a common type was ferrite core memory); by using dense information packing, one could reduce {{the frequency with which}} the CPU had to access this slow resource. Modern computers face similar limiting factors: main memories are slow compared to the CPU and the fast cache memories employed to overcome this are limited in size. This may partly explain why highly encoded instruction sets have proven to be as useful as RISC designs in modern computers.|$|E
25|$|The {{family was}} mostly focused on football; Stewart's father {{had played in}} a local amateur team and managed some teams as well, and one of Stewart's {{earliest}} <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> the pictures of Scottish players such as George Young and Gordon Smith that his brothers had on the wall. Stewart was the most talented footballer {{in the family and}} was a strong supporter of Arsenal F.C. at the time. Combining natural athleticism with near-reckless aggression, he became captain of the school football team and played for Middlesex Schoolboys as centre-half.|$|E
25|$|Cash's early <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> {{dominated}} by gospel music and radio. Taught guitar {{by his mother}} and a childhood friend, Cash began playing and writing songs {{at the age of}} twelve. When young, Cash had a high tenor voice, before becoming a bass-baritone after his voice changed. In high school, he sang on a local radio station. Decades later he released an album of traditional gospel songs, called My Mother's Hymn Book. He was also significantly influenced by traditional Irish music, which he heard performed weekly by Dennis Day on the Jack Benny radio program.|$|E
40|$|Our {{intelligence}} (science or a thoughts) {{is established}} on {{a basis of}} what <b>is</b> memorized. Since <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> always ambiguous, intelligence can be established only ambiguously. The reason why <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> ambiguous {{is that the way}} <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> formed is ambiguous. In our methodology, we consider that the cause of formation of <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> Intention and try to explore the structure of Intention. By doing this, we can get around the ambiguity. For this purpose, we have made hypothesis and made it into an axiomatic system and deduced this methodology for software development from the axioms...|$|R
50|$|Autobiographical <b>memories</b> {{can also}} <b>be</b> {{differentiated}} into Remember vs. Know categories. The {{source of a}} remembered <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> attributed to personal experience. The source of a known <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> attributed to an external source, not personal memory. This can often lead to source-monitoring error, wherein a person may believe that a <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> theirs when the information actually came from an external source.|$|R
50|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>is</b> {{inferred}} {{by comparing}} {{how much is}} remembered or it is accessed that how much has been forgotten.

25|$|According to Woolf's memoirs, {{her most}} vivid {{childhood}} <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> not of London but of St Ives, Cornwall, {{where the family}} spent every summer until 1895. The Stephens' summer home, Talland House, looked out over Porthminster Bay, and is still standing, though somewhat altered. Memories of these family holidays and impressions of the landscape, especially the Godrevy Lighthouse, informed the fiction Woolf wrote in later years, most notably To the Lighthouse. She describes why she felt so connected to Talland House in a diary entry dated March 22, 1921.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{anterograde}} amnesia have trouble recalling new information and new autobiographical events, but {{the data are}} less consistent {{in regard to the}} latter. Medveds and Hirst recorded the presence of islands of memory– detailed accounts– that were described by such patients. The island <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> a combination of semantic and episodic memories. The researchers recorded patients giving long narratives with a fair amount of detail that resembled memories that the patients had prior to the trauma. The appearance of islands of memory could {{have something to do with}} the functioning of adjacent cortical areas and the neocortex. In addition, the researchers suspect that the amygdala played a role in the narratives.|$|E
25|$|Maria Pavlovana {{childhood}} {{was spent in}} splendor. Her early <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> of magnificent palaces and lazy country estates populated by armies of servants. Until she was six, Maria spoke Russian badly as all of her governesses and the immediate family spoke English. Later she had another governess, Mademoiselle Hélène who taught her French and stayed with her until her marriage. At {{the age of seven}} she traveled in her own personal railway car accompanied by her governess to visit Germany and France. On Sundays, she and her brother were allowed to play with children from aristocratic families. Growing up without a mother and with a frequently absent father, Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri became very close, relying on each other for affection and companionship.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that fetal memory may begin within the second trimester after conception. Substantial evidence for fetal <b>memories</b> has <b>been</b> found at around 30 weeks after conception. Fetal <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> important for parental recognition, and facilitates the bond between child and parents. One of the most important types of <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> that which stores information contributing to the maternal bond between infant and mother. This form of <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> important for a type of development known as attachment. Fetal <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> thus critical to the survival of the fetus both prenatally (in the womb) and after birth as an infant.|$|R
5000|$|Cellular <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> an {{additional}} hypothesis that <b>memories</b> can <b>be</b> stored outside the brain.
