A book of stamped seals is referred to as inpu. A formal inpu has a single stamp on each page with its sokkan either at the bottom of the page or on the next page. This paper describes an effective method for affixing a sokkan stamp on paper. This is challenging for beginners, especially as there are few books dealing with This prosess apart from Shodo-Koza 6 Tenkoku (NISHIKAWA, Yasushi, 1973), Tenkokugaku (DENG, SanMu, 1979), and Tenkoku-Geijutsu (OH, HokuGaku, 1991) This is my fifth year of teaching a class on seals (tenkoku) at this university.

40|$|Librarians {{and library}} binders {{are no longer}} always able to specify the traditional, {{superior}} oversewing method for binding library books. This problem emerged due to economic pressures within several related industries resulting in a proliferation of economic, but often inferior, binding technologies. As libraries are only approximately ten to fifteen percent of total publishers 2 ̆ 7 sales, books cannot specifically {{be made for the}} library market. In addition, many of the new binding technologies yield books with insufficient inner margin space to prebind or rebind books utilizing the oversewing binding method. And finally, librarians, also faced with tight budgets, must find economic ways to bind library books. This study concentrated on investigating and determining the merits of two alternate binding methods PVA double fanning and cleat-lacing and quantitatively comparing them with oversewing. The binding performance comparison tests were for both openability and strength (internal) properties, two main concerns for the rigors of library use. It was hypothesized that 1) all three binding methods would yield different openability and binding strengths as the methods of fastening pages together work on different principles, 2) the strengths would be significantly influenced by two more main factors, paper and condition, and 3) the interactions of these three main factors (binding method, paper, condition) could significantly vary binding strength. Three different papers were tested: uncoated, dull, and glossy. The three conditions were new, used, and aged. Twenty-seven combinations of books were bound according to Class A, LBI Standard, specifications (except <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>affixing</b> pages) for testing. A new precise method of measuring openability was devised for this study called 2 ̆ 2 Openability Photocopy Test. 2 ̆ 2 The results, in general, proved that the PVA double fanned books opened better than both the cleat-laced and oversewn books, across all papers tested. The cleat-laced books opened slightly better than the oversewn volumes. Both oversewn and cleat-laced books were more consistent for openability than the PVA double fanned, across all papers. The Martini Page Pull and Flex Tester was used to determine binding strengths by recording the force necessary (pounds per linear inch) to pull single pages out of a binding. The strength test results were analyzed by the statistical method called 2 ̆ 2 analysis of variance. 2 ̆ 2 It was found that the critical (statistically significant) factors were the two main factors of binding method and paper but not condition. And it was further determined that the two-way interactions of paper/binding method, paper/condition, and binding method/condition also all vary the binding strengths significantly. The three-way multiple interaction effect, paper/binding method/condition, was not significant. All book combinations tested yielded binding strengths which exceeded 4. 0 lbs/in, a rating of 2 ̆ 2 Excellent 2 ̆ 2 by the Library Binding Institute. However, there was great variability above this level (a range of 4. 26 to 8. 50 lbs/in). In general, the PVA double fanned bindings had the greatest strengths, oversewn second best, and cleat-laced books had the lowest scores. Uncoated paper yielded books with the greatest strengths, dull paper second, and glossy paper gave the least binding strengths. Particular combinations of paper, binding method, and condition (two-way interactions) caused variations in binding strengths so the general conclusions did not always hold true. The results of the openability and strength tests were graphed and categorized in data tables. These graphs and tables can be used as an Optimum Binding Method Index for openability and strength for books of the dimensions and qualities set forth in this study. Librarians and library binders may now make more informed decisions in selecting a proper alternate binding method for a book, cleat-lacing or PVA double fanning...|$|E

The authors present a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> investigating the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>affixes</b> in which participants are trained on novel affixes presented in novel word contexts (e. g., sleepnept). Experiment 1 investigated the role of semantic information on affix acquisition by comparing a form-learning condition with a condition in which participants also received definitions for each novel word. Experiment 2 investigated the role of long-term consolidation on affix acquisition by comparing knowledge <b>of</b> learned <b>affixes</b> two days and nearly two months after training. Results demonstrated that episodic knowledge <b>of</b> <b>affixes</b> can be acquired shortly after a single training session using either form or semantic learning, but suggested that the development of lexicalized representations <b>of</b> <b>affixes</b> requires the provision of semantic information during learning as well as a substantial period of offline consolidation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the frequency <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>affixed</b> words in consecutive portions of ten selected trade books. Family frequencies <b>of</b> the <b>affixed</b> words included in the study were used to describe the frequency of their occurrence in printed school materials. In addition, affixed words were categorized as being either semantically transparent or semantically opaque. ^ Three categories of selected trade books, Books for Early Readers, Books for Middle Readers, and Books for Advanced Readers, were selected based on the criteria of their literary value and their endurance over time. One hundred-word samples were drawn from five consecutive portions of the ten selected trade books. ^ Three research questions were formulated to determine (1) if there were any differences in the frequency <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>affixed</b> words among the random samples drawn, (2) if there were any differences in the number <b>of</b> <b>affixed</b> words which had family frequencies equal to or less than 100. 00 among the random samples, and (3) if there were any differences in the percentage <b>of</b> <b>affixed</b> words which were semantically opaque among the three categories of selected trade books. ^ Findings of the study included the following: (1) There were differences in the number <b>of</b> <b>affixed</b> words occurring among the ten selected trade books. In terms of the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>affixed</b> words, the books tended to cluster into two groups. (2) There were differences in the number <b>of</b> <b>affixed</b> words having family frequencies with U values equal to or less than 100. 00. The range was five affixed words to 28 affixed words having family frequencies with U values equal to or less than 100. 00. (3) There was an increase in the percentage <b>of</b> <b>affixed</b> words which were semantically opaque among the three categories of trade books. The percentage <b>of</b> semantically opaque <b>affixed</b> words increased as the competency level increased.
