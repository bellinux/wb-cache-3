25|$|In 1977, a {{graduate}} student in the computer science department named Bill Joy (MS 1982) assembled the original Berkeley Software Distribution, commonly known as BSD Unix. Joy, who went on to co-found Sun Microsystems, also developed the original version of the terminal console editor vi, while Ken Arnold (BA 1985) created Curses, a terminal control library for Unix-like systems that enables the construction of text user interface (TUI) applications. Working alongside Joy at Berkeley were undergraduates William Jolitz (BS 1997) and his future wife Lynne Jolitz (BA 1989), who together created 386BSD, a version of BSD Unix that runs on Intel CPUs and evolved into the BSD family of free operating systems and the Darwin operating system underlying Apple Mac OS X. Eric Allman (BS 1977, MS 1980) created SendMail, a Unix <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> that delivers about 12% of the email in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to its {{merging with}} macOS, the server edition macOS Server was architecturally {{identical}} to its desktop counterpart and usually ran on Apple's line of Macintosh server hardware. macOS Server included work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services, including a <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent,</b> a Samba server, an LDAP server, a domain name server, and others. With Mac OS X v10.7 Lion, all server aspects of Mac OS X Server have been {{integrated into the}} client version and the product re-branded as [...] "OS X" [...] (dropping [...] "Mac" [...] from the name). The server tools are now offered as an application.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> (MTAs) which {{forward mail}} can avoid {{generating}} backscatter {{by using a}} transparent SMTP proxy.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{comparison}} of <b>mail</b> servers: <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents,</b> <b>mail</b> delivery agents, and other computer software that provide e-mail services.|$|R
5000|$|Some email <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> {{will perform}} FCrDNS {{verification}} on the domain name {{given in the}} SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. See #HELO/EHLO checking.|$|R
50|$|The Postfix <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> {{operates}} as a pipeline of individually chrooted helper programs.|$|E
50|$|ZMailer is a SMTP <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> for Linux, BSD {{and other}} Unix-like systems.|$|E

50|$|Certified Server Validation (CSV) is a {{technical}} method of email authentication intended to fight spam. Its focus is the SMTP HELO-identity of <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} an MRA is not {{standardized}} in email architecture. Although they operate like <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents,</b> MRAs are technically clients when they retrieve and submit messages.|$|R
5000|$|Most e-mail <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> (server software) use a FCrDNS {{verification}} and {{if there}} is a valid domain name, put it into the [...] "Received:" [...] trace header field.|$|R
50|$|This {{article is}} about the email {{management}} business. For the <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> software, see sendmail.|$|E
50|$|In UNIX and UNIX-like environments OTRS {{works closely}} with system {{programs}} like the <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> Postfix or the mail filter procmail.|$|E
50|$|Postfix is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> (MTA) that routes and delivers electronic mail, intended {{as an alternative to}} Sendmail MTA.|$|E
5000|$|Most email <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> (<b>mail</b> servers) use a forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS) {{verification}} and {{if there}} is a valid domain name, put it into the [...] "Received:" [...] trace header field.|$|R
5000|$|A message {{will often}} pass through several <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> {{to reach the}} recipient. Each of these has to store the message before {{forwarding}} it on, and may therefore also impose size limits.|$|R
5000|$|Some e-mail <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> {{will perform}} FCrDNS {{verification}} on the domain name given on the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. This can violate RFC 2821 and so e-mail {{is usually not}} rejected by default.|$|R
5000|$|Spam {{can also}} be hidden inside a fake [...] "Undelivered mail notification" [...] which looks like the failure notices sent by a <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> (a [...] "MAILER-DAEMON") when it {{encounters}} an error.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1998 by Eric Allman, creator of the sendmail open source <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent,</b> to develop {{messaging}} solutions that provided greater security, compliance and reliability around email for the enterprise.|$|E
50|$|The Courier {{mail server}} is a <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> (MTA) server that {{provides}} ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, SMAP, webmail, and mailing list services with individual components. It {{is best known}} for its IMAP server component.|$|E
50|$|The State Threads {{library is}} a small {{application}} library which provides a foundation for writing fast and highly scalable Internet applications (such as web servers, proxy servers, <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents,</b> or any network-data-driven application) on Unix-like platforms.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a FQDA is: localpart@mailhost.example.com. The local part usually denotes a username, while the fully {{qualified}} domain name is used by <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> to determine the IP address of the host by querying the Domain Name System.|$|R
50|$|Some {{directory}} operations (including unlink(2)) are not synchronous on ReiserFS, {{which can}} result in data corruption with applications relying heavily on file-based locks (such as <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> qmail and Postfix) if the machine halts before it has synchronized the disk.|$|R
50|$|MeTA1 is a <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> (MTA) {{that has}} been {{designed}} with these main topics in minds: security, reliability, efficiency, configurability and extendibility. It supports the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) as specified by RFC 2821 and various extensions.|$|E
50|$|Linux server with SuSE Linux, the Apache HTTP Server, the Proxy server Squid, the <b>Mail</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Agent</b> Postfix, POP3 - and IMAP-Server Courier and a Samba Domain controller. This server is {{responsible}} for the educational network, which is administrated by Munich.|$|E
50|$|Exim is a <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> (MTA) used on Unix-like {{operating}} systems. Exim is {{free software}} distributed {{under the terms}} of the GNU General Public License, and it aims to be a general and flexible mailer with extensive facilities for checking incoming e-mail.|$|E
50|$|Although {{electronic}} mail servers and other <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> use SMTP to {{send and receive}} mail messages, user-level client mail applications typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying. For retrieving messages, client applications usually use either IMAP or POP3.|$|R
5000|$|Historically all <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> (MTAs) added {{their host}} {{name to the}} reverse path. In the Simple <b>Mail</b> <b>Transfer</b> Protocol (SMTP) this reverse path {{is also known as}} MAIL FROM, but paths were also used before and outside of SMTP, e.g. as bang paths in UUCP and Usenet (NetNews). All news {{articles}} still contain a Path header, example: ...|$|R
50|$|DNS serves other {{purposes}} {{in addition to}} translating names to IP addresses. For instance, <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> use DNS {{to find the best}} mail server to deliver e-mail. The domain to mail exchanger mapping provided by MX records may present an additional layer of fault tolerance and load distribution.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 2000s, UUCP over TCP/IP (often encrypted, {{using the}} SSH protocol) was {{proposed}} for use when a computer {{does not have}} any fixed IP addresses but is still willing to run a standard <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> (MTA) like Sendmail or Postfix.|$|E
5000|$|... ezmlm is {{mailing list}} {{management}} software (MLM) by Daniel J. Bernstein. It {{is similar to}} GNU Mailman and Majordomo but only works with the qmail <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agent.</b> It is released into the public domain. The latest version, 0.53, came out in 1997.|$|E
50|$|The service uses a massively-parallel grid {{infrastructure}} for email {{storage and processing}} through geographically dispersed data centers, enabling it to offer a 100% uptime service level agreement on all services. Its <b>Mail</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Agent</b> provides intelligent email routing based on server or user mailbox location.|$|E
5000|$|E-mail header: The text (body) is {{preceded by}} header lines {{indicating}} sender, recipient, subject, sending time stamp, receiving time stamps of all intermediate {{and the final}} <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents,</b> and much more. See RFC 5322 for details. Similar headers are used in Usenet (NNTP) messages, and HTTP headers.|$|R
50|$|An email {{agent is}} a program {{that is part of}} the email infrastructure, from {{composition}} by sender, to transfer across the network, to viewing by recipient. The best-known are mail user agents (MUAs, aka, email clients) and <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> (MTAs, programs that transfer email between clients), but finer divisions exist.|$|R
25|$|DNS serves other {{purposes}} {{in addition to}} translating names to IP addresses. For instance, <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> use DNS {{to find the best}} mail server to deliver e-mail: An MX record provides a mapping between a domain and a mail exchanger; this can provide an additional layer of fault tolerance and load distribution.|$|R
