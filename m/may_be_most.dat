5|$|Despite {{striking}} {{differences in}} appearance, S.parthenopion <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> {{closely related to}} S.nicholsi. Like the diminutive S.parthenopion in the Virgin Islands, S.nicholsi, the smallest endemic sphaerodactylid in Puerto Rico, is very small. The geographic range of another species, S.townsendi, divides these two closely related populations, suggesting that S.townsendi evolved after S.parthenopion and S.nicholsi diverged.|$|E
5|$|First {{collected}} in 1964, it was formally described in 2009. The species <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> {{closely related to}} O.concolor and O.mamorae, which are distributed further north and south in South America. Among other characters, the three share a particular arrangement of the arteries of the head. Virtually nothing is known of its biology.|$|E

5|$|Harold Clayton Urey (April 29, 1893 – January 5, 1981) was an American {{physical}} chemist whose pioneering work on isotopes {{earned him the}} Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 for the discovery of deuterium. He {{played a significant role}} in the development of the atom bomb, but <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> prominent for his contribution to theories on the development of organic life from non-living matter.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter through a large artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude the blood vessels. The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Some {{clinical}} guidelines recommend {{the use of}} RSTs in people with pharyngitis, but others do not. US guidelines are more consistently in favor of their use than their European equivalents. The use of RSTs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> beneficial in the third world, where the complications of streptococcal infection are most prevalent, but their use in these regions has not been well studied.|$|E

5|$|Transandinomys is a genus of rodents in {{the tribe}} Oryzomyini of family Cricetidae. It {{includes}} two species—T.bolivaris and T.talamancae—found in forests from Honduras in Central America {{south and east}} to southwestern Ecuador and northwestern Venezuela in northern South America. Until 2006, its members {{were included in the}} genus Oryzomys, but phylogenetic analysis showed that they are not closely related to the type species of that genus, and they have therefore been placed in a new genus. They <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> closely related to genera like Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys, which contain very similar species. Both species of Transandinomys have had eventful taxonomic histories.|$|E
5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> appropriate {{in people who}} have no underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E

25|$|Support {{during and}} {{immediately}} after childbirth can also help women initiate and continue breastfeeding while working through common concerns related to breastfeeding. This support can be non-medical, as doula care is. Culturally sensitive care (for example, care from a peer of a similar ethnic background) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> effective at encouraging high-risk women to breastfeed.|$|E
25|$|Gravitational {{circulation}} causes stratified high salinity {{water at}} depth to flow landward while low salinity water on top flows seaward. The effect of gravitational circulation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> pronounced {{during periods of}} high fresh water flow, providing a negative feedback for maintaining the salt field {{and the distribution of}} pelagic organisms in the estuary.|$|E

25|$|The disease <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> {{frequently}} {{transmitted to}} humans by eating food contaminated with the brain, spinal cord, or digestive tract of infected carcasses. However, the infectious agent, although most highly concentrated in nervous tissue, {{can be found}} in virtually all tissues throughout the body, including blood. When it has been transmitted to humans, it is known as new Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD or nvCJD), and by June 2014 it had killed 177 people in the United Kingdom, and 52 elsewhere, primarily in western Europe. Between 460,000 and 482,000 BSE-infected animals had entered the human food chain before controls on high-risk offal were introduced in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} {{pharmacogenomics}} tailored drug therapies <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> evident {{in a survey}} conducted by the Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University from February 1998 to April 2007. The study elucidated that an average of 82% of adults in the United States are taking at least one medication (prescription or nonprescription drug, vitamin/mineral, herbal/natural supplement), and 29% are taking five or more. The study suggested that those aged 65 years or older continue to be the biggest consumers of medications, with 17-19 % in this age group taking at least ten medications in a given week. Polypharmacy has also shown to have increased since 2000 from 23% to 29%.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the core}} {{character}} deficits of highly psychopathic individuals {{are likely to}} be highly incorrigible to the currently available treatment methods, the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be more amenable to management, the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in correctional settings. It has been suggested that the treatments that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>most</b> likely to be effective at reducing overt antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing the tangible, material value of prosocial behavior, with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants out of life in prosocial rather than antisocial ways. To this end, various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy, with mixed success. As psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction, reward-based management, in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings.|$|E
