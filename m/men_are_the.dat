5|$|In chapter 157 of Njáls saga, a {{man named}} Dörruð {{witnesses}} 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, {{and that they have}} set up a particular loom; the heads of <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> weights, the entrails of <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> warp and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called Darraðarljóð, which Dörruð memorizes.|$|E

25|$|In many cultures, {{inability}} to conceive bears a stigma. In closed social groups, {{a degree of}} rejection (or {{a sense of being}} rejected by the couple) may cause considerable anxiety and disappointment. Some respond by actively avoiding the issue altogether; middle-class <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most likely to respond in this way.|$|E
25|$|Customarily, <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{head of the}} {{household}} and from this role stems dominance within different cultures in South Africa. Laws have been passed and constitutions made to create and uphold equality between men and women. However, amongst the culture these ideals of equality aren't commonly practiced. Women are gradually gaining more recognition within the culture.|$|E
25|$|Somewhat further south, around Dibër and Kërçovë in Macedonia, the lahuta is not used, {{replaced}} by the çifteli, a two-stringed instrument in which one string {{is used for the}} drone and one for the melody. Though <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> traditional performers (exception made for the sworn virgins), women have increasingly been taking part in epic balladry.|$|E

25|$|However, some women, {{known as}} hetaeras, {{received}} a careful education {{so that they}} could have more complex conversations with men. The closest historical comparison for these women who were regarded higher than normal women, but lower than <b>men,</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> geisha of Japan. Among these was Aspasia of Miletus, who was the mistress of Pericles and is said to have debated with prominent writers and thinkers, including Socrates.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan is {{a patriarchal}} society where <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> primary {{authority}} figures {{and women are}} subordinate. Gender {{is one of the}} organizing principles of Pakistani society. Patriarchal values embedded in local traditions, religion and culture predetermine the social value of gender. Islam heavily influences gender roles in particular. An artificial divide between production and reproduction, made by the ideology of sexual division of labor, has placed women in reproductive roles as mothers and wives in the private arena of home and men in a productive role as breadwinners in the public arena.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{roles in}} {{traditional}} Bezanozano families are strictly defined. <b>Men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{active participants in}} discussions about public affairs, and are responsible for house construction, earning {{money to pay for}} basic family needs, and preparing the paddy fields for planting. Women are responsible for weaving, tending crops, collecting water, tending the hearth and preparing meals. Similarly, women were traditionally expected to follow behind when walking with a man. Bezanozano men working as porters used to believe that if a woman passed in front of him while he worked, he would be injured the next time he attempted to carry a load.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, women wearing hijab {{have been}} subject of verbal and {{physical}} attacks in Western countries, particularly following terrorist attacks. Louis A. Cainkar writes that the data suggest that women in hijab rather than <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> predominant target of anti-Muslim attacks {{not because they are}} more easily identifiable as Muslims, but because they are seen to represent a threat to the local moral order that the attackers are seeking to defend. Some women stop wearing hijab out of fear or following perceived pressure from their acquaintances, but many refuse to stop wearing it out of religious conviction even when they are urged to do so for self-protection.|$|E
25|$|In {{the post}} {{apartheid}} South Africa, {{construction of new}} schools in poorer townships often failed to include the construction of both indoor and outdoor sporting facilities. There might be some space set aside for a netball court or a soccer field, though {{that may be the}} only substitute available. The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for girls, soccer for boys and athletics for both genders. For coloured children, boys rank sport as the most important for things to do in their free time. In contrast, coloured girls rank playing sport as fourth in their list of priorities.|$|E
500|$|Marshall was not fond of Wilson, as he {{disagreed}} {{with him on}} a number of issues. Although Wilson invited Marshall to cabinet meetings, Marshall's ideas were rarely considered for implementation, and Marshall eventually stopped attending them regularly. In 1913 Wilson took the then unheard-of step of meeting personally with members of the Senate to discuss policy. [...] Before this, presidents used the vice president (who serves as president of the senate) as a go-between; Wilson used the opportunity to show that he did not trust Marshall with delicate business. In his memoir, Marshall's only negative comment towards Wilson was, [...] "I have sometimes thought that great <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> bane of civilization, they are the real cause of all the bitterness and contention which amounts to anything in the world". [...] Their relationship was described as one of [...] "functioning animosity".|$|E

500|$|The Promenade was {{refurbished}} in 1990 by Leslie Wright with a gilded {{ceiling and}} reliefs and brass lanterns, and was altered again in 2005 by Thierry Despont, who fitted {{it with an}} oval leather bar; it forms the grand entrance and has a length which is {{equal to that of}} Nelson's Column. Piano music is played throughout much of the day, with live jazz from 19:30. Afternoon tea, a tradition which has taken place at the hotel since its opening in 1931, is served {{every day of the week}} at five in the afternoon in the large Promenade and the Spatisserie, with guests seated in decorative upholstered sofas with low tables placed in front of them. The tables are set with elegant silver cutlery and crockery, with Corinthian columns made of marble, glittering chandeliers, French tapestries and potted plants in the background. Tea is served by waiters dressed in English-style long coats. Hollywood actor Charlton Heston, a frequent guest at the hotel, once commented on the aspect of service at the hotel: “The cooks and bakers, the clerks and porters, the maids and the flower ladies, the bell <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> hotel”.|$|E
500|$|ISIS {{is forced}} to quit mission {{training}} due to time constraints. After the space shuttle Intrepid exits out of the Earth's atmosphere, Drake introduces them to the blueprints of Horizon, which is overrun with so-called [...] "mutineers". Drake's plan is to fight past the mutineers and link up with his men on the bridge. The group is aided with an M41A pulse rifle, which is set into two modes: on kill mode, the weapon fires lethal plasma ammunition, while the weapon serves as a tranquilizer on stun mode. Indeed, stun mode can potentially initiate cardiac arrest, as proven when Archer accidentally shoots Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), who is later revived after defibrillation. The trajectory of the shuttle is off course from Horizon, which is later found {{to be caused by}} Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer) and Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), who are being harbored in cargo. Archer is then put on probation in the hold, after shooting Pam with his pulse rifle. As the Intrepid lands on a port on the Horizon, Lana, Cyril, and Ray Gillette (Adam Reed) enter into the spacecraft with Drake. Being overwhelmed by the number of mutineers, Archer later joins their endeavors after being released by Pam. The party successfully makes it to the bridge, where it is revealed that Drake and his <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> real mutineers, and his real plan was to lure Lana onto the station to become breeding stock for the colonization of Mars.|$|E
