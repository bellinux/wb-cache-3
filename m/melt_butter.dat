25|$|The {{cooking time}} depends {{primarily}} on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food {{that needs to be}} cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, {{it might be possible to}} <b>melt</b> <b>butter</b> in 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able to grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.|$|E

To last belong sodium chloride staying the formation of free fatty acids and also additionally contributable lactatecontaining additive. Laboratory studies were carried out in a certain way. A half of each batch of butter were remelted in two versions with the addition of sodium chloride up to 4 % by weight of the butter to precipitate proteins and without the addition of the salt. Food additive with the properties of animal origin products shelf life increase were supplemented into the <b>melted</b> <b>butter.</b> The rest manufacturing operations were performed by the traditional method of <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> production. It was evaluated the organoleptic characteristics and investigated fat phase acidity and fat peroxide number in the samples of <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> with a month interval. Also were determinated the transparency of test samples. All test samples in molten state were transparent, they didn't contain suspended particles. Results of the score were summarized and on the base of the total assessment were determinated quality of the product. The carried out researches of samples of <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> have shown the full conformance with requirements of GOST R 52971 on physicochemical parameters: the weight fraction of fat – 99 %, the weight fraction of moisture – 1 %. It was established that in the samples without food additive maximum values of acid number were received in a month of storage; and in the samples with additive - in 3 months of storage. It was determinated that in samples of butter rented without salting peroxide number increases more intensively than in other test samples. It has been determined increased storage stability of <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> with salt and food additive...|$|R
40|$|Summary. <b>Melted</b> <b>butter</b> is {{made from}} dairy butter by {{rendering}} the fat phase. It has specific taste and aroma, high-calorie content and good assimilability. Defects of butter which appeared during the storage causes {{by the development of}} microbiological processes or by the chemical oxidation. On the development of these processes influence quality and composition of fresh butter, its physical structure, content of the increased amount of gas phase and content of heavy metals, storage conditions. Microbiological spoilage of butter occurs generally due to damage of plasma which is good environment for the development of microorganisms. Defects of microbiological origin include: unclean, sour, moldy, yeasty, cheesy, bitter taste. Defects of test and smell chemical origin are formed due to hydrolytic digestion of lipids. It's prevailed at long storage of butter in the conditions of freezing temperatures. It's picked out the following main processes of spoiling: souring, acidifying and sallowness. Often these processes take place simultaneously. It has been investigated <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> with lactated additive. The latter improves the microbiological and toxicological safety, prolongs the storage condition of the products. Technological efficiency of the additives is achieved by a multilayer products formation from the inactive bound water, preventing microorganisms growth and by the barrier layer with lactate inhibiting hydrolytic reactions. Oil samples were obtained with the batch-type butter maker application, then they were melted and after that lactated additive were supplemented. It has been studied organoleptic and physico-chemical indices of the <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> samples. The fatty-acid composition of <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> were studied. Comparative analysis of fatty-acid composition of cow's milk fat and produced <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> has shown their similarity. Also in the last sample there is increased weight fraction of linoleic and linolenic acids. The obtained experimental data for <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> allow to conclude about its high quality...|$|R
