5|$|Timber was {{the chief}} {{building}} material in Han architecture. It was used for grand palace halls, <b>multi-story</b> towers, <b>multi-story</b> residential halls, and humble abodes. However, due to wood's rapid decay over time and susceptibility to fire, the oldest wooden buildings found in China (i.e. several temple halls of Mount Wutai) date no earlier than the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp describes the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, {{as well as the}} often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources used by historians for clues about non-existent Han architecture. What remains of Han-dynasty architecture are ruins of brick and rammed earth walls (including aboveground city walls and underground tomb walls), rammed earth platforms for terraced altars and halls, funerary stone or brick pillar-gates, and scattered ceramic roof tiles that once adorned timber halls. Sections of the Han-era rammed earth Great Wall still exist in Gansu province, along with the Han frontier ruins of thirty beacon towers and two fortified castles with crenellations. Han walls of frontier towns and forts in Inner Mongolia were typically constructed with stamped clay bricks instead of rammed earth.|$|E

Retailing in Davenport was changed by the inclusion of the automobile into mainstream America. In the late 1940s, parking meters were installed in downtown to encourage rotation of space between different users. Soon there were more cars then the street parking spaces could handle. In 1953, the first <b>multi-story</b> ramp was completed in the state, on the corner of Fifth Street and Brady Street.

5|$|J. Keijzer {{replaced}} de Vries {{after the}} latter's death in 1887 and headed {{the church for}} seven years. During his tenure, the church and surrounding grounds were expanded significantly. Construction of a <b>multi-story</b> presbytery began in the 1880s and completed on 1 August 1890. Across the street, in 1888 the nuns established an elementary school, and they also began construction of a chapel for the convent, which was opened on 6 August 1892. During this period the church building received stained glass windows and new pews. Further construction continued into the 20th century. A pipe organ was installed in 1903; it was restored in 1993, but remains in poor condition. Also installed that year were carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross.|$|E
40|$|In tall {{buildings}} design, lateral loads induced by wind or earthquake forces are often resisted by an outrigger system. This system is often chosen as its function by tying the structural components together to provide sufficient lateral stiffness {{to the structure}} and control the excessive drift due to the lateral load. This thesis is to analyze the behavior of two 30 stories residential buildings that interconnected by a link bridge which acted as an exterior outrigger system at different heights and also the outrigger system location optimization. A total of five models with different configuration of exterior outrigger system which interconnecting the two <b>multi-stories</b> buildings had been analyzed by using ETABS software program. There is one model with no outrigger system is applied, three models with outrigger system interconnected at different height locations which are level 10, level 20 and level 30 of the buildings respectively, and last model with outrigger system is applied at three levels which are level 10, 20 and 30. The modeling process {{was carried out in}} such a way that the behavior and performance of the structure was within the limitations suggested by BSI (2001) CP 3 : Chapter V- 2 : 1972. From the results, the percentage of reduction in lateral displacement is directly proportional to the number of level of outrigger system applied to the <b>multi-stories</b> buildings. By comparison, it is structurally efficient to locate an exterior outrigger system at the top of a building. Study has shown that it is indeed helpful in reducing the lateral displacement of building structure by applying the outrigger system as an exterior structural system for interconnecting between the <b>multi-stories</b> buildings...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} been {{developing}} a new structural wall with damage control capacities which include clack-preventing and self-centering for <b>multi-stories</b> buildings in seismic area. When reinforced concrete structural walls failed in large-scale earthquakes，the walls were damaged with apparent clacks. In order to prevent its severe cracks，we proposed to make slits laterally at both sides of {{lower end of the}} wall，and conducted cyclic loading tests of the walls. Although the load-deformation relations were obtained as the typical flexural-failure，the appearances of the specimens did not have significant cracks after the tests. The lateral slits {{at the bottom of the}} structural wall decreases its flexural c apacity and lateral stiffness to keep no clacks on the surface of the wall after cyclic loading. The maximum strengths are discussed from the points of views of flexural and shearing capacities of the ten test specimens which were already reported on our previous papers. The strengths are estimated by full plastic bendingmoments of the section of the end of the structural wall without considering the strength deterioration by shearing force. The clack-preventing capacity shown by the test results of our proposed wall gives the advantage to the design against shearing force effectively...|$|R
5|$|As {{the city}} of Kraków began to expand further {{under the rule of}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the new {{architectural}} styles also developed. Key buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries in Kraków include the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, the directorate of the Polish State Railways as well as the original complex of Kraków Główny railway station and the city's Academy of Economics. It was also at around that time that Kraków's first radial boulevards began to appear, with the city undergoing a large-scale program aimed at transforming the ancient Polish capital into a sophisticated regional centre of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. New representative government buildings and <b>multi-story</b> tenement houses were built at around that time. Much of the urban-planning beyond the walls of the Old Town was done by Polish architects and engineers trained in Vienna. Some major projects of the era include the development of the Jagiellonian University's new premises and the building of the Collegium Novum just west of the Old Town. The imperial style planning of the city's further development continued until the return of Poland's independence, following the First World War.

5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, <b>multi-story</b> houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} earlier {{renovation}} attempts, authorities were considering the complete demolition of the 130-year-old Christchurch Cathedral. The building had become structurally compromised {{due to the}} collapse of its western wall, and the strong vibration had shattered its stained glass rose window. Similar damage was inflicted to the Christchurch Arts Centre, although it had been in a precarious state prior to the event. A three-month reconstruction project was scheduled to take place starting in October 2011, with associated costs estimated at NZ$30 million (US$24 million). The tower of the historic Lyttelton Timeball Station, which sustained damage from the February 2011 earthquake, collapsed after plans to dismantle the building had been initiated. Lyttelton Port, a major harbour in the region, suffered additional damage from the tremors and opted to initiate full engineering assessments. The <b>multi-story</b> HSBC Tower shook considerably during the quake, though damage was limited to cracks and broken roof tiles. Artifacts from the Canterbury Museum collection were thrown into disorder by the aftershocks, several days after reordering work had been completed since the February 2011 earthquake.

40|$|AbstractThe {{earthquakes}} disasters basically occur due to buildings damage {{not because}} of the earth shaking. Therefore, the countries have being updated the seismic codes. The seismic loads for buildings design in Egyptian Code have been changed from (EC- 1994) to (ECP- 201, 2012). On the other hand, the need is raised to study the vulnerability of existing buildings, which can be divided into the buildings designed to resist the gravity loads only (GLD) and the buildings designed according to Egyptian code (EC- 1994). Comparison between forces due to Egyptian code for loads (EC- 1994) and (ECP- 201, 2012) is carried out on the <b>multi-stories</b> R. C. framed buildings which are {{the most common type of}} existing buildings in Egypt. To investigate the vulnerability of existing buildings, nonlinear static pushover analysis is conducted to evaluate the real strength of the existing buildings. Moreover, it is considered a useful and effective tool for the performance of three framed buildings: 3, 6 and 10 stories due to expected future earthquakes. Finally, it is found that the vulnerability of existing GLD buildings occurs at expected ground accelerations (ag) greater than 0. 125 g in Egyptian seismic map, while the EC- 94 designed buildings behave elastically up to (ag) equals to 0. 2 g and above that a slight damage may occur...|$|R
40|$|Throughout this {{semester}} I {{have worked on}} a multi-complex building which main purpose was to cater to the cultural arts and culinary needs of Venice, whilst also utilise the space available to its full potential, since my site is indeed the south-west corner of the famed Piazza San Marco. For the design, I {{have decided not to}} deviate too much from the surrounding architecture, taking the site into consideration, so for the look I eventually went with was more of a ‘modern take on a classical building’. The <b>multi-stories</b> restaurant, cafe, and performance arts centre, which I chose to work on proved quite challenging to design, as like many people, I took the original plan quite literally, and it inturn proved quite geometrically restricting. Finding enough space in the beginning, particularly for the performance studios proved to be quite difficult, if not a bit desperate. However, when the decision to extending the entire northern facade forward into a columnade was made, the problem of space was solved, and further design options emerged, like the joining of circulation, public, and private spaces with communal balconies overlooking the Piazza, giving visitors a wonderful viewing platform even if they’re not there to use the facilities. Week after week, I’ve had the opportunity to improve the program and the design my building, whilst I do believe I succeeded in planning out a functional building program and circulation system, I do however regret in not taking more risks with the overall design of the building, which in my opinion is a bit too conservative. Perhaps a more daring design would’ve given the building a more unique look, as well as the potential for a very interesting program. But overall I am pretty satisfied with the end product, considering the amount of time we were give. DESA 1002 (Design and Practice...|$|R
