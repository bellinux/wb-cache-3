5|$|Instability and {{violence}} marked the family: it moved frequently, {{and much of}} Lépine's early childhood was spent in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, where his father was working for a Swiss mutual funds company. The family returned to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock market crash led {{to the loss of}} much of the family's assets. Rachid was an authoritarian, possessive and jealous man, frequently violent towards his wife and his children. He had contempt for women and believed that they were intended only to serve men. He required his wife to act as his personal secretary, slapping her if she made any errors in typing, and forcing her to retype documents in spite of the cries of their toddler. He was also neglectful and abusive towards his children, particularly his son, and discouraged any tenderness, as he considered it spoiling. In 1970, following an incident in which Rachid struck Gamil so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, his mother decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976. Following the separation, Gamil lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Rachid defaulted on <b>mortgage</b> <b>payments.</b> Gamil was afraid of his father, and at first saw him on weekly supervised visits. The visits ended quickly, as Rachid ceased contact with his children soon after the separation. Gamil never again saw his father, and in the future refused to discuss him with others.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{diversification}} of financial instruments, the labor can adjust the <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> to maximize personal utility function. We derive the optimal asset allocation by the different <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment,</b> {{and find that}} the labors who are more risk averse tend to take conservative strategy of investment. Because of the variation of labor income and <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment,</b> the allocation of risky asset will show different. The labor will try to increase the tendency of saving from income and hesitate to hold risky asset, and so become more conservative. We also find when there is positive correlation between the current <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> and stock returns, the labor will increase the risky asset in his portfolio and exhibits more aggressive strategy. In other words, the more <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> and stock returns, the more risky asset the labor will hold in order to diversify the assets. On the other hand, the labor who reduces the <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> and find the stock return drop will re-evaluate the cost of risky assets. Finally, the labor will choose an aggressive strategy to allocate risky asset. Because of the different characteristic in everyone’s job situation, some labors can afford <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> persistently and some can not. Some labors may lose job in a harsh environment and {{are not able to}} pay the <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment.</b> From the three scenarios we discussed above, the labor will take conservative strategy when facing unemployment or retirement...|$|R

50|$|The key {{difference}} between a biweekly <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> plan and a traditional <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> plan is that instead of making 12 full payments each year, 26 half payments--the equivalent of 13 full payments--are made each year. On a biweekly <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> plan, some months will require 3 payments or 1 and one half traditional payments. Finance companies use this pattern to their advantage. Finance companies charge interest on a per diem basis instead of monthly. The consumer's repayment is scheduled on a monthly basis. This allows the finance companies to collect an additional 2 weeks of interest every year. Paying biweekly payments allows consumers to eliminate the additional accrued interest charges.|$|R

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s {{the volume}} of secured lending to {{households}} has expanded rapidly, both in absolute terms and in relation to household incomes. This paper examines the determinants of households' ability to service this stock of secured debt. It estimates a random effects probit model for the probability of households having <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> problems. It is found that past experience of payment problems increases {{the probability that the}} household has difficulties servicing its secured debt today. At the household level, becoming unemployed, interest income gearing of 20 % and above, high loan to value ratios and having a heavy burden of unsecured debt are all associated with a significantly higher probability of <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> problems. Saving regularly and having unsecured debt which is not a problem are both associated with a significantly lower probability of <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> problems. The only non-household-specific variable to have a significant effect is mortgage interest rates - the probability of payment problems increases with the level of mortgage interest rates. An aggregate measure of debt at risk is calculated. This has decreased between 1994 and 2002, as falls in the probability of <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> problems have more than offset increases in the stock of mortgage debt outstanding. It is found that the fall in the probability of <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> problems has been greatest among the most highly indebted households. ...|$|R

40|$|A common puzzling {{phenomenon}} {{over the}} household survey of Taiwan {{is that the}} renters' saving rate is {{higher than that of}} the owners', while the latter has a higher average income than the former. One reason for this feature is that certain housing owners have to pay a greater amount of <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment</b> that is not included in saving. And on the other hand, the saving decision is correlated with the tenure decision, while the tenure decision is also correlated with the household's life cycle, in addition to income. And therefore, when one tries to estimate the correct saving rate, he or she has to consider the household's life cycle as well. In this study, we apply a data set of the household survey of Taiwan to investigate the correlation of life cycle, <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment,</b> and forced savings. First of all, we estimate the saving rate in a traditional way, and then estimate the saving rate after the adjustment of <b>mortgage</b> <b>payment.</b> To figure out the correct saving rate with the tenure decision, we evaluate different households' saving behaviors according to different cohorts, and consequently, we could check how life cycle plays its role in this model. And our finding is, that for every cohort, the forced savings is significant for owners with mortgage and for renters as well. Life Cycle, <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Payment,</b> Forced Savings...|$|R
