5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is <b>most</b> <b>helpful</b> if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E

25|$|Adoption of telepharmacy in Canada {{began as}} a {{response}} to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in Cranbrook, British Columbia, in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation. Remote dispensing machines for medication began operation in Ontario, Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes. As of 2009, a hospital in Ontario, Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is <b>most</b> <b>helpful.</b>|$|E

500|$|Shelley's {{trips to}} Italy were {{a way for}} her to revisit {{memories}} of her dead husband, Percy Shelley, and the children they had buried there. Moskal argues that Shelley needed to [...] "expiate" [...] her survivor guilt and Dolan {{that she needed to}} recover from a damaging trauma. Shelley writes about this in Rambles, using the trope of a pilgrimage; she believes that travelling to Italy and revisiting the scenes of her youth will cure her of her depression, writing, [...] "Besides all that Rome itself affords of delightful [...] to the eye and imagination, I revisit it as the bourne of a pious pilgrimage. The treasures of my youth lie buried here." [...] Shelley's pilgrimage follows in the tradition of Chaucer as well as the nineteenth-century trend to visit spas for healing, and like most pilgrimage narratives, hers does not relate the journey home. For Shelley, ultimately the <b>most</b> <b>helpful</b> part of travelling and visiting spas was seeing the beautiful scenery. In Rambles, Shelley contends that interacting with picturesque scenery can heal the body. Both the 1840 and 1842 trips followed times of ill health for Shelley and she used them as a way to recover both emotionally and physically. She opens Rambles by describing her poor health and hoping that by travelling her [...] "mind will... renew the outworn and tattered garments in which it has long been clothed".|$|E
500|$|Skanderbeg, {{the ruler}} of Albania (...) , had served for several years in the Ottoman army, as both soldier and commander, before {{returning}} to his homeland and beginning an uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1444. The Second Battle of Kosovo in 1448 had ended with the defeat of John Hunyadi, voivode of Transylvania while Skanderbeg and his forces were on their way; but did not arrive due to his army being blocked off by Đurađ Branković, {{and so he was}} unable to provide help; Hunyadi engaged the Ottomans thinking Skanderbeg was not coming. In reparation, Skanderbeg ravaged Brankovic's domains. As a result of the defeat, the Ottomans were free from Hungarian pressure, which had been limited to Belgrade and its environs. In 1455, Skanderbeg laid siege to Berat, a fortress which had been seized from his control in 1450. The result was catastrophic for the Albanians who succumbed to an Ottoman counterattack upon Skanderbeg's temporary departure from the main force. Alfonso V of Aragon, Skanderbeg's <b>most</b> <b>helpful</b> and important ally, also suffered a blow to his ambitions which included a pan-Mediterranean empire. The Albanians, however, were able to recover their morale when Pope Calixtus III, who had begun to worry that his plans for crusade would be undermined, promised to aid Skanderbeg.Before the planned crusade commenced, Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror (...) decided to march against Hungary and Albania. In April 1456, Skanderbeg sent Pal Engjëlli, his ambassador to the West, with a letter to Cardinal Domenico Capranica informing the Holy See of his need for aid. The Ottoman invasion came in May 1456 when Moses Golemi, Skanderbeg's former captain who had deserted after loss of Berat, met Skanderbeg's men at the Battle of Oranik. The force was defeated and, through a show of mercy, Golemi was allowed to return to the Albanian ranks without punishment. In July 1456 Mehmed marched a large army to besiege Hungarian-held Belgrade in Serbia, but was defeated by Hunyadi. Later that year, İbrahim II of the Karamanid Dynasty tried to create an anti-Ottoman alliance which would include his realm, Skanderbeg, Hunyadi, Calixtus, and Alfonso, all of whom would act in concert to defeat the sultan. The plans were never put to practice, however.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} social supports that HIV-infected persons find helpful and unhelpful, {{and the size}} and composition of networks along the disease continuum. Ninety six HIV-infected and 33 seronegative gay men were interviewed. The HIV continuum was represented by seronegative, HIV asymptomatic and symptomatic groups. Emotional and physical support were the <b>most</b> frequently identified <b>helpful</b> supports. Symptomatic persons identified physical support as helpful more often than asymptomatic persons. Availability, acceptance and nurturing were the <b>most</b> frequently identified <b>helpful</b> emotional support behaviours, while domestic support was the most frequently identified physical support behaviour.

Composition of the networks of HIV-infected persons differed from that of seronegative participants, in that the former had markedly more professional and family persons and fewer friends in their network. HIV education and counselling interventions should provide emotional support, facilitate physical support for symptomatic persons, offer support that matches specific needs, include significant others, incorporate peer-help and be gay-sensitive.

Results: Consulting a primary care practitioner, counsellor or psychologist; seeking the advice of a (female) family member or friend; getting advice about diet and nutrition; and taking vitamins and minerals were the interventions <b>most</b> often considered <b>helpful.</b> Participants were less positive about the benefits of psychiatristsand were ambivalent about the use of psychotropic medication.

Content analysis identified <b>most</b> and least <b>helpful</b> educational methods by reason. Bivariate and logistic regression analysis compared clinician characteristics to method preferences.; Most frequently, clinicians named case-based behavioral simulations as "most helpful" and video as "least helpful" training methods.
