5|$|Human {{beings are}} seen as a <b>microcosm</b> of the universe, and for example {{comprise}} the Wu Xing in form of the zang-fu organs. As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web <b>microcosm</b> studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E

Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
40|$|Desulfomonile tiedjei and Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans {{were chosen}} as model {{bacteria}} {{to demonstrate the}} introduction of an anaerobic microbia reductive dechlorination activity into nonsterile soil slurry <b>microcosms</b> by inoculation. De novo 3 -chlorobenzoate dechlorination activity was established with the bacterium D. tiedjei in <b>microcosms</b> normally devoid of this dechlorination capacity. The addition of D. tiedjei to <b>microcosms</b> supplemented with 20 mM pyruvate as the cosubstrate resulted in total biotransformation of 1. 5 mM 3 -chlorobenzoate within 7 days. The introduction of the bacterium Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans into nonsterile <b>microcosms</b> resulted in a shortening of the period required for dechlorination activity to be established. In <b>microcosms</b> inoculated with Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans, total degradation of 6 mM 3 -chloro- 4 -hydroxy phenoxyacetic acid (3 -Cl- 4 -OHPA) was observed after 4 days {{in contrast to the}} result in noninoculated <b>microcosms,</b> where the total degradation of 3 -Cl- 4 -OHPA by indigenous microorganisms was observed after 11 days.

40|$|Vertical soil <b>microcosms</b> {{flushed with}} {{groundwater}} {{were used to}} study the influence of water movement on survival and transport of a genetically engineered Pseudomonas fluorescens C 5 t strain through a loamy sand and a loam soil. Transport of cells introduced into the top 1 cm of the vertical soil <b>microcosms</b> was dependent on the {{flow rate of water}} and the number of times <b>microcosms</b> were flushed with groundwater. The presence of wheat roots growing downward in the <b>microcosms</b> contributed only slightly to the movement of P. fluorescens C 5 t cells to lower soil regions of the loamy sand <b>microcosms,</b> but enhanced downward transport in the loam <b>microcosms.</b> Furthermore, the introduced P. fluorescens C 5 t cells were detected in the effluent water samples even after three flushes of groundwater and 10 days of incubation. As evidenced by a comparison of counts from immunofluorescence and selective plating, nonculturable C 5 t cells occurred in day 10 soil and percolated water samples, primarily of the loamy sand <b>microcosms.</b> Vertical soil <b>microcosms</b> that use water movement may be useful in studying the survival and transport of genetically engineered bacteria in soil under a variety of conditions prior to field testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} Co, Ni, Cu and Zn from {{synthetic}} industrial wastewater was studied in subsurface flow constructed wetland <b>microcosms</b> filled with gravel or a gravel/straw mixture. Half of the <b>microcosms</b> were planted with Phragmites australis and half were left unplanted. All <b>microcosms</b> received low-strength wastewater (1 mg L- 1 of Co, Ni, and Zn, 0. 5 mg L- 1 Cu, 2, 000 mg L- 1 SO 4) during seven 14 -day incubation batches. The pore water was regularly monitored at two depths for heavy metals, sulphate, organic carbon and redox potential. Sorption properties of gravel and straw were assessed {{in a separate}} experiment. A second series of seven incubation batches with high-strength wastewater (10 mg L- 1 of each metal, 2, 000 mg L- 1 SO 4) was then applied to saturate the substrate. Glucose {{was added to the}} gravel <b>microcosms</b> together with the high-strength wastewater. Sorption processes were responsible for metal removal during start-up, with the highest removal efficiencies in the gravel <b>microcosms.</b> The lower initial efficiencies in the gravel/straw <b>microcosms</b> were presumably caused by the decomposition of straw. However, after establishment of anaerobic conditions (Eh~- 200 mV), precipitation as metal sulphides provided an additional removal pathway in the gravel/straw <b>microcosms.</b> The addition of glucose to gravel <b>microcosms</b> enhanced sulphate reduction and metal removal, although Phragmites australis negatively affected these processes in the top-layer of all <b>microcosms...</b>|$|R
5|$|There {{was much}} consternation {{when it was}} {{demolished}} in 1989, after Mayor Richard M.

The McCarthy Building, a Chicago Landmark, was even stripped of landmark status over the objection of preservationists and public interest groups {{in order for the}} block to be cleared. Due to Block 37's central location in the Loop, between the State Street retail district, the city/county government complex, and the Randolph Street theater district, its history is a <b>microcosm</b> of the city's history. Block 37 was a nearly vacant city block from 1989 until 2005 after several attempts at redevelopment failed due to Chicago politics and insufficient funding of several past developers. The single remaining building from the pre-1989 Block 37 architecture is an active Commonwealth Edison transformer building that distributes power to a great portion of the Loop.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} of the Ten Wings is the Great Commentary (Dazhuan) or Xi ci, which dates to roughly 300 BC. The Great Commentary describes the I Ching as a <b>microcosm</b> of the universe and a symbolic description of the processes of change. By partaking in the spiritual experience of the I Ching, the Great Commentary states, the individual can understand the deeper patterns of the universe. Among other subjects, it explains how the eight trigrams proceeded from the eternal oneness of the universe through three bifurcations. The other Wings provide different perspectives on essentially the same viewpoint, giving ancient, cosmic authority to the I Ching. For example, the Wenyan provides a moral interpretation that parallels the first two hexagrams, 乾 (qián) and 坤 (kūn), with Heaven and Earth, and the Shuogua attributes to the symbolic function of the hexagrams the ability to understand self, world, and destiny. Throughout the Ten Wings, there are passages that seem to purposefully increase the ambiguity of the base text, pointing to a recognition of multiple layers of symbolism.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a <b>microcosm</b> of that 'world museum'.|$|E
40|$|Vegetated (with Kandelia candel seedlings) and non-vegetated {{mangrove}} <b>microcosms</b> {{were employed}} to remove pyrene from contaminated sediments, {{and the effects of}} adding 6. 7 % humic acid (HA) on such removal were investigated. At the end of 6 -month treatment, residual pyrene concentrations in surface sediments (0 - 2 cm) of the contaminated <b>microcosms</b> reduced from an initial 5. 82 to 0. 63 μgg - 1 dw, and the reduction was less in HA amended <b>microcosms</b> with the residual pyrene concentration remained at 3. 12 μgg - 1 dw. The pyrene removal percentages in <b>microcosms</b> with HA amendment were 29 % for surface aerobic sediments and 41 % for bottom (anaerobic) sediments, while the respective removal percentages in <b>microcosms</b> without HA amendment were 89 % (surface sediments) and 53 % (bottom sediments). <b>Microcosms</b> planted with K. candel seedlings had a significantly higher pyrene removal when compared to the non-vegetated ones, and the average removal percentages were 70. 9 % and 61. 4 %, respectively. However, when humic acid was added, no significant difference was found between vegetated and non-vegetated <b>microcosms</b> in pyrene removal, both had less than 40 % removal, probably because plant growth in humic acid amended contaminated <b>microcosms,</b> in terms of total biomass, was reduced by 50 %). Roots of K. candel could accumulate pyrene from contaminated <b>microcosms,</b> and pyrene concentrations in roots harvested from <b>microcosms</b> with and without humic acid addition were 6. 01 and 3. 46 μgg - 1 dw, respectively. These results suggest that the addition of HA to contaminated sediments decreased the mangrove <b>microcosm's</b> ability to remove pyrene as pyrene was more tightly bound to the organic matter and plant growth was reduced. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The <b>microcosms</b> contained 225 μm filtered seawater maintained in 1 liter glass bottles attached to a plastic frame and immersed at 3 m under the sea surface. Synechococcus and picoeukaryote population dynamics in <b>microcosms</b> and the surrounding water were compared. A bloom-like behaviour observed for Synechococcus in these phytoplankton <b>microcosms</b> was avoided when 10 % of the culture volume was replaced, every two days, by filtered seawater. After 2 weeks, {{no significant difference in}} Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes cell counts was observed in <b>microcosms</b> compared to the surrounding free seawater. Synechococcus fluorescence at 545 nm (phycoerythrobilin) fluctuated with a similar pattern in such <b>microcosms</b> and in free seawater and were shown to be correlated to light intensity fluctuations over a two week experiment. The in situ <b>microcosms</b> were used to study the impact of low copper additions.

40|$|The {{addition}} of nutrients to accelerate biodegradation of oil is an adequate strategy {{to clean up}} polluted mangrove soils which pollutes mangrove soils. However, the hydrology of these ecosys-tems might interfere with such strategy. The effect of flooding frequency and nutrient addition on hydrocarbon removal in mangrove sediments was investigated in this study. <b>Microcosms</b> con-sisted of pots with 5 kg of fresh mangrove sediments and one seedling of Avicennia germinans.

5|$|The {{remains at}} Jarlshof {{represent}} {{thousands of years}} of human occupation, and {{can be seen as a}} <b>microcosm</b> of Shetland history. Other than the Old House of Sumburgh (see below) the site remained largely hidden until a storm in the late 19th century washed away part of the shore, and revealed evidence of these ancient buildings. Formal archaeological excavation started in 1925 and Jarlshof was one of two broch sites which were the first to be excavated using modern scientific techniques between 1949–52. Although the deposits within the broch had been badly disturbed by earlier attempts, this work revealed a complex sequence of construction from different periods. Buildings on the site include the remains of a Bronze Age smithy, an Iron Age broch and roundhouses, a complex of Pictish wheelhouses, a Viking longhouse, and a mediaeval farmhouse. No further excavations have been undertaken since the early 1950s and no radiocarbon dating has been attempted.|$|E
5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a <b>microcosm</b> of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, {{the game}} was {{designed}} with an overseas release in mind. Among the early ideas created for the title was {{for it to be}} set in New York City, inspired by John Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York. This was vetoed as it would not offer much variety in its cast. To enable an international cast, it was decided to set the game in Antarctica. This choice of setting was also made to depict the danger posed by the Schwarzwelt on a worldwide scale. This setting differed greatly from previous Shin Megami Tensei games, which had taken place in Tokyo. It was also chosen as the North Pole had no widespread landmass, making it an impractical setting. When developing the character drama, the team took inspiration from another film by Carpenter, 1982's The Thing. The moral alignment system, a staple in earlier Shin Megami Tensei entries, was reintroduced for Strange Journey to help players experience the game's themes. The central cast acted as both a <b>microcosm</b> of humanity and representation of the game's alignments. Due to the setting, the characters had to be members of a Special Forces group, as opposed to previous protagonists who had been average people. The game includes a larger presence of science fiction elements than in previous Shin Megami Tensei games. Various elements within the game were inspired by science fiction movies: the Red Sprite was inspired by the main vehicle from the 1977 film Damnation Alley, and some equipment was inspired by James Cameron's 1986 film Aliens. The characters' firearms were all modeled after real-life guns. Elaborating on how the science fiction elements complemented rather than clashed with the mystical elements of Shin Megami Tensei, Kaneko stated that he felt that the series had always had elements of those two genres merging, commenting that some people saw a web URL as something like a magical incantation and referencing a quote from Arthur C. Clark about technology becoming so advanced that it looked like magic.|$|E

40|$|Nitrate is {{emerging}} as a possible health benefactor. Especially the microbial conversion of nitrate to nitrite in the oral cavity and the subsequent conversion to nitric oxide in the stomach are {{of interest in this}} regard. Yet, how nitrate influences the composition and biochemistry of the oral ecosystem is not fully understood. To investigate the effect of nitrate on oral ecology, we performed a 4 -week experiment using the multiplaque artificial mouth (MAM) biofilm model. This model was inoculated with stimulated saliva of two healthy donors. Half of the <b>microcosms</b> (n[*]=[*] 4) received a constant supply of nitrate, while the other half functioned as control (n[*]=[*] 4). Additionally, all <b>microcosms</b> received a nitrate and sucrose pulse, each week, on separate days to measure nitrate reduction and acid formation. The bacterial composition of the <b>microcosms</b> was determined by 16 S rDNA sequencing. The origin of the saliva (i. e., donor) showed to be the strongest determinant {{for the development of the}} <b>microcosms.</b> The supplementation of nitrate was related to a relatively high abundance of Neisseria in the <b>microcosms</b> of both donors, while Veillonella was highly abundant in the nitrate-supplemented <b>microcosms</b> of only one of the donors. The lactate concentration after sucrose addition was similarly high in all <b>microcosms,</b> irrespective of treatment or donor, while the concentration of butyrate was lower after nitrate addition in the nitrate-receiving <b>microcosms.</b> In conclusion, nitrate influences the composition and biochemistry of oral <b>microcosms,</b> although the result is strongly dependent on the inoculum...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} two differing marine sediments (one clayey, the other sandy) to {{attenuate}} the explosive 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), dissolved in intertidal seawater {{from the eastern}} English coast of the North Sea, was examined using aerobic <b>microcosms.</b> Analysis of the seawater from the <b>microcosms</b> revealed an initial sharp decline in TNT concentration with clayey sediment in both sterilized (to prevent microbial activity) and unsterilized <b>microcosms.</b> This effect did not occur to such a marked extent in similar sterile and non-sterile sandy sediment <b>microcosms</b> and was attributed mainly to sorption of TNT to the fine clay particles of the clayey sediment. As time progressed, the attenuation of TNT in <b>microcosms</b> containing either type of sediment {{was found to be}} less in those that had been sterilized compared with those where microbial action proceeded unhindered. Feeding the <b>microcosms,</b> (i. e. supplying extra carbon sources for the microbial communities), appeared to have a small, but perceptible, enhancing effect upon TNT dissipation. The attenuation of TNT was also measured in large <b>microcosms</b> containing 2. 5 L of seawater and no sediment. Analysis of the seawater revealed a gradual decline in TNT concentration in non-sterile and fed <b>microcosms</b> compared to their sterile counterpart.

In the Elodea-dominated <b>microcosms</b> the species composition of the periphytic algae diverged from that of the control following treatment with 0. 5 % spray drift emission of the label-recommended rate (5 % for lambda-cyhalothrin), while reduced growth of M. spicatum in the Lemna-dominated <b>microcosms</b> was recorded at 2 % drift (20 % for lambda-cyhalothrin).

Mutans streptococci (MS) and total viable counts, pH of the spent medium, capacity of lactate formation and integrated mineral loss in dentin was assessed. MLPA was used for identification and relative quantification of 20 oral microorganisms in the <b>microcosms.</b> Principal Component Analysis was applied to MLPA data. Results LGG inhibited the growth of S. mutans in dual species biofilms and did not affect the pH. LGG established in saliva-derived <b>microcosms</b> and reduced MS counts significantly, but did not affect pH or dentin demineralization. Simultaneous growth of the <b>microcosms</b> with LGG under heavy cariogenic conditions (suc+) introduced a compositional shift in the microbial community. The CFU, real-time PCR and MLPA data correlated significantly. Conclusion We conclude that LGG established into and inhibited the growth of MS in complex saliva-derived biofilms, but this had no significant effect on cariogenic potential of the <b>microcosms.</b> This suggests that other microorganisms besides MS were responsible for increased cariogenicity of sucrose-exposed biofilms...|$|R
