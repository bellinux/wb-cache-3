Most existing material handling equipment is only semi-automated because a human operator is needed for tasks like loading/unloading and driving that are difficult and/or too costly to fully automate, although ongoing advances in sensing, machine intelligence, and robotics have made it possible to fully automate an increasing number of handling tasks. A rough guide to determine how much can be spent for automated equipment that would replace one <b>material</b> <b>handler</b> is to consider that, with benefits, the median moving machine operator costs a company $45,432 per year.

We pair two single-row assembly lines due to the shared usage of several workstations, thus obtaining an optimum configuration by considering the material flow of the two rows simulta-neously. The problem deals with assigning workstations to a sequence and selecting the best arrangement by looking at the length and width for each workstation.

40|$|In today's compliant-driven environment, {{fissionable}} <b>material</b> <b>handlers</b> are {{inundated with}} work control {{rules and procedures}} in carrying out nuclear operations. Historically, human errors {{are one of the}} key contributors of various criticality accidents. Since moving and handling fissionable materials are key components of their job functions, any means that can be provided to assist operators in facilitating fissionable material moves will help improve operational efficiency and enhance criticality safety implementation. From the criticality safety perspective, operational issues have been encountered in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) plutonium operations. Those issues included lack of adequate historical record keeping for the fissionable material stored in containers, a need for a better way of accommodating operations in a research and development setting, and better means of helping <b>material</b> <b>handlers</b> in carrying out various criticality safety controls. Through the years, effective means were implemented including better work control process, standardized criticality control conditions (SCCC) and relocation of criticality safety engineers to the plutonium facility. Another important measure taken was to develop a computer data acquisition system for criticality safety assessment, which {{is the subject of this}} paper. The purpose of the Criticality Special Support System (CSSS) is to integrate many of the proven operational support protocols into a software system to assist operators with assessing compliance to procedures during the handling and movement of fissionable materials. Many nuclear facilities utilize mass cards or a computer program to track fissionable material mass data in operations. Additional item specific data such as, the presence of moderators or close fitting reflectors, could be helpful to fissionable <b>material</b> <b>handlers</b> in assessing compliance to SCCC's. Computer-assist checking of a workstation material inventory against the designated SCCC to enhance the material movement was also recognized. The following three additional functions of the CSSS were requested by operational personnel: additional record keeping, assisting room inventory Material at Risk (MAR) calculations and generating the material label to be placed on a storage can. In 1998, a preliminary CSSS concept was presented to all key stakeholders for the feasibility of such an application. Subsequently, the CSSS was developed with full participation of all stakeholders including fissionable <b>material</b> <b>handlers.</b> In 2003, five CSSS workstations were deployed in the plutonium facility for beta testing and resolving any issues from the field uses. Currently, the CSSS is deployed in all laboratories in the LLNL Plutonium Facility. Initial deployment consists of only a few of the full system functions described in this paper.

Positioning of the extruder or <b>material</b> <b>handler</b> is mostly carried out by standard anthropomorphic robots or large-scale gantries. Cable-driven parallel robots (CDPR) can be an efficient alternative to these positioning solutions, being capable of automated motions in six degrees of freedom and easily relocated.

40|$|Formal {{modelling}} {{techniques that}} employ principles of finite state automata have been increasingly used for shop-floor control. These approaches have {{focused primarily on}} unmanned systems where the self-contained logic {{for control of the}} systems is embedded within the model(s). To date, human operators are seldom configured within the modelling detail required for these systems. The result has been that the interface of humans within automatic systems has been limited. In general, humans performing physical activities in an automatic system must mimic the detailed responses normally transmitted via control computers and equipment, making the human interaction painful and prone to error. This paper discusses (1) the formal modelling specifics required for the control of such an automated shop floor system; and (2) the role and interactions of the human primarily in automatic systems. The human in the automatic manufacturing system addressed here serves primarily as a <b>material</b> <b>handler</b> and material transporter, providing almost unlimited possibilities regarding the accessibility of product flow from any system resource to any other system resource—a major constraint in many operational systems.

40|$|Although {{simulation}} is {{a popular}} tool for modelling and analysing modern manufacturing systems, to model shop floor control systems (SFCSs) in simulation requires quite costly efforts, since {{they are responsible for}} resolving various decision problems, such as deadlock, part dispatching, and resource conflict. The objective of the paper is to address a conceptual framework necessary to generate a WITNESS simulation model automatically from graph-based process plans and resource configurations. A graph-based process plan is used to capture part operations, their related resource requirements, and their temporal precedence relationships. A WITNESS simulation model is a graphical representation of shop floor resources with the part flow logic embedded within each resource element. To generate a WITNESS model, a process plan is automatically converted into a machine-centered part routeing graph (MCPRG) and then a transport-tending part routeing graph (TTPRG). The MCPRG implies part flows among machines, in which a node represents a machine and an edge represents a part route. The TTPRG implies part flows among machines and material handling devices, in which a node represents either machine or <b>material</b> <b>handler,</b> and an edge represents a part route. From the TTPRG, the part's input and output rules for each resource can be automatically extracted and plugged into the WITNESS model. The approach proposed in the paper enables manufacturers to generate a simulation model rapidly and effectively for performance measurement, such as bottleneck identification, work in progress, throughput times, dynamic resource utilization, and deadlock, of the SFCSs. close 101...|$|E
40|$|At MD Company (Singapore), {{the syringe}} value stream faces {{escalating}} labor cost and high labor turnover. Two labor allocations were proposed previously to optimize current labor resources, {{with the aim}} of controlling the labor cost effectively without affecting the production. Proposal Two, which had demonstrated significant increase in productivity and reduced labor cost through computer simulations, entailed an addition of two workers each in the new dedicated inspector and <b>material</b> <b>handler</b> job designations. The associated new job scopes combine tasks which are currently assigned broadly to production technicians working on the syringe production floor. A work study approach was undertaken with the broad aim of reducing waste from the new job scopes, as well as to verify headcount used in the simulation of Proposal 2. Dedicating tasks to individuals presented opportunities to reduce repetition and to achieve collective savings via changes in methods. Within the work study, a method study provided a theoretical basis of how best to carry out the new job scopes, while a time study established time needed to perform a given set of tasks. Results found were consistent with that from simulation of Proposal 2. Further improvements were made in reducing inspection cycle time through streamlining of inspections. Identification and separation of tasks which are not performed constantly paved the way for one of the two material handlers to be hired on an overtime basis.

A mathematical model is first formulated to represent the research problem. The model is a binary and general integer non-linear programming model, and it belongs to the class of NP-hard problem. Therefore, a higher level heuristic algorithm, based on the concept known as tabu search, is developed to efficiently solve the problems with industry merit. Incorporating the features associated with the tabu search, resulted in developing six different versions of the heuristic solution algorithm.

40|$|The 2011 {{review of}} the INL Criticality Safety Program has {{determined}} that the program is robust and effective. The review was prepared for, and fulfills Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) item H. 20, 'Annual Criticality Safety Program performance summary that includes the status of assessments, issues, corrective actions, infractions, requirements management, training, and programmatic support. ' This performance summary addresses the status of these important elements of the INL Criticality Safety Program. Assessments - Assessments in 2011 were planned and scheduled. The scheduled assessments included a Criticality Safety Program Effectiveness Review, Criticality Control Area Inspections, a Protection of Controlled Unclassified Information Inspection, an Assessment of Criticality Safety SQA, and this management assessment of the Criticality Safety Program. All of the assessments were completed {{with the exception of}} the 'Effectiveness Review' for SSPSF, which was delayed due to emerging work. Although minor issues were identified in the assessments, no issues or combination of issues indicated that the INL Criticality Safety Program was ineffective. The identification of issues demonstrates the importance of an assessment program to the overall health and effectiveness of the INL Criticality Safety Program. Issues and Corrective Actions - There are relatively few criticality safety related issues in the Laboratory ICAMS system. Most were identified by Criticality Safety Program assessments. No issues indicate ineffectiveness in the INL Criticality Safety Program. All of the issues are being worked and there are no imminent criticality concerns. Infractions - There was one criticality safety related violation in 2011. On January 18, 2011, it was discovered that a fuel plate bundle in the Nuclear Materials Inspection and Storage (NMIS) facility exceeded the fissionable mass limit, resulting in a technical safety requirement (TSR) violation. The TSR limits fuel plate bundles to 1085 grams U- 235, which is the maximum loading of an ATR fuel element. The overloaded fuel plate bundle contained 1097 grams U- 235 and was assembled under an 1100 gram U- 235 limit in 1982. In 2003, the limit was reduced to 1085 grams citing a new criticality safety evaluation for ATR fuel elements. The fuel plate bundle inventories were not checked for compliance prior to implementing the reduced limit. A subsequent {{review of the}} NMIS inventory did not identify further violations. Requirements Management - The INL Criticality Safety program is organized and well documented. The source requirements for the INL Criticality Safety Program are from 10 CFR 830. 204, DOE Order 420. 1 B, Chapter III, 'Nuclear Criticality Safety,' ANSI/ANS 8 -series Industry Standards, and DOE Standards. These source requirements are documented in LRD- 18001, 'INL Criticality Safety Program Requirements Manual. ' The majority of the criticality safety source requirements are contained in DOE Order 420. 1 B because it invokes all of the ANSI/ANS 8 -Series Standards. DOE Order 420. 1 B also invokes several DOE Standards, including DOE-STD- 3007, 'Guidelines for Preparing Criticality Safety Evaluations at Department of Energy Non-Reactor Nuclear Facilities. ' DOE Order 420. 1 B contains requirements for DOE 'Heads of Field Elements' to approve the criticality safety program and specific elements of the program, namely, the qualification of criticality staff and the method for preparing criticality safety evaluations. This was accomplished by the approval of SAR- 400, 'INL Standardized Nuclear Safety Basis Manual,' Chapter 6, 'Prevention of Inadvertent Criticality. ' Chapter 6 of SAR- 400 contains sufficient detail and/or reference to the specific DOE and contractor documents that adequately describe the INL Criticality Safety Program per the elements specified in DOE Order 420. 1 B. The Safety Evaluation Report for SAR- 400 specifically recognizes that the approval of SAR- 400 approves the INL Criticality Safety Program. No new source requirements were released in 2011. A revision to LRD- 18001 is planned for 2012 to clarify design requirements for criticality alarms. Training - Criticality Safety Engineering has developed training and provides training for many employee positions, including fissionable material handlers, facility managers, criticality safety officers, firefighters, and criticality safety engineers. Criticality safety training at the INL is a program strength. A revision to the training module developed in 2010 to supplement MFC certified fissionable material handlers (operators) training was prepared and presented in August of 2011. This training, 'Applied Science of Criticality Safety,' builds upon existing training and gives operators a better understanding of how their criticality controls are derived.

However, response to psychosocial risk factors may be dependent on the individual’s per-sonality type that, in turn, can affect muscle recruitment and spine loading. This study explores how personality might be associated with spine loading during repetitive lifting performed throughout an entire work shift. PURPOSE: Assess spine loading as a function of an individual’s personality type during repeti-tive, long-term exposure to a materials handling tasks. STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory experiment where experienced and inexperienced participants per-formed repetitive, asymmetric lifts at various load and lift frequency levels throughout a series of 8 -hour exposure periods. Spine loads were monitored throughout the work period. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twelve novice and 12 experienced <b>materials</b> <b>handlers</b> who were asymptom-atic for back pain. OUTCOME MEASURES: Spine compression, anterior-posterior (A/P) shear, and lateral shear at the L 5 –S 1 level. METHODS: Participants were categorized into personality types based upon the Myers-Brigg...|$|R
