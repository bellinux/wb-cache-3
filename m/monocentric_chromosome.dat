40|$|Giant cell reparative {{granuloma}} (GCRG) is {{an uncommon}} lesion most often affecting the jaw {{but also the}} small bones of the hands and feet. GCRG overlaps clinically and radiographically with other giant cell-rich tumors such as giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) and aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC). In the only case of a cytogenetically investigated GCRG reported previously, a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 4 and X was found. In the present study, chromosome banding and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) analyses were used to characterize the primary lesion and local recurrence of a GCRG in the thumb and skin biopsy of a 45 -year-old woman. The skin showed a normal karyotype. Various forms of a dic(8; 22) containing 8 q, 22 q, and smaller or larger parts of 8 p were found in both GCRG samples. In addition, ring chromosomes, most often composed of chromosome I I material, and telomeric associations were found. The latter aberrations were more frequent in the primary lesion. Normal FISH signals were seen when using probes capable of detecting USP 6 rearrangernents. The variant 8; 22 aberrations were interpreted to originate from an unstable dic(8; 22) (p 23;p 11) that gradually evolved into a functionally <b>monocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> in the dominating subset of cell populations. We conclude that our case of GCRG shared several cytogenetic characteristics with GCTB but none with ABC. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In most eukaryotes, {{centromere}} {{is determined}} by the presence of the centromere-specific histone variant CenH 3. Two types of chromosome morphology are generally recognized with respect to centromere organization. <b>Monocentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> possess a single CenH 3 -containing domain in primary constriction, whereas holocentric chromosomes lack the primary constriction and display dispersed distribution of CenH 3. Recently, metapolycentric chromosomes have been reported in Pisum sativum, representing an intermediate type of centromere organization characterized by multiple CenH 3 -containing domains distributed across large parts of chromosomes that still form a single constriction. In this work, we show that this type of centromere is also found in other Pisum and closely related Lathyrus species, whereas Vicia and Lens genera, which belong to the same legume tribe Fabeae, possess only <b>monocentric</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> We observed extensive variability in the size of primary constriction and the arrangement of CenH 3 domains both between and within individual Pisum and Lathyrus species, with no obvious correlation to genome or chromosome size. Search for CenH 3 gene sequences revealed two paralogous variants, CenH 3 - 1 and CenH 3 - 2, which originated from a duplication event in the common ancestor of Fabeae species. The CenH 3 - 1 gene was subsequently lost or silenced in the lineage leading to Vicia and Lens, whereas both genes are retained in Pisum and Lathyrus. Both of these genes appear to have evolved under purifying selection and produce functional CenH 3 proteins which are fully colocalized. The finding...|$|R

Holocentric chromosomes are scattered throughout the plant and animal kingdoms, and may be products of convergent evolution.

40|$|Organisms that {{reproduce}} sexually must {{reduce their}} chromosome number by half during meiosis to generate haploid gametes. To achieve this reduction in ploidy, organisms must devise strategies to couple sister chromatids {{so that they}} stay together during the first meiotic division (when homologous chromosomes separate) and then segregate away from one another during the second division. Here we review recent findings that shed light on how Caenorhabditis elegans, an organism with holocentric chromosomes, deals with these challenges of meiosis by differentiating distinct chromosomal subdomains and remodeling chromosome structure during prophase. Furthermore, we discuss how features of chromosome organization established during prophase affect later chromosome behavior during the meiotic divisions.

In-depth analysis of the meiotic divisions of Rhynchospora pubera and R. tenuis reveals that during meiosis I sister chromatids are bi-oriented, display amphitelic attachment to the spindle and are subsequently separated.

40|$|A {{centromere}} is {{a specialized}} chromosomal region, where transiently a multi-protein complex, the kineto-chore, assembles {{to which the}} spindle microtubules at-tach. Proper spindle microtubule attachment ensures faithful transmission of one sister chromatid to each daughter cell during mitosis. Establishment of active cen-tromeres and their maintenance is primarily defined epigenetically by the incorporation of the centromere-specific histone H 3 variant CENH 3, originally termed CENP-A (mammalian centromere protein A) [Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985], into centromeric nucleosomes [for review see Allshire and Karpen, 2008].

40|$|Having one {{and only}} one {{centromere}} per chromosome is essential for proper chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis.

Using a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence combined with FISH (IF-FISH) on metaphase chromosome spreads, we demonstrate that centromere inactivation has evolved on a neo-Y chromosome fusion in the Japan Sea threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus nipponicus). We found that the centromere derived from the ancestral Y chromosome has been inactivated. Our data further suggest that there have been genetic changes to this centromere in the two million years since the formation of the neo-Y chromosome, but it remains unclear whether these genetic changes are a cause or consequence of centromere inactivation...|$|R

40|$|Nucleosomes {{containing}} the centromere-specific histone H 3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A) create the chromatin foundation for kinetochore assembly. To understand the mechanisms that selectively target CENP-A to centromeres, {{we took a}} functional genomics approach in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, in which failure to load CENP-A results in a signature kinetochore-null (KNL) phenotype. We identified a single protein, KNL- 2, that is specifically required for CENP-A incorporation into chromatin. KNL- 2 and CENP-A localize to centromeres throughout the cell cycle in an interdependent manner and coordinately direct chromosome condensation, kinetochore assembly, and chromosome segregation. The isolation of KNL- 2 –associated chromatin coenriched CENP-A, indicating their close proximity on DNA. KNL- 2 defines a new conserved family of Myb DNA-binding domain–containing proteins. The human homologue of KNL- 2 is also specifically required for CENP-A loading and kinetochore assembly but is only transiently present at centromeres after mitotic exit. These results implicate a new protein class in the assembly of centromeric chromatin and suggest that holocentric and <b>monocentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> share a common mechanism for CENP-A loading...|$|R

In addition, these species express two different variants of the CenH 3 protein which are co-localized in multiple domains along the poleward surface of the primary constrictions. Here we show that the constrictions represent a distinct type of chromatin differing from the chromosome arms. In metaphase, histone phosphorylation patterns including H 3 S 10 ph, H 3 S 28 ph and H 3 T 3 ph were observed along the entire constriction, in a way similar to holocentric chromosomes. On the other hand, distribution of phosphorylated H 2 AT 120 was different from that previously reported from either, holocentric and <b>monocentric</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> occurring at chromatin surrounding but not overlapping CenH 3 domains. Since some of these phosphorylations play a role in chromatid cohesion, it can be assumed that they facilitate correct chromosome segregation by ensuring that multiple separate CenH 3 domains present on the same chromatid are oriented towards the same pole. The constrictions also displayed distinct patterns of histone methylation marks, being enriched in H 3 K 9 me 2 and depleted in H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 2 compared to the chromosome arms. High resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed that although both CenH 3 protein variants are present in all CenH 3 domains detected on metaphase chromosomes, they are only partially co-localized while there are chromatin subdomains which are mostly made of only one CenH 3 variant.

40|$|The {{force for}} poleward {{chromosome}} motion during mitosis {{is thought to}} act, in all higher organisms, exclusively through the kinetochore. We have used time-lapse. video-enhanced, differential interference contrast light microscopy to determine the behavior of kinetochore-free "acentric" chromosome fragments and "monocentric" chromosomes containing one kinetochore, created at various stages of mitosis in living higher plant (Haemanthus) cells by laser microsurgery. Acentric fragments and <b>monocentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> generated during spindle formation and metaphase both moved towards the closest spindle pole at a rate (approximately 1. 0 microm/min) similar to the poleward motion of anaphase chromosomes. This poleward transport of chromosome fragments ceased near the onset of anaphase and was replaced. near midanaphase, by another force that now transported the fragments to the spindle equator at 1. 5 - 2. 0 microm/min. These fragments then remained near the spindle midzone until phragmoplast development, at which time they were again transported randomly poleward but now at approximately 3 microm/min. This behavior of acentric chromosome fragments on anastral plant spindles differs from that reported for the astral spindles of vertebrate cells, and demonstrates that in forming plant spindles, a force for poleward chromosome motion is generated independent of the kinetochore. The data further suggest that the three stages of non- kinetochore chromosome transport we observed are all mediated by the spindle microtubules. Finally, our findings reveal that there are fundamental differences between the transport properties of forming mitotic spindles in plants and vertebrates...|$|R

Due {{to the presence of}} two primary constrictions, they are inherently unstable and overcome their instability by epigenetically inactivating and/or deleting one of the two centromeres, thus resulting in functionally <b>monocentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> that segregate normally during cell division. Our understanding to date of dicentric chromosome formation, behavior and fate has been largely inferred from observational studies in plants and humans as well as artificially produced de novo dicentrics in yeast and in human cells. We investigate the most recent product of a chromosome fusion event fixed in the human lineage, human chromosome 2, whose stability was acquired by the suppression of one centromere, resulting in a unique difference in chromosome number between humans (46 chromosomes) and our most closely related ape relatives (48 chromosomes). Using molecular cytogenetics, sequencing and comparative sequence data, we deeply characterize the relicts of the chromosome 2 q ancestral centromere and its flanking regions, gaining insight into the ancestral organization that can be easily broadened to all acrocentric chromosome centromeres. Moreover, our analyses offered the opportunity to trace the evolutionary history of rDNA and satellite III sequences among great apes, thus suggesting a new hypothesis for the preferential inactivation of some human centromeres, including IIq.

This region usually spans up to a few Mbp composed mainly of centromere-specific satellite DNA common to all chromosomes of a given species. In holocentric chromosomes, there is no primary constriction; the centromere is composed of many CenH 3 loci distributed along the entire length of a chromosome. Using correlative fluorescence light microscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy, we show that pea (Pisum sativum) chromosomes exhibit remarkably long primary constrictions that contain 3 - 5 explicit CenH 3 -containing regions, a novelty in centromere organization. In addition, we estimate that the size of the chromosome segment delimited by two outermost domains varies between 69 Mbp and 107 Mbp, several factors larger than any known centromere length. These domains are almost entirely composed of repetitive DNA sequences belonging to 13 distinct families of satellite DNA and one family of centromeric retrotransposons, all of which are unevenly distributed among pea chromosomes. We present the centromeres of Pisum as novel "meta-polycentric" functional domains. Our results demonstrate that the organization and DNA composition of functional centromere domains can be far more complex than previously thought, do not require single repetitive elements, and do not require single centromere domains in order to segregate properly. Based on these findings, we propose Pisum as a useful model for investigation of centromere architecture and the still poorly understood role of repetitive DNA in centromere evolution, determination, and function...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} newborn {{monozygotic}} twins with a Noonan-like phenotype, and multiple congenital anomalies {{due to a}} <b>monocentric</b> recombinant <b>chromosome</b> 18. The mother carried a paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 18, inv(18) (q 21. 1 q 22. 3). Cytogenetic, fluorescent in situ hybridization, comparative genomic hybridization and DNA marker analyses allowed the delineation of the deleted (18 q 22. 3 -qter) and duplicated (18 q 12. 1 -q 21. 1) chromosomal regions in the recombinant chromosome 18, and suggest that this duplication-deletion chromosome 18 resulted from breakage of a dicentric recombinant chromosome 18 with subsequent reconstitution of telomeric sequences on the long arm. Marked variability is observed in the phenotypic expression of the same chromosomal anomaly in these monozygotic twins. The clinical findings of these patients are compared with those reported in proximal 18 q-duplication and distal 18 q-deletion patients. The clinical features of both infants are compatible with Noonan syndrome, suggesting that a locus for this syndrome may be located on the long arm of chromosome 18. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 05 Centromeres are {{the primary}} {{constriction}} observed on many chromosomes, and they are required for normal cell division. Having one and only one centromere per chromosome is essential for proper chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. Chromosomes containing two centromeres (dicentric) often mis-segregate during cell division, resulting in aneuploidy or chromosome breakage. Dicentric chromosomes can be stabilized by centromere inactivation, a process which re-establishes <b>monocentric</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> There are two proposed mechanisms of centromere inactivation: a solely epigenetic mechanism involving loss of the centromeric histone, also called centromere protein A (CENP-A), or a genetic mechanism involving deletion or mutation of centromeric DNA. However, {{little is known about}} this process in naturally occurring dicentric chromosomes. For my dissertation, I characterized the mechanism of centromere inactivation on a Y chromosome-autosome fusion (referred to as a neo-Y chromosome) that has been fixed in Japan Sea threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus nipponicus). In order to characterize the Japan Sea neo-Y chromosome, I first needed to identify the threespine stickleback centromeric DNA sequence. Centromere sequences exist as gaps in many genome assemblies due to their repetitive nature. Thus, I took an unbiased approach utilizing CENP-A chomatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing to identify the centromeric repeat sequence in the closely related Pacific Ocean threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). A 186 -bp, AT-rich repeat was validated as centromeric using both fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence combined with FISH (IF-FISH) on interphase nuclei and metaphase spreads. This repeat (GacCEN) hybridizes strongly to the centromere on all chromosomes, with the exception of weak hybridization to the Y chromosome. To test whether epigenetic or genetic inactivation has occurred on the Japan Sea neo-Y chromosome, I used a combination of GacCEN FISH and CENP-A immunofluoresence on metaphase chromosome spreads. I demonstrated that there has been epigenetic inactivation of the centromere derived from the Y chromosome on the Japan Sea neo-Y chromosome. Furthermore, my data suggest that there may be genetic changes to the centromere derived from the ancestral Y chromosome, potentially contributing to its inactivation. Together, my work provides the first validated sequence information for the threespine stickleback centromere. Additionally, the Japan Sea stickleback neo-Y {{is one of the few}} examples of a naturally-occurring and stable dicentric chromosome involving two functionally important chromosomes that shows evidence for centromere inactivation. It is also one of the first examples showing centromere inactivation as a potential mechanism used to maintain a chromosome fusion that may play a role in the process of speciation between the Pacific Ocean and Japan Sea sticklebacks...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome {{structure}} and behaviour in both meiosis of the germ cells and mitosis of the embryo from fertilisation to the two-cell stage in Bursaphelenchus xylophilus were examined by DAPI staining and three-dimensional reconstruction of serial-section images from confocal laser-scanning microscopy. By this method, each chromosome’s shape and behaviour were clearly visible in early embryogenesis from fertilisation through {{the formation and}} fusion of {{the male and female}} pronuclei to the first mitotic division. The male pronucleus was bigger than that of the female, although the oocyte is larger and richer in nutrients than the sperm. From the shape of the separating chromosomes at anaphase, the mitotic chromosomes appeared to be polycentric or holocentric rather than <b>monocentric.</b> Each <b>chromosome</b> was clearly distinguishable in the male and female germ cells, pronuclei of the one-cell stage embryo, and the early embryonic nuclei. The haploid number of chromosomes (N) was six (2 n = 12), and all chromosomes appeared similar. The chromosome pair containing the ribosomal RNA-coding site was visualised by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Unlike the sex determination system in Caenorhabditis elegans (XX in hermaphrodite and XO in male), the system for B. xylophilus may consist of an XX female and an XY male...|$|R
