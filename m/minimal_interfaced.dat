40|$|An {{important}} current {{movement in}} computing is towards mobile and ubiquitous interaction. A major research field within mobile and ubiquitous computing is <b>minimal</b> attention <b>interfaces.</b> At present however, {{there is little}} in the way of validated heuristics to inform the design and implementation of <b>minimal</b> attention user <b>interfaces.</b> A paradigmatic example of a challenging mobile interaction task is physical navigation. A potentially promising solution to the problem of providing a <b>minimal</b> attention <b>interface</b> for physical navigation tasks is spatial audio. The initial focus of this research is to investigate the use of spatial audio as an element in a <b>minimal</b> attention <b>interface</b> to provide usable and meaningful navigation cues in one or more common navigational contexts.

Introduction A COMPUTER AIDED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING tool (or CASE tool) is a drawing tool used to produce and manage diagrams representing a software system's design. A CASE tool typically embodies the definitions {{of one or more}} software development methodologies. The tool allows a designer to enter diagrams in the method's notation, checks the diagrams for consistency, and may generate code or produce diagrams from pre-existing code. Unfortunately, providing information to a CASE tool often serves to subvert the design process. For example, Jim Coplien [3] recommends that key [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{promotion}} of membrane fusion by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) requires {{an interaction between}} the viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins, although the mechanism by which this interaction regulates fusion is not clear. The NDV HN protein exists as a tetramer composed {{of a pair of}} dimers. Based on X-ray crystallographic studies of the NDV HN globular domain (S. Crennell et al., Nat. Struct. Biol. 7 : 1068 - 1074, 2000), it was proposed that the protein undergoes a significant conformational change from an initial structure having minimal intermonomeric contacts to a structure with a much more extensive dimer interface. This conformational change was predicted to be integral to fusion promotion with the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> form required to maintain F in its prefusion state until HN binds receptors. However, no evidence for such a conformational change exists for any other paramyxovirus attachment protein. To test the NDV model, we have engineered a pair of intermonomeric disulfide bonds across the dimer interface in the globular domain of an otherwise non-disulfide-linked NDV HN protein by the introduction of cysteine substitutions for residues T 216 and D 230. The disulfide-linked dimer is formed both intracellularly {{and in the absence of}} receptor binding and is efficiently expressed at the cell surface. The disulfide bonds preclude formation of the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> form of the protein and yet enhance both receptor-binding activity at 37 °C and fusion promotion. These results confirm that neither the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> form of HN nor the proposed drastic conformational change in the protein is required for fusion...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{trend in}} {{interactive}} modeling of 3 D shapes {{from a single}} image is designing <b>minimal</b> <b>interfaces,</b> and accompanying algorithms, for modeling a specific class of objects. Expanding upon the range of shapes that existing <b>minimal</b> <b>interfaces</b> can model, we present an interactive image-guided tool for modeling shapes made up of extruded parts. An extruded part is represented by extruding a closed planar curve, called base, in the direction orthogonal to the base. To model each extruded part, the user only needs to sketch the projected base shape in the image. The main technical contribution is a novel optimization-based approach for recovering the 3 D normal of the base of an extruded object by exploring both geometric regularity of the sketched curve and image contents. We developed a convenient interface for modeling multi-part shapes and a method for optimizing the relative placement of the parts. Our tool is validated using synthetic data and tested on real-world images.

40|$|Abstract Secure initial {{pairing of}} {{electronic}} gadgets is a challenging problem, especially considering {{lack of any}} common security infrastructure. The main security issue is the threat of so-called Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks, whereby an attacker inserts itself into the pairing protocol by impersonating one of the legitimate parties. A number of interesting techniques have been proposed, all of which involve the user in the pairing process. However, they are inapplicable to many common scenarios where devices to-be-paired do not possess required interfaces, such as displays, speakers, cameras or microphones. In this paper, we introduce BEDA (Button-Enabled Device Association), a protocol suite for secure pairing devices with <b>minimal</b> user <b>interfaces.</b> The most common and <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> available on wide variety of devices is a single button. BEDA protocols can accommodate pairing scenarios where one (or even both) devices only have a single button as their “user interface”.

To the extent it is possible, binding with particular contextual parameters such as data type, storage size, implementation algorithms, communication methods, operating environment, etc. should be postponed until the component integration time when performance optimization is made.

40|$|In a world full {{of mobile}} and smart devices, enabled to {{communicate}} with each other over wireless channels, secure pairing of two devices is of prime importance. The main threat is the so-called Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, where an attacker inserts it-self into the pairing protocol and impersonates one of the legitimate parties.

40|$|A {{temporal}} interface for {{a system}} component is a finite automaton that specifies the legal sequences of input events. We evaluate and compare three different algorithms for automatically extracting the temporal interface from the transition graph of a component: (1) a game algorithm that computes the interface as {{a representation of the}} most general environment strategy to avoid a safety violation; (2) a learning algorithm that repeatedly queries the component to construct the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> automaton; and (3) a CEGAR algorithm that iteratively refines an abstract interface hypothesis by adding relevant state information from the component. Since algorithms (2) and (3) have been published in different software contexts, for comparison purposes, we present the three algorithms in a uniform finitestate setting. We furthermore extend the three algorithms to construct maximally permissive interface automata, which accept all legal input sequences. While the three algorithms have similar worst-case complexities, their actual running times differ greatly depending on the component whose interface is computed. On the theoretical side, we provide families of components that exhibit exponential differences in the performance of the three algorithms. On the practical side, we evaluate the three algorithms experimentally on a variety of real world examples. Not surprisingly, the experimental evaluation confirms the theoretical expectation: learning performs best if the <b>minimal</b> <b>interface</b> automaton is small; CEGAR performs best if only few component variables are needed to prove an interface hypothesis safe and permissive; and the direct (game) algorithm outperforms both approaches if neither is the case...|$|R
