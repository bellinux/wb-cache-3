50|$|In the 1950s, Wald and {{his colleagues}} used {{chemical}} methods to extract pigments from the retina. Then, using a spectrophotometer, {{they were able to}} measure the light absorbance of the pigments. Since the absorbance of light by retina pigments corresponds to the wavelengths that best activate photoreceptor cells, this experiment showed the wavelengths that the eye could best detect. However, since rod cells make up most of the retina, what Wald {{and his colleagues}} were specifically measuring was the absorbance of rhodopsin, the main photopigment in rods. Later, with a technique called microspectrophotometry, he was able to <b>measure</b> <b>the</b> <b>absorbance</b> directly from cells, rather than from an extract of the pigments. This allowed Wald to determine the absorbance of pigments in the cone cells (Goldstein, 2001).|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} photometers are used: {{spectrophotometer}} and filter photometer.
