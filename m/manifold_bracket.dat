40|$|In 1974, Berezin {{proposed}} a quantum theory for dynamical systems having a Kähler manifold as their phase space. The system states were represented by holomorphic functions on the manifold. For any homogeneous Kähler manifold, the Lie algebra of its group of motions may be represented either by holomorphic differential operators ("quantum theory"), or by functions on the <b>manifold</b> with Poisson <b>brackets,</b> {{generated by the}} Kähler structure ("classical theory").

The stress trajectory is a coadjoint orbit on the Poisson manifold under a coadjoint action by the Lie-group SO(n).

Accordingly, we can construct numerical schemes to automatically preserve the yield-surface for perfect plasticity, for isotropic hardening material, {{as well as for}} an anisotropic elastic–plastic model. Then, we describe an anisotropic elastic–plastic material model without entering the work-hardening range and deforming under a specified dissipation rate, which can be achieved through a stress-dependent feedback control law of strain rate...|$|R

40|$|When {{a set of}} {{particles}} are moving in a potential field, two aspects are concerned: 1) the relative motion of particle in spatial domain; 2) the particle velocity variations in time domain. The difficulty on treating the systems is originated {{from the fact that}} the motion in time domain and the motion in spatial domain are coupled together completely. Generally, for a Hamilton dynamic system established by a set of general velocity functions, several abstract theories have been well established, such as Lie algebra, Symplectic <b>manifold,</b> Poisson <b>brackets,</b> and others. However, mathematically, to find out a general Hamilton function is very difficult even for very simple problems. Inspired by these abstract mathematic researches, the Hamilton dynamic system is studied by geometrical field theory of deformation. Firstly, referring to the instant configuration, the deformation tensor in spatial domain and the velocity transformation tensor in time domain are established for a dynamic system defined by a set of general velocity functions. Secondly, the general deformation tensor in velocity space domain is obtained. From continuum mechanics point, the stress tensor is defined through introducing background feature of space. Then, the general motion equations are established. Based on them, the simple motions are divided into two classes: 1) stable motion; and 2) radiating motion. Both of them have quantum solution structures. The features of space-time continuum are studied to obtain some intrinsic understanding about basic physical facts. This research shows an engineering way to treat the Hamilton dynamic system. Comment: 32 pages, no figure...|$|R
40|$|In the Hamiltonian {{formulation}} of general relativity, Einstein's equation {{is replaced by}} a set of four constraints. Classically, the constraints can be identified with the generators of the hypersurface-deformation Lie algebroid (HDA) that belongs to the groupoid of finite evolutions in space-time. Taken over to deformed general relativity, this connection allows one to study possible Drinfeld twists of space-time diffeomorphisms with Hopf-algebra techniques. After a review of noncommutative differential structures, two cases [...] - twisted diffeomorphisms with standard action and deformed (or -) diffeomorphisms with deformed action [...] - are considered in this paper. The HDA of twisted diffeomorphisms agrees with the classical one, while the HDA obtained from deformed diffeomorphisms is modified due to the explicit presence of -products in the brackets. The results allow one to distinguish between twisted and deformed symmetries, and they indicate that the latter should be regarded as the relevant symmetry transformations for noncommutative <b>manifolds.</b> The algebroid <b>brackets</b> maintain the same general structure regardless of space-time noncommutativity, but they still show important consequences of non-locality...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a natural}} {{sequence}} of CY manifolds that are double covers of the projective g dimensional spaces ramified over 2 g+ 2 hyperplanes. We observe {{that some of them}} are obtained as quotient of the action of the semi-direct product of g- 1 copies of cyclic Z/ 2 Z groups with the symmetric g group on the product of g-copies of hyper-elliptic curves of genus g. The quotient is a double cover of the projective g space ramified over 2 g+ 2 hyperplanes. This construction generalizes the construction of a Kummer surface. The Kodaira-Spencer classes on the Jacobian are invariant under the action of the group. Thus they form a basis of Kodaira-Spencer classes on the CY <b>manifold.</b> Since the <b>bracket</b> of any Kodaira-Spencer classes on the Jacobian are zero, then they will be zero on the CY manifold.

40|$|For the Jordan algebra of {{hermitian}} matrices {{of order}} n> 2, we let X be its submanifold consisting of rank-one semi-positive definite elements. The {{composition of the}} cotangent bundle map π_X: T^*X→ X with the canonical map X→CP^n- 1 (i. e., the map that sends a hermitian matrix to its column space), pulls back the Kähler form of the Fubini-Study metric on CP^n- 1 to a real closed differential two-form ω_K on T^*X. Let ω_X be the canonical symplectic form on T^*X and μ be a real number. A standard fact says that ω_μ:=ω_X+ 2 μ ω_K turns T^*X into a symplectic manifold, hence a Poisson <b>manifold</b> with Poisson <b>bracket</b> {, }_μ.

Consequently one obtains the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector for the classical U(1) -Kepler problem with level n and magnetic charge μ. Since the McIntosh-Cisneros-Zwanziger-Kepler problems (MICZ-Kepler Problems) are the U(1) -Kepler problems with level 2, the work presented here is a direct generalization of the work by A. Barut and G. Bornzin [J. Math. Phys. 12 (1971), 841 - 843] on the classical dynamic symmetry for the MICZ-Kepler problems. Comment: 19 page...|$|R
