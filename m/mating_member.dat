40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} Coupled Magnetic-S tructural {{analysis}} of Magnetic pulse welding proces s applied on a tubular workpiece. The study investigates the various criteria required for a successful weld bet ween the <b>mating</b> <b>members</b> through a Finite element model developed us ing COMSOL Multiphysics. The transient electromagne tic field phenomenon is coupled sequentially with mecha nical phenomenon. The coupling between the magnetic field and the electrical circuit is formulated in the ele ctromagnetic part of the model, whereas in the stru ctural part, the impact velocities, the effective plastic strain ind uced in the workpiece and the direction and magnitu de of the shear stress at the impact zone are found from the numeri cal simulations. A viscoplastic material model with rate dependent material properties is considered in the structural part. The effect of varying process para meters: input voltage and air {{gap between the two}} <b>mating</b> <b>members</b> on weld quality are computed through numerical simu lations. Based on the results of the numerical simulations a n optimal weldability window is suggested...|$|R

50|$|Prior to <b>mating,</b> <b>members</b> of {{this species}} engage in a {{courtship}} dance that can last for several minutes and sometimes an entire day or more. As part of this ritual the scorpions repeatedly raise and cross their tails, push and pull at one another, and then separate. Eventually, {{after a series of}} contractions, the male produces an off-white spermatophore, which contains sperm and hardens on contact with air. After this packet of sperm is introduced to the female's genital opening she becomes aggressive towards her mate and sometimes devours him in an episode of sexual cannibalism.|$|R

40|$|A {{possible}} {{procedure is}} proposed, which basically refers to tribological variables {{commonly used in}} engineering screen tests and in principle allows extended use of experimental wear data from the ball on disc standard system when the reference configuration has different geometry (e. g. flat pin on disc pairs) or nominal sliding conditions. The method is approximated and has been conceived to simplify comparative analysis of wear behaviour, in particular at equal nominal pressure. Expressing the ratio of wear constants {{on the basis of}} geometrical experimental variables for sphere and disc, it also aims to reduce time consumption in profilometry sessions and to split real-time linear wear curves for <b>mating</b> <b>members</b> from the overall approach pattern.

50|$|Reinforcement is {{the process}} by which natural {{selection}} reinforces reproductive isolation. In sympatry, reinforcement increases species discrimination and sexual adaptation in order to avoid maladaptive hybridization and encourage speciation. If hybrid offspring are either sterile or less-fit than non-hybrid offspring, <b>mating</b> between <b>members</b> of two different species will be selected against. Natural selection decreases the probability of such hybridization by selecting for the ability to identify mates of one's own species from those of another species.|$|R
40|$|The peak contact {{stresses}} {{are addressed}} that are {{developed from the}} frictionless press fit of a shaft subjected to bending into an elastically similar hub with bore rounded edges. The non-linear behavior of this progressive contact is addressed by scaling a local solution available from the literature, {{with the aid of}} intermediate, auxiliary problems extracted from the fracture mechanics realm. The title problem being linear on the global domain with both the bending couple and the interference, this problem is solved by combining the FE forecasts obtained for two separate load cases, i. e. a) the interference alone and, b) the bending couple alone. Such results are expressed in terms of a) stress intensity factors for the auxiliary FM problems, and b) hoop strain component, as sampled in the proximity of the indenting edge for both the <b>mating</b> <b>members.</b> Design formulae for the contact stresses are proposed, that account for various normalized geometrical parameters, such as the outer to inner hub radii ratio, the radius of the hub bore fillet, and the contact length. Comprehensive coefficient tables are provided as well. Finally, an error analysis for the proposed method is presented...|$|R

40|$|A Bayesian {{method for}} QTL {{analysis}} that {{is capable of}} accounting for heterogeneity of variance between sexes, is introduced. The Bayesian method uses a parsimonious model that includes scaling parameters for polygenic and QTL allelic effects per sex. Furthermore, the method employs a reduced animal model to increase computational efficiency. Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques were applied to obtain estimates of genetic parameters. In comparison with previous regression analyses, the Bayesian method 1) estimates dispersion parameters and polygenic effects, 2) uses individual observations instead of offspring averages, and 3) estimates fixed effect levels and covariates and heterogeneity of variance between sexes simultaneously with other parameters, taking uncertainties fully into account. Broiler data collected in a feed efficiency and a carcass experiment were used to illustrate QTL analysis based on the Bayesian method. The experiments were conducted in a population consisting of 10 full-sib families of a cross between two broiler lines. Microsatellite genotypes were determined on generation 1 and 2 animals and phenotypes were collected on third-generation offspring from <b>mating</b> <b>members</b> from different families. Chromosomal regions that seemed to contain a QTL in previous regression analyses and showed heterogeneity of variance were chosen. Traits analyzed in the feed efficiency experiment were BW at 48 d and growth, feed intake, and feed intake corrected for BW between 23 and 48 d. In the carcass experiment, carcass percentage was analyzed. The Bayesian method was successful in finding QTL in all regions previously detected...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to estimate the contact pattern for gear drives. The proposed method {{is based on the}} geometric properties of the generated surfaces of the pinion and the gear and it neglects the mechanical characteristics of the <b>mating</b> <b>members.</b> The key feature of the method is the superimposition of a virtual marking compound over the gear surface that mimics the industrial practice of contact pattern inspection. For each meshing condition the instantaneous contact area is estimated as the intersection of the pinion surface with the marking compound gear surface. Finally, the contact pattern is estimated by the convex envelope of all the instantaneous contact areas in the zr-plane. The marking compound shape is identified through an optimization process to match a target contact pattern obtained, e. g. with an accurate loaded tooth contact analysis tool. The proposed method has been tested with a dedicated FEM software package capable of producing a very accurate contact pattern estimation of the contact pattern under load. Extensive simulations have shown that, once the optimal marking compound shape has been identified, the proposed method computes a reliable contact pattern even for very different surface geometries (e. g. an ease-off on the pinion surface) and assembly errors. The computational cost of the entire procedure is about two orders of magnitude lower than that required to run the full FEM analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The silver fox is a melanistic form of red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Silver foxes {{display a}} great deal of pelt variation: some are {{completely}} black except for a white coloration on the tip of the tail, some are bluish-grey, and some may have a cinereous color on the sides. Historically, silver foxes were among the most valued furbearers, and their skins were frequently worn by nobles in Russia, Western Europe, and China. Wild silver foxes do not naturally reproduce exclusively with members of the same coat morph and can be littermates with the common red variety, though captive populations bred for their fur are almost exclusively <b>mated</b> with <b>members</b> of the same color.|$|R

40|$|For many animal groups, {{both sexes}} have been {{reported}} to attempt to <b>mate</b> with <b>members</b> of their own sex. Such behaviour challenges theories of sexual selection, which predict optimization of reproductive success. We tested male mate choice between opposite- and same-sex members in the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Binary choice experiments were conducted following exposure periods in insectaries with only males or with both sexes present. We show that switches in choice between the opposite sex and the same sex can be induced and reversed again by changing the social context. We argue that the observed reversibility in male-male- and male-female-directed mating behaviour is maladaptive and a consequence of strong selection on a male's ability to alter choice between different female colour morphs. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Forbes’ parakeet, C. forbesi : There is {{much debate}} {{regarding}} the taxonomic {{status of the}} Forbes’ parakeet.

Although it remains the closest genetic relative of the red-crowned parakeet, the Forbes’ parakeet differs slightly in voice, colour, morphology, as well as possibly ecology and behaviour. Moreover, hybrids rarely occur as individuals tend to <b>mate</b> with <b>members</b> of their own group. This species seems to have independently derived from the Chatham red-crowned parakeet.
