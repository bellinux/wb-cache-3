40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} because limited research {{has occurred in the}} area of co-curricular student learning outcomes assessment, which has resulted in confusion within the student affairs profession on how to develop and implement assessment plans. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine high-quality assessment practices of student <b>affairs</b> <b>divisions</b> at three different research institutions in order to advance the value, usefulness, and understanding of learning outcomes assessment within the student affairs profession, so more student <b>affairs</b> <b>divisions</b> may begin assessing the co-curricular. Those student <b>affairs</b> <b>divisions</b> selected for this study represented assessment models with significant experience in successfully implementing assessments of student learning and development. These mature student <b>affairs</b> <b>divisions</b> who have substantial experience in successfully implementing their assessment plans were important to examine closely so that others can learn from their experiences.

40|$|Technology impacts {{student affairs}} {{operations}} {{in several different}} ways. Advertising events on the Internet, online maintenance requests in residence halls and interactive educational programs are {{a few examples of}} how student affairs is utilizing today’s technology. As technology continues to advance, student <b>affairs</b> <b>divisions</b> will continue to utilize more technology in everyday operations. Student <b>affairs</b> <b>divisions</b> need to analyze how their Information Technology departments are structured and staffed, how they are using technology effectively and how they are planning for future technology use. Student <b>affairs</b> <b>divisions</b> are typically comprised of several different departments, but not all student <b>affairs</b> <b>divisions</b> have their own IT department. A recent study suggested that a major problem of advancing technology in student affairs is when student affairs relies on the institution’s centralized IT department (Barratt, 2001). Centralized IT departments have to plan, implement, support and maintain all IT resources on the entire campus. This can limit the amount of time and resources that the IT department can devote specifically to student affair...|$|R
