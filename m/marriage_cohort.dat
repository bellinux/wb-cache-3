40|$|We {{investigate}} the upward trend of divorce rates in West Germany {{since the middle}} of the 1930 s by testing hypotheses on the changing socio-structural composition of <b>marriage</b> <b>cohorts</b> and on changes of the divorce behavior of different socio-structural subgroups.

Empirical analyses use data from the German Life History Study (GLHS) and are based on six West German <b>marriage</b> <b>cohorts</b> between 1936 and 2005.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that marriages preceded by premarital cohabitation have higher rates of dissolution than those in which the couple marry without first living together. Most of this research relies on data generated by couples who cohabited in the 1970 s and early 1980 s when premarital cohabitation was relatively uncommon and usually of brief duration. Since then, premarital cohabitation in Australia has become normative and thus less prone to selection effects. The period of premarital cohabitation has also lengthened and is thus more likely to provide opportunities to screen out unviable matches. This paper uses national survey data from Australia to explore whether, in the light of these changes, the previously observed higher level of marital dissolution among those who live together before marrying has persisted. It demonstrates that the higher risk of marital dissolution among those who cohabited before marriage has declined substantially in the 1990 s <b>marriage</b> <b>cohort</b> and, after controlling for selection factors, has disappeared altogether...|$|E

30|$|In model 1, only <b>marriage</b> <b>cohort</b> is included. From this model, we {{find that}} the {{proportion}} of couples who do not divorce decreases significantly over time. By using logit as the link function here, the intercept and regression coefficient are not direct estimates of proportions, but by means of a simple inverse operation, we can easily calculate these proportions. The calculation shows that among those married before 1980, 97.9  % of them will not divorce; for those married during 1980 – 1989, 1990 – 1999, and after 2000, the percentages decline to 94.5, 93.8, and 94  %, respectively. By the end of 2010, couples married after 2000 had only been married {{for a short period of}} time; therefore, model 1 probably underestimates the proportion of couples from this cohort who will not divorce. With this in mind, we can infer the proportion of couples who will eventually divorce increases over time. Nevertheless, marriages in China as a whole are still very stable, and only a small number of couples will eventually divorce.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{trends in the}} intergenerational {{transmission}} of divorce have produced mixed findings, with two studies (McLanahan and Bumpass 1988; Teachman 2002) reporting no trend in divorce transmission and one study (Wolfinger 1999) finding that divorce transmission has weakened substantially. Using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model, we analyze data from the National Survey of Families and Households and find no evidence for any trend in divorce transmission. To reconcile apparent differences in results, we note that the General Social Survey data used by Wolfinger lack information on marital duration, permitting analysis only for whether respondents have divorced by interview. As a result, an apparent decline in divorce transmission {{could be due to}} inadequate adjustments for the longer exposures to risk by earlier <b>marriage</b> <b>cohorts,</b> yielding a higher probability of divorce by interview for earlier cohorts relative to more recent cohorts even if divorce risks are identical across all <b>marriage</b> <b>cohorts.</b> We confirm this possibility by using a series of discrete-time hazard logistic regressions to investigate the sensitivity of estimates of trends in divorce transmission to different adjustments for exposure to risk.

For the changes between 1948 and 1984, period effects turn out to be much more important for the increase in divorce than cohort effects. As regards period analysis for 1984, a quite surprising pattern appears: neither a specific duration of marriage (usually risk is highest at durations of between four and six years), nor a young age at marriage present the major risk factors, but young age itself. If this pattern were also to hold for other populations, it suggests the need for a major change in divorce analysis and registration of divorce data, giving less emphasis to duration or age at marriage, and more to age...|$|E

The similarities and differences in political, economic, and social histories between northern and southern Vietnam provide a compelling setting to investigate the impact of socialist policies and the recent shift from a centrally planned {{to a market economy}} on gender stratification in the domestic spheres. We assess determinants of the gender division of household labor among three marriage cohorts that underwent early marital years during 1) the Vietnam War and mass mobilization, 2) nationwide socialist collectivization and economic stagnation, and 3) market reform. We find that Vietnamese wives still do the vast majority of housework. In this sense, government efforts to change gender roles apparently have had at most limited success. Vietnamese husbands in the most recent <b>marriage</b> <b>cohort,</b> however, are more involved in household budget management and childcare than those in the two earlier cohorts.

40|$|Bangladesh {{represents}} one of the few countries in south Asia where the pace of fertility decline has been unprecedented over the last three decades. Although there has been significant reduction in fertility levels at the national level, regional variations continue to persist, especially in Sylhet and Chittagong where the total fertility rates are well above the country average. Using data from three consecutive Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHSs) this paper assesses how fertility patterns in Sylhet and Chittagong differ from the rest of Bangladesh through a <b>marriage</b> <b>cohort</b> analysis of the parity progression ratios, and examines the factors determining the transition rates to higher parity in these two regions. Three cohorts of women are identified: those married during 1965 – 1974, 1975 – 84 and 1985 – 94. The results show that the probability that a woman from the recent cohort in Sylhet or Chittagong who had a third birth will have a fourth birth is nearly twice that of her counterpart in other regions. Social characteristics such as education, occupation, religion and residence have no effect on fertility in Sylhet and Chittagong.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays that examine marital formation and dissolution in the United States. The first chapter highlights the roles that both the availability of men and competition from women within a marriage market play in the low marriage rates of uneducated black women. Black women who drop {{out of high school}} are far less likely to marry than those who do not; however, they also, counterintuitively, face much more favorable marriage markets than more educated women if we define marriage markets as independent by education level, as is standard. Using a simple model of the marriage market with men and women of different quality levels that allows for marriage market integration across education levels, I show that the marriage prospects of any woman should depend not only on the availability of men, but also the competition from more educated women. Additionally, this model predicts that any gender imbalance should disproportionately affect the marriage prospects for the least educated. Using data from the 1979 - 2004 waves of the NLSY 79, I estimate discrete-time hazard models of first marriages for black women, capturing a woman's marriage prospects in four ways: (i) using a flexible specification that includes five ratios for the relative availability of men as well as the prevalence of competing women at each education level, (ii) using the ratios for the availability of men and women at adjacent education levels, (iii) using an education-specific simple sex ratio from the educationally segmented marriage markets that dominate the literature, and (iv) using a "cascading'' sex ratio implied by the simple model. The results emphasize the importance not only of the supply of men, but also of the competition from other women for the least educated women. Thus, marriage market measures that do not account for this cross-education competition greatly overstate the favorability of the marriage markets for uneducated black women. The second chapter is joint work with my advisor Marjorie McElroy and Tongyai Iyavarakul which presents a new approach to the reduced-form estimation of dynamic models using aggregated panel data. With forward looking behaviors, exogenous changes in laws or rules give rise to selection effects on those considering entry and surprise effects for those who have already entered. We develop a model, the Cohort Panel Data Model (CPDM), {{to examine the effects of}} divorce law changes on divorce rates. Our analysis has several key features. First, we introduce the concept of a <b>marriage</b> <b>cohort,</b> a group of people married under a certain set of laws. The calculation of the shares of the population in each <b>marriage</b> <b>cohort</b> is a key element of our aggregation protocol. Second, the model includes floodgate effects, a spike in the divorce rate followed by a decline, resulting from heterogeneity within these marriage cohorts. Lastly, we develop a wait-time index for the cost of divorce and carefully code divorce laws based on two dimensions: costs and rights. Thus the model allows for an unbiased test of the Coase Theorem since our model gives the surprise effect of a change in the rights to divorce holding costs constant. Results strongly support the idea that unanticipated divorce law changes affected divorce rates, but finds that these effects are operating through changing costs and not changes in rights (supporting the Coase Theorem). Additionally, lower divorce costs are found to increase divorce rates through the selection of less well-matched couples into marriage. Finally we reconcile our results with previous studies by showing that previous studies that do not differentiate between costs and rights suffer from omitted variables bias and improper aggregation over marriage cohorts.

40|$|Background : While social {{gradient}} in divorce has been explored in many Western societies, {{this issue has}} received less attention in Asia. Objective : Few existing studies offer evidence for how educational gradient in divorce shift from positive to negative in Asia. This study explores the changing divorce patterns by education for both sexes {{over the past four}} decades in Taiwan. Methods : Vital statistics of divorce since 1975 were used. Divorce rates were calculated and a synthetic cohort life table was also constructed to estimate the proportions of unions that remain intact with the duration-specific divorce rates observed in 2010. A separate life table estimating the actual marriage survivorship for the 1998 <b>marriage</b> <b>cohort</b> was also presented. Results : As Taiwan went through industrialization, the period findings show that a reversal in educational differential in divorce from positive to negative is observed for both sexes. Now the least educated men and women have become more vulnerable to union instability. Finally, synthetic cohort life table estimates indicate substantial educational differences in the proportions of recent marriages ending in divorce. Conclusions : The drastic increase in period divorce rates is accompanied by a reversal of educational gradient and expanding social inequality. Social gap in divorce rates expanded much faster among men than women across years. Given that remarriage rates for the disadvantaged are lower than the better educated, these patterns indicate that the disadvantaged is likely to spend an increasingly large proportion of their lives outside a marital union.

40|$|Background : The paper {{explores the}} {{mechanisms}} of the European fertility transition in northern Italy by social group. Objective : Our objective is to understand when and in which sectors of a rural society the reduction of family size began. We focus on Emilia-Romagna, a region that in the 1990 s had the lowest fertility level in Italy. The core {{purpose of this paper}} is the analysis of socioeconomic status (SES) fertility differentials, especially between rural sharecroppers and landless rural workers, as well as other non-agricultural groups. Methods : Our analysis focuses on the reproductive histories of <b>marriage</b> <b>cohorts</b> in the years 1900 ‒ 1940. We perform a micro-level statistical analysis of legitimate births of parity 1 +. Results : In this period fertility decline has just begun, and shows a strong decline in the post-WWI <b>marriage</b> <b>cohorts.</b> Although nonagricultural groups lead the downward trend in family size, the role of socioeconomic status means that the path of sharecropper households is atypical. Conclusions : The fertility transition proceeds by means of spacing and stopping, testifying to a new attitude towards birth control, which agricultural and nonagricultural social groups adopted in different ways. Usually, the decline in fertility progresses from nonagricultural to rural classes. In the rural world the path is inverted, going from the lower to the upper groups. Contribution : The paper contributes to the debate on the links between socioeconomic status and fertility transition in Italy. It shows that the link between household economy and control of fertility is specific to SES groups, which can follow atypical paths, compared to the known reference model. The use of microdemographic data provides evidence for the hypothesis that the fertility transition can be shaped by the specific social and economic characteristics of population subgroups...|$|R
