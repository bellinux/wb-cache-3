25|$|The House System was {{originally}} introduced by Mr Barker. He appointed four housemasters, who gave {{their names to}} the houses (Roses, Rants, Bates, McPherson). In 1973 the system was abolished by <b>Mr</b> <b>Sanders,</b> then headteacher, due to dwindling interest. In 1990 the system was reinstated, but the new houses were named after the first four Headmasters of the school, MacCarthy (yellow), Barker (red), Dobinson (blue) and Roach (green).|$|E
2500|$|Deciding {{to give up}} his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell {{retained}} {{only two}} students, six-year-old [...] "Georgie" [...] Sanders, deaf from birth, and 15-year-old Mabel Hubbard. Each pupil would {{play an important role in}} the next developments. George's father, Thomas Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay in nearby Salem with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to [...] "experiment". Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sanders</b> was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in. Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years Bell's junior but became the object of his affection. Having lost her hearing after a near-fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday, she had learned to read lips but her father, Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Bell's benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.|$|E

"To-morrow's breakfast, sir," [...] she said, {{opening the}} door; {{and there were}} Sanders and Bonamy like two bulls of Bashan driving each other up and down, making such a racket, and all them chairs in the way.

6000|$|The second {{event was}} less unexpected, though quite equally {{embarrassing}} under existing circumstances. Hardly {{more than a}} month {{before the end of the}} quarter, a little black-eyed baby daughter came to add to the prospective burdens of the Le Breton family. She was a wee, fat, round-faced, dimpled Devonshire lass to look at, as far surpassing every previous baby in personal appearance as each of those previous babies, by universal admission, had surpassed all their earlier predecessors--a fact which, as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sanders</b> remarked, ought to be of most gratifying import both to evolutionists and to philanthropists in general, as proving the continuous and progressive amelioration of the human race: and Edie was very proud of her indeed, as she lay placidly in her very plain little white robes on the pillow of her simple wickerwork cradle. But Ernest, though he learned to love the tiny intruder dearly afterwards, had no heart just then to bear the conventional congratulations of his friends and fellow-masters. Another mouth to feed, another life dependent upon him, and little enough, as it seemed, for him to feed it with. When Edie asked him what they should name the baby--he had just received an adverse answer to his application for a vacant secretaryship--he crumpled up the envelope bitterly in his hand, and cried out in his misery, 'Call her Pandora, Edie, call her Pandora; for we've got to the very bottom of the casket, and there is nothing at all left for us now but hope--and even of that very little!' ...|$|E

Susannah Sanders was then called, and examined by Serjeant Buzfuz, and cross-examined by Serjeant Snubbin. Had always said and believed that Pickwick would marry Mrs. Bardell; knew that Mrs. Bardell's being engaged to Pickwick was the current topic of conversation in the neighbourhood, after the fainting in July; had been told it herself by Mrs. Mudberry which kept a mangle, and Mrs. Bunkin which clear-starched, but did not see either Mrs. Mudberry or Mrs. Bunkin in court. Had heard Pickwick ask the little boy how he should like to have another father. Did not know that Mrs. Bardell {{was at that time}} keeping company with the baker, but did know that the baker was then a single man and is now married. Couldn't swear that Mrs. Bardell was not very fond of the baker, but should think that the baker was not very fond of Mrs. Bardell, or he wouldn't have married somebody else. Thought Mrs. Bardell fainted away on the morning in July, because Pickwick asked her to name the day: knew that she (witness) fainted away stone dead when <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sanders</b> asked her to name the day, and believed that everybody as called herself a lady would do the same, under similar circumstances. Heard Pickwick ask the boy the question about the marbles, but upon her oath did not know the difference between an 'alley tor' and a 'commoney.' ...|$|E

As she held the plates under water and then dealt them on the pile beneath the hissing gas, she listened: heard Sanders speaking in a loud rather overbearing tone of voice: [...] "good," [...] he said, and [...] "absolute" [...] and [...] "justice" [...] and [...] "punishment," [...] and [...] "the will of the majority." [...] Then her gentleman piped up; she backed him for argument against Sanders. Yet Sanders was a fine young fellow (here all the scraps went swirling round the sink, scoured after by her purple, almost nailless hands). [...] "Women"--she thought, and wondered what Sanders and her gentleman did in THAT line, one eyelid sinking perceptibly as she mused, for she {{was the mother of}} nine--three still-born and one deaf and dumb from birth. Putting the plates in the rack she heard once more Sanders at it again ("He don't give Bonamy a chance," [...] she thought). [...] "Objective something," [...] said Bonamy; and [...] "common ground" [...] and something else--all very long words, she noted. [...] "Book learning does it," [...] she thought to herself, and, as she thrust her arms into her jacket, heard something--might be the little table by the fire--fall; and then stamp, stamp, stamp--as if they were having at each other--round the room, making the plates dance.|$|E

Thus one Falcon passes, but another is providentially fledged. It is too bad that as much ingenuity as was used to effect this interfraternal switch was not put into the further contrivance of a plot. As it is, [...] "The Falcons Brother" [...] is just a moderately confusing mystery tale, boasting but three casual murders and the final disposition of Mr. S. Nazi spies, it turns out, are the villains, and thats pretty routine these days. And, ungraciously perhaps, it must be stated that Mr. Conway is only fair as a hero.

His wife was out playing bridge with friends, and early in the evening <b>Mr</b> <b>Sanders</b> returned from a trip out with two of his friends and asked Miss Marple and the other ladies' opinions on an evening bag that he'd bought for his wife as a Christmas present. They went up to his room and saw the body of Mrs Sanders on the floor, felled by a sandbag. Immediately suspicious, Miss Marple refused to allow the husband to touch the body, and insisted the door be locked and the police called. Miss Marple noticed the woman's hat was lying beside the body, although previously she had been wearing it. Prompted by the police, she also noticed that the dead woman was no longer wearing earrings, as she had been when the body was first discovered. Mrs Sanders's other jewellery was missing, and the police were certain the thief came back after killing the woman and gained entry by means of the fire escape.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{there is}} an amazing sequel to this affair of the heart, which is recounted in the Advertiser for March 26, 1903, under a New Bedford dateline. The story {{describes}} how Mrs. de Faria sent her four children to Portugal and then set out with only $100 to search for her husband. Eventually, {{she found herself in}} San Francisco where the trail ended. While working at odd jobs in the hopes that some clue would turn up, Mrs. de Faria happened to pick up a Honolulu newspaper, and, in turning through the pages, came across Dr. de Faria's business card. Her meager savings were just enough to pay her passage to Honolulu. On arrival, her sudden appearance and the tale of her untiring search so moved her husband that the two were reunited. According to the story, the reunion was further helped {{by the fact that the}} romance between the doctor and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Sanders</b> was cooling due to the lady's interest in a young Army officer. In any event, the tale ends with the doctor and his wife departing secretly for Portugal [...] "never to return" [...] and leaving <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Sanders</b> deserted and without funds in Honolulu.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pickwick was {{regarding}} the chemist {{with feelings of}} the deepest horror, when a slight sensation was perceptible {{in the body of}} the court; and immediately afterwards Mrs. Bardell, supported by Mrs. Cluppins, was led in, and placed, in a drooping state, at the other end of the seat on which Mr. Pickwick sat. An extra-sized umbrella was then handed in by Mr. Dodson, and a pair of pattens by Mr. Fogg, each of whom had prepared a most sympathising and melancholy face for the occasion. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Sanders</b> then appeared, leading in Master Bardell. At sight of her child, Mrs. Bardell started; suddenly recollecting herself, she kissed him in a frantic manner; then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility, the good lady requested to be informed where she was. In reply to this, Mrs. Cluppins and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Sanders</b> turned their heads away and wept, while Messrs. Dodson and Fogg entreated the plaintiff to compose herself.
