In an {{interview}} with Q, he said that using mushrooms [...] "really forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> myself" [...] but added {{that he had never}} abused drugs. [...] On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he stated that he stopped using prescription drugs after his first experience with prescription drug Ambien, which left him unconscious for an hour.|$|E
500|$|... "It's All Too Much" [...] was remixed for {{inclusion}} on the Yellow Submarine album on 16 October 1968. The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, {{the song was}} edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line [...] "Time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you and {{you to look at}} me", had appeared in the film), and by fading out before the final minute of the coda.|$|E
2500|$|In 1865, Menelik married Woizero Befana Wolde Michael, whom he {{divorced}} in 1882; the marriage produced no children. Her brother was Dejazmatch Tewende Belay Wolde Michael. Woizero Bafena was implicated in {{a plot to}} overthrow Menelik when he was King of Shewa. She was widely suspected of being secretly in touch with Emperor Yohannes IV in her ambition to replace her husband on the Shewan throne {{with one of her}} sons from a previous marriage. With the failure of her plot, Woizero Befana was separated from Menelik, but Menelik apparently was still deeply attached to her. An attempt at reconciliation failed, but when his relatives and courtiers suggested new young wives to the King, he would sadly say [...] "You ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> these women with the same eyes that once gazed upon Befana?", paying tribute both to his ex-wife's great beauty and his own continuing attachment to her.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
60|$|It hurt <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Hoden. He was white, {{and tears}} rolled down his cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|The {{stars were}} very big and bright, so calm, so cold, that it somehow hurt <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. Not like men's lives, surely! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame Carr√©? Why, I've {{already a}} note from her--I found it this morning on my return <b>to</b> Paris--asking <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in <b>at</b> five o'clock and listen to a jeune Anglaise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you told}} <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you," [...] {{explained}} meekly the fishy-eyed young gentleman. [...] "I must go off somehow. I regard {{you as a}} very difficult man to please." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hereward {{collected}} himself instantly, {{and then}} holding her at arm's length, gazed upon her. [...] "I was mad a moment. But {{is it not}} enough <b>to</b> make <b>me</b> mad <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. H. He's {{been waiting}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him all through dinner. Shall I do it, {{and you can see}} what an idiot he looks? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{depresses}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> old frescos," [...] responded the Count; [...] "it is a pain, yet {{not enough}} of a pain to answer as a penance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My father! {{you know}} he does not like me, my {{presence}} is always a source of irritation to him, he cannot even bear <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him." ...|$|E
60|$|Here the gentleman, {{pulling out}} his pocket-glass, desired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> through it, which I did; {{and then he}} {{directed}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> full <b>at</b> St. Paul's, and to make that the centre of my future observation, and thereupon he promised me conviction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get {{off that}} counter! You make <b>me</b> tired <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you, with your dude {{clothes and a}} cigar-root hanging out of your mouth. Throw the blamed thing away and put up the canned stuff you left about." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{came out}} with <b>me</b> {{directly}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the boy. The servants had gathered in the hall too, and he shivered in the window-seat with Charley standing by him, like some wounded animal that {{had been found in}} a ditch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Put this wallet {{back where}} you found it, Jan, and, Nicolaes," [...] he added {{turning back to}} his friend, [...] "will you allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that bond?" ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. He doesn't {{want his}} rent at all. He's broken his tooth on a Brazil nut; {{and he wants}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it and to lunch with him afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Necessary! How was it necessary? I {{was well}} enough, he supposed? Change necessary! He would {{recommend}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Catholic 'religieuses,' and study their lives. They asked no change." ...|$|E
60|$|He gazed rather arrogantly down at me. It always irritated <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>looked</b> down <b>at</b> that way.|$|R
6000|$|And the {{violence}} on the door was renewed. [...] "I am rising, gentlemen," [...] said I, desirous to gain {{as much time as}} possible--"commit no violence--give <b>me</b> leave <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your warrant, and, if it is formal and legal, I shall not oppose it." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} I forgot this man's {{kindness}} <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{him with a}} shudder.|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "Yes." [...] After a pause, [...] "I should {{suppose you}} would care enough for {{yourself}} to wish <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the matter {{from the right}} point of view." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{held the}} baby for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> I glanced at it, but I was only {{conscious}} of the near warmth of her cheek, and of the scent of her hair.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's quite new to me,' said Lizzie, 'to {{be visited}} by a lady so nearly {{of my own}} age, and so pretty, as you. It's a {{pleasure}} to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{call them}} odd or singular," [...] said the esquire, [...] "for {{everything}} is even in numbers and double in appearance. It makes <b>me</b> giddy <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them, and I keep feeling of myself {{to make sure}} there is still only one of me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{have nothing}} left to begin with,' {{returned}} Bella, blushing, 'because I {{was going to say}} that it was a pleasure to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you, Lizzie. But we can begin without a beginning, can't we?' ...|$|E
60|$|This {{incident}} caused <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Miss Church with quickened interest. She was not strikingly pretty, {{but in her}} charming irregular face {{there was}} something brilliant and ardent. Like her mother, she was very simply dressed.|$|E
6000|$|She found Fergus {{watching}} {{for her at}} the gate, with the appeal, 'Aunt Jane, there's been a great downfall of cliff, and I {{want to see what}} formations it has brought to light, but they won't let <b>me</b> through <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, though I told them White always did.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] Adolphe agreed. [...] "It makes <b>me</b> shiver <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. There {{will be no}} boat out on {{the river}} to-night except ours.
