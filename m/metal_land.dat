From the gentle plowing of our bow it rolled lazily to one side, as if in truth it were molten <b>metal.</b> <b>Land,</b> at varying picturesque distances, lay on all sides of us. In some directions the shore was not more than a mile and a half off; in others, the eye wandered down a vista of water framed by low headlands for ten miles or more. But the atmosphere gave the dominant thought, a strange slumber-like seclusion. So rich and golden, it shut this little corner of the world in a sort of happy valley of its own, and the smoke from my pipe drifted dreamily astern, a natural incense to the spirits of the spot.|$|E

40|$|Performance {{requirements}} in high end microprocessors have increased tremendously {{in the last}} several years, leading to higher I/O counts and interconnect densities. As greater currents pass through the microprocessor interconnect, higher temperatures driven by Joule heating are expected to pose reliability risks to high pin count microprocessor sockets. In this study Joule heating and its effect on the reliability of stamped <b>metal</b> <b>land</b> grid array (LGA) sockets was investigated using a combination of experimental and numerical methods. A methodology to determine socket temperature environments under electrical loading was developed. Knowledge of socket operating temperatures can allow original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and socket manufacturers to test for and mitigate failure mechanisms under thermal aging. The factors that influence Joule heating and contribute to premature socket failure were examined. Processor temperature, contact alloy and contact pitch were all found to significantly influence socket temperatures driven by Joule heating, with the contact alloy and processor temperature having the most significant effects. The resulting temperatures at higher currents were found to significantly influence the mechanical properties of the polymer housing and adversely affect socket stress relaxation behavior. The properties of the polymer housing were found to be sensitive to temperature owing to its visco-elastic nature. Polymer housing relaxation was therefore identified as a principle contributor to failure in stamped metal sockets under high temperature environments. In {{the latter part of the}} study, numerical modeling was used to develop a methodology for assessing socket life expectancy under temperature and deformation loads. A full visco-elastic characterization of the polymer housing was conducted and the measured properties were subsequently used to model socket stress relaxation time to failure. The results of this study indicate that socket temperatures under electrical loading can be significantly higher than those called for by EIA test specifications for LGA sockets. Passing tests that are not stringent enough to account for worst case scenarios can pave the way for field failures. The methodology outlined in this dissertation may be used to determine socket temperature environments and their effect on socket life expectancy...|$|E

Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe. A sizeable portion of the Spanish conquistadors were from the southwestern regions of Spain, with their origins in Andalusia and Extremadura. Up to 1519, according to licenses issued in Spain, over half were from these two regions. From 1520 to 1539, this fell to just under half of all conquistadors leaving Spain. The conquest of the Central American isthmus was launched from three directions; Mexico, Panama, and the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Relations between rival conquistadors were dominated by mutual distrust, greed, and envy.|$|R

40|$|Aim: We {{hypothesized}} that mechanisms underlying beta diversity in rivers would differ between gradients where (1) natural stressors result in progressive species turnover with high specificity and (2) anthropogenic stressors {{result in the}} loss of specialist taxa thus giving rise to nestedness. Location: Great Britain, the Iberian Peninsula and the Himalayan Mountains. Methods: We analysed five datasets describing benthic macroinvertebrates sampled along natural (elevation, salinity) and anthropogenic (acidity, <b>metals,</b> <b>land</b> use) stress gradients. Predictions were tested by fitting models relating species richness and beta-diversity components (total, turnover and nestedness dissimilarities) to putative stress intensity (i. e. {{the degree to which a}} particular environmental constraint filters species occurrence). Results: Stress intensity accounted for most of the variability in species richness (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 64 – 0. 93), which declined with increasing stress. Dissimilarity in community composition between locations increased with the difference in stress intensity for all datasets. For natural stressors, beta-diversity patterns mainly reflected species turnover, whilst for anthropogenic stressors beta diversity mainly reflected nesting of subsets of species as stress intensity increased. Main conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that natural and anthropogenic stressors generate contrasting patterns in beta diversity that arise through different mechanisms...|$|R
