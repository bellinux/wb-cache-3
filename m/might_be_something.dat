500|$|... "Hunting Trip" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The episode introduced a romantic subplot between the characters Andy and April which continued throughout the second season and into the third. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the pairing was not previously planned, but grew when it was discovered during the filming of [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] that actors Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt had strong comedic chemistry together. However, Schur also said the idea to pair them together in [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] stemmed in part from a line Plaza improvised in the first season finale [...] "Rock Show", when Andy explained his style of music and April replied that she completely understood him. Schur said, [...] "At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, but when we watched it, we thought there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> there." ...|$|E
500|$|Team Canada {{assistant}} coach Ferguson {{felt that the}} Canadians had gotten over-confident. [...] "I was fooled again. I felt that after we had taken a 3–1 lead, the final score <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> like 7–1. But those two short-handed goals. When you score one short-handed goal it can turn it all around. But two? That's almost fatal." [...] According to Tim Burke of the Montreal Gazette, both goaltenders, Tony Esposito and Vladislav Tretiak, reached great heights, or the outcome could have been 10–10. Tretiak was making an unexpected start for the Soviets. The Soviets had planned to start Viktor Zinger, but he {{was reported to be}} ill before the game. The Soviets coach Bobrov complained about the refereeing and the play of Wayne Cashman, stating that [...] "if that game had been played in Europe, he would have spent the whole game in the penalty box." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered Here We Go Again [...] "not {{quite as much}} fun", as Lovato's debut album Don't Forget, [...] "but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like ... 'Remember December'." [...] Erlewine also named the song {{one of the best}} tracks on the album. BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine rated it four out of five stars, and wrote, [...] "I'm sure there's a punkrock reason why we should all get together and hate it, but {{for the life of me}} I just can't. Even with the weird pronunciation and silly lyrics, this is a corker." [...] McAlpine praised the [...] "grand" [...] chorus and wrote: [...] "Someone in Team Lovato has been cocking an ear to the musical stylings of Paramore and maybe suggested that the next logical step after Camp Rocks wholesome Disneyfication of popular song <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> a little more confessional." ...|$|E

500|$|During a {{scene when}} Andy {{describes}} {{his style of}} music, April responds that she completely understands him, although the other characters seemingly do not. That line was improvised by Aubrey Plaza, and later helped inspire the writing staff to place the April and Andy characters into a romantic relationship. Schur said of this, [...] "At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, but when we watched it, we thought there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> there." [...] The scene with Mark making a pass at Ann at the rock show, and Ann's angry reaction to the attempt, were a last-minute addition to the episode. Although Mark and Ann would develop a romantic relationship in the second season, the Parks and Recreation writers had not decided what would happen between the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Leslie and Ann, at time [...] "Rock Show" [...] aired. In the original pilot script, Mark helped Leslie solely because he was attracted to Ann and felt that green-lighting Leslie's project would give him an excuse {{to spend more time}} with her; the shooting version was retooled to make Leslie less pathetic and Mark less unlikable, by having him won over by Leslie's determination to fight against the odds. Immediately after [...] "Rock Show" [...] was originally broadcast, NBC set up an official website for [...] "Scarecrow Boat", Andy's band featured in the episode. The site, at scarecrowboat.com, included ringtones, band posters, songs for download and photos.|$|E
500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

For the first time, for many a long year past, he felt personally interested in a total stranger. It <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> in her eyes, or it <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>something</b> in her manner. Whatever it was, it took softly hold of him, and made him, to his own exceeding surprise, unmistakably anxious to hear {{what she had to}} say! ...|$|R

2500|$|It {{has been}} stated by Tom Searle {{that it is}} [...] "a bunch of atheists {{thinking}} {{about whether or not}} there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> bigger," [...] and that due to his cancer he was becoming highly contemplative about life, and that this album is the product of that train of thought.|$|E

He wrote various treatments of the theme, explaining, [...] "One night the show might begin with the Iranians obtaining a nuclear device, and another it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> about a flower show... The tone needs to match the news." ...|$|E

Golaud tells Pelléas {{that there must be}} no repeat of the [...] "childish game" [...] between him and Mélisande last night. Mélisande is pregnant and the least shock might disturb her health. It {{is not the first time}} he has noticed there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> between Pelléas and Mélisande but Pelléas should avoid her as much as possible without making this look too obvious.|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn {{attended}} Long Beach Polytechnic High School, {{which was}} a high-profile school in sports. He was a two-sport star in both basketball and baseball. In his final two years, his Jackrabbits baseball teams were a combined 3-25-2 in the league, while the basketball teams went 53-6 and twice reached the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section 4A championship game. Gwynn had considered quitting baseball as a senior to concentrate on basketball, but his mother talked him out of it. [...] "She said it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> {{down the road and}} that I might be sorry later if I didn’t play", recalled Gwynn.|$|E
2500|$|A {{report by}} the Harris County {{forensic}} investigator contradicted the official report of the Waller County Sheriff's Department about details of {{the condition of the}} body. [...] In addition, the documents stating the time guards last observed Bland alive in her cell did not agree with the security video footage from the jail where Bland was detained, leaving a discrepancy of an hour. Brandon Wood, director of the Texas Commissioner on Jail Standards said that the failure to observe inmates hourly as required by standards [...] "could be criminal in nature." [...] An attorney for the Bland family said that it might be just a clerical error, or <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> [...] "more nefarious." ...|$|E
