At the dinner table, they once made [...] "a silly remark about Auschwitz", {{implying}} {{that he was a}} [...] "potential or real murderer," [...] which Gröning said enraged him, banging his fist on the table, demanding: [...] "This word and this connection are never, ever, to be mentioned again in <b>my</b> <b>presence,</b> otherwise I'll move out!" [...] Gröning said that this request was respected.|$|E
500|$|In May 2015, Hill {{canceled}} her scheduled concert outside Tel Aviv in Israel {{following a}} social media campaign from activists promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. She {{said she had}} wanted to also perform a show in Ramallah in the West Bank but logistical problems had proved too great. Hill stated: [...] "It {{is very important to me}} that <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> or message not be misconstrued, or a source of alienation to either my Israeli or my Palestinian fans." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1905, Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber {{engraved}} the obverse of Roosevelt's inauguration medal, {{while his}} assistant, George T. Morgan, engraved the reverse. [...] Roosevelt disliked the work, and engaged Saint-Gaudens to design an unofficial medal commemorating the inauguration. [...] Saint-Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber {{on the question}} of the new coinage; he wrote to his brother, Louis Saint-Gaudens, [...] "Barber is a S.O.A.B. [...] but I had a talk with the President who ordered Secretary Shaw in <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> to cut Barber's head off if he didn't do our bidding".|$|E

France divided Syria into smaller statelets centered on certain regions and sects, including Greater Lebanon for the Maronites, Jabal al-Druze State for the Druze in Hauran, the Alawite State for the Alawites in the Syrian coastal mountains and the states of Damascus and Aleppo. Gouraud reportedly went to the tomb of Saladin, kicked it, and said: [...] "Awake, Saladin. We have returned. <b>My</b> <b>presence</b> here consecrates the victory of the Cross over the Crescent." ...|$|E
500|$|As the voiture {{rolled through}} the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part {{repeated}} to me... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me {{as best he could}} while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in <b>my</b> <b>presence.</b> When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, in an interview, Pusha T {{spoke on}} the {{inspiration}} behind the album title. [...] "Basically, I tried to pick a title that embodied who I am as an artist. I wanted people to understand like Pusha is everything that I really, really am. Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire. It {{was one of the}} more prominent catch phrases that he said {{at the end of that}} series. He was basically saying, I am who I am, I stand on my name I live this. I really felt that embodied <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> in the rap game." [...] Pusha T announced the new title of his album in November 2012, along with Spin reporting that his album had been pushed back until 2013. On March 19, 2013 Pusha T said that the album would include 13 songs and that he had already finished 11 of those songs.|$|E
500|$|Malouma {{announced}} in April 2014 that {{she no longer}} felt she could keep up her political fight for democracy, although she would continue to support cultural and environmental causes. Even so, her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes: equality and rights for all, women's place in society, and education for the young, all under threat, as well as environmental protection. Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces, in August 2014 she commented: [...] "I use <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> and speaking time in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs. Whenever I run into ministers or important personalities, I tell them what the people expect of them." [...] She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs. At a press conference on December 16, 2014, Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, {{on the grounds that}} she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by standing behind the policies of the current leader Aziz.|$|E
500|$|On {{the second}} day of filming the documentary, Lohan posted a message on her Twitter account stating: [...] "Over 40 {{children}} saved so far... Within one day's work". Indian non-governmental organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, said she had not been part of the raid mentioned and threatened legal action over the post. BBC said Lohan was [...] "misinterpreted" [...] and that [...] "she was merely referring to a raid that happened connected to child trafficking". A few days later Lohan posted again on Twitter praising the work of Bachpan Bachao Andolan. She was originally scheduled to be present for the raid, but due to rescheduling arrived in the country too late. Lohan had also been scheduled to interview a representative for UNICEF for the documentary, but failed to show up. The BBC failed to ensure that Lohan had a proper work visa, which might lead to her being added to an immigration blacklist in India. Of her experience working on the film, Lohan said: [...] "he strength of the young boys and girls I met has been truly humbling" [...] and [...] "I hope <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> in India will bring awareness to the really important issues raised in making this film".|$|E

500|$|Lohan narrated and {{presented}} the British television documentary Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, about human trafficking in India. It was filmed during {{a week in}} India in December 2009, and transmitted on BBC Three in April 2010. The BBC was criticized for having hired Lohan, and while reviewers called the documentary compelling, they also found Lohan's presence to be odd and distracting. Lohan said: [...] "I hope <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> in India will bring awareness to the really important issues raised in making this film." [...] In April 2010, Lohan was let go from the film The Other Side {{where she had been}} set to star, with the director saying she was [...] "not bankable." [...] In May 2010, Lohan traveled to the Cannes Film Festival to promote the biographical drama Inferno. She was set to star as the lead, adult-film performer Linda Lovelace, but was later replaced while in court mandated rehab. Because she was in Cannes, Lohan missed a mandatory DUI progress hearing. A bench warrant was issued for her arrest which was rescinded after she posted bail. A judge determined that Lohan had violated the terms of her probation by missing several mandatory classes and meetings. She was sentenced to 90 days in jail, followed by 90 days of inpatient rehab treatment. However, Lohan served only 14 days of the jail sentence, due to overcrowding. She then entered an inpatient rehabilitation facility, from where she was released after only 23 days.|$|E
500|$|Now {{clear of}} the {{immediate}} danger of the ice, Riou {{found himself in a}} desperate situation. There was two feet of water in the hold and more was rushing in, while the sea was rising and a gale had sprung up. The pumps were manned, but could not keep up with the influx of water, and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in the hold. At dawn on Christmas Day, an attempt was made to fother the hull, which involved lowering an oakum-packed studding sail over the side to cover the gash in the hull and slow the flooding. This was temporarily successful and by 11 o'clock the pumps had been able to reduce the water to a level of 19inches. The respite was short-lived, as the sail split under the pressure of the water and the water level began to rise again. [...] A number of seaman requested permission to take to the ship's boats. Riou convinced them to stay, but another attempt to fother the hull with another sail failed when the sail immediately ripped. By nightfall on 25 December, the water in the hold had risen to 7 feet, and the ship was rolling violently, allowing water to pour over the ship's side. Riou ordered the stores, guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship, but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while trying to clear the bread-room. By morning the next day, the ship was settling by the stern, while the sails had been torn away in the gale. Again the seamen, this time joined by the convicts, requested to be allowed to take to the boats. Riou at last agreed to this, well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone, and announced 'As for me, I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to make <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> useful {{as long as there is}} any occasion for it.' ...|$|E

In an interview with BBC on December 16, 2016, he said: [...] "I killed about three of them, because {{there were three of}} them. I don't know how many bullets from my gun went inside their bodies.

The eunuchs were all slaves who did all of the work in the Forbidden City such as cooking, gardening, cleaning, entertaining guests, and all of the bureaucratic work needed to govern a vast empire and serving as the emperor's advisers. The eunuchs spoke in a distinctive high-pitched voice and to further prove that they were really eunuchs had to keep their severed penises and testicles in jars of brine that they wore around their necks when working. The Forbidden City was full of treasures, which the eunuchs were constantly stealing and selling on the black market. The business of government and of providing for the emperor created further opportunities for corruption and virtually all of the eunuchs engaged in theft and corruption of one sort or another.|$|E
