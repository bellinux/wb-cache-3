40|$|We have {{selectively}} grown thin epitaxial GaAs {{films on}} Ge substrates {{with the aid}} of a 200 nm thin SiO 2 mask layer. The selectively grown structures have lateral sizes ranging from 1 mu m width up to large areas of 1 x 1 mm(2). The growth with the standard growth procedure for GaAs growth on Ge substrates reveals a limited amount of GaAs nucleation on the <b>mask</b> <b>area</b> and strong loading effects caused by diffusion of group III precursors over the <b>mask</b> <b>area</b> and in the gas phase. Reduction of the growth pressure inhibits GaAs nucleation on the <b>mask</b> <b>area</b> and reduces the loading effects strongly, but favors the creation of anti-phase domains (APDs) in the GaAs. An optimized growth procedure was developed, consisting of a 13 nm thin nucleation layer grown at high pressure, followed by low-pressure growth of GaAs. This optimized growth procedure inhibits the nucleation of GaAs on the <b>mask</b> <b>area</b> and is a good compromise between reduction of loading effects and inhibition of APD growth in the GaAs. X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements demonstrate the good microscopic characteristics of the selectively grown layers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{rigorous}} three dimensional EUV mask simulation model is presented. The mask near field is simulated with the Waveguide method {{which is similar}} to the RCWA approach. Additionally the method is extended by a so called decompositions technique. The mask image is computed by coupling the Waveguide method with a fully vectorial imaging simulation model based on an extended Abbe approach. The basic theory of the models is explained. The optimization and combination of both simulation approaches enables the simulation and analysis of larger EUV <b>mask</b> <b>areas</b> required for the analysis of complex three dimensional EUV mask structures as well as the very fast simulation of standard sized EUV <b>mask</b> <b>areas</b> required in the context of source mask optimizations.

The {{interaction}} of water hyacinth <b>area</b> with <b>growth</b> {{is known to}} be strongly influenced by area size, but {{little is known about the}} interdependent role that size and time have on dynamic estimation of water hyacinth area. We report on the fusion of specially designed, satellite and GPS sensor data into <b>area</b> <b>growth</b> model as a function of area and time. We employ a multi-sensor fusion technique that is able to generate uniform data of fitting <b>area</b> <b>growth</b> model with complete control of area and time. Evidence of an overall Goodness of Fit Index of 0. 9753 was obtained by using conventional statistic analysis. These findings suggest that the multi-sensor fusion technique readily supports <b>area</b> <b>growth</b> model development with highly resolution.

30|$|Ritchie and Hann ([1997]) {{provided}} an excellent review on disaggregation methods, classifying the disaggregating functions into additive and proportional. In the additive growth method, the basal <b>area</b> <b>growth</b> of each tree {{is equal to}} the average tree basal <b>area</b> <b>growth</b> plus an adjustment based on tree basal area (Harrison and Daniels [1988]) or tree diameter (Dhote [1994]). Another category of disaggregation methods involves proportional allocations that can be applied to either growth or yield. In the proportional yield method, predicted tree basal area is adjusted to match predicted stand basal area (Clutter and Allison [1974], Clutter and Jones [1980], Pienaar and Harrison [1988], Nepal and Somers [1992], McTague and Stansfield [1994], [1995]). The proportional growth method involves adjusting predicted tree basal <b>area</b> <b>growth</b> to match predicted stand basal <b>area</b> <b>growth</b> (Campbell et al. [1979], Moore et al.

Previous {{studies have shown that}} masking just the face leads to unacceptably high recognition levels, making it likely that participants also use other cues for recognition, such as hairstyle or clothes. In the current study we investigate this possibility by means of an identification task in which participants had to identify (partially) masked images of familiar people. To demonstrate that non-facial cues become increasingly important for recognition as faces are masked more strongly, we manipulated the size of the <b>masked</b> <b>area</b> and the degree of pixelation. Confirming our expectations, increasing the size of <b>masked</b> <b>area</b> or its level of deterioration led to lower recognition rates. More importantly, also an interaction effect between the two variables emerged, showing that additional visual information partly compensates the downswing in recognition when masking becomes stronger. Although in some conditions low recognition rates were found, masking was never a hundred percent effective, making it clear that the media should approach this issue with care.
