25|$|Dynamic {{analysis}} for simple structures {{can be carried}} out manually, but for complex structures finite element analysis can be used to calculate the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> and frequencies.|$|E
25|$|When {{there are}} many degrees of freedom, one method of {{visualizing}} the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> is by animating them using structural analysis software such as Femap or ANSYS. An example of animating <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> {{is shown in the}} figure below for a cantilevered -beam as demonstrated using modal analysis on ANSYS. In this case, the finite element method was used to generate an approximation of the mass and stiffness matrices by meshing the object of interest in order to solve a discrete eigenvalue problem. Note that, in this case, the finite element method provides an approximation of the meshed surface (for which there exists an infinite number of vibration modes and frequencies). Therefore, this relatively simple model that has over 100 degrees of freedom and hence as many natural frequencies and <b>mode</b> <b>shapes,</b> provides a good approximation for the first natural frequencies and modes. Generally, only the first few modes are important for practical applications.|$|E
25|$|The SVD is also applied {{extensively}} to {{the study}} of linear inverse problems, and is useful in the analysis of regularization methods such as that of Tikhonov. It is widely used in statistics where it is related to principal component analysis and to Correspondence analysis, and in signal processing and pattern recognition. It is also used in output-only modal analysis, where the non-scaled <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> can be determined from the singular vectors. Yet another usage is latent semantic indexing in natural language text processing.|$|E
30|$|The {{existing}} <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> estimation based location methods always {{attempt to}} support their principles by finding {{a link to the}} damping concept. There is a lack of investigations on under what conditions the estimated <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> from measurements conveys the information for locating the oscillation source. However, it was reported that under resonance condition the estimated <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> from measurements could be quite different compared to the one from model-based eigenanalysis [37] and <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> information may not help in locating the forced oscillation source [38].|$|R
30|$|Sixth <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> shows {{oscillation}} of {{the interface}} between pad 3 and pad 4 about lateral (z) axis. As a result some draft pads exhibit third modal behaviour of individual draft pad. In the seventh <b>mode</b> <b>shape,</b> interfaces between pads 2 and 3, 4 and 5 remains fixed and interfaces between pads 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 oscillate about longitudinal (x) axis causing every single pad to execute motion in accordance to first <b>mode</b> <b>shape.</b> The eight <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> of draft gear is oscillation of all draft pad interfaces about lateral (z) axis. This oscillation results in fifth <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> for all pads. For the ninth <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> of draft gear, {{the interface between}} pads 3 and 4 remains fixed while the adjacent interfaces (i.e. interface between pads 1 and 2, 2 and 3 and interfaces between pads 4 and 5, 5 and 6) oscillate in opposite direction. This mode thus causes all pads to behave in accordance to first <b>mode</b> <b>shape.</b> For the tenth <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> of draft gear, interface between pads 2 and 3 and pads 4 and 5 oscillate between about vertical (y) axis in opposite phase. The resulting effect is that all pads execute second modal behaviour.|$|R
30|$|Modal frequency, modal damping ratio, <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> magnitude, and <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> angle {{are the key}} {{parameters}} describing the electromechanical modal properties of a power system [1]. Similar to former two, the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> properties that describe the participation of state variables in a particular mode are of vital importance for the safety and reliable operation of the system. Near real-time knowledge of <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> characteristics provide critical information for the optimization of generators and/or load shedding, {{in order to improve}} the damping of the dangerously low-damped modes of power systems.|$|R
2500|$|The two <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> for the {{respective}} natural frequencies are given as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Written in {{this form}} {{it can be seen}} that the {{vibration}} at each of the degrees of freedom is just a linear sum of the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes.</b> [...] Furthermore, how much each mode [...] "participates" [...] in the final vibration is defined by q, its modal participation factor.|$|E
2500|$|... and [...] are {{diagonal}} matrices {{that contain}} the modal mass and stiffness values {{for each one}} of the modes. [...] (Note: Since the eigenvectors (<b>mode</b> <b>shapes)</b> can be arbitrarily scaled, the orthogonality properties are often used to scale the eigenvectors so the modal mass value for each mode is equal to 1. [...] The modal mass matrix is therefore an identity matrix) ...|$|E
5000|$|... where [...] is the {{participation}} factor or modal amplitude and [...] is the <b>mode</b> <b>shape.</b> The duct <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> are analytically determined from {{the solution of}} the Helmholtz equation.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} overall {{amplitude}} of the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> cancels out from each side, always. That is, the actual size of the assumed deflection does not matter, just the <b>mode</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a {{one-dimensional}} {{system at}} a given mode the vibration will have nodes, or places where the displacement is always zero. These nodes correspond to points in the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> where the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> is zero. Since the vibration of a system is given by the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> multiplied by a time function, the displacement of the node points remain zero at all times.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate the frequency of different mode shape of system manually by the energy method. For a given mode shape of a multiple degree of freedom system you can find an [...] "equivalent" [...] mass, stiffness and applied force for a single degree of freedom system. For simple structures the basic <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> can be found by inspection, {{but it is not}} a conservative method. Rayleigh's principle states: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} to the problem results in N eigenvalues (i.e. [...] ), where N corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom. [...] The eigenvalues provide the natural frequencies of the system. When these eigenvalues are substituted back into the original set of equations, the values of [...] that correspond to each eigenvalue are called the eigenvectors. [...] These eigenvectors represent the <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> of the system. The solution of an eigenvalue problem can be quite cumbersome (especially for problems with many degrees of freedom), but fortunately most math analysis programs have eigenvalue routines.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with other}} members of the Feynman team, Ashkin {{produced}} technical reports while at Los Alamos. These were classified at the time but have since been made public. One example gives an idea of the work carried out by the group. It is The Calculation of Critical Masses Including the Effects of the Distribution of Neutron Energies, by Feynman, R.P.; Welton, T.A.; Ashkin, J.; Ehrlich, R.; Peshkin, M.; and Reines, F. Report LA-524(Del.) January 21, 1947 (extract from abstract: [...] "Convenient approximate methods are developed for the calculation of critical sizes and multiplication rates of spherical, active cores surrounded by infinite tampers. Special attention is given to those problems arising from the fact that neutrons of different velocities have different properties. The methods consist essentially of approximating the neutron densities at each velocity by fundamental <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> for each velocity.") ...|$|E
30|$|<b>Mode</b> <b>shape</b> {{represents}} the relative magnitude and phasing of the oscillation throughout the system. It is defined {{based on the}} right eigenvectors of the state matrix of the linearized system model. However, the accurate system model {{is often difficult to}} obtain and the model based <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> analysis has only been applied to test systems for a better understanding. To utilize the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> information in real systems, many measurement-based methods for estimating the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> have been proposed. An overview on existing estimation techniques using either ring-down signals or ambient signals can be found in [34] and its references.|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the idea}} of {{designing}} a structure for a desired <b>mode</b> <b>shape,</b> intended towards applications such as resonant sensors, actuators and vibration confinement, we present the inverse <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> problem for bars, beams and plates in this work. The objective is to determine the cross-sectional profile of these structures, given a <b>mode</b> <b>shape,</b> boundary condition and the mass. The contribution of this article is twofold: (i) A numerical method to solve this problem when a valid <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> is provided in the finite element framework for both linear and nonlinear versions of the problem. (ii) An analytical result to prove the uniqueness and existence of the solution in the case of bars. This article also highlights a very important question of the validity of a <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> for any structure of given boundary conditions...|$|R
30|$|For the {{eleventh}} <b>mode</b> <b>shape,</b> all pad interfaces oscillate about vertical (y) axis in same phase {{and the resulting}} motion is in confirmation to the fourth modal shape. For the twelfth <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> all adjacent pad interfaces oscillate about longitudinal (x) axis in opposite direction causing each pad to follow first modal behaviour. For the thirteenth <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> the interface between pads 2 and 3 and pads  4 and 5 oscillates about the lateral (z) axis. As a result all pads execute motion in accordance to the third modal shape. For the fourteenth <b>mode</b> <b>shape,</b> all pad interfaces move linearly in the longitudinal direction. This is the only mode in which no pad behaviour confirms {{to any of the}} first five modes. In the fifteenth <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> the interface between pads 3 and 4 oscillates about the vertical (y) axis while interfaces between pads 2 and 3 and pads 4 and 5 move linearly in opposite phase in the lateral (z) direction. The resulting effect of this motion causes all draft pads to behave in accordance to second <b>mode</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|R
50|$|This method {{could be}} used iteratively, adding {{additional}} <b>mode</b> <b>shapes</b> to the previous best solution, or you can build up a long expression with many Bs and many <b>mode</b> <b>shapes,</b> and then differentiate them partially.|$|E

30|$|The mode {{matching}} method proposed for subspace identification method {{in this paper}} {{is based on the}} estimated <b>mode</b> <b>shape,</b> i.e., the relative magnitude and phasing, of the oscillation throughout the system [30]. The right eigenvector gives the ‘mode shape’, i.e., the relative activity of the state variables when a particular mode is excited [31]. The amplitude of the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> indicates how much the generators participate in the mode. The angle of the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> indicates the two swing-against groups. In this paper, two sets containing mainly swinging against generator groups can be determined by the estimated <b>mode</b> <b>shape.</b> Furthermore, inertia aggregation method is accurate enough to aggregate the coherent generators in the system for calculation simplicity.|$|R
40|$|The {{inertial}} sensor {{of the present}} invention utilizes a proof mass suspended from spring structures forming a nearly degenerate resonant structure into which a perturbation is introduced, causing a split in frequency of the two modes so that the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> become uniquely defined, and to the first order, remains orthogonal. The resonator is provided with a mass or inertia tensor with off-diagonal elements. These off-diagonal elements are large enough to change the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> of the two nearly degenerate modes from the original coordinate frame. The spring tensor is then provided with a compensating off-diagonal element, such that the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> is again defined in the original coordinate frame. The compensating off-diagonal element in the spring tensor is provided by a biasing voltage that softens certain elements in the spring tensor. Acceleration disturbs the compensation and the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> again changes from the original coordinate frame. By measuring {{the change in the}} <b>mode</b> <b>shape,</b> the acceleration is measured...|$|R

30|$|This {{category}} of methods locates the oscillation source by estimating the <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> using measurements from different locations and then identifies the source {{based on the}} <b>mode</b> <b>shape.</b> A phenomenon is discovered in [35] on a 2 -machine example that the generator leading in <b>mode</b> <b>shape</b> phase contributes less damping. Then, it is intuitively concluded that the leading generator is the oscillation source. For large power systems, the leading generator in an identified leading group is identified as the oscillation source.
