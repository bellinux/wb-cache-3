5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied {{that he was a}} spy. The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had {{made their way to the}} Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn <b>May</b> <b>could</b> not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1945, Igor Gouzenko, a cypher {{clerk at}} the Soviet Union's embassy in Ottawa, and his family {{defected}} to Canada. He brought with him copies of cables detailing Soviet intelligence (GRU) espionage activities in Canada. Agents included Alan Nunn May, who secretly supplied tiny samples of uranium-233 and uranium-235 to GRU agent Pavel Angelov in July 1945; Fred Rose, a member of parliament; and NRC scientists Israel Halperin, Edward Mazerall and Durnford Smith. Pontecorvo, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, has long been suspected of having been involved in espionage. No evidence {{that he was a}} Soviet agent has ever been established, but the GRU obtained samples of uranium and blueprints of the NRX, for which Nunn <b>May</b> <b>could</b> not have been the source, and Pontecorvo remains the prime suspect. When the spy ring became public knowledge in February 1946, the Americans became more cautious about sharing information with Britain and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The new Edward IV {{visited the}} castle {{regularly}} {{and established a}} council there to govern his estates in Wales. He probably conducted only modest work on the property, although he <b>may</b> <b>could</b> {{have been responsible for}} the remodelling of the Great Tower. In 1473, possibly influenced by his own childhood experiences at Ludlow, Edward sent his eldest son, the future Edward V, and his brother Prince Richard to live at the castle, which was also made the seat of the newly created Council in the Marches of Wales. By now Ludlow had become primarily residential, rather than military, but was still rich in chivalric connotations and a valuable symbol of the Yorkist authority and their claim to the throne. Edward died in 1483, but after Henry VII took the throne in 1485 he continued to use Ludlow Castle as a regional base, granting it to his son, Prince Arthur, in 1493, and reestablishing the dormant Council in the Marches at the property.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, the Lower Cape May Regional School District {{received}} a feasibility study that looked {{at ways to}} reconfigure the district, which had been established in 1956. The study considered Cape May City withdrawing from the regional district or {{the dissolution of the}} district, converting Lower Township's existing PreK-6 district to serve PreK-12, as the regional district's school facilities are located in the township. Cape May City and West Cape <b>May</b> <b>could</b> see annual savings approaching a combined $6 million from the dissolution.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} June, Joffre {{discussed}} {{strategy with}} the army group commanders and Pétain, who had been promoted to the command of the Second Army. Foch again advocated a series of limited attacks, particularly in Artois where strategically important railways were relatively close behind the German lines. Castelnau {{believed that it was}} still possible to advance through the German defences in one attack and that Champagne was a likely region for such an attempt, if the mistakes made on 9 <b>May</b> <b>could</b> be avoided. Pétain agreed with Foch but doubted that another offensive could quickly be prepared in Artois and was sceptical that any part of the Western Front was free of villages like Souchez and Neuville, which could be fortified and against which, only attacks even more limited than those advocated by Foch were practical. On 8 July, Joffre decided to make the principal attack in Champagne, with a supporting attack in Artois a few days earlier to attract German reserves.|$|E
2500|$|As a [...] "Westerner" [...] Wilson {{opposed the}} Gallipoli Campaign, {{as it would}} simply give Constantinople to Russia, and (18 March) {{hoped it would be}} “a fiasco” to “help get rid of Winston”. He also {{recorded}} his anger that, after shells had had to be sent to Gallipoli, the BEF, then numbering 12 divisions, barely had enough High Explosive shell for the Battle of Festubert, which he thought (13 <b>May)</b> <b>could</b> be “one of the decisive actions of the war” and complained (17 May) of Kitchener holding back the New Armies with decisive victory, in Wilson's view, imminent. In May he told Lord Derby that the 100,000 troops at Gallipoli could have made Neuve Chapelle into a decisive victory, and on 10 June he wrote “how they will laugh in Berlin" [...] at news that another 4 divisions were to be sent. He deplored the botched Landing at Suvla Bay in August, writing that “Winston first & others after” should be tried for murder.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{years later}} the teams met once more, in the quarter-finals of the European Championship, which were at the time held on a home-and-away basis. England lost 3–1 at Wembley on 29 April 1972 in the home leg, and on 13 <b>May</b> <b>could</b> only draw 0–0 in West Germany, being knocked out of the competition. Said The Observer in 2001: [...] "England may have been robbed of the chance in Mexico ... {{but there were no}} {{shortage}} of excuses – the heat, the hostile crowd, the food which had felled Banks, the errors of Bonnetti ... It was a conspiracy of fate more than a footballing defeat. In 1972, there were no excuses at all. West Germany did not just knock England out of the European Championships, they came to Wembley and comprehensively outclassed England." [...] McIlvanney wrote in his match report for The Observer: [...] "No Englishman can ever again warm himself with the old assumption that, on the football field if nowhere else, the Germans are an inferior race." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, in the British {{official}} history, L. F. Ellis {{wrote that}} the five-hour delay of the XIX Corps attack on Boulogne until [...] on 22 May, which had been ordered by General Ewald von Kleist, commander of Panzergruppe von Kleist, had been criticised in the Corps war diary, because the retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted but the long, exposed flank of Army Group A, the uncertain hold on Amiens and Abbeville and the Allied possession of Arras meant that the situation on 22 <b>May</b> <b>could</b> have changed and the delay was not excessive, since the Allied counter-attack at Arras could have continued. S. W. Roskill, the navy official historian, wrote (also in 1954), that the defence of Boulogne delayed the advance of the XIX Corps towards Dunkirk ("undoubtedly contributed to that end"), which assisted the Allied defence during the Battle of Dunkirk [...] The Welsh and Irish Guards were awarded the battle honour; [...] "Boulogne 1940".|$|E
