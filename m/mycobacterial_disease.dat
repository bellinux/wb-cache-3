40|$|Background: Pulmonary <b>mycobacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> {{describe}} both tuberculosis (TB) and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Few {{data are}} available measuring the cost burden of <b>mycobacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> at the national level. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the cost burden and measure emerging trends in hospitalization of pulmonary TB and NTM cases in the United States from 2001 through 2012. Methods: This study is a retrospective, community-based cost analysis of hospitalized patients with a principal diagnosis of pulmonary <b>mycobacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> from 2001 through 2012. Data for pulmonary TB and NTM were retrieved from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), US Department of Health and Human Services. The statistical significance of observed trends of NTM and TB national hospital costs was calculated using Poisson log-linear regression. Results: 20, 049 hospital discharges were reported for pulmonary NTM and 69, 257 for pulmonary TB in the US from 2001 through 2012. The total associated cost of these discharges was $ 903, 767, 292 for pulmonary NTM and $ 2, 078, 113, 317 for pulmonary TB. During the study period, the national hospital costs of pulmonary NTM increased at a statistically significant rate in the US over each year (P = 0. 001).

Reports are now emerging of an association between mycobacterial infection and antirheumatic treatment with anti-IL- 1 or anti-CD 20 antibodies.

Methods: In this study, 311 consecutive fistula-in-ano patients operated over 2 years were analyzed. The histopathology of anal fistula tract epithelial lining of every operated patient was analyzed and other tests (real-time-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR], GeneXpert, and mycobacterial culture) were conducted in patients with high index of suspicion of having <b>mycobacterial</b> <b>disease.</b> Results: Two patients had histopathological features suggestive of <b>mycobacterial</b> <b>disease.</b> Of these, one patient had NTM and the other had Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) on RT-PCR.

40|$|Common <b>mycobacterial</b> <b>diseases,</b> {{including}} {{tuberculosis and}} leprosy, contribute to major mortality and morbidity worldwide. Despite {{evidence of an}} important role of host genetic factors in susceptibility to these infections, few compelling genetic associations have been identified with previous candidate gene and linkage approaches. This thesis investigates the genetic factors of human immunity to these <b>mycobacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> using a high-throughput approach of association testing. To assess genetic susceptibility to tuberculosis, I have conducted a genome-wide association study in the Gambian population {{as part of the}} Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). The study reveals the region flanking CADM 1 as a potential susceptibility locus. Combining this study with a Ghanaian cohort further implicates two genetic loci at chromosome 18 q 11. 2 (P = 9. 2 x 10 ⁻⁹) and PARD 3 B (P = 1. 4 x 10 ⁻⁶). For leprosy, I have performed a gene-centric association study in the New Delhi Indian population. Evidence of significant association was observed in the HLA-DRB 1 /DQA 1 (P = 4. 9 x 10 ⁻ 14 and TLR 1 (P = 1. 7 x 10 ⁻⁹) loci. These studies identify important genomic regions that may be involved in immunity to tuberculosis and leprosy. Further analysis revealed a significant immunogenetic overlap between tuberculosis and leprosy. This provides proof-of-principle for the subsequent aggregate analysis for mycobacterial susceptibility, which suggests that the steroid biosynthesis pathway may be important in anti-mycobacterial immunity.
