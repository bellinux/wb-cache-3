5|$|In September 1811, William Henry Harrison, then {{governor}} of Indiana Territory, visited Kentucky and directed Colonel Samuel Wells to recruit Kentuckians {{for a new}} federal regiment then being formed by the authority of Secretary of War William Eustis. Harrison had not applied to Scott for permission to recruit in the state, and many Kentuckians– from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe– perceived this as a slight to the governor. Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott refused to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of the faux pas and instead {{became one of the}} staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career.|$|E

Many people around Liz <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E

25|$|On August 23, 2008, the Democratic {{nominee for}} President, Barack Obama, {{announced}} that Biden would be joining {{him on the}} ticket as the Vice Presidential nominee. Delaware law allowed Biden to run for Vice President and Senator at the same time, so he would have kept the seat if the ticket had lost. In 2000, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman ran similarly. On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama won the presidential election, making Biden the next VP. Biden vacated his senate seat shortly after the election, allowing for the Governor of Delaware to appoint a successor. There was speculation {{as to whether the}} outgoing Governor, Ruth Ann Minner, or the incoming Governor-elect Jack Markell would make the appointment, and if Biden's son, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden would receive the appointment. On November 24, 2008, Governor Minner appointed Biden's longtime Chief of Staff Ted Kaufman to fill the seat. Kaufman subsequently announced that he would not seek election to a full term in 2010, effectively making him a caretaker. Biden's Republican opponent in the Senate race, conservative political commentator Christine O'Donnell, tried to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of Biden's dual campaigns, claiming that serving his constituents is not important to him. Kaufman has since stated that he will not run for the unexpired term in 2010.|$|E

500|$|A minor {{incident}} occurred involving blind Member of Parliament David Blunkett, who was attending {{the opening ceremony}} alongside a Channel 4 director. Blunkett was denied access to his seat at Olympic Stadium {{because there was no}} room for his guide dog, and had to watch the ceremony from seats in the stadium's gantry instead. However, Blunkett noted that this was an isolated incident and chose not to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of it, simply advising organisers to [...] "seek to find a solution rather than impose a preconceived notion of what is or is not possible." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1966, the Liberals {{began to}} <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of the Munsinger affair—two {{officials}} of the Diefenbaker government had slept with a woman suspected of being a Soviet spy. In what Diefenbaker saw as a partisan attack, Pearson established a one-man Royal Commission, which, according to Diefenbaker biographer Smith, indulged in [...] "three months of reckless political inquisition". By the time the commission issued its report, Diefenbaker and other former ministers had long since withdrawn their counsel from the proceedings. The report faulted Diefenbaker for not dismissing the ministers in question, but found no actual security breach.|$|E
500|$|Pearson and his Liberals faltered {{badly in}} the campaign. The Liberal Party leader tried to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> {{of the fact}} that Diefenbaker had called a winter election, {{generally}} disfavoured in Canada due to travel difficulties. Pearson's objection cut little ice with voters, and served only to remind the electorate that the Liberals, at their convention, had called for an election. Pearson mocked Diefenbaker's northern plans as [...] "igloo-to-igloo" [...] communications, and was assailed by the Prime Minister for being condescending. The Liberal leader spoke to small, quiet crowds, which quickly left the halls when he was done. By election day, Pearson had no illusions that he might win the election, and hoped only to salvage 100 seats. The Liberals would be limited to less than half of that.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} Obsessed was thought up by Clint Culpepper, {{president}} of Screen Gems, and was shared with David Loughery, {{who wrote the}} screenplay. Producer William Packer read the script and signed on; executive producers for the film were Glenn S. Gainor, Jeff Graup, Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson, Beyoncé, Mathew Knowles, Damon Lee and Loughery, while Nicholas Stern and George Flynn served as co-producer and associate producer, respectively. Director Steve Shill signed on after reading the script and hearing that Beyoncé was on board. Part of the reason Elba joined in was that the black–white theme was ignored; [...] "It's {{not mentioned in the}} film, it's never an issue, and I think that's phenomenal ... To me, that was very refreshing that the studio execs didn't want to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of it." [...] Obsessed was allocated a production budget of $20 million. Shill stated that the intended effect of the film was to have the audience discuss the characters' motivations. Writer David Loughery designed Lisa as [...] "not a villain in a traditional sense; she's not setting out to wreck a marriage or ruin somebody's life. She really believes that [...] is in love with her." [...] Lisa's past was deliberately omitted from the film, explaining, [...] "It's scarier if we never really know how she's developed this personality that can go from very loving to ultimately deadly." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 12, 2007, Keyes {{participated in}} the Des Moines Registers Republican presidential debate, {{televised}} nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks. This {{was the first major}} presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses. Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator began to ask a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani's pro-choice position, as well as Mitt Romney's recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, [...] "I'm in favor of reducing global warming, because I think the most important emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend one thing and don't deliver". He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor's position on abortion.|$|E
500|$|Bowie drew {{criticism}} {{during the}} tour for his alleged pro-fascist views. In a 1974 interview he had declared, [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of}} the first rock stars... quite as good as Jagger... He staged a country", but managed to avoid condemnation. On the Station to Station tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of Nazi memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in Stockholm as saying that [...] "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader". Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment. The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called 'Victoria Station incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top Mercedes convertible and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in NME. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave, a contention backed by a young Gary Numan who was among the crowd that day: [...] "Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> out it..." [...] The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines [...] "To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading" [...] from Scary Monsters opening track [...] "It's No Game", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.|$|E

2500|$|Present {{throughout}} the work are masked portrayals of Cocea's political allies and adversaries. Pastia, who described such cameos as both cartoonish and interesting, identified Alexandru Averescu, Ion I. C. Brătianu, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, I. C. Frimu, Dumitru Iliescu-Turtucaia, Take Ionescu, Nicolae Iorga and some others. Pastia {{also suggests that}} the central theme (Bojogeanu as the bourgeois suffocating ancient boyardom) is conventional and ultimately irrelevant: [...] "That may well be, and we agree that our morals may tolerate the decay of the Azans and the ascent of the Bojogeanus. But this did not a novel <b>make.</b> <b>An</b> <b>issue</b> of Facla would have sufficed." [...] Călinescu spoke with displeasure about Fecior de slugă as an illustration of Cocea's [...] "strident, violent style, excessively vulgar and of a sexuality that is never redeemed by a hint of whatever is eternally human." [...] Pastia however found that Cocea wrote his book with noticeable talent [...] "in rendering that which is vulgar", a Romanian answer to Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal.|$|E
