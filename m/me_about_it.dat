500|$|Peterson's {{most famous}} {{commercials}} were his [...] "Wake up! Wake up!" [...] spots, which began airing in the mid-1970s. Peterson borrowed the idea from another retailer in Corpus Christi, Texas. Said Peterson, [...] "Somebody told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and I followed it up. Ours {{was much more}} successful than theirs. They didn't have the store owner or a strong personality doing theirs." [...] Peterson kept his stores open from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. to accommodate customers inspired by the ad to visit his store late at night. The commercial ran less frequently in the 1980s, and last aired in 1988.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{considered}} a box office bomb in the US but generally achieved greater success both critically and commercially in Europe. Many observers found similarities with Independence Day, which also came out in 1996. [...] "It was just a coincidence. Nobody told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I was surprised how close it was," [...] director Tim Burton continued, [...] "but then it's a pretty basic genre I guess. Independence Day was different in tone – it was different in everything. It almost seemed like we had done kind of a Mad magazine version of Independence Day." [...] During the film's theatrical run in January 1997, TBS purchased the broadcasting rights of the film.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E

500|$|Lehman’s {{story had}} {{originally}} {{appeared in a}} 1950 issue of Cosmopolitan, renamed [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>About</b> <b>It</b> Tomorrow!" [...] because {{the editor of the}} magazine did not want the word [...] "smell" [...] in the publication. It was based on his own experiences working as an assistant to Irving Hoffman, a prominent New York press agent and columnist for The Hollywood Reporter. Hoffman subsequently did not speak to Lehman {{for a year and a}} half. Hoffman then wrote a column for The Hollywood Reporter speculating that Lehman would make a good screenwriter, and within a week Paramount called Lehman, inviting him to Los Angeles for talks. Lehman went on to forge a notable screenwriting career in Hollywood, writing Executive Suite, Sabrina, North by Northwest, The Sound of Music, West Side Story, The King and I, and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?.|$|E

"No One" [...] saw the {{reintroduction}} of Richard Dormer and Paul Kaye, who portrayed Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, respectively, in {{the third}} season, last appearing in the episode [...] "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", before returning for the sixth season. Dormer was previously asked about returning to Game of Thrones {{in an interview in}} February 2015, saying {{at the time that he}} was doubtful about coming back to the series, stating [...] "they haven't told <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> so I don't think so." [...] He also noted about his portrayal of the character, [...] "Beric was a noble character, a leader of men. Kind of like Robin Hood. So I thought, that's how I'll play the guy." [...] Paul Kaye's participation in the series was confirmed in mid-April 2016, with his agency posting about the casting shortly before the premiere of the sixth season.|$|E

Betty Driver said of the range's launch: [...] "Betty Turpin's hotpots have become something of an institution at the Rover's and she's very proud of her reputation for good, wholesome food. I think it is a lovely idea that people will be able to buy them in supermarkets now." [...] Driver discussed her astonishment at the general level of interest in her character's hotpots, disclosing: [...] "I was on a cruise on the QE2 a few weeks ago, and everyone was asking <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Then one day, they served hot pot on the menu and everyone thought it was mine!" ...|$|E

Discussing the dinner later, Matthews told The New York Times, [...] "People have asked <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I've {{never told anyone}} that I'm running." [...] On November 28, The Patriot-News of Harrisburg reported that Matthews met that week with Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman T.J. Rooney and Executive Director Mary Isenhour to discuss possibly running against Specter. Isenhour told the paper Matthews had not formed a campaign committee or begun raising money, {{and she did not}} believe he had yet come to a firm decision, adding, [...] "He's got a really good job with MSNBC. I think he's going to put some thought into it before he jumps in." [...] The same day as that Patriot-News report, the political blog FiveThirtyEight.com reported that Matthews had already met with potential campaign staff, something Matthews claimed was [...] "absolutely not true".|$|E
500|$|... "Cop Killer" [...] was {{replaced}} by a new version of [...] "Freedom of Speech," [...] a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound, using a looped sample from the Jimi Hendrix song [...] "Foxy Lady." [...] Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a single. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album Home Invasion, taking Body Count with him. The studio version of [...] "Cop Killer" [...] has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release Live in L.A. According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song [...] "still lingers for us, even now.

But I meet a lot of bands who ask <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> too, and I'm real respected by other artists for it. But it's a love/hate thing.

[...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E

This was the reason we carried on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as that.
