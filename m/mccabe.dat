5|$|<b>McCabe</b> {{assumed the}} New South Wales {{captaincy}} from the 193637 season onwards. Due to international commitments, <b>McCabe</b> was represented his state only three times, {{but they were}} undefeated, winning both of their matches against England. <b>McCabe</b> scored a fifty {{in each of the}} matches.|$|E
5|$|<b>McCabe</b> {{was unable}} to {{translate}} the success into the Test arena, where <b>McCabe</b> struggled despite his team's 50 sweep over South Africa. <b>McCabe</b> warmed up for the series by scoring 37 and 79 not out and totalling 3/108 in a state match against the tourists. After managing only 27 in an innings victory in the First Test, <b>McCabe</b> saved his most productive Test of the summer for his home crowd for the Second Test at Sydney. He took 4/13 in the first innings, bowling or trapping all of his victims leg before wicket, and then compiled 79 as Australia cruised to another innings win. <b>McCabe</b> scored 22 and 71 and took two wickets in the Third Test win in Melbourne, but managed only two runs and three wickets {{in the last two}} Tests, which Australia won by an innings. <b>McCabe</b> ended the series with 201 runs at 33.50 and nine wickets at 22.77. <b>McCabe</b> ended the season with 783 runs at 87.00 and 19 wickets at 23.94.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, <b>McCabe</b> won a {{scholarship}} to the Catholic St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill in Sydney due to his sporting ability. Run by the Marist Brothers, the large school’s centerpiece stone castle-like building overlooks Sydney Harbour. After {{a month in the}} Second XI, <b>McCabe</b> was promoted to the Senior First XI at 14 as an all-rounder. He did not make a good start, registering a duck in his first innings. However, he impressed observers with his ability to hit the ball precisely. <b>McCabe</b> was always short, and playing against boys three years his senior, he could not rely on brute force. Aside from playing cricket, he was also full-back in the school's championship winning Rugby union team in 1926. During his time at St Joseph’s <b>McCabe</b> grew larger and batted more powerfully, and his exploits were regularly featured in the yearbook. In 1925, he struck his maiden century against Sydney Boys High School and score two more the following year. Such was his power that the backyard fence at the home of a friend had to be reinforcedMcCabe’s powerful square drives had been dislodging it. <b>McCabe</b> did not receive special coaching attention from the school's staff, who merely encouraged him to hit the ball hard and along the ground. In his later years at school, he was selected for Combined Great Public Schools of Sydneya combined team from Sydney's private schoolsfor the state schoolboys' carnival. <b>McCabe</b> studied hard and placed first in the class in each of his three years at St Joseph’s. At the end of 1926, he earned his Intermediate Certificate with five As and two Bs. <b>McCabe</b> then left school and became an accountant’s assistant.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{were now}} 02 down {{and needed to}} win three Tests in a row to retain the Ashes. The {{pressure}} on <b>McCabe</b> increased when last-minute injuries meant {{that he had to}} open the bowling. <b>McCabe</b> made 63 and 22 and took a wicket as Australia won their first match in the series. He then top-scored with 88 in Australia's first innings of 288 and made 55 in the second as Australia won by 148 runs in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to level the series. In the deciding Test at the MCG, <b>McCabe</b> scored 112, one of three centuries as Australia amassed 604, a record score in Ashes Tests in Australia. This laid the platform for the innings victory that retained the Ashes. <b>McCabe</b> aggregated 491 runs in five Tests at 54.55, with a century and five fifties in a consistent display.|$|E
5|$|Australia's captain Woodfull {{refused to}} retaliate and England made 524 in reply, <b>McCabe</b> having Jardine caught behind for 27 {{to end with}} 1/42. <b>McCabe</b> {{was one of the}} few Australians to make any impact in the second innings, making 32 as Australia fell for 164.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, McCabe’s cricket came to {{high-level}} {{attention for}} the first time. Charlie Macartney, who had just retired from Test cricket, brought a team that included six internationals, to Grenfell. <b>McCabe</b> scored 17 and took 5/84 against them. Then state and future Australian selector Chappie Dwyer, who led a team of Sydney Grade Cricketers {{to play in the}} country town. The <b>McCabe</b> brothers defeated them, Stan scoring 19. Later, the Test leg spinner Arthur Mailey led a team that also included Test player Tommy Andrews to Grenfell, and <b>McCabe</b> scored 62, 35 and 62 not out in three innings against them. In the 192728 season, <b>McCabe</b> played for the Southern Districts against other regional sides within the state. He made 92 not out in one match, but failed to pass 12 in six other innings. Dwyer returned in 192728 and <b>McCabe</b> scored 70 against his team. Dwyer convinced McCabe's parents to allow their son to move to Sydney to further his cricket career.|$|E

5|$|In 193233, <b>McCabe</b> {{made his}} {{breakthrough}} at international {{level in the}} First Test of the infamous Bodyline series, scoring an unbeaten 187 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in only four hours as his teammates fell around him. <b>McCabe</b> attacked the bowling vigorously, hooking relentlessly. He ended the series as the only Australian other than Bradman to score a century. <b>McCabe</b> missed most of the next season due to illness, but was retained for the 1934 tour of England despite his interrupted preparation. He scored 2,078 runs and eight centuries for the tour, including his maiden Test century in England. Following the retirement of captain Bill Woodfull {{at the end of}} the tour, <b>McCabe</b> became Australia’s vice-captain and held the post for the rest of his career.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test in Sydney, with England captain Douglas Jardine again {{employed}} Bodyline. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon {{to catch}} balls fended {{off by the}} batsman, {{in an attempt to}} curtail Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. <b>McCabe</b> came to the wicket on the first day, the score at 3/82 with Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Jack Fingleton already dismissed, and Bradman not playing due to illness. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to jump the fence if he was hit, <b>McCabe</b> took guard. Jardine had deployed seven men on the leg-side, usually with five close catchers and two men patrolling the boundary for hook shots. <b>McCabe</b> hooked the first ball he received from Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood for a boundary. After Kippax fell with the score at 87, <b>McCabe</b> and Vic Richardson added 129 before Richardson fell. <b>McCabe</b> reached stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. His innings was marked by dangerous cutting and compulsive hooking of short-pitched deliveries in front of his face, unfazed by the repeated body blows which hit his teammates.|$|E
5|$|<b>McCabe</b> {{followed}} his efforts at Trent Bridge with 38 and 21 in the drawn Second Test at Lord's. He bowled {{heavily in the}} match, sending down 43 overs and taking a total of 2/144 as Bradman's specialist bowlers struggled to make inroads. In the first two Tests, <b>McCabe</b> had taken a combined total of 2/208 from 64 overs. The Third Test at Old Trafford was abandoned before it started due to rain, and <b>McCabe</b> contributed only one and 15 as Australia scrambled to a five-wicket win to retain the Ashes in the low-scoring Fourth Test at Headingley after chasing a target of 105 on the third day. It {{was part of a}} three-week run in which <b>McCabe</b> failed to pass 15 in six innings and did not take a wicket. <b>McCabe</b> made fifties in the two first-class matches before the Fifth and final Test at The Oval, where Australia played an extra batsman, meaning that <b>McCabe</b> opened the bowling. He took 0/85 from 38 overs, and with Bradman and Fingleton injuring themselves during the match, <b>McCabe</b> was left in control of a nine-man team. England piled on 7/903 declared in three days before defeating Australia by an innings and 579 runs, the largest winning margin in Test history. This included a world record score of 364 by Len Hutton, who was dropped by wicket-keeper Ben Barnett from McCabe's bowling before reaching 50. Neither Bradman nor Fingleton were able to bat. <b>McCabe</b> made 14 and two, and finished the series with 362 runs at 45.25. <b>McCabe</b> scored 91 and 58 in tour matches against an England XI and the Leveson-Gower's XI to finish the English summer.|$|E

5|$|<b>McCabe</b> {{made his}} {{breakthrough}} in the following Australian season in 193233, which went down in history due to England's use of the controversial Bodyline tactics. In the lead-up to the Tests, <b>McCabe</b> scored 43, 67 and 19 in two tour matches against the Englishmen.|$|E
5|$|<b>McCabe</b> ran for an {{administrative}} position with his local club Mosman after his retirement, but was defeated, so {{he never had}} an opportunity to serve with the NSWCA. After the end of his first-class career, <b>McCabe</b> became a keen recreational golfer, but stopped playing in the mid-1950s due to his foot problems and other health issues. In 195657, <b>McCabe</b> and O'Reilly were given a testimonial match by the New South Wales Cricket Association. The match was between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI and acted as a trial for the non-Test tour of New Zealand. The match raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between <b>McCabe</b> and O'Reilly, and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.|$|E
5|$|<b>McCabe</b> {{settled in}} Sydney {{permanently}} in 1929, representing Mosman Cricket Club in Sydney Grade Cricket. His parents only {{allowed him to}} settle there permanently if Dwyer could help find him a job and lodgings, and <b>McCabe</b> subsequently began work in the accounting division of Colonial Mutual Insurance Company. Dwyer could only support one player and hard a hard decision in eventually turning down the second <b>McCabe</b> brother Les.

5|$|Returning to England in 1934, <b>McCabe</b> scored 2,078 runs at 69.28 {{including}} eight centuries on the tour, {{more than}} any of his teammates. In the second match of the tour against Leicestershire, <b>McCabe</b> scored the century that had eluded him four years earlier, finishing 108 not out. He then scored 192 against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, combining with Ponsford in a record partnership for the third wicket of 389, in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests; the MCC fielded almost a full-strength England team. <b>McCabe</b> put in an all round performance against Hampshire, scoring 79 and taking 4/79 in the first innings. In the next match, he scored 240, the highest of his career, against Surrey at The Oval. In the next match, the last fixture before the Tests, <b>McCabe</b> made 142 against Lancashire.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, England's bowlers {{continued}} to make regular inroads. Ward fell in the third over of the day, and the debutant Lindsay Hassett was dismissed soon after, leaving Australia at 5/150. <b>McCabe,</b> who had hit two boundaries thus far in the morning, was joined by Jack Badcock. The former {{continued to}} score boundaries regularly, and hit Sinfield for four and three from a leg glance and late cut to reach his 50 in 90 minutes. He then hit Hammond for consecutive on-driven fours before Badcock fell at 6/194, having made only 9 of the 43 runs in their partnership. <b>McCabe</b> had struck 62 of the 83 runs added since {{he had come to}} the crease. With all the other specialist batsmen dismissed, <b>McCabe</b> was now batting with wicket-keeper Ben Barnett and began to attack the English bowlers with powerful drives and hook shots. Hammond brought back Farnes to try and finish off the tail, but <b>McCabe</b> responded by hitting three fours in one over, forcing the English captain to remove his fast bowler after <b>McCabe</b> had hooked him for six.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, <b>McCabe</b> {{was called}} up for the 1930 tour of England despite being yet to score his maiden {{first-class}} century as the selectors chose the youngest ever team to leave Australia. <b>McCabe</b> made his first century in a warm-up match but struggled in his month in England, scoring only 51 runs. His performance began to improve after adjusting his technique and he played in all five Tests, although he continued to have problems converting starts into large scores, failing to make a century during the tour. <b>McCabe</b> managed to maintain his position {{over the next two}} home seasons, playing in all ten Tests, but failed to make a century, and after 15 Tests, his average was below 35 although he had become increasingly successful at first-class level.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the {{following}} season, <b>McCabe</b> appeared with the New South Wales Colts team in one match against Queensland, before being selected for the New South Wales Second XI to play their Victorian counterparts. <b>McCabe</b> scored 60 not out in the second innings and took a total of 6/100 for the match.

He made 60 and 34, and bowled 17 overs without success, but was later omitted when the Test players returned from international duty. In four first-class matches in his debut season, <b>McCabe</b> scored 197 runs at 32.83 and took a total of 1/111. <b>McCabe</b> played twice against the touring England cricket team led by Percy Chapman, once in a match at Goulburn for the Southern Districts of New South Wales, and the other time for his state, but managed only 24 runs in three innings.|$|E
