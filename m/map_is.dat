5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the <b>map</b> <b>is</b> a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E

As the player progresses through these regions, each representing a level, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. The goals for each level are straightforward: they generally fall {{along the lines of}} eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching the player the basics. Special items are hidden throughout certain levels. Such items perform actions such as increasing the player's creatures' experience level, or revealing the map. They can reveal a hidden level, where the player must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.|$|E

They realize they are now lost and decide simply to head south. They eventually reach a section where they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night, they hear sounds again, including the sound of children laughing among other strange noises. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn.|$|E

A <b>map</b> <b>is</b> available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, and locked doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some doors are locked by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E

The field <b>map</b> <b>is</b> an isometric area where the player can traverse between rooms. Enemies inhabit the field map and track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.|$|E

5|$|Like {{previous}} Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI {{consists of}} four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld <b>map</b> <b>is</b> a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters {{will be in the}} traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.|$|E

As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on the party's quadrupedal pet Noishe, and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E

Cameras are situated in eight locations {{in and around the}} house: the entry way, living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, driveway, and two hallways. A <b>map</b> <b>is</b> available as well so the player can see how the rooms are connected. The player can freely switch between viewing the different cameras to keep up on house activities and pick up clues from conversations. Kelli, an undercover agent, will also provide clues to the player. The player must avoid trapping her, any other agent, or the house guests.|$|E

5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather <b>map</b> <b>is</b> the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is a {{role-playing}} game {{in which}} players control the main protagonist, who can be named by the player.

Explored environments are automatically mapped out, with highlights being placed for unopened containers and doorways. These environments contain traps including pits, shifting floors, and floor tiles which damage the protagonist if stepped on. Alongside the main story quests, human non-playable characters and demons within the Schwarzwelt unlock side quests which yielded rewards upon completion. During the game, the protagonist's Demonica suit can be upgraded to open new pathways, enabling entry into new areas for story progression, {{as well as new}} parts of previously explored areas.|$|E
