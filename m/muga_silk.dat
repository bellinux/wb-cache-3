30|$|Silk is broadly {{classified}} as wild <b>silk</b> (Eri, Tasar, <b>Muga)</b> and domestic <b>silk</b> (mulberry). In the mulberry silk (Bombyxmori), glycine, alanine and serine constitute about 82  % of the amino acids, whereas, it is 73  % in the non-mulberry silks {{with a high}} proportion of alanine. The hydrophilic to hydrophobic amino acid ratio for non-mulberry silks (9.06 – 9.85) is higher compared to that of the mulberry varieties (5.29 – 6.22), which results in higher moisture content of non-mulberry silks (Altman et al. 2003; Sen and Murugesh Babu 2003). Silk fibroin has RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) sequence, which enhances cell adhesion, cell proliferation and differentiation (Muthumanickkam et al. 2013 b; Bray et al. 2013). Silk I is the helical protein present in the silk glands prior to spinning. When the silk fibroin is treated with ethanol, the water soluble silkI undergoes structural change to water insoluble silkII protein, which is also an effective sterilization approach to silk fibroin scaffolds (Zhang et al. 2012). Eri silk fibroin (ESF) is composed of about 100 repetitions of alternating polyalanine (Ala 12 − 13) and glycine-rich domains (Nakazawa et al. 2003). The glycine motifs are basically present in the random coil state structure, and it provides flexibility to the silk fibre, whereas the alanine rich motifs support to form crystalline ß-sheet structure. The sum of Gly and Ala residues in Eri silk is 82  % (Nakazawa et al. 2003; Huemmerich et al. 2006). The presence of sericin in Eri silk (Samiacynthiaricini) is less than that of mulberry silk, and also possesses higher amount of moisture regain than mulberry silk. ESF has higher content of hydrophilic and positively charged amino acids, which enhances the cell attachment and proliferation on the scaffold (Sen and MurugeshBabu 2004; Min et al. 2004).|$|R

[...] Production of silk fabrics is iconic of Assamese textiles. Silk is the most valued raw material of Assam, with the Antheraea assama worm producing the unique <b>muga</b> <b>silk.</b> [...] It is mostly the duty of women to construct silk fabrics, using a domestic backstrap loom. [...] Mahatma Gandhi had noted ‘Assamese women are born weavers, they weave fairy-tales in their cloth’. [...] Domestic weaving is an important craft for Assamese women, their marriage and future is seen as reliant upon this skill. At some stage, an unmarried girl would present a hand made bihuan to her beloved. Weaving holds a significant moral and cultural value in Assam. The silk and textile industry is also an economic resource to the state with over 25000 families associated with this craft. [...] Cane and bamboo crafts are also unique to Assam, the result of heavy physical work. Ridang, suli, lezai and long cane are a natural resource to the state. The finest cane is chopped and reduced to thin strips then woven into sheets. It is attached to the frame of a furniture piece, usually made out of bamboo sticks.

For women she weaves a variety of clothes, such as ege [...] "the lower garment of Mishing women", rihbi (a sheet with narrow stripes, wrapped to cover the lower garment and the blouse), gaseng (used for the same purpose {{as that of a}} rihbi, but having, unlike a rihbi, broad stripes of contrastive colours), gero (a sheet, usually off-white, wrapped round the waist to cover {{the lower part of the}} body, or round the chest to cover the body down to the knees or so), seleng gasor (a light cotton sheet, worn occasionally instead of a rihbi or a gaseng), riya (a long, comparatively narrow, sheet, wrapped, a bit tightly, round the chest), segrek (a loose piece of cloth, wrapped round the waist by married women to cover the eagey down to the knees), a pohtub (a scarf used to protect the head from the sun, dirt, etc.), and nisek (a piece of cloth to carry a baby with). Before yarn, produced by modern textile factories, was available in the market, Misings used to grow cotton and obtain cotton yarn by spinning. The use of endi yarn, obtained from worms fed on leaves of castor-oil plants, was probably common amongst them. However, they learnt the use of <b>muga</b> (<b>silk</b> obtained from silkworms fed on a kind of tall tree, called som in Assamese) and of paat (silk obtained from silkworms fed mulberry leaves) from their neighbours in the valley.

30|$|Among various {{natural silk}} fibers, muga (Antheraea assamensis) {{has the highest}} {{traditional}} and economical importance and is mainly cultivated in the northeastern part of India. <b>Muga</b> <b>silk</b> is generally used for making garments {{with a variety of}} conventional designs and embroidery. The <b>muga</b> <b>silk</b> fiber is mainly composed of two sub-fibers, each of which is known as fibroin [8, 9]. The two fibroins are surrounded and cemented together by a glue-like protein termed as sericin. As a natural silk, it is mainly composed of a protein which has multiple H bonds in its beta sheet secondary structure. As compared to all other natural silk fibers, <b>muga</b> <b>silk</b> possesses unique properties such as inherent natural golden color, highest tensile strength, high durability, stain free and moisture absorbent qualities, anti-flammable and anti-bacterial properties, biocompatibility, etc. [9, 10, 11]. All these properties of <b>muga</b> <b>silk</b> fiber make {{it one of the most}} suitable and important candidates for use as a biomaterial with further enhancement and refinement of some of its properties such as tensile strength and hydrophobicity.|$|E
40|$|The golden <b>Muga</b> <b>silk</b> Culture of Assam {{is as old}} as Assamese culture. Even {{today it}} {{occupies}} a very important place in life and culture of Assamese people. <b>Muga</b> <b>silk</b> is a symbol of rich Assamese culture and a part of traditional attire of this region. It is a pride of Assam. Presently, Muga culture has been providing bread and butter to nearly 30, 000 families in Assam alone. Assam is the largest silk producing state in the country alone contributes about 99 % of the total muga raw silk production. The <b>Muga</b> <b>silk</b> cloth is considered as the Queen of all fabric due to its durability and elegant lustrous natural colour. <b>Muga</b> <b>silk</b> is supposed {{to be one of the}} costliest fabrics in the textile world.

30|$|In this work, the RF plasma {{treatment}} on <b>muga</b> <b>silk</b> fiber at various treatment times is reported. The {{objective of this}} work {{is to increase the}} durability of the RF plasma-treated <b>muga</b> <b>silk</b> fiber by enhancing its tensile strength. It is important to mention that to enhance the mechanical strength of <b>muga</b> <b>silk</b> fiber, people generally and traditionally use starch on silk yarn before and after weaving the cloths which is known as ‘starching.’ This kind of process destroys the quality of the silk product as well as causes many kinds of skin diseases. Inert gas {{plasma treatment}} on the silk surface is a promising way to keep its all inherent properties the same as well as to enhance the tensile strength. The improvement in the hydrophobicity of muga fiber {{in order to reduce the}} application of natural/artificial dye on the fiber and to make it more hygienic to the skin and comfortable to wear is another motivation of this work. The work also aims at investigating the RF plasma discharge characteristics to better understand the properties of the plasma-treated fibers. The performances of the virgin and plasma-treated muga fibers have been evaluated using various characterization techniques. The correlation of the results obtained from the plasma discharge characteristics and characterization techniques with the observed properties of the fibers is attempted.|$|E
30|$|Ar plasma {{treatment}} on muga fibers {{has been carried}} out at an RF power of 20 W and treatment time range of 5 to 20 min. From FT-IR studies, it is revealed that Ar plasma-treated fibers exhibit a chemical behavior {{similar to that of the}} virgin fiber. At treatment time of 5 to 10 min the plasma-treated fibers show improved tensile strength and hydrophobicity as compared to the virgin one. The presence of higher carbon content and C-O/C-O-C, C-C/C-H/C[*]=[*]N, and OCOO units may further be accounted for the improvement in tensile strength and hydrophobicity of the fibers treated at lower treatment times. The reduction in carbon content and incorporation of more oxygen-containing functional groups at higher treatment times (15 to 20 min) are other important factors which decrease the properties of the fibers. The results suggest that RF Ar {{plasma treatment}} on this <b>muga</b> <b>silk</b> fiber is an innovative way to upgrade its qualities only by altering its surface chemistry and hence to successfully use as biomaterials such as <b>muga</b> <b>silk</b> suture.|$|E
