40|$|This paper {{estimates}} China's future {{population and}} labour force {{by developing a}} novel forecasting model for population. It combines information about age-specific parameters on fertility and mortality for both rural and urban areas using information about rural-urban migration and the transformation of rural areas into urban ones. This model {{takes into account the}} effects of urbanisation on changes in the age structure of the Chinese population; and provides separate projections on the rural and urban populations. Our findings show that (i) the shares of people aged 65 and over, in China's rural and urban populations, will double between 2010 and 2030; this implies that the ageing problem in rural areas will continue to be more serious than in urban areas; (ii) the rural labour force will shrink by 45 per cent, between 2010 and 2030, while the urban labour force will grow by 34 per cent; and (<b>iii)</b> <b>China's</b> urbanisation rate will increase to 71 per cent by 2030...|$|R

30|$|Latitudinal {{patterns}} of angiosperm species richness in Asia are important on the angiosperm specie richness in Taiwan because latitudinal range and climatic environments of Taiwan {{are similar to}} the subtropical regions in continental Asia. However, subtropical region is likely not the only source area of insular non-endemic angiosperm species in Taiwan. Some phylogenetic studies investigated population genetic variations to evaluate historical migration processes of plants from neighboring regions to Taiwan and five hypothetical migration routes have been proposed (Fig.  2) (Huang 2011, 2014; Shen 1997; Wang 1992 a, b). The five routes provided pathways for plants to migrate from tropical islands (Route I), Indochina (Route II), southern <b>China</b> (Route <b>III),</b> northeast <b>China</b> (Route IV) and temperate islands (Route V) to Taiwan (Fig.  2).

Lead author Cuihai Shen stated {{that if there was}} a gender disparity favoring men then [...] "they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time" [...] however their analysis indicated [...] "women advanced at least as fast as men did in both games".
