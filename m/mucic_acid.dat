This material is prepared from certain marine algae and, {{due to the fact that}} it is used as a food in the Orient and for medicinal purposes in Europe and America, as well as due to its employment for the preparation of culture media, its chemical nature has received considerable attention. It has been found that the composition of the agar varies with the nature of the plant from which it is obtained. Japanese agar is usually prepared from Gelidium corneum, while other species of Gelidium and species of Gracillaria, Fucus and Eucheuma are also employed in different parts of the world. Although agar contains a considerable amount of ash, themajor part of it consists of one or more hemicelluloses, or carbohydrates which are readily hydrolized by hot dilute mineral acids. The most important constituent of the agar is a galactan, first referred to by Payen as gelose, to which he gave the formula C 6 Hjo 05. Czapek (1913) in summarizing the results of previous investiga-tors, concludes that one-third of the agar consists of galactan.

The stoichiometry and stability constants of the complexes formed were determined at 25 °C and ionic strength I = 0. 2 mol dm − 3 (KCl). The spectral measurements revealed that vanadium(IV,V) coordinates first at the terminal COO− functions, forming mononuclear complexes. At pH > 3, through the metal ion-induced deprotonation and coordination of the neighbouring alcoholic functions, (COO−, O−) coordinated dinuclear complexes are formed, which predominate in the pH range 4 – 8. In the basic pH range, the ligand molecules are displaced and binary metal hydroxo and oxo complexes are present. EPR measurements at room temperature and at 140 K proved that formation of the VO(IV) dimers is more enhanced at room temperature, but at 140 K their dissociation is favoured. An interesting pH-dependent cis–trans isomeric equilibrium was assumed and analysed by EPR and molecular modelling {{in the case of}} the complexes [(VO) 2 L 2 H x] (x = − 2 and − 4).

Here, {{a family of}} cationic mucic acid-containing polymers is synthesized and shown to assemble with siRNA to form NPs. A cationic <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> polymer (cMAP) containing alternating <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> and charged monomers is synthesized. When combined with siRNA, cMAP forms NPs that require steric stabilization by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) that {{is attached to the}} NP surface via a 5 -nitrophenylboronic acid linkage (5 -nitrophenylboronic acid–PEGm (5 -nPBA–PEGm)) to diols on <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> in the cMAP in order to inhibit aggregation in biological fluids. As an alternative, cMAP is covalently conjugated with PEG via two methods. First, a copolymer is prepared with alternating cMAP–PEG units that can form loops of PEG {{on the surface of the}} formulated siRNA-containing NPs. Second, an mPEG–cMAP–PEGm triblock polymer is synthesized that could lead to a PEG brush configuration on the surface of the formulated siRNA-containing NPs. The copolymer and triblock polymer are able to form stable siRNA-containing NPs without and with the addition of 5 -nPBA–PEGm.

Because {{of the success}} of antibody-drug-conjugates, we are {{exploring}} the use of antibody targeted nanoparticles (NP) containing siRNA to produce multifunctional therapeutics. Here, we investigate the use of cetuximab (CTX) (commercial antibody to EGFR) targeted NPs containing siRNA against EGFR (sequence is for a region of the mRNA conserved in all types of mutations) in H 1975 NSCLC xenografts. Methods: We synthesized a cationic <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> polymer by polymerizing a derivative of <b>mucic</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> ethylenediamine, with dimethyl suberimidate. This polycation can self-assemble with siRNA to form the NP. A methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) was modified to have a 5 -nitrophenyl boronic acid (5 -nPBA) moiety at one end to attach to diol groups on <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> and stabilize the NP. 5 -nPBA-PEG with a carboxylic acid end group was conjugated to CTX to target the NP to EGFR receptors on the surface of cancer cells. These polymers were mixed with siRNA to form NPs, characterized by dynamic light scattering and cryo-transmission electron microscopy for size, and zeta potential measurements for surface charge. The NP was tested in vivo against tumors grown with H 1975 NSCLC cells that contain the L 858 R and T 790 M mutations. NPs dosed iv (tail vein) at 9. 3 mg/kg CTX targeting agent and 5 mg/kg siEGFR were injected twice a week for two weeks into nude mice with H 1975 NSCLC xenografts and the anti-tumor effects compared to 9. 3 mg/kg CTX (dosed iv tail vein) alone. Results: The CTX-targeted cMAP-siRNA NPs are ca. 40 nm in diameter as determined by both dynamic light scattering and cryo-TEM. The NPs' surface charge is slightly negative at - 3. 5 mV in 10 mM phosphate buffered at pH 7. 4 (surrogate for extracellular conditions in vivo). When the NPs are in 1 mM KCl at pH 5. 5 (surrogate for intracellular, endocytosis localization), the NP zeta potential is + 1 mV indicating detachment of 5 -nPBA-PEG from the NP at acidic pH. Thus, the NP is stabilized and targeted until it is endocytosed, where it disassembles to release the siRNA payload. We confirmed delivery of siEGFR to the tumor following two NP doses via a real-time PCR assay. In contrast to CTX treated mice that showed tumor growth delay but ultimately had tumors that grew to over 1000 mm^ 3, NP treated mice had tumors that remained below 200 mm^ 3 53 days following completion of 4 doses. Conclusions: NPs containing full antibodies as targeting agents and siRNA payloads can be formulated into well defined, stable experimental therapeutics. The NP system used here has a pH-tunable 5 -nPBA that allows for targeting and stabilizing the NP at a physiologic pH of 7. 4. The targeting agent and PEG coating is able to detach from the NP at acidic pH like those found in endosomes, enabling the siRNA payload to escape and reach its site of action within the cell. These NPs produce significant tumor regression in vivo that is superior to CTX alone...|$|E

CPT is conjugated to a biocompatible, hydrophilic copolymer of <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> and PEG (MAP).

These acids, and especially their sodium salts, are well suited to bacteriological techniques because of their solubility and heat stability, yet their usefulness for investigating the relationship of chemical structure to biological utilization has only recently been recognized.

Kendall, Bly and Haner (1923) concluded from a study of three monocarboxylic acids and three dicarboxylic acids that these compounds possessed little value for the differentiation of bacterial species. Koser and Saunders (1933) included one monocarboxylic acid with many other derivatives, and Sternfeld and Saunders (1937, 1938) employed seven monocarboxylic acids and one dicarboxylic acid in their studies on the utilization of sugars and their derivatives by bacteria.

Mice bearing BT- 474 human breast tumors treated with nontargeted MAP–CPT nanoparticles at 8 mg of CPT/kg show significant tumor growth inhibition (mean tumor volume of 63 mm 3) when compared to irinotecan at 80 mg/kg (mean tumor volume of 575 mm 3) and CPT at 8 mg/kg (mean tumor volume of 808 mm 3) {{at the end of the}} study. Herceptin antibody treatment at 5. 9 mg/kg results in complete tumor regressions in 5 out of 8 mice, with a mean tumor volume of 60 mm 3 at the end of the study. Mice treated with MAP–CPT nanoparticles at 1 mg of CPT/kg do not show tumor inhibition. However, all mice receiving administrations of MAP–CPT nanoparticles (1 mg of CPT/kg) that contain on average a single Herceptin molecule per nanoparticle (5. 9 mg of Herceptin equivalent/kg) show complete tumor regression by the end of the study. These results demonstrate that the antitumor efficacy of nanoparticles carrying anticancer drugs can be enhanced by incorporating on average a single antibody...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{biotechnology}} {{is one of}} the {{enabling technologies}} for biorefineries, where biomass is converted into value-added products. In addition to biofuels, several platform and fine chemicals can be produced from biomass using biotechnological routes taking advantage of metabolic pathways in the cell. Some of these metabolic pathways exist naturally in the cells that are used as production hosts. However, many of the desired chemical products are not naturally produced by the cellular metabolism. Consequently, genetic engineering is needed to redirect the cellular metabolism towards a product of interest. In this thesis, one of these metabolic pathways – the catabolic D-galacturonate pathway in filamentous fungi – was engineered and redirected to desired end products. D-Galacturonic acid is the main monomer of pectin, which is a common heteropolysaccharide in certain biomasses. Two examples of pectin-rich biomasses are citrus processing waste and sugar beet pulp from agro-industry. These residual biomasses are often poorly utilised. Biotechnological production of L-galactonic acid, a potential platform chemical, was demonstrated in this thesis for first time. The production was obtained in Aspergillus niger and Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) strains by deleting the second gene, encoding a dehydratase, from the fungal D-galacturonate pathway. Overexpression of the first gene, encoding a D-galacturonate reductase, in the pathway improved the initial production rate in A. niger. In addition, production at low pH resulted in higher productivity and titres in cultivations with the engineered A. niger strains. Final titres between 7 and 9 g L-galactonic acid l- 1 and product yields close to 100 % were observed from pure D-galacturonic acid with both of the production hosts. In addition to L-galactonic acid production from pure D-galacturonic acid, a consolidated bioprocess from citrus processing waste, a pectin-rich biomass, to L-galactonic acid was investigated using the engineered strains of A. niger. Two different bioprocess types, submerged and solid state fermentation, were compared. As a result, similar final titres and product yields were observed to those obtained in the process from pure D-galacturonic acid. The highest product yield, approaching 90 % of the theoretical maximum, was achieved in the solid state fermentation. The second reaction in the fungal D-galacturonate pathway is dehydration of L-galactonic acid by the action of an L-galactonate dehydratase. Deletion of the gene gaaB encoding this enzyme in A. niger is crucial for L-galactonic acid production. Despite the deletion of gaaB, product yields (L-galactonic acid per consumed D-galacturonic acid) have remained below the theoretical maximum. In addition, catabolisation of <b>mucic</b> <b>acid,</b> an industrially potential dicarboxylic acid that can be produced via an engineered D-galacturonate pathway, has been observed in the earlier studies. We hypothesised that catabolisation of L-galactonic acid and <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> may be due to other dehydratases. For these reasons, all the five putative dehydratase-encoding genes from A. niger were expressed in yeast and the resulting enzymes were characterised. The current study revealed the substrate specifities for four of the studied dehydratases, whereas one of the putative dehydratases was apparently not in fact an active dehydratase. In addition to GaaB, two dehydratases with activity towards D-galactonic acid and one with activity towards L-rhamnonic acid were identified. GaaB was the only dehydratase with activity towards L-galactonic acid. Although GaaB has broad substrate specificity, neither it nor any other dehydratase showed activity towards <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> or its lactone. In summary, undesired L-galactonic acid or <b>mucic</b> <b>acid</b> catabolisation was not explained by these dehydratases. L-Galactonate- 5 -dehydrogenase, a bacterial enzyme oxidising L-galactonic acid to D-tagaturonic acid, was also studied in this thesis. This enzyme activity has been demonstrated earlier from crude extract of Escherichia coli. Later on, the corresponding gene encoding the enzyme was suggested to be yjjN, although without characterisation of the enzyme. In this work, it was shown that yjjN does indeed encode an L-galactonate- 5 -dehydrogenase. The Km and kcat for L-galactonic acid were 19. 5 mM and 0. 51 s- 1, respectively. In addition, the YjjN enzyme was applied in a colorimetric assay for L-galactonic and L-gulonic acids with detection limits of 1. 65 μM and 10 μM, respectively. L-Galactonic acid can be lactonised and further oxidised to L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) via chemical or biochemical routes. Synthetic L-ascorbic acid is widely used as a nutrient and preservative in several industries. Currently, it is produced in a process combining chemical and biochemical steps. In this thesis, an A. niger strain was engineered for direct conversion of D-galacturonic acid to L-ascorbic acid. In addition to the deletion of gaaB, two heterologous genes, encoding L-galactono- 1, 4 -lactone lactonase and L-galactono- 1, 4 -lactone dehydrogenase from a plant biosynthetic L-ascorbic acid pathway, were introduced into A. niger. In addition, a gene encoding an unspecific L-gulono- 1, 4 -lactone lactonase from a mammalian biosynthetic L-ascorbic acid pathway was tested instead of the plant lactonase. The lactonase enzyme activity was not observed in any of the engineered A. niger strains. However, the resulting strains were capable of L-ascorbic acid production from pure D-galacturonic acid or citrus processing waste with final titres up to 170 mg l- 1. Pectin-rich biomass has potential as a raw material for the production of renewable chemicals. This thesis presents new ways to utilise this residual biomass by using industrial biotechnology. In addition, the thesis broadens basic understanding of the fungal catabolic D-galacturonate pathway and how it can be engineered for production of useful chemicals. Teollinen biotekniikka on yksi tärkeistä teknologioista, jotka mahdollistavat biomassan jalostamisen erilaisiksi lopputuotteiksi. Bioteknologiaa käyttäen biomassasta voidaan biopolttoaineiden lisäksi tuottaa useita eri kemikaaleja hyödyntämällä solujen metaboliareittejä. Osa näistä hyödyllisistä metaboliareiteistä on luonnostaan soluissa. Sen sijaan osa halutuista lopputuotteista ei syntetisoidu luonnostaan tuotto-organismeissa solujen metaboliareittien kautta. Näissä tapauksissa voidaan hyödyntää solujen geneettistä muokkausta, jotta solun metabolia saadaan ohjattua halutun yhdisteen tuottamiseen. Tässä työssä yksi solun metaboliareitti – mikrosienten D-galakturonihapon kataboliareitti – oli geneettisen muokkauksen kohteena ja se ohjattiin haluttujen yhdisteiden tuottoon. D-galakturonihappo on pektiinin pääkomponentti. Pektiini taas on yleinen kasvibiomassan heteropolysakkaridi. Sitrushedelmien ja sokerijuurikkaan prosessoinnista jäljelle jäävät kuori- ja puristusjäte ovat esimerkkejä pektiinipitoisista biomassoista. Nämä jäännösbiomassat ovat usein vajavaisesti hyödynnettyjä. L-galaktonihappo on kemikaali, jota voidaan potentiaalisesti hyödyntää moniin eri tarkoituksiin. Tässä työssä sen bioteknologinen tuotanto osoitettiin ensimmäisen kerran hyödyntäen Aspergillus niger ja Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) -homeita, joista D-galakturonihapporeitin toinen, dehydrataasientsyymiä koodaava geeni oli poistettu. D-galakturonihapporeitin ensimmäisen, D-galakturonihapporeduktaasia koodaavan geenin ekspressointi paransi alkuvaiheen tuottonopeutta A. niger -homeessa. Lisäksi matala pH paransi tuottoa muokatuissa A. niger -kannoissa. Puhtaasta D-galakturonihaposta saavutettiin parhaimmillaan 7 – 9 g l- 1 L-galaktonihapon tuotto saannon ollessa lähellä 100 %. L-galaktonihapon tuoton lisäksi tämän työn tutkimuskohteena oli bioprosessi suoraan pektiinipitoisesta biomassasta L-galaktonihapoksi. Kahta eri bioprosessityyppiä, nestemäistä ja kiinteän tilan kasvatusta, vertailtiin käyttäen muokattuja A. niger -kantoja. L-galaktonihapon loppupitoisuudet ja saannot pektiinipitoisesta biomassasta olivat verrannollisia arvoihin, joita saavutettiin puhtaasta D-galakturonihaposta. Korkein saanto, joka oli lähes 90 % teoreettisesta maksimista, saavutettiin kiinteän tilan prosessissa. Sienien D-galakturonihapon kataboliareitin toinen reaktio on L-galaktonihapon dehydratointi L-galaknonihappodehydrataasientsyymillä. Kyseistä entsyymiä koodaavan geenin deleetio on välttämätön L-galaktonihapon tuoton saavuttamiseksi. Deleetiosta huolimatta saannot (tuotettu L-galaktonihappo per kulutettu D-galakturonihappo) ovat jääneet alle teoreettisen maksimiarvon. Tämän lisäksi toisen D-galakturonihaposta tuotettavan yhdisteen, teollisesti potentiaalisen kemikaalin galaktaarihapon on havaittu katabolisoituvan sen tuottoon muokatuissa A. niger -kannoissa. Tässä työssä hypoteesinä edellä mainittujen yhdisteiden ei-toivotulle katabolialle olivat mahdolliset muiden dehydrataasientsyymien reaktiot. Näin ollen kaikki viisi putatiivista dehydrataasigeeniä A. nigerin genomista ekspressoitiin hiivassa ja niiden proteiinituotteiden dehydrataasiaktiivisuudet karakterisoitiin. Entsyymikarakterisoinnin avulla määritettiin neljän dehydrataasin substraattispesifisyydet, kun taas yksi putatiivisista dehydrataasigeeneistä ei todennäköisimmin koodaa toiminnallista dehydrataasia. GaaB-L-galaktonihappodehydrataasin lisäksi identifioitiin kaksi dehydrataasia, joilla on aktiivisuus D-galaktonihappoa, ja yksi dehydrataasi, jolla on aktiivisuus L-rhamnonihappoa kohtaan. GaaB oli ainoa tutkituista dehydrataaseista, jolla oli aktiivisuus L-galaktonihappoa kohtaan. Yhdelläkään tutkituista dehydrataaseista ei ollut aktiivisuutta limahappoa tai sen laktonimuotoa kohtaan. Näin ollen L-galaktonihapon ja limahapon kataboliaa ei voitu yhdistää tutkittuihin dehydrataaseihin. L-galaktonihappo- 5 -dehydrogenaasi on bakteereissa esiintyvä entsyymi, joka hapettaa L-galaktonihapon D-tagaturonihapoksi. Tämän entsyymin aktiivisuus on aikaisemmissa tutkimuksessa osoitettu Escherichia coli -bakteerin soluekstraktista. Myöhemmin kyseisen entsyymin ehdotettiin olevan yjjN-geenin koodaama, mutta kyseisessä tutkimuksessa ei karakterisoitu geenin koodaamaa proteiinia. Tässä työssä osoitettiin, että yjjN-geeni koodaa todellakin L-galaktonihappo- 5 -dehydrogenaasia. Km ja kcat -arvoiksi L-galaktonihappoa kohtaan määritettiin 19, 5 mM ja 0, 51 s- 1. Tämän lisäksi YjjN-entsyymiä hyödynnettiin kolorimetrisessä analyysimenetelmässä L-galaktoni- ja L-gulonihapon pitoisuuksien määrittämiseen. Havaittavien pitoisuuksien alarajaksi määritettiin L-galaktonihapolle 1, 65 μM ja L-gulonihapolle 10 μM. L-galaktonihappo voidaan laktonisoida ja edelleen hapettaa L-askorbiinihapoksi (vitamiini C) käyttäen kemiallisia tai biokemiallisia reaktioita. Synteettinen L-askorbiinihappo on laajalti käytössä ravinteena ja säilöntäaineena eri teollisuudenaloilla. Tällä hetkellä käytössä oleva valmistusmenetelmä yhdistää useita kemiallisia ja biokemiallisia vaiheita. Tässä työssä A. niger -home muokattiin tuottamaan L-askorbiinihappoa D-galakturonihaposta. gaaB-geenin poistamisen lisäksi kasvien L-askorbiinihapon synteesireitiltä ekspressoitiin L-galaktono- 1, 4 -laktoni laktonaasia ja L-galaktono- 1, 4 -laktoni dehydrogenaasia koodaavat geenit A. nigerissä. Vaihtoehtoisesti epäspesifi L-gulono- 1, 4 -laktoni laktonaasia koodaava geeni eläinten L-askorbiinihapon synteesireitiltä ekspressoitiin kasviperäisen laktonaasin sijasta. Laktonaasientsyymiaktiivisuutta ei pystytty kuitenkaan havaitsemaan yhdestäkään muokatuista A. niger -kannoista. Tästä huolimatta kannat pystyivät tuottamaan L-askorbiinihappoa puhtaasta D-galakturonihaposta tai sitrushedelmien prosessijäännösbiomassasta. Korkein havaittu L-askorbiinihapon pitoisuus kasvatuksissa oli 170 mg l- 1. Pektiinipitoinen biomassa on potentiaalinen uusiutuva raaka-aine kemikaalien tuottamiseksi. Tämä väitöskirja tuo esille uusia tapoja, joilla jäännösbiomassa voidaan hyödyntää entistä tehokkaammin käyttäen teollista bioteknologiaa. Lisäksi väitöskirja laajentaa perusymmärrystä sienien D-galakturonihapon metaboliareitistä ja siitä, kuinka sitä voidaan muokata tuottamaan hyödyllisiä kemikaaleja...|$|E
