25|$|Though {{member of}} a number of {{scientific}} institutions around the world, recipient of a few doctor honoris causa titles, a vastly prolific author and during his lifetime himself subject of 4 PhD dissertations, Tejada did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> elite of Spanish law scholars and did not enter Real Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislación. There are conflicting accounts of his standing in the academic realm. Some claim that he was universally highly regarded as doctrinally intransigent but pro-student open-minded, tolerant scholar, as demonstrated by his supervision of PhD bid of Enrique Tierno Galván, the future key PSOE politician. Others present him as a feared „inquisidor”, extremely quarrelsome hypocrite pursuing private goals and eager to call security when dealing with manifestations of student dissent towards him.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the big}} {{activities}} is trips to base camp (aka trekking), which can be higher {{than some of the}} highest mountains. The other big activity is serious attempts to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Everest, and those in support of those attempts. The peak time for this is late May, because that is when the monsoons push the jet stream away, there is another time later in the year when the monsoon ends yielding another break in the weather, but there is more snow then. Some technology for climbing include crampons, fixed ropes, various cold-weather gear, bottled oxygen, and weather prediction. Predicting the weather is critical, one of the big disasters came in 1996 when a storm hit during a summit bid. In modern times, there is greater on-demand logistical support available such as internet access, but also some new challenges like not offending the locals and watching out for oxygen-bottle thefts. Helicopter support has grown and the availability of helicopter rescues increased, but there are limits on how high and in what weather they are able to fly. Modern dangers remain unexpected avalanches (this claimed many in 2014 and 2015), sudden onset of altitude sickness, and that classic climbing danger- falling. For a price, permits are available from China in the Tibet region and from Nepal and there is a multitude of mountaineering firms world over operating on the mountain.|$|E
25|$|For marching band, schools {{compete against}} other {{schools in the}} same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into seven areas for Class 5A and 6A schools, and five areas for Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A schools. All schools of all classes compete in region {{competition}} annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Class 4A and Class 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 5A can advance from region to area and state. In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, {{they need to get}} an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, whether it be a 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band needs {{to make it to the}} Area Final competition AND <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> 3-5 bands to get to State. The Area and State winner is the school with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.|$|E
