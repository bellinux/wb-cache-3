Four serotypes of {{monovalent}} live attenuated dengue {{virus vaccine}} candidates were tested for reactoge-nicity and immunogenicity in 49 flavivirus non-immune adult human volunteers. The four monovalent candidates were then combined into a tetravalent formulation {{and given to}} another 10 volunteers. Neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates after a single-dose monovalent vaccination ranged from 53 % to 100 %. Solicited reactogenicity was scored by each volunteer.

Reactogenicity differed among the four serotype candidates with serotype- 1 associated with the most vaccine related side effects.

40|$|Some past {{epidemics}} {{of different}} influenza subtypes (particularly A/H 3 N 2) in the US saw co-circulation of vaccine-type and variant strains. There {{is evidence that}} natural infection with one influenza subtype offers short-term protection against infection with another influenza subtype (henceforth, cross-immunity). This suggests that such cross-immunity for strains within a subtype {{is expected to be}} strong. Therefore, while vaccination effective against one strain may reduce transmission of that strain, this may also lead to a reduction of the vaccine-type strain's ability to suppress spread of a variant strain. It remains unclear what the joint effect of vaccination and cross-immunity is for co-circulating influenza strains within a subtype, and what is the potential benefit of a bivalent vaccine that protects against both strains. We simulated co-circulation of vaccine-type and variant strains under a variety of scenarios. In each scenario, we considered the case when the vaccine efficacy against the variant strain is lower than the efficacy against the vaccine-type strain (<b>monovalent</b> <b>vaccine),</b> as well the case when vaccine is equally efficacious against both strains (bivalent vaccine). Administration of a bivalent vaccine results in a significant reduction in the overall incidence of infection compared to administration of a <b>monovalent</b> <b>vaccine,</b> even with lower coverage by the bivalent vaccine. Additionally, we found that with greater cross-immunity, increasing coverage levels for the <b>monovalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> becomes less beneficial, while introducing the bivalent vaccine becomes more beneficial. Our work exhibits the limitations of influenza vaccines that have low efficacy against non-vaccine strains, and demonstrates the benefits of vaccines that offer good protection against multiple influenza strains. The results elucidate the need for guarding against the potential co-circulation of non-vaccine strains for an influenza subtype, at least during select seasons, possibly through inclusion of multiple strains within a subtype (particularly A/H 3 N 2) in a vaccine...|$|E

After implementation of rotavirus vaccines in childhood immunization programmes, {{there has been an}} over 90 % reduction of rotavirus hospitalizations in industrialized and resource-deprived countries. Additionally, in Latin America, significant reduction of rotavirus-associated deaths has been recorded. Still, numerous countries do not recommend rotavirus mass vaccination because of assumed lack of cost-effectiveness and potential risk of intussusception, which is estimated at 1 per 50 000 – 70 000 doses of rotavirus vaccines. Cost-effectiveness of vaccination is affected in some countries by high price. Inclusion of herd protection and indirect costs in calculations for cost-effectiveness results in clear benefit: costs saved by health systems due to reduced rotavirus gastroenteritis hospitalizations far exceed the costs for implementation of rotavirus vaccination. There have been objections that high rotavirus vaccination coverage could put selective pressure on certain rotavirus strains against which protection after vaccination is less distinct. However, data now strongly suggest that even if there might be a relative increase of some specific genotypes after the use of rotavirus vaccines, this is not an absolute increase in incidence from certain genotypes and does not affect the overall effectiveness of rotavirus mass vaccination, which resulted in a major decrease of severe cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis in both industrialized and resource deprived countries...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{combined}} vaccine against Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) and Sheep/Goat Pox (SGP) {{was developed}} and applied in the field, using a new association of vaccine strains: PPR Nigeria 75 strain with a titre of 104. 1 TCID 50 and Sheep Pox Romania strain with a titre of 104. 0 TCID 50. Safety and efficacy were evaluated on goats and sheep in comparison with monovalent PPR and SGP vaccines. Goats were challenged by PPR virulent strain and sheep by SP virulent strain. The result shows that the combined PPR/SGP vaccine confers a good protection against both PPR and SGP infection with no significant difference with <b>monovalent</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The combined vaccine {{was used in the}} field on sheep flocks and good sero-conversion was detected for both diseases as soon as 14 days post vaccination...|$|R
