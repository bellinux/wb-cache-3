25|$|The {{point of}} {{exception}} handling routines {{is to ensure}} that the code can handle error conditions. In order to establish that exception handling routines are sufficiently robust, it is necessary to present the code with a wide spectrum of invalid or unexpected inputs, such as can be created via software fault injection and <b>mutation</b> <b>testing</b> (that is also sometimes referred to as fuzz testing). One of the most difficult types of software for which to write exception handling routines is protocol software, since a robust protocol implementation must be prepared to receive input that does not comply with the relevant specification(s).|$|E

A mutant frequency of 0.5–5.0 × 10−2 is found in carrier females, while a non-carrier female has a frequency of 1–20 × 10−6. This frequency is usually diagnostic by itself.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the genotoxicity of CSE 1034, a novel antibiotic adjuvant entity, using bacterial reverse <b>mutation</b> assay (Ames <b>test)</b> and in vitro chromosomal aberration <b>test.</b> Methods: Reverse <b>mutation</b> <b>test</b> {{was carried out}} using four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535 and TA 1537) and one strain of E. coli [WP 2 (uvrA) ], while chromosomal aberration test was done with cultured Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells.

50|$|<b>Mutation</b> <b>testing</b> (or Mutation {{analysis}} or Program mutation) is used {{to design}} new software tests and evaluate the quality of existing software tests. <b>Mutation</b> <b>testing</b> involves modifying a program in small ways. Each mutated version is called a mutant and tests detect and reject mutants by causing {{the behavior of the}} original version to differ from the mutant. This is called killing the mutant. Test suites are measured by the percentage of mutants that they kill. New tests can be designed to kill additional mutants. Mutants are based on well-defined mutation operators that either mimic typical programming errors (such as using the wrong operator or variable name) or force the creation of valuable tests (such as dividing each expression by zero). The purpose is to help the tester develop effective tests or locate weaknesses in the test data used for the program or in sections of the code that are seldom or never accessed during execution. <b>Mutation</b> <b>testing</b> is a form of white-box testing.|$|E

40|$|Background: Red ginseng oil (RGO) is {{produced}} by supercritical CO 2 extraction of secondary products derived from Korean Red Ginseng extract. As the use of RGO has increased, product safety concerns have become more important. Methods: In the present study, the subacute oral toxicity and bacterial reverse mutagenicity of RGO were evaluated. Sprague–Dawley rats were orally administered with RGO for 28 d by gavage. Daily RGO dose concentrations were 0  mg/kg body weight (bw), 500  mg/kg bw, 1, 000  mg/kg bw, or 2, 000  mg/kg bw per day. Bacterial reverse <b>mutation</b> <b>tests</b> included five bacterial strains (Escherichia coli WP 2 and Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, and TA 1537), which {{were used in the}} presence or absence of metabolic activation. The plated incorporation method for <b>mutation</b> <b>test</b> was used with RGO concentrations ranging from 312. 5  μg to 5, 000  μg per plate. Results: The subacute oral toxicity test results did not reveal any marked changes in clinical characteristics. There were no toxicological changes related to RGO administration in hematological and serum biochemical characteristics in either control or treatment animals. Furthermore, no gross or histopathological changes related to RGO treatment were observed. The bacterial reverse <b>mutation</b> <b>test</b> results did not reveal, at any RGO concentration level and in all bacterial strains, any increase in the number of revertant colonies in the RGO treatment group compared to that in the negative control group.

40|$|Testing for {{mutagenicity}} and carcinogenicity {{has become}} an integral part of the toxicological evaluation of drugs and chemicals. Standard carcinogenicity tests in vivo require both large numbers of animals and prolonged experiments. To circumvent these problems, several rapid tests have been developed for preliminary screening of mutagens and carcinogens in vitro. Ames and his associates, the first to develop a <b>mutation</b> <b>test,</b> used mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium [1]. <b>Mutation</b> <b>tests</b> with Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and DNA-repair tests with E. coli and B. subtilis, have been developed.

Transfection is inhibited by base mutation, cleavage of DNA, loss of cohesive ends, interaction with histones, spermidine, nalidixic acid, etc. [3]. The efficiency of transfection is affected by temperature, DNA structure and the condition of the competence of the recipient cells [3].

5000|$|Tests can {{be created}} to verify the {{correctness}} of {{the implementation of a}} given software system, but the creation of tests still poses the question whether the tests are correct and sufficiently cover the requirements that have originated the implementation. (This technological problem is itself an instance of a deeper philosophical problem named [...] "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" [...] will guard the guards?".) In this context, <b>mutation</b> <b>testing</b> was pioneered in the 1970s to locate and expose weaknesses in test suites. The theory was that if a mutant was introduced without the behavior (generally output) of the program being affected, this indicated either that the code that had been mutated was never executed (dead code) or that the test suite was unable to locate the faults represented by the mutant. For this to function at any scale, a large number of mutants usually are introduced into a large program, leading to the compilation and execution of an extremely large number of copies of the program. This problem of the expense of <b>mutation</b> <b>testing</b> had reduced its practical use as a method of software testing, but the increased use of object oriented programming languages and unit testing frameworks has {{led to the creation of}} <b>mutation</b> <b>testing</b> tools for many programming languages as a way to test individual portions of an application.|$|E

40|$|In the pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) era, non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{patients}} with de novo bone metastases had a worse prognosis than those without. However, whether {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) -TKIs affect the outcomes of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients with de novo bone metastases has not been well studied thus far. We retrospectively studied the effect of EGFR mutation status and first-line EGFR-TKIs on patient outcomes and created a survival scoring system for NSCLC patients with de novo bone metastases. This retrospective study evaluated 1510 NSCLC patients diagnosed between November 2010 and March 2014. Among these patients, 234 patients had de novo bone metastases.

The final Tensguard™ product, a supplement or a functional food ingredient, is intended for use by people who want to follow a healthy diet and lifestyle in order to manage their blood pressure. The safety-in-use of commercial lactotripeptide-containing products has been confirmed in several in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies and in studies with humans. To support the safety, Tensguard™ was examined in three in vitro genotoxicity <b>tests</b> (bacterial reverse <b>mutation</b> <b>test,</b> mammalian cell gene <b>mutation</b> <b>test</b> and mammalian chromosomal aberration test) and in a 90 -day repeated-dose oral toxicity study in rats. The genotoxicity tests confirm that Tensguard™ is not mutagenic or clastogenic. The NOAEL from the 90 -day study was at the highest dose tested, i. e. 4 % in the diet. The NOAEL is equivalent to an overall mean intake of 2 g Tensguard™/kg body weight/day and corresponds to 40 mg IPP/kg body weight/day. This is 141 -fold higher than the maximal anticipated intake.
