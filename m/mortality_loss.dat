Excessive nitrates in drinking water is thought to cause methemoglobinemia in infants, which decreases the blood's oxygen transport ability. Moreover, excess input of N from point and non-point sources to surface water promotes eutrophication in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans which causes several problems in aquatic ecosystems e.g. toxic algal blooms, oxygen depletion in water, fish <b>mortality,</b> <b>loss</b> of aquatic biodiversity.|$|E

Background. There has been a rapid scale up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Ethiopia since 2005. We aimed to evaluate <b>mortality,</b> <b>loss</b> to followup, and retention in care at HIV Clinic, University of Gondar Hospital, north-west Ethiopia. Method.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} a 5 -year HIV care programme (2003 - 2007) in the Sihanouk Hospital Center of HOPE, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. METHODS: Analysis of routine programme indicators per year: {{number of new}} patients, active patients, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage in the cohort, <b>mortality</b> and <b>loss</b> to follow-up. Comparison of mortality {{before and after the}} start of ART using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Analysis of risk factors using Cox regression for the combined endpoint of <b>mortality</b> and <b>loss</b> to follow-up in patients on ART. RESULTS: 3844 patients were registered in the hospital between March 2003 and December 2007. The <b>mortality</b> and <b>loss</b> to follow-up rate fell and paralleled the rise of ART coverage from 23 % in 2003 to 90 % in 2007. The <b>mortality</b> and the <b>loss</b> to follow-up rate was significantly higher in patients not on ART but eligible (Log rank P < 0. 001). The combined endpoint of <b>mortality</b> and <b>loss</b> to follow-up was 48. 7 % after one year in patients who were waiting for ART. 1667 patients were started on ART. The combined endpoint (<b>mortality</b> and <b>loss</b> to follow-up) in this group was 11. 5 % at 12 months and 14. 2 % at 24 months. Risk factors for mortality in the ART group were male sex, CD 4 count < 50 cells/microl, BMI < 18 and haemoglobin levels < 10 g/dl. CONCLUSION: Better access to ART is associated with lower <b>mortality</b> and fewer <b>losses</b> to follow-up. Pre-ART attrition remains significant.

We found that people with lower incomes were more likely than those with higher incomes to report worse health. For the overall sample, using the governmental administrative data, the hazard ratios of <b>mortality</b> and <b>loss</b> of healthy life-years comparing the lowest to the highest income level were 3. 50 for men and 2. 48 for women for mortality and 3. 71 for men and 2. 27 for women for loss of healthy life.

The importance of nutritional support along with an appropriate exercise regimen, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol use is to be empha-sized along with the pharmacologic approach to osteoporosis. Despite the effectiveness of therapy with pharmacologic agents, most patients who start therapy do not remain on treatment for more than 1 year. (Ar...|$|E

We simulate household-specific wealth dynamics based on a model parameterized using rich panel and experimental data from the region. The simulations allow us to investigate patterns of willingness to pay for asset index insurance that is imperfectly correlated with individuals' loss experience. The bifurcated livestock dynamics associated with the poverty trap gives rise to insurance valuation that is highly nonlinear in individual herd size. Willingness to pay among vulnerable groups who most need insurance are, on average, lower than commercially viable rates but subsidization of IBLI premiums appears to offer more cost-effective poverty reduction than direct transfers to the poor.

40|$|Abstract: Aortic valve {{disease is}} a burgeoning public health problem {{associated}} with significant <b>mortality.</b> <b>Loss</b> of function mutations in NOTCH 1 cause bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and calcific aortic valve disease. Because calcific nodules manifest on the fibrosa side of the cusp in low fluidic oscillatory shear stress (OSS), elucidating pathogenesis requires approaches that consider both molecular and mechanical factors. Therefore, we {{examined the relationship between}} NOTCH loss of function (LOF) and biomechanical indices in healthy and diseased human aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs). An orbital shaker system was used to apply cyclic OSS, which mimics the cardiac cycle and hemodynamics experienced by AVICs in vivo. NOTCH LOF blocked OSS-induced cell alignment in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas AVICs did not align when subjected to OSS under any conditions.

30|$|One {{potential}} undesirable {{effect of}} moderate burn severity is the {{increased risk of}} high severity burn patches within the moderate severity burn matrix. The fires we studied consisted {{of only a few}} moderate-high burn severity patches that were relatively small (< 120 ha).

Small pockets of high burn severity can be very effective at breaking up fuel continuity and creating wildlife habitat on a landscape (Rollins et al. 2001). On the other hand, larger patches of high burn severity can result in undesirable effects such as increased runoff and erosion, which may be detrimental to endangered species such as the Gila trout (Oncorhynchus gilae) (Brown et al. 2001). Moreover, high burn severity patches could result in complete tree <b>mortality,</b> <b>loss</b> of soil, and a possible complete type conversion (Strom and Fulé 2007).|$|E

All possible direct and indirect losses due to the disease, viz. <b>mortality</b> <b>losses,</b> losses due to direct reduction in milk/wool yield, losses due to reproduction failure, body weight losses, treatment costs and opportunity costs, were considered to provide estimate of annual economic losses due to PPR in sheep and goats in India.
