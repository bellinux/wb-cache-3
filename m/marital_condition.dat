Our study shows that divorce rates tend to be too high under a unilateral divorce law in the non-transferable utility case. On the other hand, mutual-consent divorce law generates multiple equilibria, and divorce rates are then inefficient even in the transferable utility case. In this multiple equilibrium case, divorce rates are determined by social factors, such as culture, norm, and religion. Exit; Voice; Divorce law...|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite {{the large}} volume of {{research}} dedicated to health-related behavior change, chronic disease costs continue to rise, thus creating a major public health burden. Health literacy, the ability to seek, understand, and utilize health information, {{has been identified as}} an important factor in the course of chronic conditions. Little research has been conducted on the relationship between health literacy and health-related behaviors and health status in elderly Chinese. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate the relationship between health literacy and health-related behaviors and health status in China. Methods: The subjects enrolled in this study were selected based on a stratified cluster random sampling design. Information involving > 4500 older adults in 44 pension institutions in Urumqi, Changji, Karamay, and Shihezi of Xinjiang between September 2011 and June 2012 was collected. The Chinese Citizen Health Literacy Questionnaire (China Health Education Centre, 2008) and a Scale of the General Status were administered and the information was obtained through face-to-face inquiries by investigators. A total of 1452 respondents met the inclusion criteria. A total of 1452 questionnaires were issued and the valid response rate was 96. 14 % (1396 of 1452). Factors affecting health literacy and the relationship to health literacy were identified by one-way ANOVA and a multiple linear regression model. Results: The average health literacy level of the elderly in nursing homes was relatively low (71. 74 ± 28. 35 points). There were significant differences in the health literacy score among the factors of age, gender, race, education level, household income, <b>marital</b> <b>conditions,</b> and former occupation (p 0. 05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the independent influencing factors of health literacy included education level, race, former occupation, household income, age, physical exercise, health examination, smoking, and health information access (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Health literacy was significantly associated with health-related behaviors in elderly Chinese. Further longitudinal studies are needed to help confirm that improving health literacy in the elderly may be effective in changing health-related behaviors. To reduce risky habits, educational interventions to improve health literacy should be simultaneously conducted in health promotion work...|$|R

This machine-readable version of John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics {{is the result of}} a collaboration between the Statistical Directorate of the National Assembly for Wales, the History Data Service and the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis at Queen's University Belfast. John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics is intended to provide a service for those working on the history of modern Wales. It arises from a belief that the quantitative element is a necessary and important part of the historical record; from an awareness that it was an aspect that was particularly inaccessible for scholars of Welsh history; and from a conviction that some encouragement in the use of quantitative material was necessary. It is modelled on the two volumes dedicated to British historical statistics: Mitchell, B. R. and Deane, P. (1962) Abstract of British historical statistics and Mitchell, B. R. and Jones, H. G. (1971) Second abstract of British historical statistics. Main Topics : The main tables are: Total population and intercensal change by sex by county, 1801 - 1971 Number of females per 1000 males by county, 1801 - 1971 Age and <b>marital</b> <b>condition</b> by sex, 1841 - 1971 Area/acreage by county, 1841 - 1971 Population of Registration Counties as constituted at the time of each Census, 1841 - 1911 Comparative area and population of Registration, Ancient and Administrative Counties, 1891 Parish Register returns of baptisms, burials and marriages, 1700 - 1840 Estimated mid-year population by sex, 1841 - 1974 Estimated mid-year population totals by county, 1903 - 1974 Number of deaths by sex, crude death-rates and infant mortality, 1838 - 1974 Number of births and birth-rates, 1839 - 1974 Number of marriages and rate per 1000 population, 1839 - 1974 Population of towns, 1801 - 1971 Net migration and natural increase, number and per cent for each, inter-censal period, by county, 1841 - 1971 Number born in Wales and living in United States, 1850 - 1970 Number of Welsh speakers by sex, by county and county borough, 1891 - 1971 Welsh speakers as a percentage of total population over three years of age, by county and county borough, 1891 - 1971 Welsh-speaking population by age, 1901 - 1971 Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether the participation on a chemoprevention study for premalignant lesions could influence smoking cessation. MethodsTwo hundred one volunteers, current (n = 188) and former smokers (n = 13) with more than 20 pack years had been screened for the chemoprevention study. One hundred forty-six of the current smokers at time of chemoprevention study screening have been retrospectively interviewed about their smoking behavior ≥ 1 year after their first contact for the chemoprevention study. Structured questionnaires were used, and interviews were held by telephone. The quitters at the time of these first interviews were contacted again 4 years after the initial interview about their current smoking behavior. ResultsOf the 146 smoking volunteers, 83 were diagnosed with premalignant lesions of the bronchial mucosa and participated in the chemoprevention study, and 63 had no premalignant lesions and were not included in that study. The majority of participants were men: 87 (60 %). The mean age of the participants was 52 ± 9 years, and the mean age at which volunteers started smoking was 15 ± 3. Mean number of pack years was 47 ± 27. Ten volunteers in the group without premalignant lesions and 19 in the group with premalignant lesions had quit smoking at time of the first interview. The smoking cessation rate of the total study group was 20 %. Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that smoking cessation was only significantly associated with male gender. No significant associations were found between smoking cessation and the finding of premalignant lesions, sex, age, level of addiction, educational level, <b>marital</b> <b>condition,</b> history of cancer/pulmonary diseases, age at start smoking, previous attempts to quit smoking, and motivation to quit smoking. Within the group of subjects who had quit smoking at the time of the first interview, 15 of 29 persons who had stopped smoking at the time of the first interview have reported that participation in the bronchoscopy screening and/or the trial has been of major influence on their decision to stop smoking. ConclusionsA smoking cessation rate of 20 % has been found among volunteers for a chemopreventive trial investigating smoking-related premalignant lesions after almost 2 years after initial contact has been found. Volunteers experienced screening and trial participation as having influenced their smoking cessation. Smoking cessation was significantly associated with male gender, whereas the finding of premalignant lesions by bronchoscopy was not...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The first Labour Force Survey (LFS) in the United Kingdom was conducted in 1973, {{under the terms of}} a Regulation derived from the Treaty of Rome. The provision of information for the Statistical Office of the European Communities (SOEC) continued {{to be one of the}} reasons for carrying out the survey on an annual basis. SOEC co-ordinated information from labour force surveys in the member states in order to assist the EC in such matters as the allocation of the Social Fund. The survey was carried out biennially from 1973 to 1983 and was increasingly used by UK government departments to obtain information which would assist in the framing of social and economic policy. By 1983 it was being used by the Employment Department (now the Department for Work and Pensions) to obtain information which was not available from other sources or was only available for Census years. From 1984 the survey was carried out annually, and since that time the LFS has consisted of two elements: a quarterly survey conducted in Great Britain throughout the year, in which each sampled address was called on five times at quarterly intervals, and which yielded about 15, 000 responding households in every quarter a 'boost' survey in the spring quarter (March-May), which produced interviews at over 44, 000 households in Great Britain and over 4, 000 households in Northern Ireland Users should note that only the data from the spring quarter and the 'boost' survey were included in the annual datasets for public release, and that only data from 1975 - 1991 are available from the UK Data Archive. The depositor recommends only considered use of data for 1975 and 1977 (SNs 1757 and 1758), as the concepts behind the definitions of economic activity changed and are not comparable with later years. Also the survey methodology was being developed at the time and so the estimates may not be reliable enough to use. During 1991 the survey was developed, so that from spring 1992 the data were made available quarterly, with a quarterly sample size approximately equivalent to that of the previous annual data. The Quarterly Labour Force Survey series therefore superseded the annual LFS series, and is held at the Data Archive under GN 33246. For the fourth edition of the study, the depositor supplied a re-weighted version of the data file. The re-weighting has been done to bring LFS data in line with the population estimates from the 2001 Census. Main Topics : The basic set of LFS questions sought information about household composition: i. e. for each usually resident individual member of the household, the relationship to the head of the household, sex, age, <b>marital</b> <b>condition</b> and nationality. For persons above the statutory school-leaving age information was sought about the main economic activity, any secondary economic activity, and economic activity one year previously. For unemployed persons questions were asked about the type of employment sought, duration of unemployment and method of seeking employment, previous employment status and industry and whether or not registered as unemployed at an official employment office. <br...|$|E
40|$|Despite recent “get tough ” {{trends in}} {{juvenile}} justice, relatively {{little is known}} about support for sanctioning youths in adult courts. In response, this study examines several neglected explana-tory factors, including links between marital status, political orientation, and philosophy of pun-ishment. Analysis of data from the 1995 National Opinion Survey of Crime and Justice suggests that marital status and philosophy of punishment are consistently associated with support for adult sanctioning of youths when the offense involves any of three categories of offenses (selling illegal drugs, committing property crime, or committing violent crime). It also suggests that <b>marital</b> status <b>conditions</b> the effect of philosophy of punishment, an effect itself conditioned by political orientation when the offense involves selling illegal drugs. Research and policy impli-cations are discussed. In recent years, getting tough with juvenile offenders has become aprominent focus of reforms and political campaigns (Roberts & Stalans, 1998; Singer, 1996).

MethodsConsenting adult Chinese, Malay and Indian subjects in Singapore were interviewed using Singapore English, Chinese, Malay or Tamil versions of the EQ- 5 D, Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI 2) and Mark 3 (HUI 3), and SF- 6 D. Agreement between instruments was assessed using Bland–Altman (BA) plots. Changes in incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) from dUTY were investigated using eight hypothetical decision trees. The influence of sociodemographic/clinical factors on dUTY between instrument pairs was studied using multiple linear regression (MLR) models for English-speaking subjects (circumventing structural zero issues). ResultsIn 667 subjects (median age 48 years, 59 % female), median utility scores ranged from 0. 80 (95 % confidenceinterval [CI] 0. 80, 0. 85) for the EQ- 5 D to 0. 89 (95 % CI 0. 88, 0. 89) for the SF- 6 D. BA plots: Mean differences (95 % CI) exceeded the clinically important difference (CID) of 0. 04 for four of six pairwise comparisons, {{with the exception of the}} HUI 2 /EQ- 5 D (0. 03, CI: 0. 02, 0. 04) and SF- 6 D/HUI 2 (0. 02, CI: 0. 006, 0. 02). Decision trees: The ICER ranged from $ 94, 661 /QALY (quality-adjusted life-year; 6. 3 % difference from base case) to $ 100, 693 /QALY (0. 3 % difference from base case).

40|$|Aims Associations between {{marital status}} and self-rated health were investigated, {{adjusting}} for material conditions and trust (social capital). Methods The 2004 public-health survey in Skåne is a cross-sectional study. A total of 27, 757 persons aged 18 - 80 years answered a postal questionnaire, which represents 59 % of the random sample. A logistic regression model {{was used to}} investigate associations between marital status and self-rated health, adjusting for economic problems and trust. Results The prevalence of poor self-rated health was 28. 7 % among men and 33. 2 % among women. Older respondents, respondents born abroad, with medium/low education, low emotional support, low instrumental support, economic problems, low trust, never married and divorced had significantly higher odds ratios of poor self-rated health than their respective reference group. Low trust was significantly higher among the divorced and unmarried compared to the married/cohabitating. Adjustment for economic problems but not for trust reduced the odds ratios of poor self-rated health among the divorced, which became not significant among men. Conclusions Never married and the divorced have significantly higher age-adjusted odds ratios of poor self-rated health than the married/cohabitating group. Economic problems but not trust seem to affect the association between marital status and poor self-rated health.

40|$|The use of variably {{self-reported}} {{measures of}} wellbeing may produce differing outcomes. This {{study examined the}} differences in association with health, socioeconomic status, and social <b>conditions</b> (<b>marital</b> status, social capital) of two widely used cognitive subjective wellbeing measurements: Cantril’s ladder and Diener’s five-item Satisfaction with Life Scale. Methods: A stratified sampling design was used to collect data from representative households in the 20 neighborhoods of Rhini, a deprived suburb of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses investigated differences in the associations between wellbeing and health, demographics, socioeconomic status, and social conditions determined by the three measurements. Results: We found that the multiple-item satisfaction with life scale elicited more discriminating responses that took into account {{a broader range of}} life domains. This scale reported more significant relationships between subjective wellbeing and health, socioeconomic status, and social conditions. Cantril’s ladder produced a narrower range of career-like comparisons. The direction of association between measures of wellbeing and socioeconomic characteristics never changed according to the measures used. Conclusions: Policy-makers, researchers, and practitioners using these instruments {{should be aware of the}} differences between single- and multiple-item wellbeing measures, and recognize that the choice of instrument will affect the life domains found to be associated with wellbeing...|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is {{to introduce the}} SHARE project, which examines people older than fifty years, to the readers. SHARE project is really extensive and it operates in several countries of the world. Participating respondents answers different kinds of questions. Questions concerns general information, information about <b>marital</b> status, health <b>condition,</b> social, geographic and also economic information. For my thesis I have chosen four economic variables, for which I am going to make basic descriptive statistics and analysis. I am {{going to deal with}} current accounts, stocks, bonds and mutual funds. These are financial instruments, where people frequently save up or deposit their money. Because answering the question regarding financial situation is uncomfortable to many respondents, we have only limited number of answers, with which we are going to work. I will define all of these four variables and make basic descriptive statistics for them. Then I will make an analysis of the financial situation of respondents according to the gender for each variable separately. For the next analysis I have chosen a subjective question regarding respondent´s satisfaction with life depending on their financial situation. At the conclusion of this thesis i will try to evaluate each analysis individualy and to summarize the contribution of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{looks for the}} {{relation}} between the psychosocial distress experienced by the patient and his family caregiver during the period he is hospitalised. The sample is composed by 94 persons (oncology patients and family caregivers). We have used a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the “Quality of life Questionnaire” for general satisfaction and social support and the family APGAR for family functioning. The results indicate that the anxiety of the caregiver is significantly higher than the one of the patient. The family functioning perceived by the patient correlates negatively with the depression and positively with the general satisfaction of the family caregiver. We found a correlation between the age and the depression subscale. In the family caregivers group we confirm that the higher scores in depression appear in ages between 35 and 55. Married patients and caregivers obtain higher punctuation in depression compared to unmarried ones. We conclude that the patients psychosocial distress differs from the caregivers distress. The psychological intervention should focus on the individual needs of the patient and the caregiver by promoting the social net of the relatives, supplying a better communication with the patient, reducing the caregivers anxiety and attending the demands derived from physical <b>condition,</b> <b>marital</b> status and age...|$|R
