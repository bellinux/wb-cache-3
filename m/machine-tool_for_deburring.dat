I made this internship of eleven weeks within society HALGAND, located at Saint Brévin les Pins, next to Saint Nazaire. My mission within this company was to realize work instructions <b>for</b> <b>deburring</b> of robot cells. To explain this mission, first we are going to explain the goal, and then we are going to present the different steps to complete this mission. The goal of this mission is to improve the manufacturing process of parts, and so to improve the production. All of this, by establishing working instructions allowing automated deburring operations on parts. The first thing was to have a provisional repertoire of parts which are machined on robot cell on which I worked. With this list, I determined articles on which I had to make modifications. Indeed, improvements must be made on parts having the largest machining time for month on the robot cell. The second step was to make an inventory of parts previously targeted, to identify different deburring there are to perform during machining. So, I had to analyze computer machining simulations and to discuss with the machine operators to know the different deburring already performed during machining, and those remaining to complete. An inventory of tools <b>for</b> <b>deburring</b> which are presents in the workshop and deburring stations has been also realized. I also had to look for innovative tools in the field of automated deburring, which were not present in the workshop.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a functional scheme of a <b>machine-tool</b> <b>for</b> simultaneous abrasive machining of lenses with shallow high-accuracy executive surface. The machine-tools permits flexibly and within long range to control shape-formation process through changing such adjustment parameters as tool and rough workpiece frequency rotation, amplitude value of tool oscillatory motion, their diameters {{and number of}} double strokes per minute. While using the given <b>machine-tool</b> <b>for</b> machining process an operating force is directed along normal to the working surface and due to this {{there is a possibility}} to accelerate a shape-formation process of optical parts that leads to reduction of local errors on their executive surfaces. The paper considers a structure of the executive machine-tool mechanism which transfers translational motion to the tools and consists of rotational and rectilinear kinematic pairs forming a four-bar linkage and its crank is a guide link. A turning angle of the link is selected as a generalized coordinate of the executive mechanism. A relationship between the generalized coordinates and link positions of the executive machine-tool mechanism has been established in the paper and it permits to obtain analytical dependence between motions of input and output mechanism links with due account of its kinematic transfer function which represents in itself a ratio of angular output link speed to an angular velocity of the input link. An analysis of geometric parameters for backward-rotational motion of the top link in the proposed machine-tool has made it possible to obtain an expression to calculate a rod length of the executive mechanism which ensures symmetrical center position of the above-mentioned link relative to a symmetry axis of the bottom link. As an amplitude value of oscillatory motion for an out-put link in the executive mechanism is regulated in the <b>machine-tool</b> <b>for</b> two-sided lens machining while changing length of its input link (crank) an analytical relationship has been established between these geometric parameters and the rela- tionship provides a possibility purposefully to change a machining intensity in the central or edge zone of a part according to technological blank heredity in the context of allowance which is to be removed and which is distributed along its surface.  </p...|$|R

Although numerous advantages of brushing tools <b>for</b> <b>deburring</b> applications have been cited, the material removal mechanics and dynamic characteristics of such compliant tools {{are not well}} understood. It is recognized {{that there is an}} urgent need to formulate a process model <b>for</b> <b>deburring</b> with compliant tools. Furthermore, the control strategies <b>for</b> automatic <b>deburring</b> need to be developed in order to carry out advanced automatic deburring operation. In this research, process models have been obtained from brush/workpart dynamic systems and brush material removal characteristics. A process model for the dynamic system is established by employing a viscoelastic representation and Dynamic Data System (DDS) analysis. Parameters of the systems are identified by experimentally obtained dynamic response. The viscoelastic and first order DDS dynamic process models yield close agreement for poles of the system. Material removal characteristics are described by first order differential equations. Parameters of the system are evaluated by experimentally obtained 2 ̆ 2 Master Curves 2 ̆ 2 of dynamic force response. In addition, a multiple regression method and an Neural Network model are applied in modelling the burr height reduction. Control strategies have been developed for cases of burr with known constant height, known varying height, and unknown height. The closed-form solutions of transverse feed rate along the X axis have been obtained for both known constant height burr and known varying height burr. The feed rate is increased proportionally with increase of initial penetration depth. An equal-distance sampling technique was employed {{in the development of the}} closed-loop control system for burr with unknown height.

Industrial robots are attracting {{more and more}} attention <b>for</b> the <b>deburring</b> applications. However, Each wheel path program was taking eight to ten weeks to create because the position and orientation of the deburring tool must be accurately identified based on the curvature of the wheel. To solve this problem, we developed a practical 6 DOF robot path generation method using hybrid force and visual servoing methodology. The force servoing keeps the robot tool continuously contacting with the wheel surface and the visual servoing controls the robot tool to follow a marked tool path on the wheel while the position and orientation are controlled and recorded. A robot path is then generated from the recorded data.

The edge break is now done partly manual because of robots limitation in achieving the required quality and accuracy. A typical edge breaking requirement is 0, 38 - 0, 76 mm on discs.
