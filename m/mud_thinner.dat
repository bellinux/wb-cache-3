Methanol was used as a reaction medium in this experiment. At the end of the copolymerization process, a small amount of hydroquinone 1 % was added to inhibit polymerization process. The formation of graft copolymer was proven by the attachment of acrylic acid side chain to the lignin, which was demonstrated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy analyses. Rheological performances of lignin AA as a drilling <b>mud</b> <b>thinner</b> were compared with a commercial thinner (lignosulfonate). Results found that the newly formulated thinner (lignin AA) shows better thinning performance at high temperature (190 °C) with the optimum dosage of 0. 3 % of total mud volume for water based mud system compared to lignosulfonate. Furthermore, the lignin AA also shows better performance as a fluid loss reducer agent against a commercial fluid loss reducer agent, Ressinex II towards salt contamination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Soda lignin was {{extracted}} from black liquor of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) fibers by 20 % (v/v) sulfuric acid. The yield of lignin, which is 3. 016 grams from every 200 mL of black liquor, was then purified by n-pentane using soxhlet apparatus for six hours. A comparison study between purified lignin and standard lignin was then performed through physico-chemical properties {{and structural features}} using a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet spectrometry (UV), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and ash contain test. The FTIR and HPLC results showed {{that there was no}} significant difference between the purified sample and the standard lignin. However, the UV result revealed that purified lignin gave slightly higher absorbance value than the standard lignin. The purified and unpurified samples of lignin comprised 0. 345 % and 5. 75 % ash respectively. From the GPC results, the poly-dispersity (Mw/Mn) values for the purified lignin and the standard lignin were 1. 23 and 1. 25, respectively. The lignin was then reacted with ferrous ion to form ferrum-tannin-lignin (FTL) complex at 105 °C in the presence of formaldehyde to initiate cross-linking reaction. The rheological properties of the pure FTL (FTLpurified) was compared with the unpure FTL (FTLunpurified) and a commercial thinner, lignosulfonate (LS). Generally, the FTLpurified gave comparable results with the FTLunpurified, which suggests that purification process is not required to increase the performance of chelated ferrous ion drilling <b>mud</b> <b>thinner...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{thickness}} {{and lateral}} distribution {{of sand and}} mud beds and bedsets on channel bars from the tidally influenced Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada, are quantitatively assessed. Fifty-six vibracores totalling ca 114 m of vertical section are used to tabulate bed thicknesses. Statistical calculations are undertaken for nine channel bars ranging from the freshwater and tidal zone, to the sustained brackish water and tidal zone. The data reveal that thickness trends can be organized into three groups that broadly correspond to time-averaged hydrodynamic and salinity conditions in the various distributary channels. Thick sand beds (up to 30 cm) and <b>thin</b> <b>mud</b> beds (up to 5 cm) characterize the freshwater tidal zone. The tidal and freshwater to brackish-water transition zone comprises thin sands (up to 10 cm) and thicker muds (up to 19 cm), and the sustained brackish water tidal zone consists of <b>thin</b> <b>muds</b> (up to 6 cm) with relatively thicker sands (up to 25 cm).

Abstract The interactions of microbial methane generation in fine-grained clay-rich sediments, methane migration, and gas hydrate accumulation in coarse-grained, sand-rich sediments are not yet fully understood. The Terrebonne Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico provides an ideal setting to investigate the migration of methane resulting {{in the formation of}} hydrate in thin sand units interbedded with fractured muds. Using 3 D seismic and well log data, we have identified several previously unidentified hydrate bearing {{units in the}} Terrebonne Basin. Two units are > 100 m-thick fine-grained clay-rich units where gas hydrate occurs in near-vertical fractures. In some locations, these fine-grained units lack fracture features, and they contain 1 – 4 -m thick hydrate bearing-sands. In addition, several other thin sand units were identified that contain gas hydrate, including one sand that was intersected by a well at the location of a discontinuous bottom-simulating reflector. Using correlation of well log data to seismic data, we have mapped and described these new units in detail across the extent of the available data, allowing us to determine the variation of seismic amplitudes and investigate the distribution of free gas and/or hydrate. We present several potential source-reservoir scenarios between the thick fractured <b>mud</b> units and <b>thin</b> hydrate bearing sands. We observe that hydrate preferentially forms within thin sand layers rather than fractures when sands are present in larger marine mud units. Based on regional mapping showing the patchy lateral extent of the thin sand layers, we propose that diffusive methane migration or short-migration of microbially generated methane from the marine mud units {{led to the formation of}} hydrate in these thin sands, as discontinuous sands would not be conducive to long-range migration of methane from deeper reservoirs...|$|R

A core from Larsen C comprises a lower unit of deformation till, overlain by thick mud interpreted as water lain from suspension under the ice shelf. Iceberg-rafted debris occurs only in the top 50 cm, suggesting that prior to that layer's deposition, the ice shelf had not receded past the site since the last deglaciation.

A core from Larsen B also consists of a lower unit, interpreted as sub-glacial lodgement till. The overlying <b>mud</b> is <b>thinner,</b> more poorly sorted, with evidence of powerful winnowing of sediments suggesting strong currents. The absence of iceberg-rafted debris implies that this site was covered by an ice shelf continuously from the last deglaciation until its collapse in 2002.

Regional-scale geophysical {{data indicate that}} most scours occur in zones of rapid flow expansion, such as canyon and/or channel termini and margins. High-resolution images of the scours cover ? 25 km² at 2 × 2 m pixel size, and were obtained at depths of 4200 – 4900 m using Autosub 6000, an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with an EM 2000 multibeam bathymetry system. Sedimentological and microfossil-based chronological data of scour fills and interscour areas were obtained via accurately located piston cores that targeted specific sites within imaged areas. These core data reveal {{a number of key}} findings. (1) Deep-water scours can be very long lived (> 0. 2 m. y.) and may undergo discrete phases of isolation, amalgamation, and infilling. (2) Deep-water scours can develop via a composite of cutting and filling events with periodicities of between tens of thousands {{and hundreds of thousands of}} years. (3) Immediately adjacent scours may have strikingly different sedimentological histories and do not necessarily evolve contemporaneously. (4) Scour infills are typically out of phase with sedimentation in intrascour areas, having thin sands internally and thick sands externally, or thick <b>muds</b> internally and <b>thin</b> <b>muds</b> externally. (5) Erosional hiatuses within scour fills may represent hundreds of thousands of years of time, and yet leave little visible record.

30|$|Kaolinite, {{which is}} a major concern for the {{production}} geologists, is the main clay mineral of the Eocene turbidites in the Cangoá Field. Kaolinite occurs predominantly as the replacement of primary mineral constituents and intergranular pore-filling materials.

The aggregates, when observed in further higher resolution (e.g., in scanning electron microscopy), have vermicular appearance. Intense kaolinization has created intragranular and intrafracture microporosity. The aggregates which filled the intergranular pores or replaced the mudstone intraclasts and <b>mud</b> pseudomatrix are <b>thinner,</b> and have little microporosity.

Two types of footprints, small-sized theropod and crocodylomorph are imprinted with mud cracks and ripple marks on the <b>thin</b> <b>mud</b> layer. Most of footprints are referred to cf. Asianopodus, and are imprinted by small-sized theropoda, probably ornithomimosauria. Theropod tracks are mainly separated into two groups, Group A and Group B. From ichnological viewpoints, the small-sized theropod track assemblage indicates the herd behaviour and its idiosyncratic group composition. In particular, the histogram of size-frequency measurements of Group A shows the anomalous bimodal distribution. We consider that there are two hypotheses; the first one is due to the male-female difference, and the second is a result of the different growing stage...|$|R
