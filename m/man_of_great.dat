5|$|David Jenkins, who was {{a student}} and {{assistant}} to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic {{to be a good}} conductor and too impatient for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described him as a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> musical ability.|$|E

5|$|The {{two sides}} {{eventually}} {{tired of the}} war and both agreed to meet to establish a truce. After doing so, they exchanged hostages. Vanaland is described as having sent to Asaland its best men: Njörðr—described as wealthy—and his son Freyr in exchange for Asaland's Hœnir—described here as large, handsome, and thought of by the people of Vanaland well suited to be a chieftain. Additionally, Asaland sends Mímir—a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> understanding—in exchange for Kvasir, who Snorri describes as the wisest man of Vanaland.|$|E
60|$|It is wisely {{provided}} in the constitution of our heart, that we should interest ourselves in the fate <b>of</b> <b>great</b> personages. They are therefore made everywhere the objects of tragedy, which addresses itself directly to our passions and our feelings. And why? Because <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> place, <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> rank, <b>men</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> hereditary authority, cannot fall without a horrible crash upon all about them. Such towers cannot tumble without ruining their dependent cottages.|$|R

5|$|During this time, Zhou Tong {{also has}} an {{additional}} disciple named Wu Song. Wu Song becomes famous for killing a man-eating tiger {{with his bare hands}} and is appointed as a constable in his native Shandong. The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu on a mission to Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, he makes the acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu to be a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, these two men only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E

25|$|Wilson was a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> charm. Contemporaries {{described}} him as a “delightful whirlwind” and wrote that “there was something spectacular and theatrical about him”. Politicians enjoyed his levity, e.g referring to Haig as “Sir Haig” – Kiggell {{said he was the}} only general who could talk to the “Frocks” on level terms – as did the French, who called him “General Dooble-Vay”. Some senior British officers genuinely believed that his sympathy for the French amounted almost to treason.|$|E

Eakins was a deep student of life, and with a great love he studied humanity frankly. He was not afraid of what his study revealed to him.|$|E

25|$|Downing was {{undoubtedly}} a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> political, diplomatic, and financial ability, but his character {{has often been}} maligned by his enemies because of his willingness {{to make the most}} of changing political circumstances, and to brutally betray former comrades in order to win favour from his current masters. Today his reputation is undergoing a revision among scholars of the period as his contributions as a financial reformer and diplomat are again recognised. On the other hand, one of his many less attractive personal qualities – miserliness – is well-documented.|$|E

The monastery also supplied two monks in the seventeenth century to the patriarchal throne, Pope Matthew III of Alexandria and Pope Matthew IV of Alexandria.

25|$|De Cosmos {{lost the}} 1882 federal {{election}} and retired to Victoria. Although {{widely regarded as}} a stirring orator, effective debater, and a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> intellectual depth, De Cosmos had always been considered eccentric. Contemporaries paint a portrait of an isolated person (he never married and had few intimate friends. Some claimed he had a daughter from a friend he met) with grandiose manners, prone to public outbursts of tears, and a fierce temper that sometimes degenerated into fist-fights. He had unusual phobias — including a fear of electricity. As he grew older, his eccentricities intensified, he became increasingly incoherent.|$|E
25|$|A <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> {{energy and}} drive, Newsam's {{tendency}} to be impatient with those who disagreed with him meant {{that he was not}} automatically popular with the Home Secretaries under whom he worked.

His eventual successor Philip Allen regarded him as operating in the tradition of preserving the liberty of the subject wherever possible; those who had worked under him also noted his highly prized commitment to keeping the politicians in charge of the department out of trouble at all costs.|$|E

Rarabe was a great warrior and a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> ability who was much loved by his father. Gcaleka was a meek and listless man who did not possess all the qualities befitting of a future king. Matters were also complicated by Gcaleka's initiation as a diviner, which was a forbidden practice {{for members of the}} royal family.|$|E
