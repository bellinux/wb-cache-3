5|$|Planet Moon Studios' {{blending}} of two genres in Giants {{has earned the}} acclaim of reviewers. Game Revolution and GameSpot found the simplified real-time strategy task of resource gathering in Giants <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> tedious, and Troy Dunniway, Microsoft's Head of Game Design in 2002, commented that the real-time strategy elements enhanced the game's shooter aspect rather than making it a hybrid of two genres. Sci Fi Weekly was impressed that both styles of play never interfered with each other, which was complemented by the unique gameplay of each race. The Entertainment Depot, however, found the base building in several missions tedious; they said the player had to rebuild the base several times due to being forced to leave the base defenseless, which allowed the enemy destroy the structures.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E
25|$|Under {{cloudless}} conditions, <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> {{the sunset}} {{itself is the}} view of the progression of the mountain's shadow across the California Central Valley to the distant Sierra Nevada, finally appearing for a few moments above the horizon as a shadow in the post-sunset sky glow.|$|E

25|$|Around 1500, Europeans learnt how to cast iron, {{and shifted}} their cannon {{productions}} to one-piece iron muzzle-loaders. China started to adopt European breech-loading swivel guns from 1500 onward, limiting {{at the same}} time the production of their own muzzle-loaders, because of the high effectiveness of the breech-loading swivel gun as an anti-personnel gun, which to them was <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the sheer power of a cannonball.|$|E

25|$|The String Sextet, {{entitled}} Souvenir de Florence, {{is considered}} {{by some to be}} <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the Piano Trio, better music intrinsically and better written. None of Tchaikovsky's other chamber works has a more positive opening, and the simplicity of the main section of the second movement is even more striking. After this very affecting music, the third movement progresses at least initially into a fresh, folksy world. Even more folksy is the opening of the finale, though Tchaikovsky takes this movement in a more academic direction with the incorporation of a fugue. This work has also been played in arrangements for string orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave Extinction half a star {{out of a}} {{possible}} four, saying that the film was [...] "no <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> watching someone else play with his Playstation".|$|E
500|$|Bhardwaj is {{influenced}} by the film-making styles of Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Akira Kurosawa and Krzysztof Kieślowski. Kieslowski's Dekalog (1989) inspired him to become a film-maker. Veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah says: [...] "I think he makes interesting films, even though I haven’t liked all his works. But even his poor work is <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> a lot of people’s so-called good work.” ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for Den of Geek, James Hunt {{said that}} the risk of {{disintegration}} on the holodeck was [...] "insane" [...] and was rectified in later episodes. He thought that the episode stood out from the others in the first season due to the prototype holodeck story. [...] "The holodeck will break again and again over the years, but rarely in a way any <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> this. Not that The Big Goodbye was particularly interesting, but it has the rare fortune of being first," [...] Hunt wrote.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Gerrick Kennedy said {{he liked}} the Robin character's charm and {{chemistry}} with Katherine, and said their story arc [...] "has already grown infinitely <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the Angie Bolen mystery". He said the relationship made more sense for Katherine than her previous subplots involving her romance with Mike and her mental breakdown following their break-up. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad said she was glad the episode was centered on the supporting cast, particularly praising the attention to Bob and Lee, but she said that {{did not like the}} direction the Andrew character had taken, and felt the relationship between Katherine and Robin had evolved too fast.|$|E
500|$|While the {{presentation}} was received positively, the gameplay received criticism from multiple reviews. [...] More specifically, the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were cited as weak. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker argued the cinematic portions were underpinned by the gameplay, believing that players would more likely {{want to finish}} the game for its storyline than the fun they'll have playing it. Game Revolution's AA White stated [...] "Clock Tower 3 is ultimately one of those games whose cinemas are <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the actual gameplay and from a gamer's standpoint, that's never a good thing." [...] Critics also agreed that the game felt too short.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of {{the game}} was aimed at its level of difficulty, which is {{higher than that of}} its predecessor; 1UP.com {{mentioned}} that this was most noticeable near the end {{of the game}}, where [...] "there are levels that consist of nothing but wave after wave of difficult enemies thrown at you to deplete your ammo, and then more waves of enemies after that." [...] GameSpy, however, praised this aspect of the game, saying that it made Going Commando <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the original. Some reviewers also felt that the game's space combat was poorly done in comparison to the rest of the game, and that the [...] "Giant Clank" [...] levels were [...] "brainless and boring".|$|E
500|$|Eno enlisted sixteen guest {{musicians to}} play on the album with him, {{including}} John Wetton and Robert Fripp of King Crimson, Simon King from Hawkwind, Bill MacCormick of Matching Mole, Paul Rudolph of Pink Fairies, Chris Spedding and all the members of Roxy Music except vocalist Bryan Ferry. Eno selected them on the basis that he thought they were incompatible with each other musically. He stated that he [...] "got them together merely because I wanted to see what happens when you combine different identities like that and allow them to compete... is organized with the knowledge that there might be accidents, accidents which will be <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> what I had intended".|$|E
500|$|The {{route for}} the 2015 race was {{announced}} on 15 April. The route was [...] shorter than in 2014; it was therefore [...] in length. The changes {{came in the}} final section of the route, with the Côte de la Vecquée removed and the Col du Rosier and the Col du Maquisard added instead. The second change was a reduction in distance between the third-last and second-last climbs: the distance was cut from [...] to , with a small unclassified climb also added. Cyclingnews.com described the first change as a [...] "much harder combination" [...] suggested that the new route would make the race <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the 2014 edition, which it described as [...] "painfully dull".|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{commented that}} Elsa was <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> Anna, Frozens primary protagonist. ABS-CBN writer Fred Hawson {{described}} Elsa as [...] "an incredible character {{with a unique}} and interesting predicament because of the powers she possessed" [...] and expressed the opinion that Frozen should {{have focused more on}} her rather than Anna. Samra Muslim of The Express Tribune wrote that it was her presence that kept viewers [...] "hooked" [...] throughout the movie, elaborating, [...] "Her character is complex and sympathetic and deserved to be explored even further. Instead the story revolves more around the relationship of the two sisters and Anna who is the typical, feisty, charming Disney heroine and her love trysts—instead of the alluring Elsa." ...|$|E
500|$|Arnold {{asserts that}} the music of L'incoronazione has greater variety than any other opera by Monteverdi, and that the purely solo music is {{intrinsically}} <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> that of Il ritorno. The musical peaks, according to commentators, include the final duet (despite its doubtful authorship), Ottavia's act 1 lament, Seneca's farewell and the ensuing madrigal, and the drunken Nerone–Lucano singing competition, often performed with strong homoerotic overtones. Ringer describes this scene as arguably the most brilliant in the whole opera, with [...] "florid, synchronous coloratura by both men creating thrilling, virtuosic music that seems to compel the listener to share in their joy." [...] Rosand finds Nerone's solo aria that closes the scene something of an anticlimax, after such stimulation.|$|E
500|$|The film is {{important}} as the first known character role by Lon Chaney. [...] Martin F. Norden, author of The Cinema of Isolation: A History of Physical Disability in the Movies, describes the plot as following the prevailing industry standards of disabled characters, where the figure [...] "nobly" [...] withdraws from the relationship after plotting revenge and then saving his beloved. Norden cites a quote from Chaney, saying this film made Chaney realize that [...] "the screen was <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> the stage". The film is now considered lost. It is unknown when the film was lost, {{but if it was}} in Universal's vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal's silent era films in 1948.|$|E
