25|$|The {{low-rise}} skirt in denim is {{the first}} of its kind seen on the Paris runways. What is now clear to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no self-respecting Banjee Latina, or ghetto-fabulous “Shamecka-girl” or high rolling white chick will be ever able to resist its urban appeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{death knell}} of your ethics has been enabled by your parent {{organizations}} {{who have chosen}} to align themselves with political agendas. What is clear to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you are perpetuating the corrosive partisan politics that is destroying our country and killing our servicemen who are at war.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Dr. Rogers {{said in his}} testimony: [...] "The {{theory that}} seems less {{reasonable}} to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Jackson woke up, and although he was {{under the influence of}} sedative medications, managed to give himself another dose." ...|$|E

If we were ever going to come {{together}} on any kind of record, this is definitely the right one, and really the coolest thing to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> after all of the drama and everybody making it like we had a rivalry, she was just really cool {{and we had a}} really good time in the studio. We had fun. And so, if nothing else, it was a good experience... and diva-ism, whatever." ...|$|E
500|$|Henderson {{served as}} an {{assistant}} to his former coach Carmody during Carmody's first eleven seasons as the coach at Northwestern University. Carmody used Henderson, who commonly scrimmaged with the players, as part of a joke for a Sports Illustrated: [...] "I don't mind that Mitch is cagier and smarter than all those guys on the court. The thing that bothers <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he's faster than all of them." [...] During Henderson's final three seasons at Northwestern, the team qualified for the National Invitation Tournament.|$|E
500|$|Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani {{said that}} Black Lives Matter is [...] "inherently racist" [...] {{and called the}} {{movement}} anti-American. According to Giuliani, the BLM movement divides people and exacerbates racial tensions. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza replied, [...] "What those comments show <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the former mayor doesn't understand racism," [...] adding that his comments were [...] "not rooted in fact." [...] Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart wrote that Giuliani's comments reinforced his sense that the former mayor lives in a [...] "racial world of make-believe".|$|E
5000|$|He denied, however, any subversive goal:"The {{purpose as}} {{designed}} by <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> through going abroad, {{they were to}} inform foreign countries {{of the situation in}} Romania." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That I can. But {{the worst}} larry for <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{pheasant}} business at Yalbury Wood. Your wife swore false that time, Joe--O, by Gad, she did--there's no denying it." ...|$|R
500|$|The 1970 {{demo version}} of [...] "Run of the Mill" [...] appears briefly in Martin Scorsese's [...] {{documentary}} (2011), playing over {{a scene where}} Harrison takes to the stage {{for one of his}} 1974 Dark Horse Tour concerts, before cutting to him and his wife on an empty beach at sunset. Although available since the 1990s on bootleg collections such as Beware of ABKCO!, this solo demo was only issued officially in the UK in November 2011, with the [...] DVD release of the film. Six months later, it received worldwide release on the [...] compilation. Noting Harrison's usual practice of perfecting his guitar parts, compilation producer Giles Martin commented: [...] "While that's a very valid practice, I think it can sometimes inhibit the spirit of the recording... he appeal of this version to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's very rough and edgy." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2008, Lavigne {{launched}} the clothing line Abbey Dawn, featuring a back-to-school collection. It {{is produced by}} Kohl's, which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself. Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a [...] "juniors lifestyle brand", which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and [...] "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed {{out that she was}} not merely licensing her name to the collection. [...] "I actually am the designer. What's really important to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all." [...] The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, [...] "after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career".|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, Clark Gregg {{explained}} how the series would tie into the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: [...] "...the exciting part {{is going to}} be seeing the way that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in , and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show." [...] Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from The Avengers, saying [...] "It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think." [...] He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, explaining [...] "It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent ... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And that, to <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [...] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{one message}} she always gave <b>me</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> you <b>were</b> {{not to think}} of coming home; and, indeed, those dear boys <b>were</b> so good, <b>that</b> we managed very well without you." ...|$|R
60|$|The most {{surprising}} {{part of the}} whole thing to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I did not feel in the least alarmed. If anything, I was rather pleased to see him. It was company.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, sir. The {{expression}} escaped me inadvertently. What I intended to say, since you press <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the action which you propose {{does seem to}} me somewhat injudicious." ...|$|R
500|$|Zeta-Jones' career graph and {{marriage}} to Douglas {{has been a}} subject of satire. A 2006 episode of the satirical British television show Star Stories (2006–2008) was entitled Catherine Zeta-Jones— Her Quest to Prove Herself... And Also Find Love, about a fictitious life story of Zeta-Jones. Addressing her perceived media image, Zeta-Jones remarked in a 2004 interview to USA Weekend: [...] "The biggest misconception of <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I'm some die-hard, ambitious, do-anything-to-get-anything kind of person, I'm not. I'm very shy socially." [...] Zeta-Jones is protective of her public image, {{and the use of}} her likeness is carefully controlled. As well as taking legal action against Hello! magazine, she sued a Nevada-based topless club for including her image on their advertising. In 2003, the celebrity biographer Cliff Goodwin wrote an unauthorised biography of the actress, entitled Catherine Zeta Jones: The Biography, but the publication was indefinitely postponed when she issued a legal notice prohibiting its release.|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} for <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says {{at the end and}} yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|In early 2010, it was {{announced}} that three new characters; Doug Harris (Mahesh Jadu), Michael Williams (Sandy Winton) and Natasha Williams were to join Neighbours in the following months. Novakovic, a performing arts college graduate, was cast in the role of Natasha. The actress had been studying architecture at university, before she chose to move into acting. Shortly after her casting {{was announced}}, Novakovic revealed that the role of Natasha was her first acting job and that while she would always be interested in architecture, she really wanted to enjoy the experience on Neighbours. Novakovic moved from Sydney to Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed, for the role. She is three years older than the character she portrays. In 2011, Novakovic revealed she is still happy with the career choice she made, stating [...] "I enjoy what I'm doing now a lot more than studying, because this is where I want to be. [...] The best thing for <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I enjoy going to work every day and have some great friends there, including the crew. It's awesome to do something you love every single day." ...|$|E
60|$|What amazed <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he did {{not seem}} to be shocked by the revelation near as much as I had feared. So this matter had brought me {{happiness}} where I looked for nothing but sorrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's her own affair. The reason I {{asked you}} to see <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it {{appeared}} to me I ought to tell you frankly that--decidedly!--I can't undertake to produce that effect. In fact I don't want to!" ...|$|R
60|$|What annoyed <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they quarrelled in English. They all had {{languages}} of their own,--there were four Belgians, two Frenchmen, and a German,--but no language {{was good enough}} for them to insult each other in but English.|$|R
500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E
500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I didn't {{know if they were}} good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 July 2011, {{according}} to a leaked telephone surveillance transcript, Berlusconi told his presumed blackmailer Valter Lavitola: [...] "The only thing they can say about <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I screw around [...] Now they're spying on me, controlling my phone calls. I don't give a fuck. In a few months [...] I'll be leaving this shit country that makes me sick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> glad <b>that</b> <b>was</b> it," [...] I said, [...] "for I {{could not}} believe you guilty of such bad form. The version which reached <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> you swore at each other, and <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> to be {{dismissed}} and you reprimanded." ...|$|R
60|$|SIGSBY The arrangement, as he {{explained}} it to <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the whole thing was}} to end with the polling. It was to have been a mere joke, a mere ballon d'essai. The mistake he made was thinking he could depend on her.|$|R
60|$|There {{is always}} {{sufficient}} reserve {{of the ninth}} ray stored in the great building to maintain the present Martian atmosphere for a thousand years, and the only fear, as my new friend told <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> some accident might befall the pumping apparatus.|$|R
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{criticism}} of his passion about {{the coming of the}} Messiah and, his urging people to do all they could to bring about the redemption by adding in the observance of Torah and Mitzvahs, was something that was known to him. On one occasion he even remarked [...] "I have merited that the complaint people have against <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I am passionate about the Mashiach." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allah's Apostle said, [...] "My similitude in {{comparison}} with the other prophets before <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{of a man who has}} built a house nicely and beautifully, except for a place of one brick in a corner. The people go about it and wonder at its beauty, but say: 'Would that this brick be put in its place!' So I am that brick, and I am the Seal of the Prophets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Considering {{the title}} of the album, Steve Von Till conceded that the band members cannot agree on its precise meaning, but [...] "one thing that really resonates with <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> decay is the natural state of all things over time...When shit's falling apart, that is when you see the people who have honor and will stand by what they said, or those that are self-serving or dishonorable and stab people in the back".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, your reverence; they're on the Ullathorne property. But a {{word from}} your reverence would do it. Mr. Henry thinks more of the foxes than anything. The last word he told <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it would break his heart if he saw the coppices drawn blank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor I," [...] {{replied the}} girl. [...] "Those who stole me from Ptarth spoke among {{themselves}} of Aaanthor, so that I thought {{it possible that}} the ancient city to which they took <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> famous ruin; but where we may be now I have no idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{never be}} able to pull out, I haven't got the strength," [...] she told Hodder, between sobs.
