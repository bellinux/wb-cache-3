40|$|A {{research}} paper on how pesticides infiltrate the biological systems of living organisms. The <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> {{like that of}} many other chemicals, takes place mainly in the liver, skin, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys and lungs. These organs {{have the capacity to}} bring about enzymatic reactions of metabolism. In this chapter, <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> is exemplified by the metabolic pathways of the organochlorine, DDT, and the organophosphate, parathion. Metabolism means more than just one thing. On one hand, the chemical and enzymatic reactions and processes that maintain the existence of any organism may be referred to as metabolism. On the other hand, metabolism may mean the conversion or transformation of chemical substances foreign and endogenous to an organism by chemical or enzymatic reactions in the organism. “Foreign compounds" refers to non-nutrient substances to a specific organism. Pesticides may enter the body by way of ingestion in food or drink, inhalation, through the eyes or by absorption through the skin (Neal, 1975). The <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> that is, the total fate of pesticides in the body, including their absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion like that of other foreign substances is handled in the body by certain organs. Although the liver is perhaps the major organ involved in metabolism of chemicals, the kidney, skin, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the lungs are all involved in metabolism too (Briggs and Briggs, 1974). A more detailed account of the mechanisms of metabolism is presented by Williams (1959) and La du et al. (1971) ...|$|E
40|$|Like many chemicals, {{carcinogenicity}} {{of pesticides}} is poorly characterised in humans, especially in children, {{so that the}} present knowledge about childhood leukaemia risk derives primarily from epidemiological studies. Overall, case–control studies published {{in the last decade}} have reported positive associations with home use of insecticides, mostly before the child’s birth, while findings for herbicides are mixed. Previous studies relied solely on self-reports, therefore lacking information on active ingredients and effects of potential recall bias. Few series to date have examined the influence of children’s genetic susceptibility related to transport and <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> To overcome these limitations, investigators of the Northern California Childhood Leukaemia Study (NCCLS) have undertaken, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, a comprehensive assessment of residential pesticide exposure, including: (1) quality control of self-reports; (2) home pesticide inventory and linkage to the Environmental Protection Agency to obtain data on active ingredients; (3) collection and laboratory analyses of 600 home dust samples for over 60 pesticides and (4) geographic information studies using California environmental databases to assess exposure to agricultural pesticides. The NCCLS is also conducting large-scale genotyping to evaluate the role of genes in xenobiotic pathways relevant to the transport and <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> A better quantification of children’s exposures to pesticides at home is critical to the evaluation of childhood leukaemia risk, especially for future gene– environment interaction studies...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{cultures}} of white rot fungi not favoring the production of lignin and manganese peroxidases are effective in degrading certain xenobiotics. In this study we have used endosulfan as a model xenobiotic to assess the enzymatic mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> <b>metabolism</b> under ligninolytic (nutrient-deficient) and nonligninolytic (nutrient-rich) culture conditions. Rapid <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> this chlorinated <b>pesticide</b> occurred under each nutrient condition tested. However, the extent of degradation {{and the nature of the}} metabolic products differed for nutrient-deficient and nutrient-rich media. The pathways for endosulfan metabolism were characterized by analysis of the fungal metabolites produced. The major endosulfan metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-electron capture detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as endosulfan sulfate, endosulfan diol, endosulfan hydroxyether, and a unknown metabolite tentatively identified as endosulfan dialdehyde. The nature of the metabolites formed indicates that this organism utilizes both oxidative and hydrolytic pathways for <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> this <b>pesticide.</b> Piperonyl butoxide, a known cytochrome P- 450 inhibitor, significantly inhibited the oxidation of endosulfan to endosulfan sulfate and enhanced hydrolysis of endosulfan to endosulfan diol. We suggest that the <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> endosulfan is mediated by two divergent pathways, one hydrolytic and the other oxidative. Judging by the inactivity of extracellular fluid and partially purified lignin peroxidase in metabolizing endosulfan, we conclude that <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> this compound does not involve the action of extracellular peroxidases...|$|R
40|$|Biobed {{substrates}} commonly exhibit high degradation capacity. However, degradation {{does not}} always lead to detoxification and information on the metabolic pathways <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in biobeds is scarce. We studied the degradation and <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> three <b>pesticides</b> in selected biomixtures and soil. Biomixtures stimulated degradation of terbuthylazine and metribuzin, whereas chlorpyrifos degraded faster in soil. The latter was attributed to the lipophilicity of chlorpyrifos which increased adsorption and limited biodegradation in organic-rich biomixtures. Although the same metabolites were detected in all substrates, qualitative and quantitative differences in the metabolic routes <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in the various substrates were observed. Chlorpyrifos was hydrolyzed to 3, 5, 6 -tricholorpyridinol (TCP) which was further degraded only in compost-biomixture CBX 1. <b>Metabolism</b> <b>of</b> terbuthylazine in compost biomixtures (BX) and soil resulted {{in the formation of}} desethyl-terbuthylazine (DES) which was fully degraded only in the compost-biomixture CBX 2, whereas peat-based biomixture (OBX) promoted the hydroxylation of terbuthylazine. Desamino- (DA) (dominant) and diketo- (DK) metribuzin appear as intermediate metabolites in all substrates and were further transformed to desamino-diketo-metribuzin (DADK) which was fully degraded only in compost-biomixture GSBX. Overall, lower amounts of metabolites were accumulated in biomixtures compared to soil stressing the higher depuration efficiency of biobeds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Clenbuterol {{was added to the}} birds' diet at concentrations of 1 or 25 ppm for 21 days. There was a dose-related decrease in the concentration of cytochrome P- 450, and in the activities of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible monooxygenases ethoxyresorufin O-de-ethylase and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase.

40|$|Farm {{workers are}} often exposed to pesticides, which are {{products}} {{belonging to a}} specific chemical group that affects the health of agricultural workers and is mostly recognized as genotoxic and carcinogenic. The exposure of workers from Piauí, Brazil, to these hazardous chemicals was assessed and cytogenetic alterations were evaluated using the buccal micronucleus assay, hematological and lipid parameters, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity and genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in the <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> such as PON 1, {{as well as of}} the DNA repair system (OGG 1, XRCC 1 and XRCC 4). Two groups of farm workers exposed to different types of pesticides were evaluated and compared to matched non-exposed control groups. A significant increase was observed in the frequencies of micronuclei, kariorrhexis, karyolysis and binucleated cells in the exposed groups (n = 100) compared to controls (n = 100). No differences were detected regarding the hematological parameters, lipid profile and BChE activity. No significant difference was observed either regarding DNA damage or nuclear fragmentation when specific metabolizing and DNA repair genotypes were investigated in the exposed groups...|$|E
40|$|Pesticides are high-volume, widely used, {{environmental}} {{chemicals and}} there is continuous debate concerning their possible role in many chronic human health effects. Because of their known structures, known rates of application, {{and the presence of}} a large occupationally exposed population, they are not only important in their own right but are ideal models for the effects of environmental chemicals on the population in general. For reasons that are not always clear, this potential has not been realized. These exposed populations represent an underused asset {{in the study of the}} human health effects of environmental contaminants. Chronic effects thought to involve pesticides include carcinogenesis, neurotoxicity, and reproductive and development effects. In this paper we attempt to summarize this concern and, relying to a large extent on studies in our own laboratory, to indicate the importance and present status of studies of the mammalian <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and indicate the need for further use of this model. Aspects considered include the role of pesticides as substrates for xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P 450 and the flavin-containing monooxygenase and their role as inducers or inhibitors of metabolic enzymes. The interaction of pesticides with complex multienzyme pathways, the role of biological characteristics, particularly gender, in pesticide metabolism, and the special role of pesticides at portals of entry and in target tissues are also considered...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A paraoxonase {{activity}} {{present in}} serum of two Brazilian fish species was consistently assayed at pH 8. 5 using 7. 5 mM paraoxon final concentration. The paraoxonase activity was more activated by 0. 5 M NaCI in selUm of Piarac/us mesopo/amicus Holmberg, 1887 (pacu) than in serum of Hypos/omus puncta/us Valenciennes, 1840 (cascudo). Apparent values ofKM were 3. 3 x 10 - 3 M for cascudo and pacu paraoxonase {{activity in the}} presence of 0. 5 M NaC!. Apparent maximum velocity values calculated {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 M NaCl were 6. 1 and 6. 5 nmo-le/min/mL of serum for cascudo and pacu, respectively. VmaxlKM ratio values of determinations in the presence and absence of 0. 5 M NaCI showed that NaCI had a more evident effect on increasing the affinity of serum paraoxonase for paraoxon in pacu serum. Young specimens ofpacu showed a marked decreased paraoxonase serum activity when kept in tanks treated with 0. 25 ppm methyl-parathion. KEY WORDS.

Fenitrothion {{was shown to}} be detoxified by dealkylation in white pine via a glutathione dependent S-alkyl transferase enzyme to form desmethyl fenitrothion and S-methyl glutathione. Dealkylation was also found in white spruce and yellow birch seedlings. The pesticide was activated to form fenitro-oxon, which is more toxic than the parent compound. The desmethyl form was shown to be reactivated via alkylation by fenitrothion to form S-methyl fenitrothion which is a more potent cholinesterase inhibitor than the parent compound. Treatment of the seeds at higher concentrations of 1000 ppm fenitrothion inhibited germination of yellow birch seeds but not white pine or spruce. Severe depletion of tissue glutathione levels was shown {{to be related to}} toxicity in yellow birch which absorbed much higher levels <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> than the two coniferous species.

40|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} have {{a pivotal}} role in ecosystem functioning. In 2010, EFSA identified soil microorganisms as a specific protection goal for environmental risk assessment of pesticides. Despite that, the assessment of the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides still relies on an out-of-date N transformation test overlooking the recent methodological and standardization advances in soil microbial ecology. Within the frame of two EU-funded projects (ECOFUN-MICROBIODIV& LOVE-TO-HATE) we developed a toolbox of ISO standardized and of new methods which enable the comprehensive assessment of the toxicity of pesticides on soil microorganisms following a tiered experimental approach. This involved pesticide testing against natural microbial assemblages,initially at laboratory-scale under high exposure conditions, followed by field-scale assessment under more realistic exposure scenarios. In 2017 EFSA proposed the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as one of the possible bioindicators to assess the soil microbial toxicity of pesticides. Mounting evidence suggest that ammonia-oxidizing microbes (AOM) constitute another could also serve asbioindicatorssince (a) they are sensitive to external disturbances including pesticides, (b) they mediate the rate-limiting step of N cycle and (c) there are ISOstandardized tools to measure their activity and abundance. Key experimental aspects of the scheme proposed are (a) the parallel determination of the dissipation and <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> to allow the identification of the compound (parent or metabolite) responsible for toxicity effects observed, (b) the duration of the tests should allow microbial recovery, (c) effects on microbial diversity, although powerful tools are now available their application is still far from standardized. The proposed tiered scheme could be augmented with an in vitro assessment step on representative AOMs and AMF as an initial conservative tierbefore testing against natural soil assemblages. However, certain aspects of in vitro testing require further development standardization. Acknowledgements : This work was funded in the frame of the IAPP-FP 7 -MSCA project LOVE-TO-HAT...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{data on the}} <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{in plants}} is {{required}} for registration, therefore several in vitro systems {{have been developed to}} generate and identify a broad spectrum of possible metabolites. Therefore transgenic plant cell cultures with the human isoenzymes CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2 were established for an oxidative metabolic profiling of pesticides. The cDNA of human P 450 (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2) was introduced into tobacco cells (N. tabacum L.) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. For the screening of the transgenic calli an in vivo 7 ?Ethoxycoumarin O-de-ethylation (ECOD) -assay was established, which was performed with intact plant cells. The ECOD activity was measured as the concentration of non-metabolised 7 ?ethoxycoumarin remaining in the media. The developing transgenic calli or transgenic suspension cultures were characterised regarding their ECOD-activity. Expression of the P 450 genes was further examined by PCR and western blotting. For metabolism studies in the transgenic tobacco cell cultures 14 C-labelled atrazine, metamitron and dimethoat were used as model substances. The herbicide atrazine was metabolised by oxidative N-Dealkylation. The conversion rate was considerably higher in the transformed cell cultures (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2) than in non-transformed cell culture. However, CYP 1 A 2 exhibited a higher conversion rate than CYP 1 A 1. In a time-course study the enzyme CYP 1 A 2 catalysed predominately N-deethylation whereas the enzyme CYP 1 A 1 catalysed predominately the N-deisopropylation. In experiments with a constant amount of CYP 1 A 2 plant cell culture the originally used concentration of atrazine was raised up to a 20 fold quantity. In these large-scale experiments the high activity of the transgenic clones was demonstrated. Metabolism studies with the herbicide metamitron demonstrated that the arylhydroxylation and the previous desamination both can be catalysed by the isoenzymes CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2. The conversion rate was considerably higher in the transformed cell cultures (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2) than in non-transformed cell culture. However, CYP 1 A 2 exhibited a higher conversion rate than CYP 1 A 1. In a time-course study using a CYP 1 A 2 cell culture the transformation of metamitron could be demonstrated, starting with the formation of the metabolite desaminometamitron, followed by 4 ?hydroxydesaminometamitron and ended with the glucosid of the later. In experiments with a constant amount of CYP 1 A 2 plant cell culture the originally used concentration of metamitron was raised up to a 20 fold quantity. In these large-scale experiments the relative metabolic profile had changed slightly. This was due to the slower glucosylation compared to P 450 -oxidation. Therefore a high P 450 activity of the transgenic clones was demonstrated. The third substance used was the insecticide dimethoate with three potential P 450 reaction centres present in this molecule. The three reactions are the desulfuration, N-demethylation and O-demethylation. Nevertheless, {{there was no evidence that}} dimethoat was a suitable substrate for the two P 450 isoenzymes. Only a slight increase in the conversion rate of dimethoate could be found by the CYP 1 A 2 enzyme which was attributed to the O-demethylation. Finally the metabolism of dimethoate was tested in liver microsomes of rats, which were prior induced with Aroclor 1254 to increase the P 450 enzyme activity. On the basis of the obtained results it is obvious, that dimethoate is not metabolised by P 450 -isoenzymes in rats. Plant cell cultures in which the appropriate P 450 cDNAs are introduced, appear to be suitable in vitro systems in order to produce large quantities of primary oxidised pesticide metabolites...|$|E
40|$|Background: Honey bees (Apis mellifera) have {{recently}} experienced {{higher than normal}} overwintering colony losses. Many factors have been evoked to explain the losses, among which are the presence <b>of</b> residues <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and veterinary products in hives. Multiple residues are present at the same time, though most often in low concentrations so that no single product has yet been associated with losses. Involvement {{of a combination of}} residues to losses may however not be excluded. To understand the impact of an exposure to combined residues on honey bees, we propose a mechanism-based strategy, focusing here on Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR) transporters as mediators of those interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using whole-animal bioassays, we demonstrate through inhibition by verapamil that the widely used organophosphate and pyrethroid acaricides coumaphos and t-fluvalinate, and three neonicotinoid insecticides: imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiacloprid are substrates of one or more MDR transporters. Among the candidate inhibitors of honey bee MDR transporters is the in-hive antibiotic oxytetracycline. Bees prefed oxytetracycline were significantly sensitized to the acaricides coumaphos and t-fluvalinate, suggesting that the antibiotic may interfere with the normal excretion or <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> these <b>pesticides.</b> Conclusions/Significance: Many bee hives receive regular treatments of oxytetracycline and acaricides for prevention and treatment of disease and parasites. Our results suggest that seasonal co-application of these medicines to bee hives coul...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is an {{investigation}} on the kinetics of dimethoate biodegradation and an estimation of residual dimethoate in bacterial culture by spectrophotometry. The methylene chloride extract of the culture medium was used for determination of dimethoate through its reaction with 1 chloro- 2, 4 dinitrobenzene to produce methylamine whose absorbance at 505 nm gave an estimation of dimethoate content. The dimethoate standard curve follows Beer’s law at 505 nm with a slope of 0. 0129 absorbance units per µg/mL. The regression equation relating concentration of dimethoate (x) with the absorbance is (y) : y = 0. 037 + 0. 0129 x.

40|$|The {{findings}} {{of previous studies}} indicate that the genes required for <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide</b> 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) are typically encoded on broad-host-range plasmids. However, characterization of plasmid-cured strains of Burkholderia sp. strain RASC, as well as mutants obtained by transposon mutagenesis, suggested that the 2, 4 -D catabolic genes were located on the chromosome of this strain. Mutants of Burkholderia strain RASC unable to degrade 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -D- strains) were obtained by insertional inactivation with Tn 5. One such mutant (d 1) was shown to have Tn 5 inserted in tfdARASC, which encodes 2, 4 -D/alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase. This is the first reported example of a chromosomally encoded tfdA. The tfdARASC gene was cloned from a library of wild-type Burkholderia strain RASC DNA and shown to express 2, 4 -D/alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase activity in Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence of the gene was determined and shown to be similar, although not identical, to those of isofunctional genes from other bacteria. Moreover, the gene product (TfdARASC) was purified and shown to be similar in molecular weight, amino-terminal sequence, and reaction mechanism to the canonical TfdA of Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP 134. The data presented here indicate that tfdA genes {{can be found on}} the chromosome of some bacterial species and suggest that these catabolic genes are rather mobile and may be transferred by means other than conjugation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Exposure {{biomonitoring}} <b>of</b> organophosphate (OP) <b>pesticides</b> is {{a common}} practice to protect the health of agricultural workers. However, {{few studies have examined}} the association between markers of exposure and cholinesterase inhibition, the standard marker of effect, for these compounds or how genetic variation in the metabolic pathways responsible for the activation and detoxification <b>of</b> OP <b>pesticides</b> affects these associations. We evaluated the potential for pesticide exposure and cholinesterase inhibition levels of apple orchard farmworkers and their children in relation to non-farmworker households in the same region. We tested the hypothesis that 1.) OP pesticide exposure biomarkers were predictive of the inhibition of cholinesterase enzymes and 2.) genetic variants for metabolizing genes, including paraoxonase- 1 (PON 1) and cytochrome P- 450 s (CYP 450 s) altered this association. Higher levels of azinphos methyl in blood and dimethylphosphate urinary metabolites were observed in farmworkers adults and children during periods <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application (thinning season) compared to non-farmworkers. Levels of azinphos methyl in blood were significantly associated with higher levels of dimethyl phosphate metabolites in the urine. Significant associations between concentrations of these exposure biomarkers and levels of cholinesterase inhibition were observed during the thinning season. We observed no significant modification of these observations when incorporating PON 1 phenotypic and genotypic information into our models in accordance with predictions from in vivo data. However, when considering quantification of exposure via urinary metabolites, we found significant modification of the exposure/effect relationship by genetic variants for a number of CYP 450 enzymes. These observations suggest that significant differences in the level of activation or detoxification <b>of</b> OP <b>pesticides</b> occur between individuals differing in the genotype of certain CYP 450 s responsible for this metabolism. Despite not directly handling pesticides, individuals working in pomme orchards during periods <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application and their children are exposed to OP pesticides and can experience cholinesterase inhibition. Furthermore, the risk of cholinesterase inhibition appears to be greater in individuals with certain genetic backgrounds. This information illustrates the significance of individual susceptibility and the <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> specific OP <b>pesticides</b> for cumulative risk assessments of these compounds...|$|R

However, the applicability or the "fitness " of these cells to demonstrate biological principals is still debated. It {{is well known}} that many of the cell lines bear little resemblance to the parent tissue or organ cells. Yet isolated functional cells of serially-propagated clonal strains, that can perform specialized, organ-specific functions for prolonged periods, have been produced in nearly limitless numbers (1). The loss of specific function has been ascribed to (i) selective overgrowth by connective tissue cells, (ii) a phenotypic change in the cultured cells, or (iii) inadequate or harmful environmental conditions (2). In order to circumvent these problems, primary cell lines are used and tested before the line "adapts " to culture conditions through aneuploidy or other means. The use of tissue culture cells for the examination of environmental chemicals has been relatively recent (3).

40|$|The {{development}} of bacterial biofilms in natural environments may alter important functions, such as pollutant bioremediation by modifying both the degraders' physiology and/or interactions within the matrix. The present study {{focuses on the}} influence of biofilm formation on the <b>metabolism</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pesticide,</b> 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), by Cupriavidus necator JMP 134. Pure cultures were established in a liquid medium with 2, 4 -D as a sole carbon source with or without sand grains for 10 days. Bacterial numbers and 2, 4 -D concentrations in solution were followed by spectrophotometry, the respiration rate by gas chromatography and the surface colonization by electron microscopy. In addition, isotopic techniques coupled with Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) profiling were used to determine possible metabolic changes. After only 3 days, approximately 80 % of the cells were attached to the sand grains and microscopy images showed that the porous medium was totally clogged by the {{development of}} a biofilm. After 10 days, there was 25 % less 2, 4 -D in the solution in samples with sand than in control samples. This difference was due to (1) a higher (+ 8 %) mineralization of 2, 4 -D by sessile bacteria and (2) a retention (15 %) of 2, 4 -D in the biofilm matrix. Besides, the amount of carbohydrates, presumably constituting the biofilm polysaccharides, increased by 63 %. Compound-specific isotope analysis revealed that the FAME isotopic signature was less affected by the biofilm lifestyle than was the FAME composition. These results suggest that sessile bacteria differ more in their anabolism than in their catabolism compared to their planktonic counterparts. This study stresses the importance of considering interactions between microorganisms and their habitat when studying pollutant dynamics in porous media...|$|R

30|$|The {{frequent}} {{high concentrations}} (over guideline values) <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{detected in the}} current study are probably due to the extensive utilization <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in the agricultural fields. There are three major sources for surface water contamination by pesticides: inappropriate handling <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> (e.g., washing equipment in the river), volatilization to air, and residuals from soil and water. In this perspective, the drainage of water from agricultural fields into irrigation channels poses a critical source of risk for contamination by pesticides in the broader water environment (Phong et al. 2010). Rain runoff from agricultural fields that occurred immediately after the application period <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> has been pointed to be the major source <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in water bodies (Kreuger 1998). Rainfall, and hence the associated increased runoff, would be expected to result in increased movement <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> into nearby water bodies.
