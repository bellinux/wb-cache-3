This seamount was named Surtla, but never reached sea level. Eruptions at Surtla ended on 6 January 1964, and it has since been eroded from its <b>minimum</b> <b>depth</b> of 23m (75ft) to 47m (154ft) below sea level.|$|E

25|$|The lagoon was dredged in 1894–95 to {{form part}} of the Florida East Coast Canal from Jacksonville to Biscayne Bay with a <b>minimum</b> <b>depth</b> of 5 feet (1.5 m) and a minimum width of 50 feet (15.2 m). After 1895, the lagoon and canal were {{sometimes}} called the Spanish River. Between 1930 and 1935 the canal was improved to 8×100 feet (2.4×30.5 m) {{by the federal government}} and renamed the Intracoastal Waterway. It was improved again between 1960 and 1965 to 10×125 feet (3×38.1 m). All three versions were subject to shoaling which reduced their depths below the specified minimum. Forming part of the northern city limits is the C-15 canal, connecting the El Rio Canal to the Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
25|$|Legal {{requirements}} for tank size vary greatly {{from country to}} country. In the US, the minimum enclosure size is set by the Code of Federal Regulations, 9 CFR E § 3.104, under the Specifications for the Humane Handling, Care, Treatment, and Transportation of Marine Mammals. In 9 CFR 3.104, Table III classifies killer whales as Group I cetaceans with an average length of 24feet (7.315meters). Based on length, Table I states up to two killer whales may be held in a pool with a minimum horizontal dimension (the diameter of a circular pool of water) of twice that length or 48feet (14.63meters) and a <b>minimum</b> <b>depth</b> of 12feet (3.66m), giving a minimum volume of 615m3 for two killer whales. Each additional killer whale requires a pool with an additional 308m3 of volume. 9 CFR 3.104 also requires a minimum of 63m2 surface area per killer whale in Table IV (the example with a cylindrical tank 7.315m in diameter for two whales provides 84m2 of surface area per killer whale). Swiss regulations require a larger minimum volume: 400 m2 x 4.0m deep for two killer whales, or 1,600m3. The Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA) goes further, and recommends 1,918 m3 for two killer whales. The US exhibitors of captive killer whales belong to the AMMPA, but exhibitors in other countries do not.|$|E

2500|$|In 1887, a new shorter {{alignment}} {{was completed}} between St. Catharines and Port Dalhousie. One {{of the most}} interesting features of this third Welland Canal was the Merritton Tunnel on the Grand Trunk Railway line that ran under the canal at Lock 18.

The pool into which Meneely dived was not constructed to the published standards. [...] The standards had changed after the diving board was installed on the non-compliant pool by the homeowner. [...] But the courts held that the pool [...] "was close enough" [...] to the standards to hold NSPI liable. [...] The multimillion-dollar lawsuit was eventually resolved in 2001 for US$6.6million ($8million after interest was added) {{in favor of the}} plaintiff. [...] The NSPI was held to be liable, and was financially strained by the case. It filed twice for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was successfully reorganized into a new swimming pool industry association.|$|E
2500|$|The San Joaquin {{was once}} navigable by steamboats as far {{upstream}} as Fresno, but agricultural diversions have greatly slowed and shallowed the river. In addition, this {{has caused the}} river to drop large amounts of silt that formerly washed out to sea in its bed, further reducing the depth. In the late 19th century, the city of Stockton, once an important seaport for the San Joaquin Valley, found itself increasingly landlocked because the San Joaquin River, its main connection to the sea, was rapidly silting up. The early 20th century saw proposals to maintain a <b>minimum</b> <b>depth</b> in the lower river by dredging, but these were interrupted by the onset of World War I. In 1925 the city put forth a $1.3 million bond for dredging the lower San Joaquin from its mouth to the Port of Stockton – a distance of [...] by river.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} factors {{that control the}} depth of trenches. [...] The most {{important}} control is the supply of sediment, which fills the trench {{so that there is}} no bathymetric expression. It is therefore not surprising that the deepest trenches (deeper than [...] ) are all nonaccretionary. [...] In contrast, all trenches with growing accretionary prisms are shallower than [...] A second order control on trench depth is the age of the lithosphere at the time of subduction. Because oceanic lithosphere cools and thickens as it ages, it subsides. The older the seafloor, the deeper it lies, and this determines the <b>minimum</b> <b>depth</b> from which the seafloor begins to descend. [...] This obvious correlation can be removed by looking at the relative depth, the difference between regional seafloor depth and maximum trench depth. Relative depth may be controlled by the age of the lithosphere at the trench, the convergence rate, and the dip of the subducted slab at intermediate depths. Finally, narrow slabs can sink and roll back more rapidly than broad plates, because it is easier for underlying asthenosphere to flow {{around the edges of the}} sinking plate. [...] Such slabs may have steep dips at relatively shallow depths and so may be associated with unusually deep trenches, such as the Challenger Deep.|$|E
