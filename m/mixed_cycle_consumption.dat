40|$|We {{explore the}} {{quantitative}} implications of {{uncertainty about the}} length of life and a lack of annuity markets for life <b>cycle</b> <b>consumption</b> in a general equilibrium overlapping generations model in which markets are otherwise complete. Empirical studies find that consumption tends to rise early in life, peak around age 45 - 55, and to decline after that. Our calibrated model exhibits life <b>cycle</b> <b>consumption</b> that is consistent with this pattern. This follows from the fact that, {{due to a lack of}} annuity markets, households discount the future more heavily as they age and their probability of survival falls. Once an unfunded social security system is introduced, the profile is still hump shaped, but the decline in consumption does not begin until after retirement in our base case.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{standard}} model of life <b>cycle</b> <b>consumption,</b> saving and labor supply {{in a number of}} directions. First, it argues that consumption should be defined as expenditure on household production as well as on market goods, that is, we are interested in life cycle profiles of full consumption. If this is done, several well-known puzzles concerning life <b>cycle</b> <b>consumption</b> behaviour are resolved. Secondly, we stress the importance of the heterogeneity of household behaviour in respect of female labour supply and saving, and provide evidence to show that these are very closely related across households. Finally, we formulate theoretical and empirical models incorporating these ideas and use them to show that policy changes, such as a reduction in the progressivity of income taxation, can have effects that contrast sharply with those suggested in the existing literature.

40|$|A {{new theory}} of shear {{instability}} in a turbulent environment {{is applied to}} eight days of velocity and density profiles from the upper-equatorial Pacific. This period featured a regular diurnal cycle of surface forcing, together with a clear response in upper-oceanmixing. During the day, a layer of stable stratification and shear forms at the surface. During late afternoon and evening, this stratified shear layer descends, leaving the nocturnal mixing layer above it. Using high-resolution current measurements, the detailed structure of the descending shear layer is seen for the first time. Linear stability analysis is conducted using a newmethod that accounts {{for the effects of}} preexisting turbulence on instability growth. Shear instability follows a diurnal cycle linked to the afternoon descent of the surface shear layer. This cycle is revealed only when the effect of turbulence is accounted for in the stability analysis. The cycle of instability leads the diurnal <b>mixing</b> <b>cycle,</b> typically by 2 – 3 h, consistent with the time needed for instabilities to grow and break. Late at night, the resulting turbulence suppresses further instabilities, lending an asymmetry to the <b>mixing</b> <b>cycle</b> that has not been noticed in previous measurements. Deep <b>cycle</b> <b>mixing</b> is triggered by instabilities formed as the de-scending shear layer merges with the marginally unstable shear of the Equatorial Undercurrent. In the morning, turbulence decays and the upper ocean restratifies. Wind accelerates the near-surface flow to form a new unstable shear layer, and the cycle begins again. 1...|$|R
