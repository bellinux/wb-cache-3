The three-dimensional structure of the ferrocytochrome at pH 8. 5 was solved through two-dimensional 1 H-NMR. The structures were calculated using a large amount of experimental information, which includes upper and lower distance limits as well as dihedral angle restraints. The analysis allows for fast-flipping aromatic residues and flexibility in the haem plane. The structure was determined using 2289 upper and 2390 lower distance limits, 63 restricted ranges for the f torsion angle, 88 stereospecific assignments out of the 118 stereopairs with non-degenerate chemical shifts (74. 6 %), and 115 out of the 184 nuclear Overhauser effects to fast-flipping aromatic residues (62. 5 %), which were pseudo-stereospecifically assigned to one or {{the other side of the}} ring.

Analogous to classical, planar {{barycentric coordinates}} that describe {{the positions of}} points in a plane {{with respect to the}} vertices of a given planar polygon, spherical barycentric coordinates describe the positions of points on a sphere with respect to the vertices of a given spherical polygon. In particular, we introduce spherical <b>mean</b> value <b>coordinates</b> that inherit many good properties of their planar counterparts. Furthermore, we present a construction that gives a simple and intuitive geometric interpretation for classical barycentric coordinates, like Wachspress <b>coordinates,</b> <b>mean</b> value <b>coordinates,</b> and discrete harmonic coordinates.

On the basis of 563 experimental constraints, including 516 distance constraints obtained from the nuclear Overhauser effect, 21 torsion angle (�,� 1) constraints, and 26 constraints associated with hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds, a total of 14 converged structures were obtained.

Twenty conformers representing the solution structure of des(1 - 6) Antp(C 39 S) have an average root-mean-square distance relative to the <b>mean</b> <b>coordinates</b> of 0. 56 A for the backbone atoms of residues 8 - 59.

40|$|Dedicated to Rudolf Haag on the {{occasion}} of his 80 th birthday. We discuss a formulation of quantum field theory on quantum space time where the perturbation expansion of the S-matrix is term by term ultraviolet finite. The characteristic feature of our approach is a quantum version of the Wick product at coinciding points: the differences of coordinates qj − qk are not set equal to zero, which would violate the commutation relation between their components. We show that the optimal degree of approximate coincidence can be defined by the evaluation of a conditional expectation which replaces each function of qj − qk by its expectation value in opti-(q 1 + · · ·+qn) mally localized states, while leaving the <b>mean</b> <b>coordinates</b> 1 n invariant. The resulting procedure is to a large extent unique, and is invariant under translations and rotations, but violates Lorentz invariance. Indeed, optimal localization refers to a specific Lorentz frame, where the electric and magnetic parts of the commutator of the coordinates have to coincide [11]. Employing an adiabatic switching, we show that the S-matrix is term by term finite. The matrix elements of the transfer matrix are determined, at each order in the perturbative expansion, by kernels with Gaussian decay in the Planck scale. The adiabatic limit and the large scale limit of this theory will be studied elsewhere. ...|$|E

The refined three-dimen-sional structure of CINC/Gro was derived with the aid of heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a hybrid method of distance geometry and simulated annealing. The backbone atomic r. m. s. differences for 19 structures about the <b>mean</b> <b>coordinates</b> for residues 7 to 70 are 0. 69 ± 0. 15 A for the dimer and 0. 56 ± 0. 13 A for the monomer.

The dimer structure consists of a six-stranded anti-parallel (3 sheet with two C-terminal a helices on the /? sheet. The overall dimer structure of CINC/Gro is similar to that of human MGSA, though the backbone r. m. s. d. s between CINC/Gro and the two MGSA structures were high (1. 81 and 2. 34 A for the monomer) in spite of the high sequence homology (67 %). The major difference resides in the relative position of the C-terminal a helix with respect to the 0 sheet.

40|$|The {{zinc finger}} HIT domain is a {{sequence}} motif {{found in many}} proteins, including thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 3 (TRIP- 3), which is possibly involved in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Novel zinc finger motifs are suggested to play important roles in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. Here, we determined the high-resolution solution structure of the zinc finger HIT domain in ZNHIT 2 (protein FON) from Homo sapiens, by an NMR method based on 567 upper distance limits derived from NOE intensities measured in three-dimensional NOESY spectra. The structure yielded a backbone RMSD to the <b>mean</b> <b>coordinates</b> of 0. 19 Å for the structured residues 12 – 48. The fold consists of two consecutive antiparallel β-sheets and two short C-terminal helices packed against the second β-sheet, and binds two zinc ions.

40|$|Objective: Validate an MRI {{procedure}} to localize {{the position of}} our final implanted electrodes. Material and Methods: 26 parkinsonian patients were selected for DBS. Surgery was performed with a CRW (Radionics) frame. The final electrode (Medtronic Activa 3389) was implanted according to the MRI preoperative target, microrecording and macrostimulation. A postop 3 D MPRAGE MRI was performed to localize the distal end of the distorsion artifact induced by the contacts of the electrodes. The size of this artifact was studied independently by scanning the electrode in a reference system. It allowed us to calculate {{the center of each}} contact, together with the projected angles of the electrode, the height of one contact and the distance between 2 adjacent contacts. Results: A distance of 1. 4 mm was measured between the artifact and the contact. 208 contacts and 65 active contacts were projected on sagittal, coronal and axial views of the Schaltenbrand and Wahren stereotactic atlas (SWSA). The <b>mean</b> <b>coordinates</b> of each contact were reported as well as the active contact (AP: 3. 09 mm behind, LAT: 12. 06 mm, VERT: 4. 06 mm below the MCP).

The constants and the proposed methodology simplify bioequivalence determinations to blood sampling restricted only to two time points. Twelve volunteer drug plasma concentration (Cp) determinations from a crossover design bioequivalence study were fitted into equations containing two rate processes. The optimized rate constants were used to generate the Cp vs time curves (generated curves). Generated curves were then differentiated (dCp/dt) to obtain the first derivative curve for each volunteer from which times for highest rate of absorption (TAmaxn) and highest rate of elimination (TEmaxn) were determined. The corresponding highest rate of absorption and the highest rate of elimination for each individual were then obtained from the generated curve and named as Amaxn and Emaxn. Individual Amaxn and Emaxn values were then averaged to obtain the mean Amax and Emax. Out of the 24 determinations, a total of 13 Amaxn and 20 Emaxn values fell within &#x 00 B 1; 20 &#x 0025; of the overall mean.

Twenty high-resolution solution structures {{for each of the}} two forms of holo-PfACP have been determined on the basis of 1226 and 1218 unambiguously assigned NOEs (including NOEs between 4 '-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group (4 '-PP) and protein), 55 backbone dihedral angles and 26 hydrogen bonds. The atomic rmsd values of the determined structures of two equilibrium forms, about the <b>mean</b> <b>coordinates</b> of the backbone and heavy atoms, are 0. 48 +/- 0. 09 and 0. 92 +/- 0. 10 and 0. 49 +/- 0. 08 and 0. 97 +/- 0. 11 angstrom, respectively. The interaction of 4 '-PP with the polypeptide backbone is reported {{here for the first time}} for any of the ACPs. The structures of holo-PfACP consist of three well-defined helices that are tightly packed. The structured regions of the molecule are stabilized by extensive hydrophobic interactions. The difference between the two forms arises from a reorientation of the 4 '-PP group. The enthalpy difference between the two forms, although small, implies that a conformational switch is essential for the activation of holo-ACP. Sequence and structures of holo-PfACP have been compared with those of the ACPs from type I and type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathways (FAS), in particular with the ACP from rat and the butyryl-ACP from E. coli.
