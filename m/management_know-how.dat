40|$|Knowledge transfer, {{which is}} a form of {{knowledge}} management, plays an important role for enhancing competitiveness of a company. This is particularly true in restaurant franchise business because a franchisee can usually gain fast and instant competitive advantages against its competitors by receiving precious knowledge such as patented technology and <b>management</b> <b>know-hows</b> from franchisor when signing a franchise contract. In order for knowledge transfer to be successful, there are a few issues involved in the knowledge transfer process. First is whether the recipient has the capability to absorb and to utilize the new knowledge. Second is whether they have an intention to receive the knowledge. Last issue is whether the franchise duration affects the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. This study aims to investigate the relationships among the several factors that are involved in the knowledge transfer between franchisor and franchisee in restaurant industry. Data was collected by using a survey questionnaire on the 119 respondents. The results show that the franchisee’s knowledge absorption capability alone is not very effective to make knowledge transfer successful. More important is that the franchisee’s satisfaction level is affected by the organizational intention for knowledge transfer. The franchise duration, however, does not seem to affect the effectiveness of knowledge transfer...|$|R

40|$|Special Issue: Works from "Future Leaders Global Workshop on Social Science of Agriculture, Food and Environment"Shortage of successors in Japanese farm {{households}} raises {{awareness of}} the significance of succession of farming to non-family members, which as an alternative to conventional transfer to family heirs, is also expected to ease burdens for new entrants to farming. However, challenges have been pointed out as follows: first, a successor has to quickly acquire farm management skills during a relatively short time period; second, for the successor who has no farm-background, financial burdens to succeed the farm are significant; third, even if the successor is well equipped with management skills, financial bases, and other resources, whether he/she can successfully inherit faming is still uncertain for unexpected reasons. Given these challenges, incorporation for succession of farming to non-family successors has emerged as a solution. This paper provides an overview of this emerging farm succession arrangement, and its challenges and future prospects. To illuminate characteristics and challenges in the succession of farming through incorporation, this paper employs case studies of two young farm successors without farm-background. Major findings indicated that the succession of farming to non-family members through incorporation enabled the non-family successor, (1) to begin farming with larger assets including lands with less financial resources; (2) to inherit production skills, <b>management</b> <b>know-hows,</b> and sales channels from the predecessor effectively; (3) to establish readily trust and credibility in the community based on what the predecessor had developed; and (4) to secure income from farming and become fullfledged farmers. Meanwhile, challenges remain for this new succession arrangement, such as matching between potential successors and farmers seeking non-family successors for which supports by local government and communities are essential...|$|R

There are still controversies over these concepts in Korea for two reasons. The first one is the compatibility of the term.

In Korea, these terms have been widely used in the regional development and cultural industry fields. However, when the term “creative economy,” which had been used in state affairs philosophy, collided with the existing creative economy ecosystem, the confusion occurred. For example, local governments such as Seoul and Busan had already implemented strategies to promote the creative industry. Icheon (crafts and folk art), Seoul (design), and Jeonju (gastronomy) were selected for the creative city network that UNESCO constructed to share experiences, ideas, and model cases for cultural, societal, and economic development of cities since 2004.|$|R
