50|$|The {{roots of}} both the term “fine chemicals” and the {{emergence}} of the fine chemical industry as a distinct entity date back to the late 1970s, when the overwhelming success of the histamine H2 receptor antagonists Tagamet (cimetidine) and Zantac (ranitidine hydrochloride) created a strong demand for advanced organic chemicals used in their manufacturing processes. As the in-house production capacities of the originators, the pharmaceutical companies Smith, Kline & French and Glaxo, could not keep pace with the rapidly increasing requirements, both companies (now merged as GlaxoSmithKline) outsourced part of the manufacturing to chemical companies experienced in producing relatively sophisticated organic molecules. Lonza, Switzerland, which already had supplied an early intermediate, <b>methyl</b> <b>acetoacetate,</b> during drug development, soon became the main supplier of more and more advanced precursors. The signature of a first, simple supply contract is generally acknowledged as the historical document marking the beginning of the fine chemical industry.|$|E

40|$|A whole-cell {{biotransformation}} {{system for}} the reduction of prochiral carbonyl compounds, such as <b>methyl</b> <b>acetoacetate,</b> to chiral hydroxy acid derivatives [methyl (R) - 3 -hydroxy butanoate] was developed in Escherichia coli by construction of a recombinant oxidation/reduction cycle. Alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis catalyzes a highly regioselective and enantioselective reduction of several ketones or keto acid derivatives to chiral alcohols or hydroxy acid esters. The adh gene encoding for the alcohol dehydrogenase of L. brevis was expressed in E. coli. As expected, whole cells of the recombinant strain produced only low quantities of methyl (R) - 3 -hydroxy butanoate from the substrate <b>methyl</b> <b>acetoacetate.</b> Therefore, the fdh gene from Mycobacterium vaccae N 10, encoding NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase, was functionally coexpressed. The resulting two-fold recombinant strain exhibited an in vitro catalytic alcohol dehydrogenase activity of 6. 5 units mg- 1 protein in reducing <b>methyl</b> <b>acetoacetate</b> to methyl (R) - 3 -hydroxy butanoate with NADPH as the cofactor and 0. 7 units mg- 1 protein with NADH. The in vitro formate dehydrogenase activity was 1. 3 units mg- 1 protein. Whole resting cells of this strain catalyzed the formation of 40 mM methyl (R) - 3 -hydroxy butanoate from <b>methyl</b> <b>acetoacetate.</b> The product yield was 100 mol% at a productivity of 200 micromol g- 1 (cell dry weight) min- 1. In the presence of formate, the intracellular [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio of the cells increased seven-fold. Thus, the functional overexpression of alcohol dehydrogenase {{in the presence of}} formate dehydrogenase was sufficient to enable and sustain the desired reduction reaction via the relatively low specific activity of alcohol dehydrogenase with NADH, instead of NADPH, as a cofactor...|$|E
