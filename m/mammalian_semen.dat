40|$|Insect {{seminal fluid}} {{proteins}} are powerful modulators of {{many aspects of}} female physiology and behaviour including longevity, egg production, sperm storage, and remating. The crucial role of these proteins in reproduction makes them promising targets for developing tools aimed at reducing the population sizes of vectors of disease. In the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, seminal secretions produced by the male accessory glands (MAGs) are transferred to females {{in the form of}} a coagulated mass called the mating plug. The potential of seminal fluid proteins as tools for mosquito control demands that we improve our limited understanding of the composition and function of the plug. Here, we show that the plug is a key determinant of An. gambiae reproductive success. We uncover the composition of the plug and demonstrate it is formed through the cross-linking of seminal proteins mediated by a MAG-specific transglutaminase (TGase), a mechanism remarkably similar to <b>mammalian</b> <b>semen</b> coagulation. Interfering with TGase expression in males inhibits plug formation and transfer, and prevents females from storing sperm with obvious consequences for fertility. Moreover, we show that the MAG-specific TGase is restricted to the anopheline lineage, where it functions to promote sperm storage rather than as a mechanical barrier to re-insemination.

40|$|In the {{majority}} of teleost fish, fertilization occurs externally when {{in the act of}} spawning, eggs and sperm are discharged in close proximity. Fish sperm consists of spermatozoa which are produced during spermatogenesis and seminal plasma produced by the gonads and spermatic ducts. The parameters which determine the fertilization capability of spermatozoa are their motility and concentration. The movement of fish spermatozoa for external fertilization begins at the moment of their contact with water. Based on the sperm concentration, we can indirectly determine the correct or irregular functioning of male gonads. Fish seminal plasma contains mineral compo-nents and smaller quantities of proteins, carbohy-drates, organic phosphorus, lactic acid and lipids. The seminal plasma of teleost fish is character-ized by a very low concentration of proteins in comparison with <b>mammalian</b> <b>semen</b> (Mann and Lutwak-Mann, 1981). Generally in fish, the protein concentration in seminal plasma does not exceed 2 g/l. Currently, only two protein groups were iden-tified in fish seminal plasma: lipoproteins (Loir et al., 1990) and anti-proteinases (Ciereszko et al., 2000). Besides that, some proteolytic activity was found in fish seminal plasma (Lahnsteiner et al., Supported by UWM Olsztyn, Poland (Project No. 080302. 0214).

40|$|The ejaculated spermatozoon, as an aerobic cell, {{must fight}} against toxic levels of {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) generated by its own metabolism but also by other sources such as abnormal spermatozoa, chemicals and toxicants, or the presence of leukocytes in <b>semen.</b> <b>Mammalian</b> spermatozoa are extremely sensitive to oxidative stress, a condition occurring {{when there is a}} net increase in ROS levels within the cell. Opportunely, this specialized cell has a battery of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxins, thioredoxins, thioredoxins reductases, and glutathione s-transferases) working in concert to assure normal sperm function. Any impairment of the antioxidant enzymatic activities will promote severe oxidative damage which is observed as plasma membrane lipid peroxidation, oxidation of structural proteins and enzymes, and oxidation of DNA bases that lead to abnormal sperm function. Altogether, these damages occurring in spermatozoa are associated with male infertility. The present review contains a description of the enzymatic antioxidant system of the human spermatozoon and a reevaluation of the role of its different components and highlights the necessity of sufficient supply of reducing agents (NADPH and reduced glutathione) to guarantee normal sperm function...|$|R
40|$|In mammals {{the length}} of {{daylight}} has an oscillatory influence on semen production. It is known that in <b>mammalian</b> males highest <b>semen</b> output occurs mainly in spring and fall. It is possible that there is the same pattern in rooster semen production despite the anatomic differences regarding the testis location and, obviously local temperature. Considering these facts the present trial {{was set up in}} order to reveal effects of prolonged daylight – photo stimulation – on semen production in young roosters. All young roosters in the trial were divided in 3 groups, according to the age when photo stimulating schedule started. Photo stimulation was performed by moving young roosters from an 8 h/day light to 14 h / day light. Attempts of collecting semen up to the age of 20 weeks have failed showing relationship between body general development and semen output. Under prolonged light semen parameters as volume, motility and concentration changed from one week to the other. However, light is not the single factor inducing sexual maturity of the genital tract, but it could be used in young roosters in order to stimulate feed intake and thus overall body growth and development...|$|R
40|$|THE {{extensive}} {{amount of}} tedious effort {{required to make}} counts of sperma-tozoa number using the haemocytometer has led those working with <b>mammalian</b> and fowl <b>semen</b> to develop indirect techniques for estimating the density of semen samples. For some years now (Salisbury et al., 1943) the density of bull semen has been deter-mined routinely in most laboratories {{by the use of}} absorptiometric techniques after di-luting the semen with a suitable buffered solution. This technique has been modified for use with semen from other domestic animals {e. g. Bangs and Underwood, 1948, for the ram). Shaffner and Andrews (1943) demonstrated the feasibility of using packed cell volume to estimate the density of sper-matozoa. (Much earlier, Burbank (1935) mentioned that he was developing such a technique but did not indicate it was suc-cessful.) However, the techniques these earlier workers employed were quite cum-bersome and not as simple as measuring the optical density of diluted samples of semen. Recently Hickman (1958) outlined a pro-cedure for estimating the density of undi-luted bull semen, utilizing standard micro-haematocrit capillary tubes and a micro-haematocrit centrifuge. This eliminated most of the objectionable features in the procedure outlined by Shaffner and An-drews (1943). The optical density technique described by Salisbury et al. (1943) for bull semen has been widely used by those studying fowl and turkey semen (Jones and Lamo...|$|R
40|$|Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a {{naturally}} occurring ectopeptidase present in <b>mammalian</b> <b>semen.</b> Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that APN adversely affects male fertility through the alteration of sperm motility. This enzyme constitutes 0. 5 to 1 % of the seminal plasma proteins, which can be transferred from the prostasomes to sperms by a fusion process. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of action of APN and its role in regulating sperm functions and male fertility. In this in vitro study, epididymal mouse spermatozoa were incubated in a capacitating media (pH 7) containing 20 ng/mL of recombinant mouse APN for 90 min. Our results demonstrated that the supplementation of recombinant APN in sperm culture medium significantly increased APN activity, and subsequently altered motility, hyperactivated motility, rapid and medium swimming speeds, viability, and the acrosome reaction of mouse spermatozoa. These effects were potentially caused by increased toxicity in the spermatozoa. Further, altered APN activity in sperm culture medium affected early embryonic development. Interestingly, the effect of elevated APN activity in sperm culture medium was independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and protein kinase A activity. On the basis of these results, we concluded that APN plays {{a significant role in the}} regulation of several sperm functions and early embryonic development. In addition, increased APN activity could potentially lead to several adverse consequences related to male fertility...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{fertilization}} of mouse, golden hamster, and rat eggs in media at various pH values was investigated. A modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, a modified Tyrode’s solution with heated hamster blood serum, and a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution with heated rat blood serum were used, respectively, for the mouse, hamster, and rat gametes. Although sperm penetration could occur in media between pH 6 and 8. 5, 6. 7 and 8. 7, and 6. 75 and 8. 3, the optimal pH ranged from 7. 3 to 7. 7, 6. 8 to 8. 2, and 7. 8, respectively, for the penetration of mouse, hamster, and rat eggs. It seems that in {{vitro fertilization}} of rat eggs can be achieved in media only within a relatively narrow range of pH higher than pH 7, while hamster and mouse gametes can withstand a relatively wide range of pH. The hydrogen ion concentration of fresh <b>mammalian</b> <b>semen</b> is not far from neutral and, in general, spermatozoa are active and survive for the longest period at a pH of about 7 (White, 1962; Mann, 1964). Two-cell mouse eggs can develop into blasto-cysts in media at pH 5. 87 and 7. 78 {{in an atmosphere of}} 5 % GO 2, and the optimal pH appears to be near 6. 82 (Brinster, 1965). The fertilization rate of mouse eggs in the ampullar parts of the oviduct in a medium of pH 6. 8 - 7. 0 is lower than in a medium of pH 7. 8 - 8. 1 (Pavlok, 1968). The fertilization rate of hamster eggs in vitro was maximal at pH 7. 6 and decreased at pH 7. 2 or less in a modified Tyrode’s solu-tion containing bovine serum albumin in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 (Bavister, 1969). When barbital-acetate-HC 1 buffer was used, the highest proportion of penetrate...|$|E
