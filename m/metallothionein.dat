However, inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful; excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because <b>metallothionein</b> absorbs both metals.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to <b>metallothionein</b> and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and <b>metallothionein</b> and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E

Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state {{by the end of}} the reaction catalyzed.

5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by <b>metallothionein.</b> However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E
5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective <b>metallothionein</b> that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper.|$|E

Methods In order to examine the association between the expression of <b>metallothioneins</b> and bladder tumors, and to compare the levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel in animals with bladder tumors and animals without bladder tumors, 37 cases of bovine bladder tumors and 17 controls were collected. The detection and quantification of <b>metallothioneins</b> in bladder tissue of both cases and controls was performed by immunohistochemistry. And the quantification of metals in tissue and hair was assessed by inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry. Results Increased expression of <b>metallothioneins</b> was associated with bladder tumors when compared with non-tumoral bladder tissue (OR = 9. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 0 – 480).

However, as for the concentration of metals in bladder tissue, the differences were not significant. Conclusion Though the sample size was small, the present study shows an association between bladder tumors and <b>metallothioneins.</b> Moreover, it shows that concentrations of metals such as cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel in hair may be used as a biomarker of exposure. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{optimization}} {{strategy for}} the separation and analysis of class III <b>metallothioneins</b> from a complex matrix by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is presented and illustrated. <b>Metallothioneins</b> are a group of polypeptides used for many organisms to alleviate stresses imposed by exposure to heavy-metal excess. The analysis requires several steps: chromatography on exclusion or anion-exchange columns, ultrafiltration and HPLC with derivatization. In the present paper, a rapid and simple separation technique by CZE with an uncoated polyimide-clad fused-silica capillary is described. This technique permits the analysis of these molecules without prior steps of purification and derivatization. The running conditions were voltage − 12 kV, room temperature and 150 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 3. 5). Based on this preliminary study, CZE with an uncoated fused-silica capillary using sodium phosphate buffer {{appears to be a}} useful technique for the separation of class III <b>metallothioneins...</b>|$|R

40|$|Early {{cysteine}} labeled (E-c) proteins are plant <b>metallothioneins,</b> {{which were}} first identified in wheat embryos and {{are thought to}} be seed-specific. An exhaustive analysis of expressed sequence tag (EST) entries reveals that homologs are expressed in embryos of both classes of flowering plants (monocotyledons and dicotyledons), but also occur in conifers (gymnosperms) and seed-free spike moss (lycophyta). Mass spectrometric and elemental analysis results indicate that, contrary to the widely propagated number of five, Ec binds predominantly six zinc ions in at least two zinc-thiolate clusters. H- 1 and Cd- 111 NMR experiments suggest that, in contrast to the majority of previously characterized <b>metallothioneins,</b> two conserved histidine residues participate in metal binding. The collected data is con- sistent with the presence of clusters unprecedented in <b>metallothioneins</b> so far. This novel cluster composition is accompanied by metalbinding properties that are substantially different from other metallothioneins; thus wheat EC binds zinc less strongly than either mammalian or cyanobacterial MTs. The unique biochemical properties of wheat Ec render it ideally suited for a role in zinc donation to nascent proteins during seed development, a role that has been suggested {{based on the fact that}} EC is induced by the plant hormone abscisic acid, but not by heavy metals. Our results provide a step further toward developing a property/function relationship for <b>metallothioneins.</b> ...|$|R

CD 4 T cell activation was associated with zinc influx via the zinc transporter Zip 6, leading to increased free cytoplasmic zinc and activation of negative feedback loops, including the induction of zinc-binding <b>metallothioneins.</b> In young adults, activation-induced cytoplasmic zinc concentrations declined after 2 days to below prestimulation levels. In contrast, activated naïve CD 4 T cells from older individuals failed to downregulate cytoplasmic zinc, resulting in excessive induction of <b>metallothioneins.</b> Activation-induced <b>metallothioneins</b> regulated the redox state in activated T cells and accounted for an increased proliferation of old CD 4 T cells, suggesting that regulation of T cell zinc homeostasis functions as a compensatory mechanism to preserve the replicative potential of naïve CD 4 T cells with age...|$|R

The two metal-coordinating His residues in Synechococcus PCC 7942 SmtA enhance the stability of the zinc-thiolate cluster, compared to an all-Cys cluster generated by site-directed mutagenesis. His 40 confers structural order to the entire C-terminus, whilst His 49 has been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating zinc transfer reactions.
