5000|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>dry</b> {{abrasive}} blast {{systems are}} typically {{powered by a}} diesel air compressor. The air compressor provides a large volume of high pressure air to a single or multiple [...] "blast pots". Blast pots are pressurized, tank-like containers, filled with abrasive material, used to allow an adjustable amount of blasting grit into the main blasting line. The number of blast pots is dictated by the volume of air the compressor can provide. Fully equipped blast systems are often found mounted on semi-tractor trailers, offering high mobility and easy transport from site to site. Others are hopper-fed types making them lightweight and more mobile.|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of this thesis the new two-dimensional detector array maXs 30 was developed, fabricated and characterized. It is optimized for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy in the energy range up to 30 keV and consists of 8 x 8 individual metallic magnetic calorimeters. These detectors combine the good energy resolution of crystal spectrometers and the large energy bandwidth of semiconductor detectors and measure the energy of each absorbed photon by the resulting temperature change. This change is converted to a change of magnetization by the paramagnetic alloy Ag:Er, which is read out by sensitive SQUID magnetometers. The detector can be mounted on the side arm of a <b>mobile</b> <b>dry</b> dilution refrigerator and a new 32 channel acquisition system has been developed for this array. The intrinsic energy resolution of the maXs 30 detector {{was measured to be}} 7. 9 eV (FWHM) and a resolving power of almost 3000 was achieved for X-rays with an energy of 60 keV.

40|$|The PETRA {{storage ring}} at DESY will be {{upgraded}} {{to a third}} generation synchrotron radiation source with 15 beamlines in the PETRA III project [1]. Mobile pumping stations will be needed for the initial pump down of the beamlines and beamline components to a hydrocarbon-free and particle-free ultra-high vacuum [2]. They will be placed at the disposal for users to pump down and bake their experimental chambers and for leak detection. Since the old HASYLAB pumping station design used at DORIS does not fulfil the resulting requirements, a new pumping station was developed (see Fig. 1).

40|$|The Office of Mine Safety and Health Research of the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH OMSHR) {{conducted}} {{laboratory testing}} of a self-tramming, remotely controlled <b>mobile</b> <b>Dry</b> Scrubber (DS) that J. H. Fletcher and Co. developed under {{a contract with}} NIOSH OMSHR to reduce the exposure of miners to airborne dust. The scrubber was found to average greater than 95 percent dust removal efficiency with disposable filters, and 88 and 90 percent, respectively, with optional washable filters in their prewash and post-wash test conditions. Although the washable filters can be reused, washing them generated personal and downstream respirable dust concentrations of 1. 2 and 8. 3 mg/m(3), respectively, for a 10 -min washing period. The scrubber's velocity-pressure-regulated variable-frequency-drive fan maintained relatively consistent airflow near the targeted 1. 42 and 4. 25 m(3) /s (3, 000 and 9, 000 ft(3) /min) airflow rates {{during most of the}} laboratory dust testing until reaching its maximum 60 -Hz fan motor frequency or horsepower rating at 2, 610 Pa (10. 5 in. w. g.) of filter differential pressure and 3. 97 m(3) /s (8, 420 ft(3) /min) of scrubber airflow quantity. Laboratory sound level measurements of the scrubber showed that the outlet side of the scrubber was noisier, and the loaded filters increased sound levels compared with clean filters at the same airflow quantities. With loaded filters, the scrubber reached a 90 dB(A) sound level at 2. 83 m(3) /s (6, 000 ft(3) /min) of scrubber airflow, indicating that miners should not be overexposed in relation to MSHA's permissible exposure level - under Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations Part 62. 101 - of 90 dB(A) at or below this airflow quantity. The scrubber's washable filters were not used during field-testing because of their lower respirable dust removal efficiency and the airborne dust generated by filter washing. Field-testing the scrubber with disposable filters at two underground coal mine sections showed that it could clean a portion of the section return air and provide dust reduction of about 50 percent at the face area downstream of the continuous-miner operation.

40|$|The mind is {{the music}} that neural {{networks}} play. " This quote from computational neurobiologist T. J. Sejnowski underscores a growing scientific consensus that studying the structure and function of vast networks of connections between brain regions is essential to understanding cognitive and affective state maintenance, sensorimotor information processing and control, etiologies and remedies for numerous neuropathologies, {{as well as a}} host of other facets of our conscious (and non-conscious) experience. Towards this goal, an ongoing challenge lies in identifying - in vivo in humans - spatiotemporal cortical network dynamics, at the level of individuals and groups, across experimental task conditions, and at the level of single trials. In the opening chapter of this dissertation, I introduce the Source Information Flow Toolbox (SIFT), a novel open-source software package for identification of neuronal dynamics and causal interactions in electrophysiological source and sensor data. The software integrates with the widely used EEGLAB analysis suite, addressing a need for robust tools for identifying single- and multi-trial multivariate brain network dynamics across time, frequency, anatomical source location, and subjects. I then introduce and assess two new methods (Measure Projection Analysis and Multi-view Hierarchical Bayesian Learning) for statistical analysis of source-level dynamics (including connectivity) across groups of subjects in the presence of missing data. The remaining chapters focus on applications of dynamical modeling approaches in SIFT to open problems within the fields of cognitive neuroscience, clinical neuroscience and neuroengineering. I first present three studies examining single-trial time-varying spatiotemporal network dynamics underlying generation and maintenance of epileptic seizures. Next I present a case study examining the effect of visual feedback on an occipito-parietal-motor network in freezing-of-gait in patients with Parkinson's disease. The final chapters focus on new directions in neuroengineering and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) leveraging neural dynamical system identification. We first review the history and state of the BCI field and summarize important new directions in BCI design. I then present a novel system for real-time mobile brain imaging, artifact rejection, neuronal system identification, and cognitive state prediction, and demonstrate its application in predicting response error commission from cortical network dynamics using a new high-density <b>mobile</b> <b>dry</b> EEG system...|$|R

40|$|Volcanic eruptions are powerful, {{uncontrollable}} natural {{events which}} produce {{a number of}} hazards that can impact upon all aspects of society, including critical infrastructure. The most widespread and disruptive of these hazards is volcanic ashfall. Direct ashfall impacts, even minor, can cause multiple knock on effects throughout all critical infrastructure sectors leading to disruption of these services, on which society relies. However with appropriate volcanic risk management strategies, these impacts can be lessened. Electronic equipment, including laptop computers, are a common and vital component in all critical infrastructure sectors, field based volcanic research and wider society. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand how laptops will function in volcanic environments. This thesis assesses the vulnerability of laptop computers to volcanic ash and gas hazards through field and laboratory based experimentation and the development of quantitative risk assessments metrics. Laboratory based ash vulnerability experiments were carried out in the Volcanic Ash Testing Facility, University of Canterbury, using a mass produced basalt ‘pseudo ash’, which is physically and chemically analogous to fresh volcanic ash. Each laptop was exposed to ash for 100 160 hours at fall rates of ~ 500 g/m² h. None of the ten laptops used sustained any permanent damage from volcanic ash, however, three shutdown temporarily due to overheating. This was because laptops only contain a few small ventilation holes which prevent large quantities of ash from entering the laptops. However, ash contamination reduced functionality of keyboards, CD drives and some cooling fans as these are open to the environment or located close to ventilation holes. Wet ash, known to cause short circuits of electrical equipment, was not able to enter the laptops because it is less <b>mobile</b> than <b>dry</b> ash. Functionality was retained with the use of simple mitigation techniques such as placing laptops inside heavy duty polyethylene bags. Volcanic gas vulnerability experiments were undertaken at White Island, New Zealand. Three laptops were exposed to high concentrations of volcanic gases for ~ 5 hours. None however, sustained any permanent damage, due to the limited quantity of gas that could enter the laptop, although metal components on the outside of the laptop sustained minor corrosion...|$|R
40|$|VHF radio-tags were {{attached}} to 16 estuarine crocodiles that were tracked between October 2001 and May 2003. Male (n = 12) and female (n = 4) crocodiles exhibited distinctly different patterns of movement. Females occupied a small core linear range (1. 3 +/- 0. 9 km) on the main river channel {{during the dry season}} and moved up to 62 km to nesting habitat during the wet season, returning to the same core area the following dry season. They occasionally made excursions away from their core areas during the dry season. Males moved considerable distances along the Ord River throughout the year. The largest range recorded was 87 km for a 2. 5 -m juvenile male. However, ranges of males {{did not appear to be}} related to body size, with the largest two ranges being recorded for the smallest (2. 5 m) and largest (4. 3 m) males tagged. Rates of movement of males did not differ significantly between three size classes of males but there were significant seasonal differences, with the highest mean rates of movement occurring during the summer wet season (4. 0 +/- 5. 4 km/day). However, males were quite <b>mobile</b> during the <b>dry</b> season and the highest rate of movement detected was 23. 3 km/day for a 4. 3 -m male at the end of July. The highest rate of sustained movement was 9. 8 km/day for a translocated 2. 6 -m juvenile male, which travelled 118 km in 12 days to return to the area of its capture. Neither males nor females showed exclusive habitat preferences for any of four broad riverine habitats identified on the Ord River. However, the three largest males had activity centres that they returned to frequently despite numerous excursions throughout the year, both up- and downriver. Males had substantial range overlaps with no obvious spatial partitioning, suggesting that territoriality is not an important behavioural characteristic of free-ranging male crocodiles along the Ord River...|$|R
