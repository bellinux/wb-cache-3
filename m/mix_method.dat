50|$|The dry <b>mix</b> <b>method</b> {{involves}} {{placing the}} dry ingredients into a hopper and then conveying them pneumatically through a hose to the nozzle. The nozzleman controls the addition of water at the nozzle. The water and the dry mixture is not completely mixed, but is completed as the mixture hits the receiving surface. This requires a skilled nozzleman, {{especially in the case}} of thick or heavily reinforced sections. Advantages of the dry mix process are that the water content can be adjusted instantaneously by the nozzleman, allowing more effective placement in overhead and vertical applications without using accelerators. The dry mix process is useful in repair applications when it is necessary to stop frequently, as the dry material is easily discharged from the hose.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To outline {{some of the}} {{challenges}} of <b>mixed</b> <b>methods</b> research and illustrate {{how they can be}} addressed in health psychology research. METHODS: This study critically reflects on the author's previously published <b>mixed</b> <b>methods</b> research and discusses the philosophical and technical challenges of <b>mixed</b> <b>methods,</b> grounding the discussion in a brief review of methodological literature. RESULTS: <b>Mixed</b> <b>methods</b> research is characterized as having philosophical and technical challenges; the former can be addressed by drawing on pragmatism, the latter by considering formal <b>mixed</b> <b>methods</b> research designs proposed in a number of design typologies. There are important differences among the design typologies which provide diverse examples of designs that health psychologists can adapt for their own <b>mixed</b> <b>methods</b> research. There are also similarities; in particular, many typologies explicitly orient to the technical challenges of deciding on the respective timing of qualitative and quantitative methods and the relative emphasis placed on each method. Characteristics, strengths, and limitations of different sequential and concurrent designs are identified by reviewing five <b>mixed</b> <b>methods</b> projects each conducted for a different purpose. CONCLUSIONS: Adapting formal <b>mixed</b> <b>methods</b> designs can help health psychologists address the technical challenges of <b>mixed</b> <b>methods</b> research and identify the approach that best fits the research questions and purpose. This does not obfuscate the need to address philosophical challenges of mixing qualitative and quantitative methods.
