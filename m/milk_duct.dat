The milk glands {{are most likely to}} be affected by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede milk flow. Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, it is impossible to predict whether a woman who undergoes breast augmentation will be able to successfully breast feed since some women are able to breast-fed after periareolarincisions and subglandular placement and some are not able to after augmentation using submuscular and other types of surgical incisions.|$|E

25|$|Functional {{breast-feeding}} difficulties {{arise if}} the surgeon cut the milk ducts or the major nerves innervating the breast, {{or if the}} milk glands were otherwise damaged. <b>Milk</b> <b>duct</b> and nerve damage are more common to the periareolar incision implantation procedure, which cuts tissue near the nipple, whereas other implantation incision-plansIMF (inframammary fold), TABA (Trans-Axillary Breast Augmentation), TUBA (trans-umbilical breast augmentation)avoid the tissue of the nipple-areola complex; if the woman is concerned about possible breast-feeding difficulties, the periareolar incisions can be effected to reduce damage to the milk ducts and to the nerves of the NAC. The milk glands are affected most by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede milk flow. Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, women have successfully breast-fed after undergoing periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement.|$|E
2500|$|If {{breastfeeding}} {{is suddenly}} stopped a woman's breasts {{are likely to}} become engorged with milk. [...] Pumping small amounts to relieve discomfort helps to gradually train the breasts to produce less milk. There is presently no safe medication to prevent engorgement, but cold compresses and ibuprofen may help to relieve pain and swelling. Pain should go away in one to five days. [...] If symptoms continue and comfort measures are not helpful a woman should consider the possibility that a blocked <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> or infection may be present and seek medical intervention.|$|E
50|$|A blocked <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> is a {{blockage}} {{of one or}} more ducts carrying milk to {{the nipple}} for the purpose of breastfeeding an infant. The symptoms are a tender, localised lump in one breast, with redness in the skin over the lump. The cause of a blocked <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> is the failure to remove milk from part of the breast. This may be due to infrequent breastfeeding, poor attachment, tight clothing or trauma to the breast. Sometimes the duct to one part of the breast is blocked by thickened milk. A blocked <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> can be managed by improving the removal of milk and correcting the underlying cause.|$|E
50|$|Mastitis {{typically}} develops {{when the}} milk is not properly {{removed from the}} breast. Milk stasis {{can lead to the}} <b>milk</b> <b>ducts</b> in the breasts becoming blocked, as the breast milk is not being properly and regularly expressed. It has also been suggested that blocked <b>milk</b> <b>ducts</b> can occur as a result of pressure on the breast, such as tight-fitting clothing or an over-restrictive bra, although there is sparse evidence for this supposition.Mastitis may occur when the baby is not appropriately attached to the breast while feeding, when the baby has infrequent feeds or has problems suckling the milk out of the breast.|$|R

50|$|The {{extremely}} {{rapid growth}} of the breasts can result in intense heat. The woman's breasts can generate extraordinary discomfort, turning feverish, red, itchy, and even causing the skin to peel. The swelling can suppress the milk supply, pinching off the <b>milk</b> <b>ducts,</b> and leading to mastitis.|$|R

50|$|The {{stripping}} {{action is}} repeated, using both hands for speed. Both methods {{result in the}} milk that was trapped in the <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> being squirted out the end into a bucket that is supported between the knees (or rests on the ground) of the milker, who usually sits on a low stool.|$|E
50|$|Some women (approximately 15% in Kvist et al. study) {{will require}} {{antibiotic}} treatment for infection {{which is usually}} caused by bacteria from the skin or the baby's mouth that entering the <b>milk</b> <b>ducts</b> through skin lesions of the nipple or through {{the opening of the}} nipple. Infection is usually caused by staphylococcus aureus.|$|R
50|$|Puerperal {{mastitis}} is {{the inflammation}} of the breast in connection with pregnancy, breastfeeding or weaning. Since {{one of the most}} prominent symptoms is tension and engorgement of the breast, it is thought to be caused by blocked <b>milk</b> <b>ducts</b> or <b>milk</b> excess. It is relatively common; estimates range depending on methodology between 5-33%. However, only about 0.4-0.5% of breastfeeding mothers develop an abscess.|$|R
50|$|The 2.0-4.5 mm <b>milk</b> <b>ducts</b> are {{immediately}} surrounded with {{dense connective tissue}} that support the glands. The glandular tissue of the breast is biochemically supported by estrogen. When a woman ceases menstruation and her estrogen levels decrease, breast atrophy occurs; milk gland tissue atrophies, withers, and disappears, resulting in a breast composed of adipose tissue, superﬁcial fascia, suspensory ligaments, and the skin envelope.|$|R
50|$|Estrogen {{stimulates the}} <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> system {{to grow and}} differentiate. Like progesterone, high levels of {{estrogen}} also inhibit lactation. Estrogen levels also drop at delivery and remain low for the first several months of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mothers should avoid estrogen-based birth control methods, as a spike in estrogen levels may reduce a mother's milk supply.|$|E
50|$|Milk stasis {{is when a}} <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> {{is blocked}} and cannot drain properly. This may affect {{only a part of}} the breast and is not {{associated}} with any infection. It can be treated by varying the baby's feeding position and applying heat before feeding. If it happens more than once, further evaluation is needed.|$|E
50|$|Its cause {{may be due}} to a blocked pore {{that leads}} to seepage of milk or serous fluid under the epidermis. This causes a white 'bump' that appears opaque and shiny. If the bleb {{continues}} to block the flow of milk out of the breast it may develop into a blocked <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> or even mastitis.|$|E
50|$|FunctionA ramogen is a {{biochemical}} {{signal that}} enables {{the creation of a}} physiological branch. The signal can be {{in the form of a}} growth factor or a hormone that makes a tube branch. One specific example would be the hormone that forms the simple tube through which the mammary glands begin to form causing the formation of a highly branched “tree” of <b>milk</b> <b>ducts</b> in females.|$|R
5000|$|Engorgement usually {{happens when}} the breasts switch from {{colostrum}} to mature milk (often referred to as when the milk [...] "comes in"). However, engorgement can also happen later if lactating women miss several nursings and not enough milk is expressed from the breasts. It can be exacerbated by insufficient breastfeeding and/or blocked <b>milk</b> <b>ducts.</b> When engorged the breasts may swell, throb, and cause mild to extreme pain.|$|R
50|$|Not only {{is a poor}} latch painful but it {{can also}} lead to blocked <b>milk</b> <b>ducts,</b> mastitis, and other infections. A poor latch also isn't good for the baby, as it means he or she isn't getting enough milk. So if poor {{latching}} has been occuring {{for more than a few}} days breastfeeding mothers can get help. There are resources available at no or low cost.|$|R
50|$|Ductoscopy can be {{performed}} in a physician's office or as an outpatient in a clinic. A fiber optic scope less than a millimeter thick is inserted into the <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> at the nipple and threaded deep into the breast through the duct. No incision is involved. An imaging system displays {{the output of the}} scope on a computer monitor. Samples of epithelial cells can be collected onto microscope slides for further analysis. Local anesthetic may be employed to reduce discomfort.|$|E
50|$|Cosmetic {{improvement}} procedures include breast lift (mastopexy), breast augmentation with implants, and combination procedures; the {{two types}} of available breast implants are models filled with silicone gel, and models filled with saline solution. These types of breast surgery can also repair inverted nipples by releasing <b>milk</b> <b>duct</b> tissues that have become tethered. Furthermore, {{in the case of the}} obese woman, a breast lift (mastopexy) procedure, with or without a breast volume reduction, can be part of an upper-body lift and contouring for the woman who has undergone massive body weight loss.|$|E

50|$|Engorgement {{may lead}} to {{mastitis}} (inflammation of the breast) and untreated engorgement puts pressure on the <b>milk</b> <b>ducts,</b> often causing a plugged duct. The woman will often feel a lump {{in one part of}} the breast, and the skin in that area may be red and/or warm. If it continues unchecked, the plugged duct can become a breast infection, at which point she may have a fever or flu-like symptoms.|$|R
50|$|Ductal lavage is {{a method}} used to collect cells from <b>milk</b> <b>ducts</b> in the breast. A hair-size {{catheter}} (tube) is inserted into the nipple, and {{a small amount of}} salt water is released into the duct. The water picks up breast cells, and is removed. The cells are checked under a microscope. Ductal lavage may be used in addition to clinical breast examination and mammography to detect breast cancer.|$|R
50|$|Lactiferous ducts {{are those}} ducts that {{converge}} {{and form a}} branched system connecting the nipple to the lobules of the mammary gland. When lactogenesis occurs, {{under the influence of}} hormones, the milk is moved to the nipple by the action of smooth muscle contractions along the ductal system to the tip of the nipple. They are also referred to as galactophores, galactophorous ducts, mammary ducts, mamillary <b>ducts</b> or <b>milk</b> <b>ducts.</b>|$|R
