Elevation of the buffer pH to 7. 8, by addition of ammonium chloride, reduced arterial perfusion pressure from 8. 74 ± 0. 57 to 6. 96 ± 1. 37 kPa, and increased adenosine output from 25 ± 5 to 47 ± 8 pmol min− 1 (g wet wt muscle) − 1 and AMP output from 3. 7 ± 1. 1 to 24. 6 ± 6. 8 pmol min− 1 (g wet wt muscle) − 1. Activity of membrane-bound 5 ′N was {{an order of magnitude}} higher than that of either cytosolic 5 ′N or PT: pH depression reduced the Km of 5 ′N, which increased its capacity to form adenosine by 10 – 20 % for every 0. 5 unit decrease in pH within the physiological range. PT was only found in the membrane fraction: its contribution to extracellular adenosine formation increased from about 5 % at pH 7. 0 to about 15 % at pH 8. 0. Cytosolic 5 ′N had a low activity, which was unaffected by pH; the rate of intracellular adenosine formation was an order of magnitude lower than the rate of adenosine removal by adenosine kinase or adenosine deaminase, which were both exclusively intracellular enzymes. We conclude that (i) adenosine is formed in the extracellular compartment of rat skeletal muscle, principally by membrane-bound 5 ′N, where it is protected from enzymatic breakdown; (ii) adenosine is formed intracellularly at a very low rate, and is unlikely to leave the cell; (iii) enhanced adenosine formation at low pH is driven by an increased extracellular AMP concentration and an increased affinity of membrane-bound 5 ′N for AMP; (iv) enhanced adenosine formation at high pH is driven solely by the elevated extracellular AMP concentration, since the catalytic capacity of membrane 5 ′N is reduced at high pH...|$|E

OBJETIVO: Avaliar, em ratas submetidas a exercício físico, as repercussões do infarto do miocárdio. MÉTODOS: Ratas foram submetidas à natação ou permaneceram sedentárias por oito semanas e foram randomizadas para oclusão coronariana ou cirurgia simulada, compondo quatro grupos: Sedentário (S), Exercício (E), Sedentário infarto (SIM) e Exercício infarto (EIM). Após seis semanas, foram analisados biometria, ecodopplercardiograma, hemodinâmica e mecânica miocárdica. RESULTADOS: Não foram observados cardioproteção nos animais EIM e diferença no tamanho do infarto (%VE) entre EIM (38, 50 ± 4, 60 %) e SIM (36, 58 ± 4, 11 %). Os teores de água pulmonar (%) de SIM (80 ± 0, 59) e EIM (80 ± 0, 57) foram maiores do que em S (78 ± 0, 15) e E (78 ± 0, 57). A pressão sistólica (mmHg) do ventrículo esquerdo (S: 130 ± 5; E: 118 ± 8; SIM: 91 ± 3; EIM: 98 ± 3) e a primeira derivada {{temporal}} (mmHg/s) positiva da pressão (S: 8. 216 ± 385; E: 8. 437 ± 572; SIM: 4. 674 ± 455; EIM: 5. 080 ± 412) de S e E foram maiores do que em SIM e EIM. As frações de encurtamento da área transversa (%) de SIM (27 ± 2) e EIM (25 ± 2) foram similares e menores do que E (65 ± 2) e S (69 ± 2). A relação E/A foi maior em SIM (5, 14 ± 0, 61) e EIM (4, 73 ± 0, 57) em relação a S (2, 96 ± 0, 24) e E (2, 83 ± 0, 21). Em estudos de músculos papilares isolados foi verificada depressão da capacidade contrátil semelhante em SIM e EIM, e não houve alteração da rigidez miocárdica. CONCLUSÃO: O treinamento prévio por natação não atenuou as repercussões cardíacas em virtude do infarto do miocárdio. BACKGROUND: Few {{studies have}} analyzed the cardiac effects of exercise prior to coronary occlusion. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate {{the effects of}} myocardial infarction in rats undergoing physical exercise. METHODS: Female rats underwent swimming exercise or were kept sedentary for eight weeks and were randomized to coronary occlusion or sham surgery, {{in one of the}} following four groups: Sedentary (S), exercise (E), Sedentary myocardial infarction (SMI) and Exercise myocardial infarction (EMI). After six weeks, their biometrics, Doppler echocardiography, hemodynamics and myocardial mechanics were analyzed. RESULTS: No cardioprotection was observed in EMI animals and {{there was no difference in}} infarct size (%LV) between EMI (38. 50 ± 4. 60 %) and SMI (36. 58 ± 4. 11 %). Water content of the lung (%) of SMI (80 ± 0. 59) and EMI (80 ± 0. 57) was higher than that of S (78 ± 0. 15) and E (78 ± 0. 57) groups.

50|$|Three {{antagonistic}} {{pairs of}} muscles control eye movements: the lateral and medial rectus muscles, the superior and inferior rectus muscles, and the superior and inferior oblique muscles. These muscles {{are responsible for}} movements of the eye along three different axes: horizontal, either toward the nose (adduction) or away from the nose (abduction); vertical, either elevation or depression; and torsional, movements that bring {{the top of the}} eye toward the nose (intorsion) or away from the nose (extorsion). Horizontal movements are controlled entirely by the medial and lateral rectus muscles; the medial rectus muscle is responsible for adduction, the lateral rectus muscle for abduction. Vertical movements require the coordinated action of the superior and inferior rectus muscles, as well as the oblique muscles. The relative contribution of the rectus and oblique groups depends on the horizontal position of the eye. In the primary position (eyes straight ahead), both of these groups contribute to vertical movements. Elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus and inferior oblique <b>muscles,</b> while <b>depression</b> is due to the action of the inferior rectus and superior oblique muscles. When the eye is abducted, the rectus muscles are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus, and depression is due to the action of the inferior rectus. When the eye is adducted, the oblique muscles are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the inferior oblique <b>muscle,</b> while <b>depression</b> is due to the action of the superior oblique muscle.

40|$|Introduction. Fatigue is {{a common}} and {{debilitating}} symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Self-reported levels of perceived fatigue are associated with both patient characteristics and clinical measures. Pilot analysis indicated that muscle fatigability combined with depression scores was highly associated with perceived fatigue in patients with MS. Studies that combine physiological and psychological constructs to explain MS-related fatigue are scarce. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the robustness of the association between perceived fatigue, <b>muscle</b> fatigability, and <b>depression</b> scores in MS. Methods. Eighty-six patients with relapsing-remitting MS completed 2 fatigue questionnaires (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS] and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale [MFIS]) and a depression questionnaire (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]). Maximal index finger abduction force (maximum voluntary contraction [MVC]) was measured, as well as muscle fatigability during a 2 -minutes sustained maximal contraction. Multivariable regression analyses were {{used to analyze the}} association between perceived fatigue, and <b>muscle</b> fatigability and <b>depression</b> scores. Results. Perceived fatigue was associated with <b>depression,</b> <b>muscle</b> fatigability, and, depending on the questionnaire, to sex or to MVC. The model explained 40 % and 48 % of the variation in perception of fatigue as indexed with FSS questionnaire (r(partial) : HADS 0. 45, muscle fatigability 0. 45, MVC - 0. 14, sex 0. 32), and MFIS physical questionnaire (r(partial) : HADS 0. 59, muscle fatigability 0. 49, MVC - 0. 38), respectively. Conclusions. The found association accentuates the importance of including both physiological fatigability-related and psychological mood-related constructs in models to explain perceived fatigue in patients with MS. The model also directs future research toward applying effortful conditions and emphasizes the importance of assessing different constructs when evaluating rehabilitation strategies to reduce MS-related fatigue...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The present studiy was {{conducted}} to evaluate the toxic effects of the carbamate insecticide carbofuran (Carbosan 35 ST) after experimental acute intoxication in quails (Coturnix coturnix). Experiments for monitoring of changes in clinical indices and some haematological parameters. Quails were divided into 5 groups: one control and 4 experimental. They were treated by increasing single doses of the tested pesticide: 1. 05 mg/kg (experimental group I), 2. 1 mg/kg (experimental group II), 5. 25 mg/kg (experimental group III) and 10. 5 mg/kg (experimental group IV), corresponding to 1 / 10 LD 50, 1 / 5 LD 50, 1 / 2 LD 50 and LD 50 oral doses for albino rats, respectively. In three consecutive days prior to the treatment (hours – 48, – 24 and 0) and 1, 3, 5, 7, 24 and 48 hours thereafter, the clinical status was registered to evaluate rectal body temperature, faeces excretion, locomotion, perception etn. and were obtained blood samples from v. subcutanea ulnaris or v. metatarsea ulnaris for analysis of haemoglobin content (HGB).

The described changes were the most obvious between post treatment hours 1 and 3, and then the studied parameters regained their control values. The tolerated dose of carbofuran was 1. 05 mg/kg (1 / 10 LD for albino rats), the minimum toxic dose was 2. 1 mg/kg (1 / 5 LD for albino rats), and minimum lethal dose - 10. 5 mg/kg, equal to LD for albino rats. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The typical {{symptoms}} of {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD), chest pain and breathlessness, are well-known. They are considered quite dramatic, and can thus be fairly reliably mapped by a survey. However, people might have other clearly unpleasant symptoms impairing quality of life. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the appearance of these complaints of working-aged people with self-reported CHD. Methods The study consists of a postal questionnaire of randomly selected Finns in age groups 30 – 34, 40 – 44 and 50 – 54, a response rate of 39 % (N = 15, 477). The subjects were asked whether or not a doctor had told them that they had angina pectoris or had had myocardial infarction. Four randomly selected age and sex matched controls were chosen for every patient. The occurrence of self-reported dyspnoea, chest pain during anger or other kind of emotion, palpitation and perspiration without physical exercise, irregular heartbeats, flushing, trembling of hands and voice, jerking of <b>muscles,</b> <b>depression</b> and day-time sleepiness were examined. Odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI), between occurrence of symptoms and CHD with and without heart infarction, were computed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results The sample eventually comprised 319 CHD patients. Dyspnoea, chest pain during anger or other kind of emotion, palpitation, perspiration without physical exercise, irregular heartbeats daily or almost daily, trembling of hands and voice, and jerking of muscles occurred statistically significantly more frequently among CHD patients than among controls. The CHD patients also reported more depressive mood according to Beck's inventory scores and poorer sleep and more frequent day-time sleepiness than controls. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis chest pain during anger or other kind of emotion (ORs 4. 12 and 3. 61) and dyspnoea (ORs 2. 33 and 3. 81) were the symptoms most associated with CHD. Conclusions Working-aged people with self-reported coronary heart disease evince a number of symptoms limiting the quality of their every day life. This aspect should be paid attention to when evaluating functional capacity of these patients. </p...|$|R

This layering of mechanisms makes it extremely difficult for researchers to extract the crucial pieces of information that would assist in a rational design of drugs with an improved therapeutic profile, i. e. a satisfying and maintained therapeutic response in the absence of the many incapacitating glucocorticoid-associated side effects, such as diabetes, osteoporosis, <b>muscle</b> wasting, <b>depression</b> etc. In direct correlation with increased glucocorticoid usage as observed in the clinic, the impetus and desire to reveal all of these mechanisms -and most importantly, to try to integrate them in a sensible manner for the sake of finding better alternatives- has never been stronger...|$|R
40|$|Clinical and {{pulmonary}} function changes {{induced by}} intravenous dichlorvos (2, 2 -dichlorvinyldimethyl phosphate) (DDVP) toxicosis, and reversibility {{of these changes}} after atropine treatment were investigated in six Friesian calves one to three months old. From one minute after dosage, all animals showed severe respiratory distress, excitation, weakness, muscle fasciculation and cholinesterase inhibition. Decrease in dynamic lung compliance and arterial oxygen tension and increase in total pulmonary resistance, viscous work of breathing and alveolar arterial oxygen gradient were highly significant (P less than 0. 01). On the other hand, body secretions, heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume and arterial carbon dioxide tension were not significantly affected by DDVP injection. Atropine promptly and completely reversed these changes, except for <b>muscle</b> fasciculations, central <b>depression</b> and cholinesterase inhibition which disappeared progressively within 24 hours.

40|$|Objective: to {{identify}} from a systematic literature review the main {{risk factors for}} falls among the elderly. Methods: the search in the databases was performed using the descriptors fall and elderly; were analyzed 51 articles published from 2005 to 2010, expressing on their resumes risk factors for falls in the elderly. Results: the main fall risk factors in the elderly are related to biological, behavioral, environmental and socioeconomic. Other factors identified were the <b>muscle</b> reduction, balance, <b>depression,</b> obstacles in the way, abuse, lack of handrails, crime {{and the history of}} falls. Conclusion: this study sought to provide a scientific north, not only to aid in the clinical assessment and, in turn, improve the care provided to those under-risk of falling at different levels of health care, more in any case, has its main focus on context of primary care...|$|R
