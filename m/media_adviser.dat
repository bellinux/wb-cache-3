In 1966 he became a <b>media</b> <b>adviser</b> to a television studio in Jordan, a role which ended after six weeks; the single broadcast of Aqwal al-Suhf in Jordan was met with consternation from the Jordanian royal government and after Qandil was notified of this disapproval, he immediately returned to Egypt where he continued presenting the program.

2500|$|Guided by <b>media</b> <b>adviser</b> Allen Callaghan, {{with whom}} he worked from 1971 to 1979, Bjelke-Petersen was an astute manager of news media. He made himself {{available}} to reporters and held daily press conferences where he [...] "fed the chooks". Callaghan released {{a steady stream of}} press releases, timing them to coincide with periods when news editors were most desperate for news. For most of Bjelke-Petersen's premiership, Queensland newspapers were supportive of his government, generally supporting the police and government on the street march issue, while Brisbane's Courier-Mail endorsed the return of the coalition government at every state election between 1957 and 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Troops under Prabowo's command {{kidnapped and}} {{tortured}} {{at least nine}} democracy activists {{in the months before}} the May 1998 Riots. In one testimony, a former detainee told of being tortured for days in an unidentified location, allegedly a military camp where most of their time was spent blindfolded, while being forced to answer repeated questions, mainly concerning their political activities. Abuse included being punched, terrorized physically and mentally, and given electric shocks. Later, in 2009, two of the nine men were candidates for Gerinda, Prabowo's political party, and another served as his <b>media</b> <b>adviser.</b> Prabowo was also suspected of organizing the 1997–98 activists kidnappings in Indonesia of another 13 activists (who all remain [...] "missing") between February 1997 and May 1998.|$|E
2500|$|On December 25, 2006, the United States {{arrested at}} least four senior {{military}} officials on their visit to Baghdad. It has been mentioned that the Iranians have been arrested after US soldiers raided the compound of Shiite leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the influential Shiite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). President of Iraq Talabani, a strong US ally, has asked for their release. Hiwa Othman, Talabani's <b>media</b> <b>adviser,</b> told Reuters: [...] "The president is unhappy. He is talking to the Americans about it as we speak." [...] Othman said the Iranian diplomats came to Iraq {{at the invitation of}} the Iraqi leader but he was not aware if they had met with him."The invitation was within the framework of an agreement between Iran and Iraq to improve the security situation." [...] Finally, it seems that they have been released on 30 December. One of the commanders, identified by officials simply as Chizari, was the third-highest-ranking official of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' al-Quds Brigade, the unit most active in aiding, arming and training groups outside Iran, including Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, U.S. officials said.|$|E

2500|$|As {{his victory}} at the {{convention}} on June 23, 1990, occurred {{on the same day}} that the Meech Lake accord died, Chrétien was heavily criticized in the Quebec media for his opposition to Meech Lake. Photographs of Chrétien embracing Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells, a prominent opponent of Meech at the convention attracted much negative comment in Quebec. His leadership was also shaken by the defection from the caucus of francophone MPs (and Martin loyalists) Jean Lapierre and Gilles Rocheleau, who claimed that they could not serve under the anti-Meech Chrétien and so left to join the newly founded Bloc Québécois. In a by-election for Laurier—Sainte-Marie on August 13, 1990, Chrétien's hand-picked candidate, Denis Coderre was badly defeated by the Bloc Québécoiss Gilles Duceppe, costing the Liberals a riding that they had held since the 1917 election; many attributed this to Chrétien's opposition to the Meech Lake Accord. Chrétien appeared indecisive in the Oka Crisis, having almost nothing to say about the stand-off at Oka for the first two months of the crisis, which began on July 11, 1990. When Chrétien finally did call a press conference about the Oka crisis on September 23, 1990, Chrétien declared that he could not answer certain questions about First Nations land claims because [...] "I'm not a lawyer", which prompted widespread ridicule as Chrétien had been a member of the Quebec Bar Association since 1958. The federal Liberals were disorganized and dropped in the polls from 50% in June 1990 to 32% in September. Upon becoming Liberal leader, Chrétien appointed his friend Eddie Goldenberg as his chief of staff, and formed a leadership team comprising John Rae and David Zussman as his policy advisors, his [...] "surrogate son" [...] Jean Carle as his special executive assistant, Warren Kinsella as his <b>media</b> <b>adviser,</b> and George Radwanski as his speech-writer. All of the Chrétien leadership team that was created in 1990 were later to play prominent roles in the omnipotent Prime Minister's Office (PMO) during Chrétien's time as Prime Minister.|$|E
2500|$|In December, the ISIS {{said that}} Iran had {{produced}} 425 kilograms of uranium, and that Iran had [...] "not yet achieved a break-out capability", but that Iran may {{be close to}} a break-out capability. In response to statements that Iran had enough material to make a weapon, the Arms Control Association urged the U.S. and the media to exhibit greater care when making claims about Iran's nuclear program. Ivan Oelrich and Ivanka Barzashka, from the Federation of American Scientists, said that the [...] "simplistic calculations" [...] contained in the ISIS article were wrong because [...] "just taking the quantity of LEU and multiplying by the U-235 concentration does not work because {{not all of the}} U-235 is recovered". Cheryl Rofer, a retired 35 year researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory and former president of the Los Alamos Committee on Arms Control and International Security, has argued that for Iran to make a bomb from this material it would need to kick all the inspectors out of the country, reconfigure thousands of closely watched centrifuges, and then engage in years of enrichment. According to the American Institute of Physics, the most difficult step in building a nuclear weapon is the production of fissile material. Iran has enriched uranium to [...] "less than 5%", consistent with fuel for a nuclear power plant and well below the purity of WEU (around 90%) typically used in a weapons program. HEU with a purity of 20% or more is usable in a weapon, but this route is less desirable because far more material is required to obtain critical mass. [...] "Our production of a nuclear energy program is completely within the framework or structure of international laws," [...] said Ali Akbar Javanfekr, <b>media</b> <b>adviser</b> to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. David Albright, president of the group which published the report, maintained that Iran's enriched uranium meant that Israel was losing control over the timing of Iran's nuclear activities and that even Iran pretending to have a bomb would be a threat. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its inspectors have not found evidence to suggest that Iran is attempting to process low-enriched uranium into weapons-grade uranium, but expressed concern that Iran was still refusing to comply with the United Nation's requirement of ending its uranium enrichment activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{professional}} {{relationship between}} political journalists and political <b>media</b> <b>advisers</b> – intermediaries {{between the public}} and their elected representatives – is complex and, because the stakes are high on multiple levels, filled with tension. Underpinning it all is trust: a dynamic that to be effective must work in both directions and is cyclically tested, broken and repaired. As part of a PhD research project, in-depth interviews with practitioners from two sides of political communication revealed that the absence or presence of trust is the foundation stone of the relationship. While the relationship is fostered in speed-of-lightning environments, the study revealed old-fashioned conventions buttress the trust framework, but circumstances dramatically affect it. It is found that political <b>media</b> <b>advisers</b> aim to be honest, but approach this indirectly, and that political journalists see little need for transparency about their work before it enters the public realm...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between journalists who report on political matters and political <b>media</b> <b>advisers</b> in common-law democracies is symbiotic but traditionally uneasy. Their interaction is accepted as necessary for each to communicate information to their shared target audience, but each seeks {{to control the}} message. The products of the relationship are deep and far-reaching, having been found to affect public perceptions of politicians, voting intentions, and public views of itself more broadly. Through semi-structured, in-depth interviews with <b>media</b> <b>advisers</b> and journalists at both state (provincial) and national levels, individuals revealed their perspectives on the multi-faceted relationship and {{their perceptions of the}} practices of the other party. They offered insights into their own professional roles, perceptions of power, and understanding of responsibilities. The study results have practical implications for each group’s understanding of the practices and frameworks of the other, and for society’s understanding of the groups’ functions and operations. It is professionally significant for each of the professions. Theoretical applications include contributing to the field of gatekeeping, fourth estate and agenda-setting theory...|$|R
