40|$|Dark channel prior (DCP) has {{advantages}} in image enhancement and image haze removal and is explored to detect highway visibility {{according to the}} physical relationship between transmittance and extinction coefficient. However, there are three major error sources in calculating transmittance. The first is that sky regions do not satisfy the assumptions of DCP algorithm. So the optimization algorithms combined with region growing and coefficient correction method are proposed. When extracting atmospheric brightness, different values lead to the second error. Therefore, according to different visibility conditions, a multimode classification method is designed. Image blocky effect causes the third error. Then guided image filtering is introduced to obtain accurate transmittance of each pixel of image. Next, according to the definition <b>meteorological</b> <b>optical</b> visual <b>range</b> {{and the relationship between}} transmittance and extinction coefficient of Lambert-Beer’s Law, accurate visibility value can be calculated. A comparative experimental system including visibility detector and video camera was set up to verify the accuracy of these optimization algorithms.

The results indicate that these detection visibility methods are feasible and reliable for the smooth operation of highways...|$|R

40|$|A record-breaking {{dust storm}} {{originating}} from desert regions in northern Syria and Iraq {{occurred over the}} eastern Mediterranean in September 2015. In this contribution {{of a series of}} two articles (part 1, observations; part 2, atmospheric modeling), we provide a comprehensive overview of the aerosol conditions during this extreme dust outbreak in the Cyprus region. These observations are based on satellite observations (MODIS, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and Ångström exponent, surface particle mass (PM 10) concentrations measured at four sites in Cyprus, visibility observations at three airports in southern Cyprus and corresponding conversion products (particle extinction coefficient, dust mass concentrations), EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network) lidar observations of dust vertical layering over Limassol, particle optical properties (backscatter, extinction, lidar ratio, linear depolarization ratio), and derived profiles of dust mass concentrations. Maximum 550  nm AOT exceeded values of 5. 0, according to MODIS, and the mass loads were correspondingly >[*]  10  g m − 2 over Larnaca and Limassol during the passage of an extremely dense dust front on 8  September 2015. Hourly mean PM 10 values were close to 8000  µg m − 3 and the observed <b>meteorological</b> <b>optical</b> <b>range</b> (visibility) was reduced to 300 – 750  m at Larnaca and Limassol. The visibility observations suggest peak values of the near-surface total suspended particle (TSP) extinction coefficients of 6000  Mm − 1 and thus TSP mass concentrations of 10   000  µg m − 3. The Raman polarization lidar observations mainly indicated a double layer structure of the dust plumes (reaching to about 4  km height), pointing to at least two different dust source regions. Dust particle extinction coefficients (532  nm) already exceeded 1000  Mm − 1 and the mass concentrations reached 2000  µg m − 3 in the elevated dust layers on 7  September, more than 12  h before the peak dust front on 8  September reached the Limassol lidar station around local noon. Typical Middle Eastern dust lidar ratios around 40  sr were observed in the dense dust plumes.

40|$|Visibility {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters for meteorological observation and numerical weather prediction (NWP). It is also an important factor in everyday life, mainly for surface and air traffic especially in the Aeronautical Meteorology. The visibility decides the taking off and landing of aircraft. If the airport visibility is lower than requirement for aircraft taking off stipulated by International Civil Aviation Administration, then the aircraft must be parked at the airport. So the accurate measurement of visibility is very important. Nowadays, many devices can be measured the visibility or <b>meteorological</b> <b>optical</b> <b>range</b> (MOR) such as Scatterometers, Transmissometers and visibility lidar. But there is not effective way to verify the accuracy of these devices expect the artificial visual method. We have developed a visibility testing system that can be calibration and verification these devices. The system consists of laser transmitter, optical chopper, phase-locking amplifier, the moving optic receiving system, signal detection and data acquisition system, atmospheric aerosol simulation chamber. All of them were placed in the atmosphere aerosol simulation chamber with uniform aerosol concentration. The Continuous wave laser, wavelength 550 nm, has been transmitted into the collimation system then the laser beam expanded into 40 mm diameter for compressing the laser divergence angle before modulated by optical chopper. The expanding beam transmitting in the atmosphere aerosol cabin received by the optic receiving system moving in the 50 m length precision guide with 100 mm optical aperture. The data of laser signal has been acquired by phase-locking amplifier every 5 meter range. So the 10 data points can be detected in the 50 meters guide once. The slope of the fitting curve can be obtained by linear fitting these data using the least square method. The laser extinction coefficient was calculated from the slope using the Koschmieder formula, then it been divided by 3 is MOR. The aerosol concentration in chamber can be changed by adjusting aerosol generator that producing variety of visibility atmospherical environment. The experiment has been carried out and the measurement accuracy of atmospheric transmittance is 0. 3 ‰ Corresponding to the accuracy of MOR 4. 9 % at the 2 km visibility environment. So this system can be calibrated and validated the other visibility measuring devices...|$|E
40|$|Losses of {{reflected}} Direct Normal Irradiance due to {{atmospheric extinction}} in concentrated solar tower plants can vary significantly with site and time. The losses {{of the direct}} normal irradiance between the heliostat field and receiver in a solar tower plant are mainly caused by atmospheric scattering and absorption by aerosol and water vapor concentration in the atmospheric boundary layer. Due to a high aerosol particle number, radiation losses can be significantly larger in desert environments compared to the standard atmospheric conditions which are usually considered in ray-tracing or plant optimization tools. Information about on-site atmospheric extinction is only rarely available. To measure these radiation losses, two different commercially available instruments were tested, and more than 19 months of measurements were collected and compared at the Plataforma Solar de Almería. Both instruments are primarily {{used to determine the}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>optical</b> <b>range</b> (MOR). The Vaisala FS 11 scatterometer is based on a monochromatic near-infrared light source emission and measures the strength of scattering processes in a small air volume mainly caused by aerosol particles. The Optec LPV 4 long-path visibility transmissometer determines the monochromatic attenuation between a light-emitting diode (LED) light source at 532 nm and a receiver and therefore also accounts for absorption processes. As the broadband solar attenuation is of interest for solar resource assessment for concentrated solar power (CSP), a correction procedure for these two instruments is developed and tested. This procedure includes a spectral correction of both instruments from monochromatic to broadband attenuation. That means the attenuation is corrected for the time-dependent solar spectrum which is reflected by the collector. Further, an absorption correction for the Vaisala FS 11 scatterometer is implemented. To optimize the absorption and broadband correction (ABC) procedure, additional measurement input of a nearby sun photometer is used to enhance on-site atmospheric assumptions for description of the atmosphere in the algorithm. Comparing both uncorrected and spectral- and absorption-corrected extinction data from 1 -year measurements at the Plataforma Solar de Almería, the mean difference between the scatterometer and the transmissometer is reduced from 4. 4 to 0. 57 %. Applying the ABC procedure without the usage of additional input data from a sun photometer still reduces the difference between both sensors to about 0. 8 %. Applying an expert guess assuming a standard aerosol profile for continental regions instead of additional sun photometer input results in a mean difference of 0. 8 %. Additionally, a simulation approach which just uses sun photometer and common meteorological data to determine the on-site atmospheric extinction at surface is presented and corrected FS 11 and LPV 4 measurements are validated with the simulation results. For T 1 km equal to 0. 9 and a 10 min time resolution, an uncertainty analysis showed that an absolute uncertainty of about 0. 038 is expected for the FS 11 and about 0. 057 for the LPV 4. Combining both uncertainties results in an overall absolute uncertainty of 0. 068 which justifies quite well the mean RMSE between both corrected data sets. For yearly averages several error influences average out and absolute uncertainties of 0. 020 and 0. 054 can be expected for the FS 11 and the LPV 4, respectively. Therefore, applying this new correction method, both instruments can now be utilized to sufficiently accurately determine the solar broadband extinction in tower plants...|$|E
