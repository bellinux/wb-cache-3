50|$|The process {{involves}} {{cycling the}} coupling {{a number of}} times at a lower inertia, lower speed or a combination of both. Burnishing can require anywhere from 20 to over 100 cycles depending upon the size of a coupling and the amount of initial torque required. For bearing mounted couplings, where the rotor and armature are connected and held in place via a bearing, burnishing does not have to take place on the machine. It can be done individually on a bench or in a group burnishing station. If a clutch has a separate armature and rotor (two piece unit) burnishing is done as a matched set, to make sure proper torque is achieved. Similarly, two-piece brakes that have separate armatures should be burnished on a machine rather than a bench because any change in the <b>mounting</b> <b>tolerance</b> as that brake is mounted to the machine may shift the alignment so the burnishing lines on the armature, rotor or brake face may be off, slightly preventing that brake from achieving full torque. Again, the difference is only slight so this would only be required in a very torque sensitive application.|$|E
30|$|The main {{relevant}} inaccuracy {{sources for}} the overall acquisition system are: (i) the inaccuracy of the robot in reproducing a selected target trajectory; (ii) the uncertainty associated to the laser displacement-sensors; (iii) the precision in assembling the support frame; (iv) {{the sensitivity of the}} assembly to environmental effects such as temperature and vibrations. The first two sources can be evaluated with Type-B uncertainty estimation approach via the manufacturer specifications. The effects of the third error source could be reduced and estimated by using additional knowledge on the <b>mounting</b> <b>tolerance.</b> In particular, the apparatus mounting inaccuracy, which affects the displacement measures with both systematic and predictable components, can be corrected by using additional geometrical references, acquired during the artwork laser scanning. The assembly sensitivity to temperature and vibrations, instead, cannot be modeled, and, therefore, this phenomenon has to be reduced as much as possible by strengthening the frame and reducing the robot speed at minimum.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a thru-reflect-line (TRL) {{calibration}} technique enabling full S-parameter characterisation for membrane circuits {{has been}} demonstrated in the WR- 03 waveguide band (220 to 325 GHz). The designed membrane TRL kit is packaged in E-plane split blocks. An improvement of beam lead to ground connection was utilized by recessing the block surface. The proposed calibration provides the reference planes right at device under tests, thus reduces an extra de-embedding step. Membrane circuits such as stub filter, thin film resistors, thin film capacitor were characterised by applying the presented method. The simulated and measured results agree well, showing the validity of this approach. Furthermore, the measurement uncertainties such as temperature variation, time drift, system noise, power level fluctuations, connection repeatability and assembly tolerance were systematically investigated. For the connection repeatability study, the amplitude response of transmission coefficient varies within +/-(0. 1) dB while that of reflection coefficient is below - 30 dB across the frequency band. In addition, {{the result of the}} membrane circuit is not sensitive to circuit <b>mounting</b> <b>tolerance.</b> These analysis prove that this technique is applicable in the WR- 03 band. However, it is also very crucial to have a setup with good cables because of the significant impact of the cables on the characterisation result...|$|E
40|$|High-precision {{positioning}} {{often requires}} high speed and high resolution displacement measurements {{in order to}} compensate for the small vibrations of critical components. The displacement sensor must be precise and stable {{over a long period of}} time to avoid expensive recalibration. This requires tight <b>mounting</b> <b>tolerances,</b> which are especially difficult to meet in inaccessible environments. The proposed sensor system is based on a capacitive sensor and consists of three subsystems: 1) a mechanical ``zoom-in'' system that performs self-alignment of the capacitive sensor electrode in order to reduce the <b>mounting</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the sensor; 2) a real-time capacitance-to-digital converter that employs an internal reference and electrical zoom-in technique to effectively reduce the dynamic range of the measured capacitance, thus improving the power efficiency; and 3) a self-calibration circuit that periodically calibrates the internal references to eliminate their drift. In previous publications, the three subsystems have been introduced. This paper shows how the different subsystems can be integrated to achieve optimal performance and presents new repeatability and stability measurement results. The overall system demonstrates a displacement measurement resolution of 65 pm (in terms of capacitance 65 aF) for a measurement time of 20 μs. Furthermore, the thermal drift of the sensor is within 6 ppm/K, owing to the self-calibration circuit. In measurement mode, the system consumes less than 16 mW.

40|$|To {{improve the}} speed {{measurement}} of construction equipment, different sensor technologies have been investigated. Many of these sensor technologies are very interesting {{but to keep}} {{the extent of the}} thesis only two was chosen for testing, magnetic absolute angle sensors using Hall and GMR technology, to investigate if those are a valid replacement for the current measurement system that is using a passive sensor. Tests show that these sensors are capable of speed measurement, but because of noisy angle estimates they need filtering for good speed computation. This filtering introduces a large time delay that is of significance for the quality of the estimate. A Kalman filter has been implemented in an attempt to lower the time delays but since only a very simple model has been used it does not give any improvements over ordinary low pass filtering. For these sensors the <b>mounting</b> <b>tolerance</b> is of great interest. For best performance the offset between the sensor and magnet centres need to be kept small for both sensors. This is due to a non-linearity effect this causes. The distance between the sensors and the magnet is not critical for linearity issues, but only for the quality of the signal, where it might drop out when the distance is too large. This is where the sensor using GMR technology stands out. Compared to the Hall technology sensor, the GMR sensor can handle distances that are more than 10 times larger. The conclusion is that these sensors can be a valid replacement of the current measurement system. They will introduce more functionality with the capability of detecting rotational direction and zero velocity. In an application with more than one sensor they can also be used for more purposes, like detecting slip in clutches etc. Depending on the application, the time delays may not be critical, else more work need to be done to improve the estimate, e. g. with a more advanced model for the Kalman filter. ...|$|E

The unit is well suited for lens undistortion and for stereo head rectification in embedded real-time systems. The proposed architecture has been realized on a prototyping system based on an Altera STRATIX EP 1 S 60 FPGA resulting in a performance of 35 frames per second for a 1024 × 1024 pixels input image. 2. INDRODUCTION Modern applications such as robot assembling automation, upcoming mobile robot platforms for homes, and car safety features require both, 3 D perception and object classification, for navigation and object manipulation [9]. Real-time performance of approximately 30 frames per second is mandatory and a very critical design issue. Em-bedded stereo vision sensors, consisting of a sensor head and a calculation unit, are very well suited for stereoscopic perception but require huge computational effort. Due to <b>mounting</b> <b>tolerances</b> within the sensor head, resulting in a maximum relative shift and revolution of these two camera images, rectification is absolutely necessary to reduce the matching effort. In our employed method it is done by applying a remap with offline calculated coefficients.

40|$|Today, {{handling}} and assembly of flexible micro-components such as thin wires or glass fibres with diameters {{down to a}} few micrometers and lateral dimensions up to a few meters is an important challenge in hybrid micro-assembly (Brecher and Peschke 2004). Production of flow sensors for respirators in medical engineering or coupling a fibre to an active visual component in optical data communication are examples of such applications. Such products {{have one thing in}} common: The assembly of their most sensitive functional components is often carried out manually since the {{handling and}} positioning technology either has to be specially developed and is costly or is non-existent (Weck and Peschke 2003). However, in most cases the manual assembly is very time consuming and its repeatability and positioning accuracy is not adequate (Carrozza et al. 2000); Petersen (2003). This disadvantage is obvious especially in the assembly of hybrid micro-optical telecommunication systems such as switches or power splitters, because the required <b>mounting</b> <b>tolerances</b> are less than a micron. A deviation of 100 nm in the alignment between the optical components and the glass fibres leads to noticeable and non-tolerable losses when coupling light into the fibres. With this background, fundamental studies are carried out at Fraunhofer IPT for the optimization of gripper geometry, gripper materials and gripping parameters for handling flexible micro-components such as glass fibres. The aim of these studies, shown in chapter 2 of this paper, is primarily to investigate the effects on the reproducibility of the positioning when gripping these highly sensitive micro-components and to derive gripper optimization strategies. A further aim is to develop a large scale integrated, adaptive, rugged and economical gripper system particularly for handling and alignment of flexible micro-components accurate to the sub-micron level. This gripper system can be used on conventional robot systems for carrying out micro-assembly operations. The robot system carries out the pre-positioning, the positioning tolerances necessary for the micro-assembly are subsequently realised directly {{at the tip of the}} gripper with a multi-axes system integrated into the gripper. Positioning systems that achieve the required positioning increments in the sub-micron range are existent (Scheller 2001). The problem of such systems is that they are normally highly sensitive against mechanical impact. Also their gripper integration is problematical due to a high weight and size dimensions in the decimetre range for each axis. In this paper the development of a highly robust gripper-integrable multi-axes system is presented...|$|R
40|$|Sliding {{lip seals}} {{are used in}} {{pneumatic}} cylinders to prevent leakage past the piston and rod. Though they guarantee excellent sealing, the friction forces at contact between lip and counterpart can be relatively high. This results in energy losses and problems with wear on components in relative motion, as well as difficulties in controlling actuator positioning. Standards for compressed air cleanliness restrict the use of greases and lubricants, especially in applications such as the food processing and pharmaceutical industries. A number of studies are thus under way {{in order to find}} effective alternatives to the use of common lubricants. These studies address both seal configuration [1 - 4], and the use of innovative materials [5 - 7]. Other approaches employ systems permitting small amounts of air leakage that operate as lubricated supports, variable-profile pistons [8], or rings with special micromachined surfaces [9 - 10]. Such solutions are not always economical, both because they require precision tolerances and geometries, and because they use special seals, often produced ad hoc. This paper discusses the possibility of using commercial lip seals with a non-conventional mounting on the piston in order to obtain a simple controlled-leakage system that reduces friction forces in pneumatic cylinders economically and effectively. The non-conventional mounting consists of positioning the lip seal in the direction opposite to that used in a conventional installation, so that the contact pressure reduces as air pressure in the chamber rises. In this way, an air gap is created at the sliding interface which allows air in the pressurized chamber to escape past the seal lip, thus reducing the contact force on the barrel. The piston is provided with a hole which exhausts the leakage flow to the atmosphere. To evaluate the validity of this approach, a number of preliminary tests were carried out in [11] to measure flow rate on a type of spring-loaded lip seal consisting of graphite-filled PTFE for barrel diameters of 50 mm. In particular, the tests determined air leakage behavior for different <b>mounting</b> <b>tolerances.</b> This paper presents further tests conducted on the same samples examined in [11] and on another PTFE and graphite-filled PTFE configuration, measuring leakage flow rates and friction forces. Leakage flow rate measurements were carried out with single and double seal installations.

40|$|The {{foodborne}} pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has {{the ability}} to survive and grow under a wide range of adverse conditions encountered both in food, processing environment and during the host passage. Listeriosis outbreaks are often associated with the ingestion of contaminated dairy products, mainly soft cheese. During cheese manufacturing this pathogen can experience sublethal stresses such as low pH and high salt content, which may induce tolerance responses and potentially increase its survival during gastrointestinal passage. The present study aimed to: a) evaluate how two dairy isolates <b>mount</b> their <b>tolerance</b> responses to a sublethal pH and salt content in a defined medium; b) investigate the impact of low pH and salt adaptation in a cheese-simulated medium on the survival of cheese and dairy isolates during gastric stress and ultimately c) determine the influence of low pH and salt adaptation in a cheese-based medium on the survival of cheese and dairy isolates during gastrointestinal stress. The intracellular proteomes of adapted (pH 5. 5 and 3. 5 % (w/v) NaCl) and non-adapted cultures (pH 7. 0, no NaCl added) were evaluated via 2 -DE gel electrophoresis. In the defined medium acid and salt tolerance were different. All strains were able to successfully survive the gastric and the gastrointestinal challenge and both adapted and non-adapted cells were equally able (P> 0. 05) to overcome the gastric and the gastrointestinal stress.

The study was carried out in five villages in western Niger: Falmado, Seberi and Libore (single S. haematobium infection foci), and Diambala and Namarigoungou (mixed S. haematobium-S. mansoni infection foci). Parasitological examinations consisted of triplicate urine filtrations and triplicate Kato-Katz thick smears at each visit. Two 40 mg/kg oral doses of PZQ were administered 3 weeks apart. Adverse events were monitored within 4 h after dosing by the survey team and 24 h after treatment using a questionnaire. Our final study cohort comprised 877 children who were infected with either S. haematobium, or S. mansoni, or both species concurrently and received both doses of PZQ. Follow-up visits were conducted 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after the first dose of PZQ. At baseline, the geometric mean (GM) infection intensity of S. haematobium ranged from 3. 6 (Diambala) to 30. 3 eggs/ 10 ml of urine (Falmado). The GM infection intensity of S. mansoni ranged from 86. 7 (Diambala) to 151. 4 eggs/g of stool (Namarigoungou). Adverse events were reported by 33. 0 % and 1. 5 % of the children after the first and second doses of PZQ, respectively. We found cure rates (CRs) in S. haematobium-infected children 3 weeks after the second dose of PZQ ranging between 49. 2 % (Falmado) and 98. 4 % (Namarigoungou) and moderate-to-high egg reduction rates (ERRs) (71. 4 - 100 %). Regarding S. mansoni, only moderate CRs and ERRs were found (51. 7 - 58. 8 % in Diambala, 55. 2 - 60. 2 % in Namarigoungou).

During an expedition to <b>Mount</b> Kilimanjaro, the <b>tolerance</b> for strenuous physical activity and high-altitude of organ transplant recipients after various types of transplantation was compared to non-transplanted controls. Methods Twelve organ transplant recipients were selected to participate (2 heart-, 2 lung-, 2 kidney-, 4 liver-, 1 allogeneic stem cell-and 1 small bowel-transplantation). Controls comprised {{the members of the}} medical team and accompanying family members (n = 14).

Eight transplant participants (73 %) and thirteen controls (93 %) reached the summit (5895 m). Cardiopulmonary parameters and altitude sickness scores demonstrated no differences between transplant participants and controls. Signs of hyperventilation were more pronounced in transplant participants and adaptation to high-altitude was less effective, which was related to a decreased renal function.

Functional recovery after transplantation is not as good as expected. However, higher levels of physical activity after transplantation are associated with better outcomes. This thesis showed that less than 60 % of transplant recipients complied to the physical activity guidelines. A higher level of physical activity was associated with better survival after kidney transplantation, independent of cardiac damage. Cardiac damage was, however, a intermediate step in the association. Peripheral muscle strength showed to be an important predictor of exercise capacity after lung transplantation, interventions around six months after transplantation are needed to improve exercise capacity. Qualitative and quantitative studies into barriers and motivators to physical activity after transplantation showed that most factors are comparable to those in the general population. Specific factors for transplant recipients were care for the new organ, medication side-effects, and expertise of personnel. In intervention development physical limitation, fear of negative effects, low expectations and self-confidence, and exercise self-efficacy should be taken into account. During an expedition to <b>Mount</b> Kilimanjaro the <b>tolerance</b> to strenuous physical activity after transplantation was studied; this was comparable for carefully selected recipients and controls. Despite of the large variety in physical activity level after transplantation a substantial part of recipients do not fulfill the physical activity guidelines.

In nature, S. typhimurium can experience and survive dramatic acid stresses that occur in diverse ecological niches ranging from pond water to phagolysosomes. However, in vitro the organism is very sensitive to acid. To provide an explanation for how this organism survives acid in natural environments, the adaptive ability of S. typhimurium to become acid tolerant was tested. Logarithmically grown cells (pH 7. 6) shifted to mild acid (pH 5. 8) for one doubling as an adaptive procedure were 100 to 1, 000 times more resistant to subsequent strong acid challenge (pH 3. 3) than were unadapted cells shifted directly from pH 7. 6 to 3. 3. This acidification tolerance response required protein synthesis and appears to be a specific defense mechanism for acid. No cross protection was noted for hydrogen peroxide, SOS, or heat shock. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of acid-regulated polypeptides revealed 18 proteins with altered expression, 6 of which were repressed while 12 were induced by mild acid shifts. An avirulent phoP mutant was 1, 000 -fold more sensitive to acid than its virulent phoP+ parent, suggesting a correlation between acid tolerance and virulence. The Mg 2 (+) -dependent proton-translocating ATPase was also found {{to play an important role}} in acid tolerance.
