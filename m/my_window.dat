Early during her performance, her microphone failed, leaving Etheridge to play her guitar without singing while an alternate mic was found. Famously, the audience, made up largely {{of members of}} the New York City fire and police departments (and survivors of NYPD and FDNY personnel who were lost in the attacks) sang the lyrics themselves until Etheridge's mic was restored.|$|E
25|$|Meantime, I {{had found}} me {{quarters}} in Villiers Street, Strand, which forty-six {{years ago was}} primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small, not over-clean or well-kept, but from my desk I could look out of <b>my</b> <b>window</b> through the fanlight of Gatti's Music-Hall entrance, across the street, almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side, the boom of the Strand on the other, while, before my windows, Father Thames under the Shot tower {{walked up and down}} with his traffic.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1970s, Van Zandt {{split from}} his {{longtime}} manager, Kevin Eggers. He {{found a new}} manager, John Lomax III (grandson of the famed folk music historian John Lomax), who set up a fan club for Van Zandt. Though the club was only advertised through small ads {{in the back of}} music magazines, Lomax immediately began to receive hundreds of impassioned letters from around the world written by people who felt touched by Van Zandt. Some of the letters described how his material often served as a crutch for those who were dealing with depression. In 1978, the singer fired Lomax and re-hired Eggers. He soon signed with Eggers' new label, Tomato Records. The following year, he recorded Flyin' Shoes; he would not release another album until 1987's At <b>My</b> <b>Window.</b> Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s. For much of the 1970s, he lived a reclusive life outside of Nashville in a tin-roofed, bare-boards shack with no heat, plumbing or telephone, occasionally appearing in town to play shows.|$|E

500|$|Gulfton {{includes}} several scattered areas {{of commercial and}} light industrial properties. Gulfton gained {{a large number of}} immigrants in the mid-1980s and the regional economy could not support the increasing pressure of the new workers. This led to higher unemployment rates and families tended to [...] "double-up" [...] housing, where multiple families shared the same unit to reduce family expenditures. Scott Van Beck, head of the Houston Independent School District's West Region in the Gulfton area, stated in a 2006 keynote address to the Rotary Club of Bellaire, [...] "When I look out <b>my</b> <b>window</b> on Chimney Rock, I don't see big corporations; I see Gulfton; I see mom and pop businesses." [...] The Houston Metropolitan Chamber, previously the Greater Southwest Houston Chamber of Commerce, provides economic assistance in Gulfton.|$|E

2500|$|... "One evening, passing my living-room window, I heard Graham's name flung upward {{from the}} street below. I leaned out to see. A very fiery young man was making a speech from a soapbox on the corner. A little knot of men, women, and {{children}} had collected about him. He was pointing up at <b>my</b> <b>window</b> — at me. He was saying things about us. I strained to hear... 'Municipal Ownership is no solution,' he cried, 'so long as the propertied classes own the municipalities. J.G.

2500|$|Grand Duke George {{wrote to}} his wife in England, “We were each given a cell, and later on were joined by Dmitry.

He informed that they were guarded, by soldiers from the Baltic provinces. [...] “They treat us like comrades, and have not locked our cells after the second day, while they allow us to walk in the small garden in the courtyard. Our food is brought from outside. ” [...] While imprisoned, rumors of the tsar's assassination reached them; this seemed to indicate the worst and Grand Duke George was, of the three Grand Dukes, the more pessimistic. On 21 July, all of the exiled Grand Dukes in Vologda were again transferred back to Petrograd. In the former Imperial capital, the men were quickly imprisoned with six other detainees in a cell at Cheka Headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|Van Zandt {{has been}} {{referred}} to as a cult musician and [...] "a songwriter's songwriter." [...] Musician Steve Earle, who met him in 1978 and considered Van Zandt a mentor, once called Van Zandt [...] "the best songwriter in the whole world and I'll stand on Bob Dylan's coffee table in my cowboy boots and say that." [...] The quote was printed on a sticker featured on the packing of At <b>My</b> <b>Window,</b> much to Van Zandt's displeasure. In the years following, the quote was often cited by the press, much to Van Zandt and Earle's embarrassment; in 2009, Earle told the New York Times, [...] "Did I ever believe that Townes was better than Bob Dylan? No." [...] But he later concluded {{at the end of the}} same article that, [...] "As a songwriter, you won't find anybody better." [...] Earle has championed the songwriter on a number of occasions: his eldest son, Justin Townes Earle, also a musician, is named after Van Zandt. Earle wrote the song [...] "Fort Worth Blues" [...] as a tribute to the singer in the late 1990s, and in 2009 released an album titled Townes, which featured all covers of Van Zandt songs.|$|E

2500|$|He {{began and}} {{finished}} {{composition of the}} Symphonie fantastique in 1830, a work which would bring Berlioz much fame and notoriety. He entered into a relationship with– and subsequently became engaged to– Marie Moke, despite the symphony being inspired by Berlioz's obsession with Harriet Smithson. As his fourth cantata for submittal to the Prix de Rome neared completion, the July Revolution began. [...] "I was finishing my cantata when the revolution broke out," [...] he recorded in his Mémoires. [...] "I dashed off the final pages of my orchestral score {{to the sound of}} stray bullets coming over the roofs and pattering on the wall outside <b>my</b> <b>window.</b> On the 29th I had finished, and was free to go out and roam about Paris till morning, pistol in hand." [...] He finally won the prize with the cantata Sardanapale. He also arranged the French national anthem La Marseillaise and composed an overture to Shakespeare's The Tempest, which was the first of his pieces to play at the Paris Opéra. An hour before the performance, a sudden storm created the worst rain in Paris in 50 years, meaning the performance was almost deserted. Berlioz met Franz Liszt who was also attending the concert. This proved to {{be the beginning of a}} long friendship. Liszt would later transcribe the entire Symphonie fantastique for piano to enable more people to hear it.|$|E
