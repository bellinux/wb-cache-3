40|$|Anthropometry is {{a science}} which object is the {{measurement}} of the human figure, its shape and proportions. Traditional tools used in it are the <b>measure</b> <b>tape,</b> the anthropometer, the calliper etc. In 1988, for an anthropometric study, carried out on the US military staff, all the measurements of only one person required four hours to be taken. Nowadays, this takes {{less than a minute}} due to the contemporary science and 3 D laser scanners. How did the tailors in the past make garments without scanners, anthropometric studies or even without a tape measure with the well-known today centimetres or inches? What did they use as a basis? The answers of these questions are the aim of this study. It will examine the canons for human body proportions in the artists’ art in Ancient Egypt, The Antiquity and The Renaissance which set off the beginning of the systems for garment construction...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{establish}} {{the effect of}} preventive measures and assert the optimal prevention strategy for acute lateral ligament injury to the ankle. Methods: An electronic literature search was employed to look for published randomised controlled trials, a controlled trials or time interventions containing research questions regarding the prevention of lateral ankle ligament injuries. Two reviewers reviewed relevant studies for strengths and weaknesses in design and methodology, according to a standardised set of predefi ned criteria. A total of 24 relevant studies met the criteria for inclusion and were analysed. Results Overall taping, bracing and neuromuscular training were all effective {{for the prevention of}} anklesprain recurrences. The RRs of these prophylactic measures are of similar magnitude, ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 5 when compared with control groups. Although preventive effects have been reported in a general athletic population, evidence suggests this overall effect is due to a strong preventive effect in previously injured athletes and that any effect on fresh ankle sprains is either non-existent or very low. Conclusions Based on these outcomes, a combination of an external prophylactic <b>measure</b> (<b>tape</b> or brace) with neuromuscular training will achieve the best preventive outcomes with minimal burden for the athlete...|$|E

40|$|Since {{a century}} cosmic rays {{are based on}} direct cosmic {{particle}} detection in space (below PeV) or on secondary downward vertical airshowers (above TeVs). We consider the guaranteed physics of horizontal (hadron) air-showers, HAS, developing at high (30 − 40) km altitudes, above and below these energy windows. Their morphology and information traces are different from vertical ones. Hundreds of km long HAS are often split by geomagnetic fields in a long (fan-like) showering with a twin spiral tail. The horizontal fan-like airshowers are really tangent and horizontal only at North and South poles. At different latitude their showering plane are turned and inclined by geomagnetic fields. In particular at magnetic equator such tangent horizontal East-West airshowers are bent and developed into a vertical fan air-shower, easily detectable by a vertical array detector (hanging elements by gravity). Such medusa arrays maybe composed by inflated floating balloons chains. The light gas float and it acts as an calorimeter for the particles, while it partially sustains the detector weight. Vertically hanging chains as well as rubber doughnut balloons (whose interior may record Cherenkov lights) reveal bundles of crossing electron pairs. Even in space orbit such vertical array may hang by tiny tidal forces within huge balloon arrays, while brought in locus by an extendable <b>measure</b> <b>tape.</b> Possibly located around Space Station in synerg...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: VHND {{session is}} a great {{opportunity}} for reaching to pregnant women and children less than 5 years of age. Objective {{of the study was to}} assess the status of logistics availability on Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) in rural areas of Tapi district and Surat city areas. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted during September 2013 to February 2014. Out of 28 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) of Tapi district 9 were selected and out of 40 Urban Health Centres (UHCs) of Surat City, 16 were selected by random number table. Checklist of essential logistics for VHND was prepared and used to collect the data. Results: Logistics used during Antenatal care like sphygmomanometer, stethoscope, examination table, <b>measure</b> <b>tape</b> and adult weighing scale were available at more VHND session in rural areas compared to urban session sites. Medications like iron folic acid tablets, paracetamol tablets and calcium tablets were present in more than three forth of the session at both urban as well as rural areas. Availability of Zinc tablets and cotrimoxazole tablets were very poor in urban area in contrary to rural area where they were available at almost all VHND session. Overall, logistics availability was better at rural VHND sessions in comparison to urban sessions. Conclusion: Logistics availability was poor in urban area compared to rural area. Reasons behind the same need to be explored and appropriate corrective measures need to be taken which might help to improve services provided during VHND sessions.

40|$|Lateral tape motion (LTM) is {{the motion}} of a tape {{perpendicular}} to the tape transport direction. It {{is a problem in}} magnetic tape recording technology that limits the track density on a tape. To reduce LTM, it is important to characterize the main sources of LTM in tape transports. In this dissertation, the effect of tape edge contact as well as tape tension transients on LTM is investigated. An optical non-contact tension sensor is developed and a correlation between LTM and tension transients is observed. Additionally, a method based on acoustic emission is established to <b>measure</b> <b>tape</b> edge contact. Tape edge contact is observed to cause high frequency LTM, and the magnitude of the impact is shown to be function of the tape pack size. The dynamics of a tape as it moves over a cylindrical guide are studied theoretically and validated experimentally. Good agreement between theory and experiments is observed. In the experimental analysis, the tape/guide friction coefficient is observed to be function of different operating and design parameters. A model for the friction coefficient between a tape and a cylindrical guide is presented and evaluated with experimental data. Finally, the use of laser surface texturing (LST) for improved tape guiding is proposed and investigated both experimentally and numerically. LST guides are observed to create an air bearing at low tape speeds and thus reduce the transition speed between boundary lubrication and full fluid lubrication. Additionally, the design of a dual stage actuator tape head for increased bandwidth track-following is introduced, as a means to enable increased track density on a tape for future high performance tape drive...|$|E

40|$|Trabajo presentado en la EGU General Assembly 2014 (European Geosciences Union), celebrada en Viena del 27 de abril al 2 de mayo de 2014. Long term {{soil erosion}} studies imply {{substantial}} efforts, particularly {{when there is}} the need to maintain continuous measurements. There are high costs associated to maintenance of field equipment keeping and quality control of data collection. Energy supply and/or electronic failures, vandalism and burglary are common causes of gaps in datasets, reducing their reach in many cases. In this work, a system of three video-cameras, a recorder and a transmission modem (3 G technology) has been set up in a gauging station where rainfall, runoff flow and sediment concentration are monitored. The gauging station is located in the outlet of an olive orchard catchment of 6. 4 ha. Rainfall is measured with one automatic raingauge that records intensity at one minute intervals. The discharge is measured by a flume of critical flow depth, where the water is recorded by an ultrasonic sensor. When the water level rises to a predetermined level, the automatic sampler turns on and fills a bottle at different intervals according to a program depending on the antecedent precipitation. A data logger controls the instruments’ functions and records the data. The purpose of the video-camera system is {{to improve the quality of}} the dataset by i) the visual analysis of the measurement conditions of flow into the flume; ii) the optimisation of the sampling programs. The cameras are positioned to record the flow at the approximation and the gorge of the flume. In order to contrast the values of ultrasonic sensor, there is a third camera recording the flow level close to a <b>measure</b> <b>tape.</b> This system is activated when the ultrasonic sensor detects a height threshold, equivalent to an electric intensity level. Thus, only when there is enough flow, video-cameras record the event. This simplifies post-processing and reduces the cost of download of recordings. The preliminary contrast analysis will be presented as well as the main improvements in the sample program. N...|$|E
