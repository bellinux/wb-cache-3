5|$|Anti-vitamins are {{chemical}} compounds that inhibit the absorption or actions of vitamins. For example, avidin is a protein in raw egg whites that inhibits {{the absorption of}} biotin; it is deactivated by cooking. Pyrithiamine, a synthetic compound, has a <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> similar to thiamine, vitamin B1, and inhibits the enzymes that use thiamine.|$|E

5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E

25|$|Since organic chemists are {{particularly}} interested in <b>molecular</b> <b>structures,</b> it might be useful {{to be able to}} single out individual molecular units interactively from the drawing. Organic molecular units need to be given both as 2D structural formulae and full 3D <b>molecular</b> <b>structures.</b> Molecules on special-symmetry positions need to be reconstructed from the asymmetric unit. Protein crystallographers are interested in <b>molecular</b> <b>structures</b> of biological macromolecules, so that provisions need to be made to be able to represent molecular subunits as helices, sheets, or coils, respectively.|$|R

5|$|On {{the planet}} Krypton, using {{evidence}} {{provided to the}} Council by scientist Jor-El, the attempted insurrectionists General Zod, Ursa, and Non are sentenced to the Phantom Zone. For this, Zod swears revenge on Jor-El and his family. Jor-El, despite his eminence, is unable to convince the Council that Krypton will soon be destroyed when its red supergiant sun goes supernova. To save his infant son, Kal-El, Jor-El launches him in a spaceship to Earth, a planet with a suitable atmosphere where Kal-El's dense <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> will give him superhuman powers. Shortly after the launch, Krypton's sun explodes, destroying the planet.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{a technique}} used for determining the atomic and <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E
5|$|After World War II {{work on the}} {{synthesis}} of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed {{a better understanding of}} how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book <b>Molecular</b> <b>Structure</b> and the Properties of Liquid Crystals became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world’s top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E
5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As {{a result of}} the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic <b>molecular</b> <b>structure.</b> The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2°C and boils at 58.8°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital. The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195°C is pale yellow.|$|E

Although there are usually energetic reasons why a <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> results such that it does not exhibit partly filled orbitals (i.e. unpaired spins), some non-closed shell moieties do occur in nature. Molecular oxygen is a good example. Even in the frozen solid it contains di-radical molecules resulting in paramagnetic behavior. The unpaired spins reside in orbitals derived from oxygen p wave functions, but the overlap is limited to the one neighbor in the O2 molecules. The distances to other oxygen atoms in the lattice remain too large to lead to delocalization and the magnetic moments remain unpaired.|$|E
