The selection earned praise from the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations, but was not well received by business groups and the anti-union group Center for Union Facts. The official announcement was made by Obama on December 19. Solis's successor was chosen in a special election in California's 32nd congressional district; she declined to endorse a candidate in the primary (from which her past <b>mentee</b> Judy Chu emerged on top and eventually won the general election).|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters) {{have gotten}} back {{together}} after Dennis {{was the only}} person who remembered her birthday. Disturbed by Liz's acceptance of mediocrity, her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), tries to reform her into someone who enjoys the good life. He refers Liz to the fanciest restaurant in the city, Stone. Nevertheless, Liz declines Jack's offer to be her mentor. That night at Stone, Jack and his date walk by Liz and Dennis's table, with Jack very unimpressed by Dennis's manners. The following day, Jack introduces Liz to a former <b>mentee</b> of his, Howard Jorgensen (Brian Stack). At lunch the next day, Liz realizes she is frustrated with her relationship with Dennis, then she storms off to Jack's office to ask for help. Jack motivates Liz to end it with him. Liz comes home to break up with Dennis, only to find him distraught after a loss of his favorite hockey team, the New York Islanders. As a result, Dennis moves in with her.|$|E

Study participants attended a Western New York school district including 20 mentors from grades 9 to 12, and 16 <b>mentees</b> from grades 4 to 6.

Dissimilar personality matched <b>mentees</b> had mixed results with improvements in grade average and school attendance, but declines in social connectedness.

Georgescu accepted the offer and moved to Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tennessee in 1949. It {{has been argued that}} Georgescu's decision to move from Harvard to the permanence and stability of the less prestigious Vanderbilt was motivated by his precarious wartime experiences and his feeling of insecurity as a political refugee in his new country. It has also been argued that Joseph Schumpeter had at this point lost most of his former influence that could have secured his once <b>mentee</b> Georgescu a permanent position at Harvard (Schumpeter died in 1950). Georgescu remained at Vanderbilt until his retirement in 1976 at age 70. Except for short trips, he would never leave Nashville again.|$|E

In 2013, 11 of the 23 <b>mentees</b> passed all six vocational modules, and only 6 students failed in 2 or more modules. In {{the focus group}} interviews, almost all <b>mentees</b> appreciated the mentors’ efforts in the program and agreed that the program was useful to them. Mentors could help them to understand basic concepts {{so that they could}} catch up with the curriculum and be more confident when facing examinations. <b>Mentees</b> found that both group tutoring and a collaborative learning model were effective. This finding is in agreement with the concept of the learning community, which helps to build up individual knowledge [2]. Most mentors agreed that they had helped the <b>mentees</b> to participate in the program. The program also provided an opportunity for mentors to apply what they had learnt in the past and consolidate their knowledge. Friendship amongst the mentors and <b>mentees</b> was also built in the program.|$|R

On the other hand, <b>mentees</b> more often reported concerns {{having to do with}} meeting the requirements of the mentoring program, such as finding mutually acceptable times to meet. This highlights the differences in roles between the two parties and how they perceived the relationships. <b>Mentees</b> perceive their role as participants, and when filling out the reports, are in the mindset of fulfilling the requirements.

The <b>mentees</b> view their role as participants in the program and report upon the rapport they experience with their mentor {{and their ability to}} meet the program requirements. The mentors are much more reflective about their relationships and are in tune with the struggles facing their <b>mentees.</b>|$|R

Daly argues that this steady-state economy is both necessary and desirable in order to keep human environmental impact within biophysical limits (however defined), and to create more allocational fairness between present and future generations with regard to mineral resource use.

Feedback from both mentors and <b>mentees</b> regarding the program was largely positive, and a measure of success was that 45 % of both mentors and <b>mentees</b> wished to continue the relationship with mentoring partners after the completion of mentoring requirements. Mentors and mentors were highly positive about the value of mentoring, for <b>mentees</b> particularly in regard to increasing information about the university and for mentors the value of the mentoring relationship. The challenges of embedding the mentoring program in a business course included the short duration of the mentoring and the lack of commitment from some volunteer <b>mentees.</b> We conclude with recommendations for further research to explore the efficacy of conscripted mentors compared with volunteer mentors.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationships between specific gender combinations of mentor-mentee and distinct mentoring functions. Design/methodology/approach - Of the 500 participants, 272 were <b>mentees</b> and 228 were mentors from public- and private-sector organisations, representing all four gender combinations of mentor-mentee. Participants completed a 36 -item measure of mentoring functions. Findings - Hierarchical regression analyses revealed few significant relationships between gender and mentoring functions. As far as <b>mentees</b> were concerned, female mentors provided personal and emotional guidance to a greater extent than male mentors; female mentors provided career development facilitation to a greater extent than male mentors and female <b>mentees</b> were provided with career development facilitation to a greater extent than male mentees; also female <b>mentees</b> were provided with role modelling to a greater extent than male <b>mentees.</b> As far as mentors were concerned, there were no significant differences in the functions provided to female and male <b>mentees.</b> Research limitations/implications - The study emphasized the need to use measurement tools that examine distinct, rather than categories of, mentoring functions. The findings also suggest that gender may not be as influential, with regard to mentoring functions, as has previously been proffered. Knowledge about the relationships between gender and particular mentoring functions may be beneficial for potential and actual <b>mentees</b> and mentors as they make decisions about becoming involved in mentoring relationships, engage in contracting processes, and monitor and review their relationships.
