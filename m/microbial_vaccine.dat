30|$|Undoubtedly, {{the science}} of {{genomics}} has tremendous potential for improving human health. The World Health Organization [WHO] has recently made several recommendations for the scope and application of genomics on global health (WHO 2002). It is acknowledged that the information generated by genomics will provide major benefits in the prevention, diagnosis and management of communicable and genetic diseases {{as well as other}} common medical diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and mental illnesses (Cardon and Bell 2001). Together these constitute a major health burden, as reflected in chronic ill-health and mortality. In addition, a number of infectious diseases are associated with genomic mutations manifesting in the form of increased susceptibility, clinical severity, favorable and unfavorable response to anti-microbial therapy and in conferring protection. It is possible that the protective effect of a <b>microbial</b> <b>vaccine</b> might be influenced by genomic variation.|$|E
40|$|Factor H binding protein (FHbp) is a {{virulence}} factor used by meningococci {{to evade}} the host complement system. FHbp elicits bactericidal antibodies in humans and is part of two recently licensed vaccines. Using human complement Factor H (FH) transgenic mice, we previously showed that binding of FH decreased the protective antibody responses to FHbp vaccination. Therefore, {{in the present study}} we devised a library-based method to identify mutant FHbp antigens with very low binding of FH. Using an FHbp sequence variant in one of the two licensed vaccines, we displayed an error-prone PCR mutant FHbp library on the surface of Escherichia coli. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate FHbp mutants with very low binding of human FH and preserved binding of control anti-FHbp monoclonal antibodies. We sequenced the gene encoding FHbp from selected clones and introduced the mutations into a soluble FHbp construct. Using this approach, we identified several new mutant FHbp vaccine antigens that had very low binding of FH as measured by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. The new mutant FHbp antigens elicited protective antibody responses in human FH transgenic mice that were up to 20 -fold higher than those elicited by the wild-type FHbp antigen. This approach offers the potential to discover mutant antigens that might not be predictable even with protein structural information and potentially can be applied to other <b>microbial</b> <b>vaccine</b> antigens that bind host proteins...|$|E
40|$|Mycobacteria expressing {{recombinant}} antigens {{are already}} being developed as vaccines against both infections and tumors. Little is known about how dendritic cells might process such antigens. Two different mycobacterial species, the fast-growing Mycobacterium smegmatis and the slow-growing M. bovis M. bovis BCG, were engineered to express a model tumor antigen, the Kb-restricted dominant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope OVA 257 - 264. Recombinant M. bovis BCG but not recombinant M. smegmatis conferred protection to mice challenged with the B 16 -OVA tumor cell line. We went on to investigate whether the contrast in antitumor efficacy {{could be due to}} differences in how dendritic cells process antigen from the two mycobacterial strains for class I presentation. Both strains of mycobacteria caused phenotypic maturation of dendritic cells, but recombinant M. smegmatis infection led to a greater degree of dendritic cell maturation than recombinant M. bovis BCG infection. Antigen from recombinant M. smegmatis was processed and presented as OVA 257 - 264 on Kb molecules by the dendritic cell line DC 2. 4 but not by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) or splenic dendritic cells. In contrast, antigen from recombinant M. bovis BCG was presented by all three dendritic cell types as long as the mycobacteria were viable. Such presentation was dependent on proteasome function and nascent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules in DC 2. 4 cells but independent of the proteasome and transporter associated with antigen processings (TAP) in BMDC and splenic dendritic cells. These data demonstrate {{for the first time that}} antigen vectored by the slow-growing M. bovis BCG but not that vectored by fast-growing, readily destroyed M. smegmatis is processed and presented on MHC class I by in vitro-generated dendritic cells, which has implications for recombinant <b>microbial</b> <b>vaccine</b> development...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which <b>microbial</b> <b>vaccines</b> interact with human APCs remain elusive. Herein, we describe the transcriptional programs induced in human DCs by pathogens, innate receptor ligands and vaccines. Exposure of DCs to influenza, Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus allows us to build a modular framework containing 204 transcript clusters. We use this framework to characterize the responses of human monocytes, monocyte-derived DCs and blood DC subsets to 13 vaccines. Different vaccines induce distinct transcriptional programs based on pathogen type, adjuvant formulation and APC targeted. Fluzone, Pneumovax and Gardasil, respectively, activate monocyte-derived DCs, monocytes and CD 1 cþ blood DCs, highlighting APC specialization in response to vaccines. Finally, the blood signatures from individuals vaccinated with Fluzone or infected with influenza reveal a signature of adaptive immunity activation following vaccination and symptomatic infections, but not asymptomatic infections. These data, offered with a web interface, may guide the development of improved vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, many authors have {{reported}} evidence of the immunoprotective capacity of ribosomes isolated from bacteria, fungi and parasites. Since 1971 we have explored the protective capacity of ribosomes isolated from a large variety of microorganisms responsible for human and animal diseases. More recently, using monoclonal antibodies raised against ribosomes and then selected {{for their ability to}} confer passive immunity to mice, we have studied the mechanism of the protection induced by ribosomes. These studies, in parallel with the development of a technology for the large scale production of ribosomes, have allowed us to achieve a new regard for ribosomal vaccines for use in human. The general concept of ribosomal vaccines in presented and examples of two such vaccines are described with data on the specific protection that they induce in mice against experimental infections with Klebsiella peneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae for the first one, and against Candida albicans type A and type B for the second one.

40|$|Today's most {{commonly}} used <b>microbial</b> <b>vaccines</b> are essentially composed of antigenic elements and a non-microbial adjuvant, and induce solid amounts of antibodies. Cancer vaccines mostly aim to induce anti-tumor CTL-responses, which require cross-presentation of tumor-derived antigens by dendritic cells (DCs). Adjuvants that improve DC function and antigen cross-presentation are therefore advantageous for inducing anti-tumor immunity. Previously, we have reported that in situ tumor destruction of established murine tumors by ablation efficiently delivers antigens to DC for the in vivo induction of anti-tumor immunity. Yet, tumor ablation alone resulted in only partial protection against a subsequent tumor-challenge. In this article, the ability of various non-microbial vaccine adjuvants to modulate the immune response following cryo-ablation was tested. The data show that tumor ablation with co-injection of saponin-based adjuvants, but not oil-in-water, water-in-oil or alum-based adjuvants, creates a highly effective in situ vaccine. Draining lymph node CD 11 c+ DCs acquire antigens more efficiently and become increasingly activated following ablation with saponin adjuvants relative to ablation alone. Moreover, our data reveal that the saponin-based adjuvants facilitate an in this model unprecedented level of antigen cross-presentation, induction of tumor-specific CTL and long-lasting tumor protection. Collectively, combining saponin-based adjuvants with in situ tumor destruction leads to an extremely potent systemic anti-tumor response. This combination approach forms a powerful in situ DC vaccine for which no prior knowledge of tumor antigens is required. As saponin-based adjuvants are currently clinically available, they represent attractive tools for various human and veterinary settings where in situ tumor destruction is applied...|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{remain a}} major cause of deaths and disabilities in the world, the majority of which are caused by bacteria. Although immunisation is the most cost effective and efficient means to control <b>microbial</b> diseases, <b>vaccines</b> are not yet available to prevent many major bacterial infections. Examples include dysentery (shigellosis), gonorrhoea, trachoma, gastric ulcers and cancer (Helicobacter pylori). Improved vaccines are needed to combat some diseases for which current vaccines are inadequate.

The availability of complete genome sequences has dramatically changed the opportunities for developing novel and improved vaccines and facilitated the efficiency and rapidity of their development.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the in vivo evaluation of orally administered extracts of Echinacea species, and fractions obtained from Echinacea purpurea for specific immunostimulatory function induced in Balb/c mice by immunization with <b>microbial</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Two vaccines {{were used for}} this purpose in this study. The first vaccine used consisted of whole-cell formalin-killed Salmonella typhimurium vaccine, which is known to induce production of specific antibodies but no delayed-type hypersensitivity response considered as an indicator of the cell-mediated immune response. The second vaccine was a commercial acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) consisting of inactivated diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and native or inactivated virulence factors of Bordetella pertussis (the etiological agent of whooping cough) which is known to induce a humoral immune response but with controversial reports about performance in the induction of cell-mediated immunity. Both vaccines were administered intraperitoneally, whereas the herbal extracts and fractions were administered by oral gavage. The phytochemical profile of the ethanolic extracts of Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea pallida, Echinacea angustifolia and one commercial product 'Echinacea Triplex' and three fractions prepared from Echinacea purpurea, namely polysaccharides, phenolics and alkylamides, was determined by thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and/or by chemical analytical techniques. Statistically significant increases in specific anti-Salmonella typhimurium serum antibody were obtained for the Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea Triplex [Trade Mark] treatment groups, and also for groups receiving treatment with fractions obtained from Echinacea purpurea, namely, polysaccharide, alkylamide and phenolic fractions. Statistically significant increases in the anti-B pertussis serum antibodies were also obtained in the young Echinacea Triplex [Trade Mark] group vaccinated with the DTaP vaccine. Significant enhancement of serum interleukin- 12 titres was observed in the Echinacea Triplex [Trade Mark] as well as the phenolic fraction treatment groups which were vaccinated with killed Salmonella typhimurium vaccine. Of the groups vaccinated with the DTaP vaccine, only Echinacea Triplex [Trade Mark] displayed statistically significant increases in mean interleukin- 12 titre compared to the placebo in both young and old groups, however Echinacea purpurea, and Echinacea angustifolia both displayed significant increases in mean interleukin- 12 titre in the young treatment mice. Increases in interferon-gamma levels in mice orally dosed with phenolic, polysaccharide or alkylamide fractions of Echinacea purpurea and vaccinated with the killed Salmonella typhimurium vaccine were also observed, however these need to be repeated for confirmation, and statistical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Andrographis paniculata (AP) is a {{traditional}} herbal medicine which is widely used {{for the treatment of}} many diseases in Asia. Recently, various biological activities of AP extract or andrographolide (AND), such as immunostimulatory activity, anti-inflammatory effect, cytokine induction or deduction, a potential cancer therapeutic agent and T cell activation suppression, have been reported. However the potential of AP extract or AND to stimulate the specific or adaptive immune response using <b>microbial</b> <b>vaccines</b> has not been determined. In this project, AND has been purified from AP and its identity confirmed by the melting point, colour test, TLC, UV absorption spectrum, ESI-MS and H-NMR. An aqueous and two ethanolic extracts of Andrographis paniculata and AND, an active principle of Andrographis paniculata, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against nine bacterial species in vitro using the disc diffusion method. It was discovered that neither the aqueous extract nor AND were bacteriostatic or bactericidal against S. typhimurium, E. coli, S. sonnei, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, L. pneumophila or B. pertussis but the two ethanolic extracts of AP were bacteriostatic against L. pneumophila and B. pertussis. It was also observed that the ethanol extract of AP and AND stimulated both antibody and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses to a killed S. typhimurium vaccine. Mice were vaccinated with either one dose or two doses of killed S. typhimurium vaccine. They were fed two different quantities of an ethanol extract of AP or AND for 14 days in mice immunised with one dose of the vaccine, and for 28 days in mice immunised with two doses of vaccine, respectively. Both the extract and AND significantly increased the IgG antibody titres against S. typhimurium, with the increase in antibody titres being statistically significant in the two dose vaccine group. Although not statistically significant, there was also a substantial increase in the IgG antibody titres in the one dose vaccine group. Splenocyte cultures from mice from both the immunisation groups treated with the extract or AND stimulated with the S. typhimurium lysate showed {{a significant increase in the}} production of IFN-γ in both 14 and 28 day AP extract or AND treatment groups. The increase indicates the induction of a cell-mediated immune response. To confirm the immunomodulatory potential of AP extract and determine the immunomodulatory potential of AND, experiments were conducted using mouse salmonellosis as a model system. Mice were vaccinated with two doses of killed S. typhimurium vaccine by intraperitoneal (i/p) route and orally dosed with AP extract at 25 mg/kg bodyweight or AND at 4 mg/kg bodyweight for total 28 days, followed by oral challenge with virulent S. typhimurium.

To study cytokine and β-chemokine profiles during pathogenesis of lentiviral infection and progression to AIDS in rhesus macaques, we established new quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays based on TaqMan chemistry. Using synthetic RNA standards, we quantified mRNAs of IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 12 p 40, interferon γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α (MIP- 1 α), and MIP- 1 β in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymph nodes from macaques chronically infected with SIV or SHIV. Viremic monkeys with decreased CD 4 + T cell counts (< 500 cells/μl) had significantly higher IL- 10 mRNA expression than uninfected controls, which parallels the findings in HIV- 1 -infected humans. In addition, MIP- 1 α, MIP- 1 β, and RANTES mRNA expression increased in viremic monkeys with decreased CD 4 + T cell counts; gene expression was inversely correlated with CD 4 + T cell counts, but not viral load.

40|$|Background: In early {{clinical}} studies, {{the live}} tuberculosis vaccine Mycobacterium bovis BCG exhibited 80 % protective efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Although BCG still exhibits reliable protection against TB meningitis and miliary TB {{in early childhood}} it has become less reliable in protecting against pulmonary TB. During decades of in vitro cultivation BCG not only lost some genes due to deletions of regions of the chromosome but also underwent gene duplication and other mutations resulting in increased antioxidant production. Methodology/Principal Findings: To determine whether <b>microbial</b> antioxidants influence <b>vaccine</b> immunogenicity, we eliminated duplicated alleles encoding the oxidative stress sigma factor SigH in BCG Tice and reduced the activity and secretion of iron co-factored superoxide dismutase.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} simple and {{sensitive}} assays to assess innate and adaptive immune responses to <b>microbial</b> agents and <b>vaccines.</b> Herein, we describe a whole blood method allowing to measure the induction of cytokine synthesis at the mRNA level. The originality of this method consists in the combination of PAXgene tubes containing an mRNA stabilizer for blood collection, the MagNA Pure instrument as an automated system for mRNA extraction and RT-PCR reagent mix preparation, and the real-time PCR methodology on the Lightcycler for accurate and reproducible quantification of transcript levels. We first demonstrated that this method is adequate to measure the induction of interleukin (IL) - 1 beta and IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 RA) mRNA upon the addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to whole blood. We then showed that this approach is also suitable to detect the production of mRNA encoding T cell-derived cytokines in whole blood incubated with tetanus toxoid as a model of in vitro immune response to a recall antigen. Finally, we demonstrated that this methodology can be used successfully to assess inflammatory as well as T cell responses in vivo, as it allowed to detect the induction of IL- 1 beta and IL- 1 RA after injection of LPS in healthy volunteers, and also the induction of IL- 2 upon recall immunisation with tetanus vaccine.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{evaluating}} two "new" concepts for {{the management}} of pneumonia. The first concept, oral immunization, seems a promising approach towards prevention of pneumonia. Extensive programs have been developed for active immunoprophylaxis to immunize against specific <b>microbial</b> pathogens, and <b>vaccines</b> introduced into clinical practice since the 1970 s include those against H. influenzae, meningococs, pneumococs, pseudomonas, hepatitis B virus and rabies. However, controversies surrounding established vaccines and the search for vaccines against other pathogens constantly stimulate investigations on the development of new vaccines. Therefore, and because oral administration of vaccines is convenient, much {{attention has been paid to}} the development of vaccines for oral administration. It is proven that oral administration of vaccine of viral or bacterial origin can induce a mucosal immune response, but the possibility of oral immunization with bacterial lysate for the prevention of viral pneumonia has not been well documented. The first part of this thesis presents investigations on oral immunization with a new polyvalent bacterial lysate against both bacterial and viral pathogens that may cause pneumonia. The second concept, surfactant replacement therapy, has already proven its value in the prevention and treatment of idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) of the newborn, which is caused by a surfactant deficient state of the premature lungs. Several studies on the origin and nature of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have demonstrated a surfactant deficient state of the lungs of ARDS-patients and frrst clinical trials of surfactant replacement in ARDS patients have proven the beneficial effects of surfactant replacement.

40|$|Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{regulators}} of inflammatory and immune responses. It is a family of transcription factors composed of five members: RelA, RelB, cRel, NF-κB 1 (p 105 /p 50), and NF-κB 2 (p 100 /p 52). Homo- and hetero-dimers of family members are inhibited by inhibitor of 2 ̆ 6 klappaB (IκB) family members and activated by IκB kinase (IKK) family members. The IKK family is comprised of IKKα, IKKΒ, and IKKγ. The focus of my dissertation delves into the role of NF-κB activation by IKKΒ in both an immunotherapy setting and its role in T cell mediated anti-tumor immune responses. A central focus of immunotherapy is to develop vaccine adjuvants that are capable of enhancing a protective adaptive immune response. <b>Microbial</b> adjuvants in <b>vaccines</b> activate key transcription factors, including NF-κB and interferon response factors (IRF). The individual role of these transcription factors in successful vaccines is not clear. We used constitutively active IKKΒ (CA-IKKΒ) expressed in an adenoviral vector (AdIKK) to determine the role of classical NF-κB activation in a vaccine-induced immune response. In an in vivo model, AdIKK induced rapid and sustained NF-κB-driven inflammation in the lungs compared to the control virus. AdIKK infection had no impact on the magnitude of T cell activation as measured by IFN-γ production; however pulmonary inflammation resulted in increased cellularity of draining lymph nodes (LN) at early timepoints resulting in increased early antibody and T cell responses. Taken together, these findings show that IKKΒ-induced NF-κB activation of an inflammatory response affects the kinetics, but not the magnitude of the adaptive immune response. NF-κB is activated in many tumor types and contributes to the progression of cancer by suppressing apoptosis, and enhancing proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. NF-κB is also activated in other cells within the tumor microenvironment and promotes inflammation initiated by neutrophils and macrophages. In addition to inflammatory cells, T cells can be found within the tumor microenvironment and are associated with improved patient survival. Using CA-IKKΒ, we sought to determine if NF-κB activation in tumor cells could promote T cell mediated tumor immunity. In both primary tumors and a metastatic tumor model, we found that NF-κB expression in tumors rendered immunogenic through expression of Kb-OVA led to tumor rejection or growth suppression. Tumor regression was mediated by increased CD 8 T cell recruitment by chemokines. Microarray results showed increases in T cell chemokines, including CCL 2 and CCL 5. Knock-down of CCL 2 by Lentiviral shRNA in LLC-OVA-IKK cells resulted in abrogation of tumor regression. These results suggest that NF-κB is capable of promoting immune surveillance in tumors through increased recruitment of T cells. Overall, my dissertation highlights beneficial roles of IKKΒ-induced activation of NF-κB in two separate systems: vaccine induced immune responses and tumor immune surveillance...|$|R
