5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Terriers have {{a greater}} chance of {{developing}} some cancers than other purebreds. According to research by the Veterinary Medical Data Program (1986), six cancers that Scotties appeared to be <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for (when compared to other breeds) are: (in descending order) bladder cancer and other transitional cell carcinomas of the lower urinary tract; malignant melanoma; gastric carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; lymphosarcoma and nasal carcinoma. Other cancers that are known to commonly affect Scotties include mast cell sarcoma and hemangiosarcoma.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes may on {{occasions}} prey on lambs. Usually, lambs {{targeted by}} foxes {{tend to be}} physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.|$|E

Suicide risks were also significantly greater than the general population. Swedish researchers found both international and domestic adoptees undertook suicide at much higher rates than non-adopted peers; with international adoptees and female international adoptees, in particular, at highest risk.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{with a low}} {{heart rate}} prior to {{pacemaker}} implantation are <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of developing pacemaker syndrome. Normally the first chamber of the heart (atrium) contracts as the second chamber (ventricle) is relaxed, allowing the ventricle to fill before it contracts and pumps blood out of the heart. When the timing between the two chambers goes out of synchronization, less blood is delivered on each beat. Patients who develop pacemaker syndrome may require adjustment of the pacemaker, or fitting of another lead to better coordinate the timing of atrial and ventricular contraction.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} meningiomas {{are not well}} understood. Most cases are sporadic, {{appearing}} randomly, while some are familial.

Atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima had a higher than typical frequency of developing meningiomas, with the incidence increasing the closer that they were {{to the site of the}} explosion.

40|$|Systemic {{inflammation}} and sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes are central {{processes in the}} pathophysiology of severe Plasmodium falciparum childhood malaria. However, {{it is still not}} understood why some children are <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>risks</b> to develop malaria complications than others. To identify human proteins in plasma related to childhood malaria syndromes, multiplex antibody suspension bead arrays were employed. Out of the 1, 015 proteins analyzed in plasma from more than 700 children, 41 differed between malaria infected children and community controls, whereas 13 discriminated uncomplicated malaria from severe malaria syndromes. Markers of oxidative stress were found related to severe malaria anemia while markers of endothelial activation, platelet adhesion and muscular damage were identified in relation to children with cerebral malaria. These findings suggest the presence of generalized vascular inflammation, vascular wall modulations, activation of endothelium and unbalanced glucose metabolism in severe malaria.

25|$|Although {{lessons and}} {{training}} may help peers {{of children with}} autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of The New York Times, bullying {{is most likely to}} occur against autistic children who have the most potential to live independently, such as those with Asperger syndrome. Such children are <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> because they have as many of the rituals and lack of social skills as children with full autism, but {{they are more likely to}} be mainstreamed in school, since they are on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Children with autism have more difficulty attending to social cues, and so may not always recognize when they are being bullied.|$|E
25|$|If the {{infection}} in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; although, this {{was seen as a}} benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the {{invasive}} species {{problem in the}} buffers was complicated further by the confirmed arrival of Didymosphenia geminata, an algae species {{commonly referred to as}} rock snot, in the creek's waters between Shandaken and the reservoir. It was the third stream in the state where it has been found, after Batten Kill in Washington County and the East and West branches of the Delaware River in Delaware County, just {{to the west of the}} Esopus valley. The species can clog water intakes but poses no threat to human life. Trout are <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> because it often grows over river bottoms, smothering the insect hatches they depend on as a food source. There is no way at present to eradicate the species; the state has instead advised fishermen to thoroughly clean and disinfect their waders after trips in order to slow its growth and prevent it from reaching other streams.|$|E

40|$|For novel cardiac markers to be clinicallyuseful in {{diagnosing}} acute coronary syn-dromes, {{they need}} to show their incre-mental utility beyond that of existing markers, with therapeutic implications designed to im-prove patient care.
