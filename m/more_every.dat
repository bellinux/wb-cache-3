5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for <b>more</b> <b>every</b> winter.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed critical reception. Despite enjoying Tracy's subplot, {{which he}} acknowledges had [...] "a couple of funny moments", Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that this episode was a [...] "mediocre" [...] one from season four. The A.V. Clubs Leonard Pierce {{noted that this}} episode was not a [...] "terrible" [...] one, though he opined [...] "this is a show that should be giving us <b>more</b> <b>every</b> week than 'wasn't a terrible episode'", and not entirely favorable to [...] "Season Four", [...] "Into the Crevasse", and [...] "Stone Mountain", Pierce commented that 30 Rock [...] "needs to give us something fast {{to get rid of}} the worst-season-ever stink that's starting to gather." [...] In conclusion, he gave it a C grade rating. Time contributor James Poniewozik reported that the [...] "middle America" [...] theme [...] "would have played a little stronger if (1) it wasn't vocalized so blatantly and repeatedly by Liz and Jack and (2) if it hadn't already been the theme of [...] two weeks ago." [...] Meredith Blake, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was not complimentary towards [...] "Stone Mountain", citing Jeff Dunham's appearance as the major problem, and concluded by calling the episode [...] "disappointing" [...] and a [...] "letdown". New York magazine contributor Lane Brown also found it unfavorable, calling it a [...] "sorta disappointing episode", and concluded [...] "...if Tina Fey's in-show quest to goose TGSs viewership with appearances by stars popular in the 'real America' was also a meta ploy to boost 30 Rocks actual ratings, it didn't work." ...|$|E
500|$|The cast of FOX musical series Glee {{performed}} {{this song}} on the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol", with Heather Morris' character, Brittany Pierce, taking the lead. The episode revolved around teen drinking and its dangers. The members of Glee Club are asked to perform at the school's alcohol awareness assembly, in which [...] "Tik Tok" [...] {{is one of the}} songs performed. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that the song's inclusion in the episode was superfluous, stating that it was just an excuse to get a Kesha song on Glee. VanDerWerff however, wrote that he [...] "REALLY liked Heather Morris'" [...] rendition of the song. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised Brittany's choreography and overall performance in [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "The huge star of this number was clearly Brittany, who more and <b>more</b> <b>every</b> week proves that she needs to be moved to the forefront of this show's big performances and storylines." [...] Gonzalez gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a B, calling it [...] "pure, fun entertainment up until we got to the part straight out of the mind of Gordie LaChance. So even though the purple vomit was a bit too much for this weak viewer, the performance made me add a Ke$ha song to my iTunes, which I never thought would happen." [...] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a mostly positive review, writing, [...] "Love Brittany as we do, we wish Rachel or Mercedes stepped up to the mic. The performance is less risqué than their Pep Rally [...] "Push It" [...] but winds up causing more controversy when Brittany pukes on Rachel and Santana also vomits up grey slush. It's a fitting end to the song, and the episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|The biggest such operation, [...] "Operation Junction City" [...] in 1967 for example, {{involving}} some 22 US battalions and 4 ARVN counterparts, {{and supported}} by massive air and artillery firepower, only yielded an average of approximately 33 enemy dead per day, over its 2 months. Such losses were manageable by an opponent that could put {{tens of thousands of}} staunch fighters in the field, and reinforce them with <b>more</b> <b>every</b> day. Even more telling, such massive sweeps failed to cripple their targets and deliver the big battles sought by the Americans. The option of initiating contact was still largely in the hands of Communist units, and their tactics lured powerful US forces away from populated areas, their key base until late in the war.|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Posts Allison Stewart {{writes that}} the album [...] "cribs heavily from vintage R. Kelly {{in the same way}} its predecessor,... Love Hate, {{borrowed}} from Purple Rain-era Prince". The track [...] "Kelly's 12 Play" [...] references R. Kelly's 1993 album 12 Play.

This album is just gonna be the first album on some out of this world crack, basically". In an interview for The Village Voice, he discussed his use of melody, repetition, and hooks, relating it to child discipline, saying that [...] "Americans are not the biggest listeners. I didn't listen, which is why my granddaddy beat me half the time. It's only when the belt is swinging at you in the same repetitive manner that you actually start to listen. So it's all about creating a belt on the song that repetitiously swings at you. It doesn't mean that in between the belt swinging, I'm not saying stuff that means something".|$|E
2500|$|In 1874, {{the family}} moved to Providence. In the fall of that year the General Conference met with Roger Williams Church. It was notable as the first General Conference at which a woman presided over the public meeting of the W.M.S. As President of the W.M.S., she was asked to make the dedicatory address at Myrtle Hall, Storer College, May 30, 1879. For this she made her first journey alone, and, {{preceding}} the dedication, gave an evening of reading to defray the expenses of the journey. Rev. A. H. Morrell invited her to preach for him one Sunday morning. This she did, and thereafter, through the years, did considerable pulpit work. On moving to Providence, Burlingame became actively identified with the W.C.T.U. movement, then only a few months old; first with the Providence Union, then as corresponding secretary of the State Union, and in 1884–1890 as president of the latter. It was during her presidency that the campaign was on which won for a period of three years, 1886–89, State Constitutional Prohibition. Into this, she threw all of her energies, as she did in 1887 into the effort to secure state suffrage for women. Through all the years she has been keenly interested in these two reform movements, and has lived to see both realized nationwide. After giving up her state office in the W. C. T. U., she was appointed, through Miss Willard's influence, National Evangelist. This gave her credentials to speak for the cause wherever she might be. As a sample of her activities we quote, “For several years I had the work connected with the Presidency of the R. I. W. C. T. U., speaking once or <b>more</b> <b>every</b> Sunday, attending frequent conventions, keeping track of work at Headquarters and the interests of the local Unions, editing a semimonthly edition of the Outlook, and the monthly Missionary Helper.” ...|$|E
