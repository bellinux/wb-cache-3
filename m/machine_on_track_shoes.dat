Platform track 5 is used only for the Ahr Valley Railway, operated as the Rhein-Ahr-Bahn towards Ahrbrück.|$|R
50|$|The rumored resentment over Tim Finn's {{successful}} solo {{career was}} worsened by {{his desire to}} include drummer Ricky Fataar in recording sessions, and using a drum <b>machine</b> <b>on</b> most other <b>tracks.</b> Hence, although Noel Crombie is credited as drummer/percussionist on the album liner notes, he actually contributed very little drumming.|$|R
50|$|House of Hearts is {{an album}} by American blues guitarist and singer Rory Block, {{released}} in 1987 on the Rounder Records label.

50|$|There {{are other}} {{categories}} of single-seater racing, including kart racing, which employs a small, low-cost <b>machine</b> <b>on</b> small <b>tracks.</b> Many {{of the current}} top drivers began their careers in karts. Formula Ford represents the most popular first open-wheel category for up-and-coming drivers stepping up from karts. The series is still the preferred option, as it has introduced an aero package and slicks, allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer F1. The Star Mazda Series is another entry-level series.|$|R
50|$|In 1894 Sir Hiram Maxim {{tested a}} flying <b>machine</b> running <b>on</b> a <b>track</b> and held down by safety rails because it lacked {{adequate}} flight control. The machine lifted {{off the track}} and met the safety rails and this is sometimes claimed as a flight. Maxim himself never made such a claim.|$|R
50|$|The {{tracks in}} the former yard are now used as storage for {{concrete}} sleepers, old and new signals, and rail <b>machines.</b> <b>Tracks</b> <b>on</b> the northern side of the station were moved slightly, to reduce the radius of curves, and allow trains to travel at higher speed.|$|R
5000|$|Outside of rock music, the TR-606 was {{commonly}} used by electronica artists Plastikman, Aphex Twin, Mike Ink, and Autechre. Even artists that preferred breakbeats to four-on-the-floor rhythms used it, seen when 4Hero credited the TR-606 on its well-received album Parallel Universe. Another example was Massive Attack's 1994 album Protection, which prominently used the <b>machine</b> <b>on</b> some <b>tracks,</b> and the CD booklet included {{a photo of}} the TR-606 connected to a TB-303. The Swedish electronic band Covenant used it extensively for most of their career, citing it as [...] "one of the most beautifully distortable drum machines ever made".|$|R
50|$|Tracked {{vehicles}} {{have better}} mobility over rough terrain {{than those with}} wheels. They smooth out the bumps, glide over small obstacles and are capable of crossing trenches or breaks in the terrain. Riding in a fast tracked vehicle feels like riding in a boat over heavy swells. Tracks cannot be punctured or torn. Tracks are {{much less likely to}} get stuck in soft ground, mud, or snow since they distribute the weight of the vehicle over a larger contact area, decreasing its ground pressure. In addition, the larger contact area, coupled with the cleats, or grousers, <b>on</b> the <b>track</b> <b>shoes,</b> allows vastly superior traction that results in a much better ability to push or pull large loads where wheeled vehicles would dig in. Bulldozers, which are most often tracked, use this attribute to rescue other vehicles, (such as wheel loaders) which have become stuck in, or sunk into, the ground. Tracks can also give higher maneuverability, as tracked vehicles can turn in place without forward or backward movement by driving the tracks in opposite directions. In addition, should a track be broken, assuming the correct tools are available, it can be repaired without the need for special facilities; something which is crucial in a combat situation.|$|R
50|$|Also new to NASCAR 09 was the Paint Booth Customization Feature, {{similar to}} Papyrus' NASCAR games. For {{only the second}} time in the franchise's history (first {{appearing}} in EA's NASCAR Sim Racing for PC), a car customization template is available online which creates endless possibilities for personalization. Players are only able to see their friends' custom-designed car skins when racing against them online, not non friends. The online connectivity of Paint Booth allows players to download a car template from EASports.com and import it into editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, giving users a multitude of design options. They can then upload those images into the game and show off their dream <b>machine</b> <b>on</b> the <b>track.</b> After EA lost the NASCAR license, the Paint Booth application was removed from the EA Sports website.|$|R

5000|$|Brown's voice, and in {{particular}} his high banshee screams, are a precursor to the banshee screaming of many later heavy metal singers, and his theatrical concepts and stage presence such as the face makeup, voodoo dancing and flaming helmet pioneered {{a lot of what}} was to become shock rock and progressive rock. The third and final Kingdom Come album, Journey (1973), is noteworthy for being one of the first rock albums to feature a drum <b>machine,</b> especially <b>on</b> the <b>track</b> [...] "Time Captives".|$|R

2500|$|During {{this time}} Smith {{departed}} the band, and they eventually went {{to record their}} second album without a full-time drummer (although Manu Katche drummed on several songs on the album). In September 1990, they went to Belgium to work with Laurie Latham, using a drum <b>machine</b> <b>on</b> many <b>tracks.</b> Recording was finished in early 1991, however release of the album was delayed several times by EMI. A new single, [...] "Walk With the Mountain", {{was scheduled to be}} released in September 1991 and a video was recorded in America, however EMI cancelled the release. The eventual lead single, [...] "Fall to Love", was released early the following year, reaching No. 48 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1992. Their album, Decency, was released on 3 February 1992, and peaked at No. 57 in the UK Albums Chart. On the supporting tour, Dave Anderson joined the band full-time on drums. [...] "Boy on Top of the News", a song inspired by Brian Jones was released as the second single from the album and reached No. 58 on the singles chart.|$|R

50|$|Track {{construction}} and assembly is {{dictated by the}} application. Military vehicles use a <b>track</b> <b>shoe</b> that is integral {{to the structure of}} the chain in order to reduce track weight. Reduced weight allows the vehicle to move faster and decreases overall vehicle weight to ease transportation. Since track weight is completely unsprung, reducing it improves suspension performance at speeds where the track's momentum is significant. In contrast, agricultural and construction vehicles opt for a <b>track</b> with <b>shoes</b> that attach to the chain with bolts and do not form part of the chain's structure. This allows <b>track</b> <b>shoes</b> to break without compromising the ability of the vehicle to move and decrease productivity but increases the overall weight of the track and vehicle.|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} met with {{critical}} acclaim. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review, awarding it five out of five stars. Levine praised the synths and strings present <b>on</b> the <b>track,</b> as well as Åhlund's production. He commented that the lyrics made the song [...] "not just touching, but utterly, utterly life-affirming". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music and compared it to [...] "heartbreak songs" [...] by ABBA, but noted its modern synthpop as opposed to 1970s disco. McAlpine noted that the song about dancing and being [...] "terrified/upset" [...] at the same time, and wrote that Robyn has created a [...] "devastating happysad feeling". McAlpine awarded the song five out five stars, and gave it [...] "special points" [...] for its [...] "faux-classical synth solo" [...] in the middle. Emma Gaedeke of Billboard highlighted the songwriting and praised it for being emotionally honest, without [...] "generic pop cheesiness". Molly Lambert of Pitchfork wrote a positive review of the song, saying that the drum <b>machines</b> <b>on</b> the <b>track</b> contrast well with the qualities of her voice. Lambert wrote, [...] "“Indestructible” encapsulates the kind of freedom Robyn sings about; freedom from reductionist categories, unfair expectations, and life's daily indignities." ...|$|R

5000|$|In mid-October 1986, the {{mainstay}} Smak members reunited {{in the lineup}} Mihajlović, Stojanović, Aranđelović and Milanović, but without Ristovski who refused {{to participate in the}} reunion. The four started rehearsing at the University of Kragujevac campus, and during the rehearsals a young keyboard player Milan Đurđević often attended the rehearsals, however, due to being Mihajlović's reserved towards him, he invited Chris Nichols to record the keyboard parts. The comeback album Smak 86., also featuring Miša Komnenić and Vlada Nikodijević on guest keyboards, but the album was not well received by the critics. The album featured Mihajlović as the album producer, music and lyrics author, even lead vocalist in the song [...] "Kornjačina koža" [...] ("Turtle Skin"). The band members themselves, with the exception of Mihajlović were also dissatisfied with the record: Aranđelović was not satisfied with some of the lyrics and Stojanović was not content with the usage of rhythm <b>machines</b> <b>on</b> certain <b>tracks.</b> After the album release, the band embarked on a tour with Milan Đurđević on keyboards, but without much promotion. After a short tour, the band went on an indefinite hiatus.|$|R
