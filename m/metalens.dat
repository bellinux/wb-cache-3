30|$|In a MIL, {{since the}} {{geometry}} {{is responsible for}} beam bending, the image quality is restricted by the geometrical and wave aberration. However, the conventional imaging devices with non-flat geometry can be compressed to the flat one using coordinate transformation because metamaterials are able to control light in almost arbitrary manners [122]. A flat metamaterial with gradually varying refractive index was proposed as an alternative <b>metalens</b> [120]. In the third <b>metalens,</b> a gradient-index (GRIN) <b>metalens,</b> spatially varying refractive index {{plays a role in}} bending light. A GRIN <b>metalens</b> is quite similar to a conventional GRIN lens, but the difference is that refractive profile is complicated in GRIN <b>metalens</b> while it is symmetric in the conventional one. A <b>metalens</b> consisting of patterned copper strips and an FR 4 as a matrix in which refractive index is addressed by changing a proportion of the copper strips was proposed [123]. Since the copper strips are not resonant in the operation frequency, this <b>metalens,</b> or flattened Luneburg lens, exhibited low losses and broadband operation. Because artificial magnetic response is difficult to be fabricated, GRIN <b>metalens</b> in which permittivity distribution is designed in order to focus a plane wave was introduced and achieved a resolution of one-sixth of a wavelength [120]. A resolution of one-hundredth of a wavelength, and either wavelength- or incident angle- dependent focusing was numerically achieved by using metallic waveguide on which subwavelength patterns are non-periodically arranged [124]. A switchable GRIN <b>metalens</b> by shorting the gaps in SRRs were also presented [125].|$|E

However, a CMOS-compatible <b>metalens</b> {{has yet to}} be achieved in the visible region due to the limitation on material properties such as transmission and compatibility. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a divergent <b>metalens</b> based on silicon nitride platform with large numerical aperture (NA~ 0. 98) and high transmission (~ 0. 8) for unpolarized visible light, fabricated by a 695 -nm-thick hexagonal silicon nitride array with a minimum space of 42 nm between adjacent nanoposts. Nearly diffraction-limit virtual focus spots are achieved within the visible region. Such <b>metalens</b> enables to shrink objects into a micro-scale size field of view as small as a single-mode fiber core. Furthermore, a macroscopic <b>metalens</b> with 1 -cm-diameter is also realized including over half billion nanoposts, showing a potential application of wide viewing-angle functionality.

40|$|The project "the {{development}} of pT" is completed with this report. The name pT refers to toxic potency of surface water {{due to the}} presence of toxic substances, of which the identity and concentrations are unknown. The multitude and diversity of potentially occurring chemicals put strong limitations to information conventional chemical monitoring may provide. Even if it were doable to analyse most chemicals, {{it would be impossible to}} interpret such information in terms of toxic stress because toxicity data are available for only a limited number of environmental pollutants. In environmental policy a need was expressed to develop an instrument to monitor toxic stress in ecosystems. There is a need to keep track of the efficacy of environmental measures as well as for weighting toxic stress in association with respect to other environmental stressors, such as acidification and eutrophication ("how serious is the problem of toxic substances for the environment?"). A method was developed to 1.) extract and concentrate the unknown cocktail of toxic substances from a sample of surface water, 2.) to determine the acute toxicity of concentrated water samples using a test battery of miniaturised in vivo-bioassays ("toxkits") and 3.) to compute, from the observed interspecies variation of acute toxicity in the toxkits, impacts at a higher ecological level, i. e. toxic stress in terms of the potentially affected fraction of species (PAF) that occur in the field. The concentration technique was optimised by means of different test mixtures, consisting of chemicals with a non-specific (narcotic) mode of action, pesticides and surfactants. Toxkits were employed to test these mixtures. The test battery consisted of Daphnia IQ, PAM (an algae test), Microtox and Thamnotox F. The test mixtures were made of more than 30 chemicals with varying physico-chemical and toxic properties. The recovery of the finally adopted concentration technique was higher than 60 % and should be considered as the maximum achievable, because the solid phase extraction on which it relies is specific with respect to physico-chemical properties of chemicals. For metals an alternative technique was developed, based on multi-element analyses of a water sample in combination with ecotoxicity data of 16 metals. Monitoring programs were executed to sample, concentrate and test the toxicity of surface waters in the Netherlands. Both for organic micropollutants and metals it was shown that toxic pollution order is Scheldt > Meuse > Rhine. The pT method, also known as "measured msPAF" (ms means multi substance), was applied to varying test mixtures in a first attempt to compare the calculation rules for msPAF which is computed for complex mixtures with pT (measured msPAF) derived from measured toxicity distributions. Dit rapport vormt de afronding van het project pT. pT verwijst naar de toxische potentie van oppervlaktewater door de aanwezigheid van lage concentraties van toxische stoffen, maar waarvan de aard en concentraties onbekend zijn. De veelheid van stoffen beperkt de informatie die conventionele chemische monitoring kan leveren. Ook al zou het mogelijk zijn om de meeste stoffen te meten, dan is het onmogelijk om deze informatie te vertalen naar zoiets als toxische stress, omdat van slechts een klein aantal stoffen de toxische eigenschappen bekend zijn. Het milieubeleid heeft behoefte aan een instrument waarmee monitoring van toxische stress in het ecosysteem mogelijk is, zowel om de effectiviteit van het stoffenbeleid te kunnen volgen als om een afweging te kunnen maken met andere stressfactoren, zoals verzuring en vermesting. De methode pT werd ontwikkeld waarmee 1.) de onbekende cocktail van organische toxische stoffen uit een monster van oppervlaktewater wordt geextraheerd, 2) de acute toxiciteit wordt bepaald van het aldus geconcentreerde watermonster m. b. v. een testbatterij van geminiaturiseerde in vivo-bioassays ("toxkits") en 3.) uit de waargenomen variatie in gevoeligheid van de toxkits de toxische stress in het lokale ecosysteem wordt afgeleid die indicatief is voor aantasting van de soortenrijkdom, PAF (potentieel aangetaste fractie). Aan de hand van verschillende testmengsels, bestaande uit stoffen met een a-specifieke (narcotiserende) werking, pesticiden en surfactanten, werd de concentratietechniek geoptimaliseerd. Deze mengsels met meer dan 30 verschillende verbindingen met uiteenlopende fysisch-chemische en toxische eigenschappen, werden gebruikt bij het uittesten van de in vivo-bioassays. De efficientie van de concentratietechniek van ca 60 % moet als het maximaal haalbare worden gezien vanwege het feit dat deze gebaseerd is op vaste fase extractie met onvermijdelijk specificiteit voor fysisch-chemische eigenschappen van stoffen. De testbatterij bestond uit Daphnia IQ, PAM (een algentest), Microtox en Thamnotox F. Omdat voor <b>metalen</b> deze methode ongeschikt is, werd daarvoor een andere procedure ontwikkeld. Deze is gebaseerd op multi-elementanalyse van watermonsters in combinatie met ecotoxiccteits data van 16 <b>metalen.</b> Gezamelijk onderzoek met het RIZA heeft aangetoond dat de totale toxische stress afneemt in volgorde van Schelde, Maas en Rijn.

40|$|Metalenses {{can achieve}} diffraction-limited {{focusing}} through localized phase {{manipulation of the}} incoming light beam. Because these structures are ultrathin, less than a wavelength, this {{has the potential of}} achieving ultrathin optical elements, with a thickness limited mainly by the mechanical strength of the transparent substrate.

To overcome these challenges, this paper predicts a new type of <b>metalens</b> with concentric-nanoring topology, where the number and size of the nanorings are determined using an inverse design method. By focusing the electrical field energy at a specified position, the convex-like <b>metalens</b> is inversely predicted with desired numerical aperture and a diffraction-limited focal spot. The Poynting vector distribution found demonstrates the mechanism of the lensing function, in which optical vortices are generated in the nanorings to achieve a matching of the phase and impedance between the substrate and free space, and further, to form a spherical wavefront and enhance the transmission of the optical energy. The inverse design method can also be extended to predict an axicon-like <b>metalens</b> with focal beam. The improved manufacturability is concluded from the geometry of the concentric-nanoring configurations...|$|E

However, efficient collection of a quantum emitter's photoluminescence (PL) is challenging as its atomic scale necessitates diffraction-limited imaging with nanometer-precision alignment, oftentimes at cryogenic temperatures. In this letter, we image an individual quantum emitter, an isolated nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, using a dielectric <b>metalens</b> composed of subwavelength pillars etched into the diamond's surface.

Despite the rapid growth, simultaneously achieving low-dimensionality, high transmission efficiency, real-time continuous reconfigurability, and a wide variety of re-programmable functions are still very challenging, forcing researchers to realize just one or few of the aforementioned features in one design. In this study, we report a subwavelength reconfigurable Huygens' metasurface realized by loading it with controllable active elements.

30|$|The {{second type}} of <b>metalens</b> is {{metamaterial}} immersion lens (MIL) [119]. MILs have same phase compensation mechanism with a conventional lens; geometric shape of a MIL determines propagation length and hence, phase accumulation. Since diffraction phenomenon limits resolution to / 2 NA where NA is a numerical aperture, {{it is important to}} make a lens with high NA. To achieve high NA, properly shaped high-index metamaterials were introduced. Interface of a MIL have to be designed to realize bidirectional coupling between the lens and air. By using a concave-shaped hyperbolic MIL where real part of permittivity along the propagating direction is negative, plane wave focusing was demonstrated. Whereas a convex shape is used to focus a plane wave for conventional materials, the hyperbolic MIL has concave surface due to negative refraction at the metamaterial-air interface [119]. One interesting thing is that the losses are important factors in the working mechanisms of MIL <b>metalens.</b> The waves with different transverse wavevectors suffer different amount of the loss due to their different loss coefficients, propagation length, and refraction angle. In a MIL, the waves with high transverse wavevectors attenuate less, and therefore, contribute more to construct an image, leading to high NA [119].|$|E

These flat lenses exhibited high NA as well as zero monochromatic-aberration [145]. After that, metasurface-based lenses with complementary nanoantennas were proposed. A metasurface composed of array of complementary V-shaped antennas was fabricated in a gold film using photolithography and showed reduced noise due to directly transmitted light [154]. Another experimental research demonstrated a strong focusing ability of concentrically perforated gold films called a Babinet-inverted <b>metalens.</b> This metasurface accomplished a focal length of a few nanometers, high signal to noise ratio, and wavelength-controllable focal length by replacing plasmonic nano-antennas to nano-voids [155].|$|E
40|$|Utilizing {{discrete}} phase distribution to fit continuous phase distribution {{has been a}} primary routine for designing metasurfaces. In the existing method, the validation of the discrete designs is guaranteed only by using the sub-wavelength condition of unit cells, which is insufficient, especially for arbitrary phase distribution. Herein, we proposed an analytical method to design metasurfaces via estimating {{the width of the}} source in a unit cell. Also, by calculating field patterns in both real- and momentum-space, we provided four guidelines to direct future applications of metasurfaces, such as an arbitrary multi-foci lens with the same strength of each focus, a convex-concave double lens, and a lens with a large numerical aperture that can precisely prevent undesired diffraction orders. Besides <b>metalens,</b> this methodology can provide a wide platform for designing tailored and multifunctional metasurfaces in future, especially large-area ones in practical applications.

40|$|A {{new type}} of <b>metalens</b> with the {{capability}} to selectively focus narrowband light is reported at different focal planes depending on polarization. Two zone planes with two different focal lengths are spatially multiplexed and encoded in the subwavelength regime with arrays of orthogonal silver nanostructures, which are designed to exhibit strong wavelength- and polarization-dependent scattering profiles. Using this principle, imaging under white-light illumination with independent focal planes is experimentally demonstrated for each polarization at the narrowband resonant wavelength. Furthermore, each focal plane can be dynamically controlled with an output polarizer. In contrast to conventional refractive and diffractive optical elements, functional metalenses allow additional control over wavelength and polarization properties of light {{for a wide range}} of applications.

40|$|The {{resonant}} <b>metalens</b> {{consisting of}} metal-wire resonators with equally finite length can break the diffraction barrier {{well suited for}} super-resolution imaging. In this study, a basic combination constructed by two metal-wire resonators with different lengths is proposed, and its resonant characteristics is analyzed using the method of moments (MoM). Based on the time reversal (TR) technique, this kind of combination {{can be applied to}} a sub-wavelength two-element antenna array with a 1 / 40 -wavelength interval to make the elements work simultaneously with little interference in the frequency band of 1. 0 - 1. 5 GHz and 1. 5 - 2. 0 GHz, respectively. The simulations and experiments show that analysis of MoM and the application of the resonators can be used to design multi-frequency sub-wavelength antenna arrays efficiently. This general design method is convenient and can be used for many applications, such as weakening jamming effectiveness in communication systems, and sub-wavelength imaging in a broad frequency band...|$|E
40|$|The {{dispersion}} {{curves of}} {{a cluster of}} closely spaced rods supported by a thin plate are characterised by subwavelength bandgaps and slow group velocities induced by local resonance effects. A recent analytical study [Williams, Roux, Rupin, and Kuperman (2015). Phys. Rev. B 91, 104307], has shown how the slow velocity branch depends, amongst other parameters, on {{the height of the}} rods that make up the cluster. Such metamaterial, offering easy-to-tune spatial velocity gradients, is a perfect candidate for building gradient index lenses such as Luneburg, Maxwell, and 90 ° rotating. Here theoretical results are combined with numerical simulations to design and test metalenses for flexural waves. The lenses are obtained by tuning the height of the cluster of rods such that they provide the required refractive index profile. Snapshots and videos from three-dimensional numerical simulations in a narrow band centered at ∼ 4 [*]kHz are used to analyse the performances of three types of gradient index <b>metalens</b> (Luneburg, Maxwell, and 90 ° rotating) ...|$|E
40|$|Nanostructured metasurfaces offer unique {{capabilities}} {{for local}} {{control of the}} phase and amplitude of transmitted and reflected optical waves. Based on this potential, {{a large number of}} metasurfaces have been proposed in recent years as alternatives to standard optical elements. In most cases, however, these elements suffer from large chromatic aberrations, thus limiting their usefulness for multi-wavelength or broadband applications. Here, in order to alleviate and correct the chromatic aberrations of individual diffractive elements, we introduce dense vertical stacking of independent metasurfaces, where each layer comprises a different material, and is optimally designed for a different band within the visible spectrum. Using this approach, we demonstrate the first triply RGB achromatic <b>metalens</b> in the visible range and perform color imaging with this lens. We further demonstrate functional beam shaping by constructing a self-aligned integrated element for Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy and a lens that provides anomalous dispersive focusing. These demonstrations lead the way to the realization of superachromatic ultrathin optical elements and multiple functional operations, all in in a single nanostructured ultrathin element...|$|E
