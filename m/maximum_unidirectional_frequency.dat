The existence of unidirectional surface plasmons in the nonreciprocal graphene-based gyrotropic interfaces has been demonstrated theoretically. By efficiently controlling the chemical potential of graphene, the <b>unidirectional</b> working <b>frequency</b> can be continuously tunable from THz to near-infrared and even visible. Particularly, the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>frequency</b> bandwidth can be 1- 2 orders of magnitude larger than that in metal under the same magnetic field, which arises from the superiority of extremely small effective electron mass in graphene.|$|R

Namely, photonic crystals with low symmetry such as the monoclinic crystal type considered here as well as with unit cells formed by the heterostructure of different photonic crystals show significant unidirectional electromagnetic response. In particular, we show that the use of scatterers with low refractive-index contrast favors the formation of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>frequency</b> gaps which is the optimal route for achieving unidirectional wave propagation...|$|R

For the first time, a 10 Gb/s Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) signal from an ultra-narrow linewidth laser was transmitted through a field-installed optical fibre with round-trip length of 124 km between Cork City and town of Clonakilty, without inline optical amplification. At the receiver, using coherent communication techniques and optical injection-locking the carrier was recovered with noise suppression. The beat signal between the original carrier at the transmitter and recovered carrier at the receiver shows a linewidth of 2. 8 kHz. Long term stability measurements revealed fractional instabilities (True Allan deviation) of 3. 3 × 10 - 14 for 1 s averaging time, prior to phase noise cancellation...|$|R
40|$|To achieve {{both the}} {{flexibility}} of software {{and the performance of}} hardware, we design a hybrid architecture for a TCP offload engine that is based on hardware/software co-design. In this architecture, the transmission and reception paths of TCP/IP are completely separated with the aid of two general embedded processors to process data transmission and reception simultaneously. We implement this architecture based on an FPGA that has two general embedded processor cores. In the experiments based on the gigabit Ethernet, the hybrid TOE has a minimum latency of 13. 5 μs. The CPU utilization is less than 3 %, which is at least eighteen times lower than that of the general gigabit Ethernet adapters. The <b>maximum</b> <b>unidirectional</b> bandwidth of the hybrid TOE is 110 MB/s − comparable to that of the general gigabit Ethernet adapters − although the embedded processors operate with a clock speed that is seven times lower than that of the host CPU. By using two embedded processors, the bidirectional bandwidth of the hybrid TOE improves to about 201 MB/s, comparable to that of the general gigabit Ethernet adapters, and a 34 % improvement over an experimental TOE implementation in which only one embedded processor is used...|$|R
40|$|It {{is highly}} desired {{to operate a}} joint time and {{frequency}} transfer over the exiting fiber-optic telecom networks with the commercial data transmission. Previously, we proposed a time transfer scheme based on bidirectional time division multiplexing transmission over a single fiber with the same wavelength (BTDM-SFSW), and an optical amplification scheme of single-fiber bidirectional-transmission unidirectional optical amplifier (SFBT-UOA). The effects of excess noises like Rayleigh backscattering etc. on the received time signals can be efficiently suppressed for an accepted timing jitter. Simultaneously, the bidirectional propagation delay symmetry can be guaranteed for an expected uncertainty without requiring complicated and expensive link calibration. In this paper, we propose a high-precision joint BTDM-SFSW based time and <b>unidirectional</b> <b>frequency</b> transfer over conventional telecom networks. A stable frequency signal is achieved by compensating the fiber temperature dependent phase variation according to the time transfer. The proposed joint transfer scheme is demonstrated over a 320 km fiber-optic telecom testbed with two 10 Gb/s data transmission channels. The time transfer stabilities (time deviation, TDEV) of 23. 2 ps/s and 5. 4 ps/ 10 ^ 5 s, respectively, and the frequency transfer stabilities (Allan deviation, ADEV) of 5. 4 X 10 ^(- 13) /s and 9. 5 X 10 ^(- 17) / 10 ^ 5 s, respectively, are reached. The measured bit error rates (BER) of the 10 Gb/s communication data are well below 10 ^(- 13) ...|$|R
40|$|Nonreciprocal {{components}} like circulators {{are often}} used to separate transmitting and receiving signals sharing a common antenna {{such as those in}} the front-end of a monostatic continuous-wave radar or a full-duplex radio that performs simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) over the same frequency band. In those systems, the isolation of the circulator is critical in preventing the receiver from being interfered or jammed by the transmitted signal. Classical ferrite circulators are essentially cavities supporting non-reciprocal resonant modes. They are intrinsically narrowband, bulky, and hard to be integrated on modern integrated circuits (ICs). In comparison, active circulators have been developed based on the nonreciprocal transfer characteristics of transistors. They offer small physical dimensions, versatile functionalities, and compatibility with IC technology. However, active circulators have generally limited noise and power performances which prevent them from being widely deployed in systems requiring wide dynamic ranges. Time-varying transmission lines (TVTL) such as Distributedly Modulated Capacitors (DMC) are transmission lines loaded with varactors whose capacitances are modulated by a unidirectionally propagating wave. They translate the direction difference of waves propagating on it into the difference in frequency based on its <b>unidirectional</b> <b>frequency</b> conversion property. In such way, TVTL can behave as a circulator and exhibit broadband isolation due to the non-resonant nature of the traveling wave structure. Positive-dB parametric gain may be realized during the frequency conversion process which helps to compensate for the circuit loss. In this work, a complete theory, based on (1) the distributed parametric effect on a TVTL and (2) the distributed capacitive mixers, is presented with emphasis on the theoretical bounds of the isolation and gain performances of the DMC. The DMCs implemented on Rogers PCB and on GaN MMIC are both presented with the measured results agreeing well with the theoretical derivations and the simulation results. Especially, the MMIC DMC has demonstrated experimentally verified positive-dB receiving (RX) gain and > 10 dB transmitting-versus-receiving (TX/RX) isolation over 0. 7 - 2. 5 GHz. Furthermore, a circulator prototype combining a pair of MMIC DMC units in a balanced architecture is assembled and tested. The balanced architecture offers a new level of isolation in addition to what is offered by a single DMC. More than 25 dB TX/RX isolation and less than 2 dB RX loss have been experimentally observed for almost one octave at 0. 95 - 1. 8 GHz...|$|R

40|$|Most {{inversion}} techniques {{described in}} the literature rely on the validity of ray tracing, which breaks down {{in the presence of}} caustics. The linearized acoustic inverse problem with constant reference velocity is analyzed in order to quantify the effects of a caustic in a probing wavefront on the scattered signal. When the sound velocity is perturbed by a localized, <b>unidirectional,</b> high <b>frequency</b> inhomogeneity, the surprising result obtained is that the energy in the scattered field is spread out if the perturbation is located on the caustic. This spreading of energy allows the construction of an oscillatory integral representation of the scattered field, which has the same form, whether or not an incident caustic is present. On the other hand, a sequence of localized high frequency sound velocity perturbations is constructed such that the size of the scattered signal relative {{to the size of the}} inhomogeneity becomes arbitrarily large as the support of the perturbation approaches the caustic. In regions where there are no caustics, a general inverse operator if found for smoothly varying reference velocities. This operator is shown to be equivalent to an inverse operator constructed by Beylkin (1985) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} phenotype of [poky] {{and other}} extranuclear Neurospora mutants {{is known to}} predominate over that of wild type in heteroplasmons. In the present work, we have investigated the interaction between wild-type and [poky] mtDNAs using {{as many as four}} physical markers to distinguish the two types of mtDNAs.

40|$|Adaptive {{divergence}} at the microgeographic {{scale has}} been generally disregarded because high gene flow {{is expected to}} disrupt local adaptation. Yet, growing number of studies reporting adaptive divergence at a small spatial scale highlight {{the importance of this}} process in evolutionary biology. To investigate the genetic basis of microgeographic local adaptation, we conducted a genome-wide scan among sets of continuously distributed populations of Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera that show altitudinal phenotypic divergence despite gene flow. Genomic comparisons were independently conducted in two distinct mountains where similar highland ecotypes are observed, presumably as a result of convergent evolution. Here, we established a de novo reference genome and employed an individual-based resequencing for a total of 56 individuals. Among 527, 225 reliable SNP loci, we focused on those showing a <b>unidirectional</b> allele <b>frequency</b> shift across altitudes. Statistical tests on the screened genes showed that our microgeographic population genomic approach successfully retrieve genes with functional annotations that are in line with the known phenotypic and environmental differences between altitudes. Furthermore, comparison between the two distinct mountains enabled us to screen out those genes that are neutral or adaptive only in either mountain, and identify the genes involved in the convergent evolution. Our study demonstrates that the genomic comparison among a set of genetically connected populations, instead of the commonly-performed comparison between two isolated populations, can also offer an effective screening for the genetic basis of local adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) {{with low}} levels of {{external}} pressurization and poor end sealing are prone to air entrapment, thus reducing the damping capability. Furthermore, existing predictive models are too restrictive. Single <b>frequency,</b> <b>unidirectional</b> load and centered circular orbit experiments were conducted on a revamped SFD test rig. The damper journal is 1 " in length and 5 " in diameter, with nominal clearance of 5 mils (0. 127 mm). The SFD feed end is flooded with oil, while the discharge end contains a recirculation groove and four orifice discharge ports to prevent air ingestion. The discharge end is fully sealed with a wave-spring that pushes a seal ring into contact with the SFD journal. The measurements conducted without and with lubricant in the squeeze film lands, along with a frequency domain identification procedure, render the mechanical seal dry-friction force and viscous damping force coefficients as functions of frequency and motion amplitude. The end seal arrangement is quite effective in eliminating side leakage and preventing air entrainment into the film lands. Importantly enough, the dry friction force, arising from the contact forces in relative motion, increases significantly the test element equivalent viscous damping coefficients. The identified system damping coefficients are thus frequency and amplitude of motion dependent, albeit decreasing rapidly as the motion parameters increase. Identified force coefficients, damping and added mass, for the squeeze film damper alone agree very well with predictions based on the full film, short length SFD model...|$|R
40|$|If {{electronics}} {{are ever}} to be completely replaced by optics, a significant possibility {{in the wake of}} the fiber revolution, it is likely that nonlinear materials will play a central and enabling role. Indeed, nonlinear optics is the study of the mechanisms through which light can change the nature and properties of matter and, as a corollary, how one beam or color of light can manipulate another or even itself within such a material. However, of the many barriers preventing such a lofty goal, the narrow and limited range of properties supported by nonlinear materials, and natural materials in general, stands at the forefront. Many industries have turned instead to artificial and composite materials, with homogenizable metamaterials representing a recent extension of such composites into the electromagnetic domain. In particular, the inclusion of nonlinear elements has caused metamaterials research to spill over into the field of nonlinear optics. Through careful design of their constituent elements, nonlinear metamaterials are capable of supporting an unprecedented range of interactions, promising nonlinear devices of novel design and scale. In this context, I cast the basic properties of nonlinear metamaterials in the conventional formalism of nonlinear optics. Using alternately transfer matrices and coupled mode theory, I develop two complementary methods for characterizing and designing metamaterials with arbitrary nonlinear properties. Subsequently, I apply these methods in numerical studies of several canonical metamaterials, demonstrating enhanced electric and magnetic nonlinearities, as well as predicting the existence of nonlinear magnetoelectric and off-diagonal nonlinear tensors. I then introduce simultaneous design of the linear and nonlinear properties in the context of phase matching, outlining five different metamaterial phase matching methods, with special emphasis on the phase matching of counter propagating waves in mirrorless parametric amplifiers and oscillators. By applying this set of tools and knowledge to microwave metamaterials, I experimentally confirm several novel nonlinear phenomena. Most notably, I construct a backward wave nonlinear medium from varactor-loaded split ring resonators loaded in a rectangular waveguide, capable of generating second-harmonic opposite to conventional nonlinear materials with a conversion efficiency as high as 1. 5 %. In addition, I confirm nonlinear magnetoelectric coupling in two dual gap varactor-loaded split ring resonator metamaterials through measurement of the amplitude and phase of the second-harmonic generated in the forward and backward directions from a thin slab. I then use the presence of simultaneous nonlinearities in such metamaterials to observe nonlinear interference, manifest as <b>unidirectional</b> difference <b>frequency</b> generation with contrasts of 6 and 12 dB in the forward and backward directions, respectively. Finally, I apply these principles and intuition to several plasmonic platforms with the goal of achieving similar enhancements and configurations at optical frequencies. Using the example of fluorescence enhancement in optical patch antennas, I develop a semi-classical numerical model for the calculation of field-induced enhancements to both excitation and spontaneous emission rates of an embedded fluorophore, showing qualitative agreement with experimental results, with enhancement factors of more than 30, 000. Throughout these series of works, I emphasize the indispensability of effective design and retrieval tools in understanding and optimizing both metamaterials and plasmonic systems. Ultimately, when weighed against the disadvantages in fabrication and optical losses, the results presented here provide a context for the application of nonlinear metamaterials within three distinct areas where a competitive advantage over conventional materials might be obtained: fundamental science demonstrations, linear and nonlinear anisotropy engineering, and extremely compact resonant all-optical devices.
