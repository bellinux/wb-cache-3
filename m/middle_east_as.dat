5|$|Although {{the film}} was not a major success, former Research Fellow at Australia's National Film & Sound Archive Robert Cettl, in his 2009 book Terrorism in American cinema: an {{analytical}} filmography, 1960–2008 argues that the film reveals an alarmingly realist insight into US-Middle Eastern politics and terrorism since the 2000s, dealing with an al-Qaeda-esque terrorist organization and the conspiracy theories that some believe the US government is using the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>as</b> a cover-up.|$|E

5|$|When World War II broke out, the British {{shut down}} the orphanage and {{deported}} its German teachers. The British turned the compound into a closed military camp known as the Schneller Barracks, installing about 50 watchtowers and huts.

The Royal Army Pay Corps 90th Battalion occupied the barracks in the late 1940s.|$|E

The LTZ and S comes standard with a 3.6L Alloytec V6 and a 6-speed automatic transmission for the S and 4-speed for the LTZ, while the SS comes standard with 6.0L Alloytec V8 with the option of Active Fuel management.

They have also transported supplies and personnel as part of relief efforts following natural disasters in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and several other countries. The C-17s are highly regarded throughout the Australian military {{for their ability to}} carry large amounts of cargo across long distances, and the process through which they were acquired has been identified as an example of good practice in defence procurement.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1945, the {{division}} was pulled out of Germany and returned to England. It was initially intended {{to send them to}} India to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. The division’s advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India. Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength. Reinforced by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, {{the division}} was sent to the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>as</b> the Imperial Strategic Reserve.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, it {{had been}} planned to send the {{division}} to Burma to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese surrender, ended the war and changed British plans. The 6th Airborne Division was nominated to be the Imperial Strategic Reserve. Together with a Royal Air Force troop-carrier formation, they were to be located in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>as</b> a quick reaction peace keeping force for the British Empire. Initially No. 283 Wing RAF had two squadrons of transport aircraft, 620 and 644, available to provide troop transport.|$|E

One of the older volunteers of the battalion, he was soon promoted to the rank of corporal, and not long after was made a sergeant. The battalion embarked for the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>as</b> part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd New Zealand Division, in January 1940.|$|E

In March 1941 he was sent to the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>as</b> commanding officer of the 1st Australian Mobile Bacteriological Laboratory, and was soon engaged in the diagnosis of a variety of hitherto uncertain diseases. In July 1941, Ford's unit moved to Syria, where it was attached to the 2/3rd Casualty Clearing Station, providing the latter with the diagnostic capabilities of a larger general hospital, of which none were available.|$|E
5|$|In late 1990 {{consideration}} {{was given}} to deploying a squadron of F/A-18s to the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>as</b> part of an expanded Australian contribution to the Gulf War. The Department of Defence opposed dispatching the aircraft {{on the grounds that}} doing so would greatly strain the fighter force in Australia, and this option was not adopted by the government. As a result, the Hornets' only role in the war was to support the training of the Royal Australian Navy warships which were sent to the Gulf by conducting mock attacks on the vessels as they sailed from Sydney to Perth.|$|E

5|$|The 18th Battalion {{was formed}} in New Zealand in September 1939. After a period of training, in 1940 it {{embarked}} for the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>as</b> part of the 2nd New Zealand Division and then, in 1941, on to Greece. It participated in the Battle of Greece {{and later in the}} fighting on Crete. Evacuated from Crete, it then fought in the North African Campaign and suffered heavy losses during Operation Crusader. Brought back up to strength, in June 1942 the battalion participated in the breakout of the 2nd New Zealand Division from Minqar Qaim where it had been encircled by the German 21st Panzer Division. The following month, the battalion fought in the First Battle of El Alamein.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the battalion's other ranks were drawn from men who were originally part of the 8th reinforcement draft, intended {{to be sent to}} the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>as</b> reinforcements for the New Zealand 2nd Division. Sugden had previously been commandant of the Army School and was familiar with most of the graduates of the recent officer cadet training units. He selected many of these as the battalion's officers while a few other officers were sourced from the 3rd New Zealand Tank Battalion. Upon establishment, the battalion consisted of a headquarters company, three rifle companies and a machine gun/support company.|$|E
5|$|Their service {{records have}} added to their fame, ranging from their work as carrier escorts in World War II to their shore {{bombardment}} duties in North Korea, North Vietnam, and the <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> <b>as</b> well as their service in the Cold War against the expanded Soviet Navy. Their reputation combined with the stories told concerning the firepower of these battleships' 16-inch guns are such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity—and in particular, {{in response to the}} commissioning of the s—the United States Navy was inundated with requests from former sailors pleading for a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.|$|E
