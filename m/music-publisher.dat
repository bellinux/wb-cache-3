60|$|Archie {{took another}} drink of ice-water to steady his shaking nerve-centers, pulled down his waistcoat, {{straightened}} his tie, and then, with {{something of the}} air of a Roman gladiator entering the arena, tottered across the room. Lucille turned to entertain the perplexed <b>music-publisher.</b>|$|E
60|$|The <b>music-publisher</b> {{was talking}} with some vehemence {{on the subject of}} Labour. A recent printers' strike had bitten deeply into Mr. Blumenthal's soul. The working man, he considered, was rapidly landing God's Country in the soup, and he had twice upset his glass with the vehemence of his gesticulation. He was an {{energetic}} right-and-left-hand talker.|$|E
6000|$|... "One of my boyhood chums. A <b>music-publisher.</b> I'll {{get him to}} come along, {{and then}} we'll all be set. At the {{conclusion}} of the performance Miss--" [...] Archie winced--"Miss Spectatia Huskisson will be signed up for a forty weeks' tour, and jovial old Blumenthal will be making all arrangements for publishing the song. Two birds, as I indicated before, with one stone! How about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no. I {{knew her}} before she went on the stage. She was a stenographer in a <b>music-publisher's</b> office when we first met." ...|$|R
60|$|Today, for {{the first}} time, she {{revealed}} something of her woes. There was that about the mop-headed young man which invited confidences. She told him of the stony-heartedness of <b>music-publishers,</b> {{of the difficulty of}} getting songs printed unless you paid for them, of their wretched sales.|$|R
60|$|Friendships ripen {{quickly in}} Chelsea. Within {{the space of}} {{an hour and a}} quarter Annette had learned that the young man's name was Alan Beverley (for which Family Heraldic affliction she pitied rather than despised him), that he did not depend entirely on his work for a living, having a little money of his own, and that he {{considered}} this a fortunate thing. From the very beginning of their talk he pleased her. She found him an absolutely new and original variety of the unsuccessful painter. Unlike Reginald Sellers, who had a studio in the same building, and sometimes dropped in to drink her coffee and pour out his troubles, he did not attribute his non-success to any malice or stupidity {{on the part of the}} public. She was so used to hearing Sellers lash the Philistine and hold forth on unappreciated merit that she could hardly believe the miracle when, in answer to a sympathetic bromide on the popular lack of taste in Art, Beverley replied that, as far as he was concerned, the public showed strong good sense. If he had been striving with every nerve to win her esteem, he could not have done it more surely than with that one remark. Though she invariably listened with a sweet patience which encouraged them to continue long after the point at which she had begun in spirit to throw things at them, Annette had no sympathy with men who whined. She herself was a fighter. She hated as much as anyone the sickening blows which Fate hands out to the struggling and ambitious; but she never made them the basis of a monologue act. Often, after a dreary trip round the offices of the <b>music-publishers,</b> she would howl bitterly in secret, and even gnaw her pillow in the watches of the night; but in public her pride kept her unvaryingly bright and cheerful.|$|R
6000|$|Archie and Lucille lingered {{over their}} coffee. Mr. Blumenthal {{was out in}} the telephone-box {{settling}} the business end with Wilson Hymack. The <b>music-publisher</b> had been unstinted in his praise of [...] "Mother's Knee." [...] It was sure-fire, he said. The words, stated Mr. Blumenthal, were gooey enough to hurt, and the tune reminded him of every other song-hit he had ever heard. There was, in Mr. Blumenthal's opinion, nothing to stop this thing selling a million copies.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm a jolly old {{child in}} these matters, old lad," [...] he said, [...] "but why don't {{you take it}} direct to a publisher? As a matter of fact, {{if it would be}} any use to you, I was foregathering with a <b>music-publisher</b> only the other day. A bird of the name of Blumenthal. He was lunching in here with a pal of mine, and we got tolerably matey. Why not let me tool you round to the office to-morrow and play it to him?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Bishop {{was born}} in London, where {{his father was a}} watchmaker and haberdasher. At the age of 13, Bishop left {{full-time}} education and worked as a <b>music-publisher</b> with his cousin. After training as a jockey at Newmarket, he took some lessons in harmony from Francisco Bianchi in London. In 1804 he wrote the music to a piece called [...] "Angelina", which was performed at Margate.|$|E
50|$|Yet no {{more was}} heard for four years, until in 1937 Schott Music, the <b>music-publisher</b> in Mainz, sent {{a copy of}} the score to Yehudi Menuhin asking for an opinion. He played it through with Hephzibah Menuhin, and {{reported}} to the conductor Vladimir Golschmann in July 1937 that it was the historically missing link of the violin literature. Menuhin planned to deliver the world premiere at San Francisco, and announced it for 3 October, but was interrupted by the appearance of Jelly d'Aranyi, who claimed the right of first performance for herself {{on the basis of the}} spiritualist messages.|$|E
50|$|Ivanhoé is an 1826 {{pastiche}} {{opera in}} three acts with music by Gioachino Rossini to a French-language libretto by Émile Deschamps and Gabriel-Gustave de Wailly, after Walter Scott's {{novel of the}} same name. The music was adapted, with the composer's permission, by the <b>music-publisher</b> Antonio Pacini from Rossini's operas, namely Semiramide, La Cenerentola, La gazza ladra, and Tancredi in order to introduce his music to Paris. An examination of the score shows that Pacini also used music from Bianca e Faliero, Armida, Maometto II, Aureliano in Palmira, Sigismondo, Torvaldo e Dorliska, Mosè in Egitto and an amount of newly composed music including fanfares and the gallop that was later to become famous from its inclusion in Guglielmo Tell. The work was premiered on 15 September 1826, at the Odéon Theatre.|$|E
