5|$|The Liniers {{administration}} was popular among criollos, but not among peninsulars {{such as the}} merchant Martín de Álzaga and the Governor of <b>Montevideo,</b> Francisco Javier de Elío. They requested the Spanish authorities appoint a new viceroy. In {{the wake of the}} outbreak of the Peninsular War, de Elío created the Junta of <b>Montevideo,</b> which would scrutinise all the orders from Buenos Aires and reserve the right to ignore them, but did not openly deny the authority of the Viceroy or declare <b>Montevideo</b> independent.|$|E

5|$|After storms, the Beagle reached <b>Montevideo</b> on 26 July 1832, {{and took}} {{observations}} for the chronometers. An attempt {{to call at}} Buenos Aires for information was thwarted by officials, then FitzRoy agreed a request for ship's crew (and Darwin) to briefly occupy a <b>Montevideo</b> fort to dispel a revolution. On 22 August, after taking soundings in Samborombón Bay, the Beagle began survey work down the coast from Cape San Antonio.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires and <b>Montevideo</b> {{successfully}} resisted two British invasions. In 1806, a small British army led by William Carr Beresford seized Buenos Aires {{for a brief}} time; a Montevidean army led by Santiago de Liniers liberated the city. The following year, {{a larger}} army seized <b>Montevideo,</b> but was overwhelmed {{by the forces of}} Buenos Aires; the invaders capitulated and returned <b>Montevideo</b> to the viceroyalty. There was no aid from Spain during either invasion. Liniers organized criollo militias during the preparations for the second invasion, in spite of the prohibition against them. The Patricios Regiment, led by Cornelio Saavedra, was the biggest criollo army. These events gave criollos military power and political influence {{that they did not have}} before and, since the victory was achieved without any help from Spain, it boosted criollo confidence in their independent capabilities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Montevideo,</b> {{which had}} a {{historical}} rivalry with Buenos Aires, opposed the Primera Junta and the Council of Regency declared it the new capital of the Viceroyalty, along with Francisco Javier de Elío as the new Viceroy. The city was well defended, so it could easily resist an invasion. Peripheral cities in the Banda Oriental acted contrary to Montevideo's will and supported the Buenos Aires Junta. José Gervasio Artigas led them, and kept <b>Montevideo</b> under siege. The final defeat of the Montevidean royalists {{was carried out by}} Carlos María de Alvear and William Brown.|$|E
5|$|Months later, on 20 January 1818, Marques de Sousa was enlisted {{into the}} army as a cadet in the 1st Regiment of Light Cavalry in the Division of Royal Volunteers. The {{regiment}} had been deployed to <b>Montevideo,</b> the largest town in the Banda Oriental. He fought in the Battle of Pando on 30 March and in the Battle of Manga near <b>Montevideo</b> on 1 April. Successful in both battles, on 24 June {{he was promoted to}} alferes (equivalent to a modern-day second lieutenant) and named adjutant to the commander-in-chief, Lieutenant General Carlos Frederico Lecor (then Baron and later Viscount of Laguna).|$|E

5|$|The Allied army {{continued}} to make {{its way to the}} assembly point at Gualeguaichu. Urquiza and his cavalry traveled overland from <b>Montevideo,</b> while the infantry and artillery were carried by Brazilian warships up the Uruguay River. After meeting up, they marched west until they reached the city of Diamante {{on the east side of}} the Paraná River in the middle of December 1851. Eugenio Garzón and his the Uruguayan troops were taken from <b>Montevideo</b> up to Potrero Perez by Brazilian warships and continued on foot until arriving at Diamante on 30 December 1851, when all the Allied forces were finally reunited.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{garrison}} in <b>Montevideo,</b> {{the capital}} of Cisplatina (then Brazil's southernmost province), {{was the last to}} surrender. In 1825, secessionists in the province rebelled. The United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (later Argentina) attempted to annex Cisplatina. Brazil declared war, triggering the Cisplatine War. The Emperor's Battalion, to which Luís Alves was attached, was sent to guard <b>Montevideo,</b> then besieged by rebel forces. Luís Alves fought in engagements against the insurgents during 1827 (7 February, 5 July, 7 July, 14 July, 5 August and 7 August).|$|E

5|$|As the {{situation}} deteriorated, the Brazilian government mobilized army units from {{other regions of}} the Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 men from the Brazilian province of Rio de Janeiro disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. Paranhos, along with Tamandaré, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against <b>Montevideo.</b> It was apparent that the Paraguayans would take too long to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped that the foreign powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in <b>Montevideo</b> whether they would provide military assistance to him and his government, none responded positively. João Propício Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the Santa Lucía River near <b>Montevideo.</b> On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of Colonia del Sacramento, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Brazil's {{involvement}} in the Uruguayan civil war also began to deepen. Luis Alves de Lima e Silva, the Count of Caxias, assumed the presidency (governorship) of Rio Grande do Sul and the command of the four Brazilian Army divisions headquartered in the province. Beginning in 1849, the Imperial government directly assisted the besieged Uruguayan government of Colorados in <b>Montevideo,</b> and on 6 September 1850 the Uruguayan representative Andres Lamas {{signed an agreement with}} Irineu Evangelista de Sousa to transfer money to the <b>Montevideo</b> government through his bank. On 16 March 1851, the Empire of Brazil openly declared its support of Colorado government of Uruguay against Oribe, something it had been covertly doing for more than two years. This did not please the Argentine government, and it began mobilizing for war.|$|E
5|$|<b>Montevideo,</b> on {{the other}} shore of the Río de la Plata, was still a royalist stronghold. José Rondeau laid siege to it, but the Montevidean navy eluded it by pillaging nearby cities. San Martín was sent with the new Regiment to watch the {{activities}} in the Paraná River shore.|$|E

5|$|Rosas was {{determined}} to restore Argentine suzerainty over Uruguay and take revenge on Gonçalves. A series of interventions resulted. In 1839 an army led by Lavalleja, Oribe and Justo José de Urquiza, (Governor of Entre Rios) was quickly defeated by Rivera. At this point, Lavalleja {{turned his back on}} the conflict and played no further part in the civil war. Rosas sent another army of Argentines and Uruguayans in 1845, led by Oribe and Urquiza, and this time defeated Rivera's forces, slaughtering the survivors. Rivera {{was one of the few}} who managed to escape, and went into exile in Rio de Janeiro. What remained of Rivera's Colorados held power only in the country's capital <b>Montevideo</b> as Oribe's forces began the Great Siege of <b>Montevideo.</b> The violence in Uruguay escalated, with Oribe's men killing more than 17,000 Uruguayans and 15,000 Argentinians during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Central Junta {{replaced}} Liniers {{with the}} naval officer Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, {{a veteran of}} the Battle of Trafalgar, to end the political turmoil in the Río de la Plata. He arrived in <b>Montevideo</b> in June 1809 for the handover. Manuel Belgrano proposed that Liniers should resist on the grounds that he had been confirmed as Viceroy by a King of Spain, whereas Cisneros lacked such legitimacy. The criollo militias shared Belgrano's proposal, but Liniers handed over the government to Cisneros without resistance. Javier de Elío accepted the authority of the new Viceroy, and dissolved the Junta of <b>Montevideo.</b> Cisneros rearmed the disbanded peninsular militias, and pardoned those responsible for the mutiny. Álzaga was not freed, but his sentence was commuted to house arrest.|$|E
5|$|The battle did {{not have}} a notable {{influence}} on the war and did not prevent further pillage. <b>Montevideo</b> was finally subdued by Admiral Brown during the Second Banda Oriental campaign. Antonio Zabala, the leader of the Montevidean army, served under San Martín during the crossing of the Andes years later.|$|E

5|$|After his exile, Larrea {{moved to}} Bordeaux in France, and did {{business}} {{with some of}} his old associates. He continued correspondence with Bernardino Rivadavia, and in 1818 he moved to <b>Montevideo,</b> under Brazilian control at that time, and strengthened his contacts in Buenos Aires from there. He was finally able to return to Buenos Aires in 1822 due to the oblivion law.|$|E
5|$|Although Buenos Aires had {{suffered}} a difficult period in its war for independence, its prospects were improving by 1812. Even though the defeats of Manuel Belgrano during the Paraguay campaign and Juan José Castelli in the first Upper Peru campaign had generated a political crisis, Belgrano's victory at Tucuman had given new fresh hope to the revolution, which would be strengthened shortly afterwards with the victory at the Battle of Salta. <b>Montevideo,</b> capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata since the May Revolution, was under siege by both an army from Buenos Aires led by José Rondeau and an Uruguayan one led by José Gervasio Artigas. The city, however, maintained its naval supremacy over Buenos Aires and their ships raided the coasts of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers to gather supplies, despite the siege. <b>Montevideo</b> organized a navy to destroy the gun batteries at Rosario and Diamante, two population centers along the Parana, but were prevented from doing so as Buenos Aires dismantled them knowing {{that they could not}} defend them.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian {{independence}} did {{not meet}} with unanimous approval in the south. Part of the army, led by Dom Álvaro de Macedo (later Count of Ilha da Madeira), entrenched itself in <b>Montevideo</b> and remained loyal to Portugal. The town was besieged by forces under Laguna. Following his return from the imperial capital, Marques de Sousa served under his father's command, {{taking part in the}} siege and later fighting in the successful Battle of Las Piedras on 18 May 1823. In early 1824, Macedo and his men surrendered. The end of the Brazilian War of Independence came at a cost for Marques de Sousa. His father was mysteriously murdered with poison in <b>Montevideo</b> on 21 November 1824, leaving him the head of his family at age 20, as his paternal grandfather had died (of old age) on 22 April 1822. He was promoted to lieutenant (modern-day first lieutenant) on 1 December 1824 for his acts of bravery during the war.|$|E
50|$|Born in {{the city}} of Buenos Aires, Argentina, he served as Rabbi of <b>Montevideo's</b> Ashkenazi Community (Comunidad Israelita del Uruguay) from 1977 until 1993. This {{position}} has always been considered as Chief Rabbi of the entire Uruguayan Jewish community.|$|R
