Manet's Chez Tortoni was also stolen from its location in the Blue Room. <b>Motion</b> <b>detector</b> records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12:27a.m. and again at 12:53a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol. The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W. Grindle's chair near the front desk. The thieves made two trips to their car with artwork during the theft, which lasted 81 minutes. Before leaving, they visited the guards once more, telling them [...] "You’ll be hearing from us in about a year," [...] although they were never heard from again.

We have fabricated capacitive free-standing cantilevers by screen printing sacrificial and structural materials onto a fabric substrate. In this paper, these devices are used as <b>motion</b> <b>detectors</b> which are mounted and tested on a human forearm alongside a commercial accelerometer, for comparison.

2500|$|Used in {{high end}} {{electronic}} fluorescent ballasts. This ballast applies {{power to the}} filaments first, it allows the cathodes to preheat and then applies voltage to the lamps to strike an arc. Lamp life typically operates up to 100,000 on/off cycles when using programmed start ballasts. [...] Once started, filament voltage is reduced to increase operating efficiency. This ballast gives the best life and most starts from lamps, and so is preferred for applications with very frequent power cycling such as vision examination rooms and restrooms with a <b>motion</b> <b>detector</b> switch.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the paper}} is to provide an optimal {{placement}} of sensors for inhabitant location tracking in smart homes, by using only <b>motion</b> <b>detectors.</b> In particular, <b>motion</b> <b>detectors</b> are binary sensors largely used in ambient assisted living applications because they are low cost, non-intrusive and privacy sensors. An approach to optimize the placement of <b>motion</b> <b>detectors</b> in a real home environment by adopting a two-dimensional grid is presented.

For example, the <b>motion</b> <b>detector</b> can be paired with the gateway to perform functions such as switching on a light at night when it detects motion; the window sensors can start or stop a connected fan as windows are closed or opened; in another example, users can set the gateway into alert mode with their smartphones as they leave the house, and the gateway would then send push notifications {{and turn on the}} automatic recording of a Yi Smart Webcam when the door/window sensor or the <b>motion</b> <b>detector</b> detects abnormal activity.|$|E
40|$|Background The {{difficulty}} of accurately assessing LLIN use has {{led us to}} test electronic data logging <b>motion</b> <b>detectors</b> to provide quantitative data on household LLIN usage. Methods The main movements associated with an LLIN when appropriately used for malaria control were characterised under laboratory conditions. Data output from <b>motion</b> <b>detectors</b> attached to the LLINs associated with these specific movements were collated. In preliminary field studies in central Cote d’Ivoire, a pre-tested and validated questionnaire was used to identify {{the number of days}} householders claimed to have slept under LLINs. This information was compared to data downloaded from the <b>motion</b> <b>detectors.</b> Results Output data recording movement on the x, y, and z axes from the data loggers was consistently associated with the specific net movements.

5000|$|The term [...] "false alarm" [...] is {{actually}} a misnomer, and is regularly replaced by the term [...] "nuisance alarm". When a sensor operates, it is hardly false, and it is usually a true indication of {{the present state of}} the sensor. A more appropriate term is nuisance, indicating that the alarm activation is inconvenient, annoying, or vexatious. A prime example of this difference is burglar alarms being set off by spiders.
