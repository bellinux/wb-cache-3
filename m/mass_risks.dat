40|$|This Article {{develops}} normative and doctrinal innovations to {{cope with}} a pivotal yet undertheorized question in most proposed class actions: assuming that a class has adequate representatives, how much variance among class members 2 ̆ 7 circumstances should courts tolerate? Class actions seeking monetary damages would be much less controversial if all class members were identically situated. In an imagined world of perfect homogeneity, shifting from an individualized to an aggregative mode of adjudication would promote efficiency, mitigate collective action problems, and counterbalance defendants 2 ̆ 7 inherent economies-of-scale without sacrificing accuracy or redistributing entitlements among class members. In the real world, however, most classes encompass at least partially heterogeneous claims spread across a spectrum of merit and economic value. This diversity creates opportunities for strategic behavior that can distort the outcome of trials or of settlements negotiated in the shadow of trial. The Article defines three phenomena that create such distortions: cherry-picking, claim fusion, and ad-hoc lawmaking. The potentially mischievous consequences of heterogeneity in class actions suggest that courts should have a normative theory and doctrinal mechanism to distinguish between acceptable and excessive diversity among proposed class members. The Article addresses the normative question by introducing and justifying three principles to structure certification criteria: finality, fidelity, and feasibility. The Article then applies these principles to assess the forty-year-old predominance standard that currently governs how courts decide whether to certify diverse damages classes. This analysis reveals that the predominance standard is conceptually incoherent and that widely-cited doctrine applying it is normatively unsound. To fill the gatekeeping function that the predominance standard ineffectively attempts, the Article proposes a new resolvability test for courts to apply when deciding if a class action would be an appropriate procedural vehicle for adjudicating diverse claims and defenses. The proposed test would permit certification of class actions seeking money damages only when: The court has a feasible plan to answer all disputed questions of law and fact that must be resolved before entering judgment for or against class members under the law governing each class member 2 ̆ 7 s claim and applicable defenses. The Article then discusses broader implications of its proposal that highlight a dynamic relationship between substantive and procedural constraints on regulation of <b>mass</b> <b>risks...</b>|$|E

Methods : 50 elderly patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic neuropathy (NPD) participated in this study. Risk of falling was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Fear of falling was assessed {{by means of the}} Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I). Muscle mass was assessed by tetrapolar bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and Janssen's equation. Subjects were divided into two groups: one with a history of falls in the six months before study enrollment (G 1) and the other without history of falls (G 2). Results : There were statistically significant differences between G 1 and G 2 regarding lean body mass (p < 0. 05), risk of falls as measured by the BBS (p < 0. 01), and fear of falling as measured by the FES-I (p < 0. 01).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: For a fixed weight, a wider bone of {{standardised}} {{length is}} stiffer. But moving the cortices {{away from the}} centre of <b>mass</b> <b>risks</b> creating structural (elastic) instability, and hip fractures have been postulated to occur {{as a consequence of}} buckling of the thinned supero-lateral femoral neck cortex during a fall. We hypothesised that stereotyped physical activity (e. g., walking) may help conserve bending resistance (section modulus, Z) through redistribution of bone tissue, but it might be at the expense of supero-lateral cortical stability. METHODS: Hip structural analysis (HSA) software applied to DXA scans was used to derive measurements of section modulus and distances of a cross-section's centre of mass from the supero-lateral cortical margin (lateral distance, in cm). DXA scans were obtained on 1361 {{men and women in the}} EPIC-Norfolk population-based prospective cohort study. Up to 4 repeat DXA scans were done in 8 years of follow-up. Weight, height and activities of daily living were assessed on each occasion. A detailed physical activity and lifestyle questionnaire was administered at baseline. The lateral distance was measured on three narrow cross-sections with good precision: narrow neck (NN, coefficient of variation 2. 6 %), intertrochanter (IT) and shaft (S). A linear mixed model was used to assess associations with predictors. RESULTS: Ageing was associated with medial shifting of the centre of mass, so that lateral distance increased. Both greater weight and height were associated with greater lateral distance (P 1 h/day (P= 0. 025), weekly time spent on moderate impact activity (P= 0. 003), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (NN and IT, P< 0. 026) and lifetime physical activity (IT, P< 0. 0001) were associated with higher lateral distance. However, after adjusting for these variables, activities of daily living scores (NN, P< 0. 0001) and weekly time spent on low impact hip flexing activities were associated with shorter lateral distance (P= 0. 001). Greater baseline lateral distance was significantly associated with increased risk of subsequent hip fracture (n= 26) in females (P< 0. 05, all regions) independently of age, height and bone mineral content. CONCLUSION: The age-related shift medially of the centre of mass of the femoral neck and trochanter may have adverse effects on fracture resistance in the event of a fall, so compromising the beneficial effects of walking on fitness, strength and risk of falling. The role of more diverse physical activity patterns in old age that impose loading on the supero-lateral cortex of the femur, involving for example hip flexion and stretching, needs investigation for their ability to correct this medial shifting of the centre of mass...|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of jeopardized myocardial mass {{is important in}} defining the effect of interventions during myocardial infarction. To quantitate the in vivo <b>mass</b> at <b>risk,</b> 2 -dimensional echocardiography (2 -D echo) and thallium- 201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed in 10 closed-chest dogs after circumflex coronary artery occlusion. The 2 -D images were manually digitized to compute left ventricular (LV) mass using a modified Simpson's rule algorithm. This measure of LV mass correlated well with the actual LV mass (r = 0. 97). Perfused myocardial mass was estimated from thallium SPECT images 4 hours after occlusion using a region-growing algorithm. After the dogs were killed, the jeopardized mass was outlined using a dual perfusion staining technique using triphenyltetrazolium chloride and Evans blue dye. The actual perfused mass was well estimated by the thallium images (r = 0. 96). The noninvasively determined <b>mass</b> at <b>risk</b> was calculated as: 2 -D mass [...] thallium SPECT mass, and correlated well with the pathologically determined <b>mass</b> at <b>risk</b> (r = 0. 91).

This thesis explores the requirements and offers potential architectures and component selection to satisfy the Army Aviation Ground Power Unit requirements while increasing value. Using the current system as a baseline, alternatives were compared using performance, mass, envelope, reliability, and life cycle costs. The power plant proved to be the most important component in the architectures examined.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{widespread}} belief that testosterone supplementation {{increases the risk of}} atherosclerotic heart disease, evidence to support this premise is lacking. Although supraphysiological doses of testosterone, such as those used by athletes and recreational body builders, decrease plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, replacement doses of testosterone have had only a modest or no effect on plasma HDL in placebo-controlled trials. In epidemiological studies, serum total and free testosterone concentrations have been inversely correlated with intra-abdominal fat <b>mass,</b> <b>risk</b> of coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Testosterone administration to middle-aged men is associated with decreased visceral fat and glucose concentrations and increased insulin sensitivity.

40|$|CONTEXT: Alcoholism may {{interfere}} with nutritional status, but reports are often troubled by uncertainties about ingested diet and organ function, {{as well as by}} ongoing abuse and associated conditions. OBJECTIVE: To identify nutritional and body compartment changes in stable alcoholics without confounding clinical and dietetic variables, a prospective observational pilot study was designed. Three well-matched populations were considered: subjects with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, alcoholics without visceral disease, and healthy never-drinking adults (controls). METHODS: Subjects (n = 60) were asymptomatic males with adequate diet, no superimposed disease or complication, and alcohol-free for at least 6 months. After exclusions, 48 patients were compared. Variables encompassed dietary recall, bioimpedance analysis, biochemical profile and inflammatory markers. Main outcome measures were body fat, lean body mass, serum lipids, C-reactive protein, and selected minerals and vitamins. RESULTS: Both alcoholic populations suffered from reduced lean body mass (P = 0. 001), with well-maintained body fat. Magnesium was depleted, and values of vitamin D and B 12 correlated with alcohol abuse. LDL and total cholesterol was increased in alcoholics without pancreatitis (P = 0. 04), but not in those with visceral damage. C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A correlated with duration of excessive drinking (P = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Undernutrition (diminished lean body <b>mass,</b> <b>risk</b> of magnesium and vitamin deficiencies) contrasted with dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk.

Epidemiological characteristics of Taipei’s outbreak were analyzed from 461 sampled AHC cases. Median time from exposure to onset of the disease was 1 day. This was significantly shorter for cases occurring in family clusters than in class clusters (mean 6 SD: 2. 663. 2 vs. 4. 3964. 82 days, p = 0. 03), as well as for cases occurring in larger family clusters as opposed to smaller ones (1. 261. 7 days vs. 3. 964. 0 days, p, 0. 01).

40|$|Summary We {{examined}} {{the relation between}} physical activity and endometrial cancer using data from a multicentre case-control study involving 405 endometrial cancer cases and 297 population controls. Estimates of recreational (i. e. active sport, walks and hikes) and nonrecreational activity (i. e. house cleaning, climbing stairs and walking or standing on the job) were obtained using interview information. After adjustment for age, study area, education, parity, years of use of oral contraceptives, years of use of menopausal oestrogens and cigarette smoking, recent recreational inactivity was associated with increased risk (RR = 1. 9 for lowest vs highest tertile). Similarly, recent nonrecreational inactivity was associated with increased risk (RR = 2. 2 for lowest vs highest tertile). Further adjustment for body mass and nonrecreational activity attenuated the association between risk and recent recreational inactivity (RR = 1. 2; 95 % CL = 0. 7 - 2. 0) but adjustment for body mass and recreational activity did not alter the association between risk and recent nonrecreational inactivity (RR = 2. 0; 95 % CL = 1. 2 - 3. 1).
