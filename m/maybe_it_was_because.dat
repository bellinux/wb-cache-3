[...] After the album was completed Parker later revealed that some of the more indulgent pop moments of the album were removed: [...] "Thankfully, those bits were culled from the final project. The big thing that was difficult to put a lid on was the excessiveness of really cheesy pop things. For whatever reason, I started to become obsessed with pop melodies and pop chord progressions. I fell in love with the disposable-ness of it. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> we had suddenly become involved in this indie scene, and a part of my personality was trying to reject whatever environment I was in; we were in love with the idea that people would hate it.

5000|$|Władysław Pachulski {{was born}} in Łazy, Lublin Voivodeship, eastern Poland in 1855 or 1857, to a poor family. [...] He studied at the Moscow Conservatory {{and one of his}} {{teachers}} there for some time was Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. In 1877 Tchaikovsky left the Conservatory to become a full-time composer, with the ongoing financial support of a wealthy widow, Nadezhda von Meck. A very unusual feature of their arrangement was that they agreed never to meet, but would communicate only by letter or messenger.Another of Tchaikovsky's students, and later possibly his lover, was Iosif Kotek. On Tchaikovsky's recommendation, von Meck had engaged Kotek as her house musician. She had a succession of musicians in her coterie, none of whom lasted long, and before long Kotek too was dismissed. Pachulski succeeded Kotek, and he proved to be the only musician who ever gained a permanent place in her affections. [...] The difference was that he was not recommended by Tchaikovsky, whose opinion of his musical talents was always very low. Pachulski in fact made his own introductions to von Meck. On 4 January 1878, she wrote to Tchaikovsky saying that one of his former pupils (unnamed) was writing to her constantly, saying that life at the Conservatory was not the same since Tchaikovsky had left. [...] Just why she regarded Pachulski so favourably in the first place is not clear. His father Albert Pachulski managed one of von Meck’s estates, although it is not known whether he was already there at that time or came later. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Władysław showed the same love of Tchaikovsky’s music as she herself felt. Whatever her reasons, she offered him employment, and immediately began asking Tchaikovsky to provide him with lessons and advice. This he agreed to, because he felt an obligation to show his gratitude for her generosity towards him; he also felt it appropriate to make his assessments of Pachulski's skills as favourable as he could, without sacrificing his artistic integrity. [...] However, he soon found it burdensome and tiresome.|$|E
5000|$|Travelling {{has been}} a big part of Emmanuel Pahud's life from birth. His father worked for a U.S. company, and the family moved {{repeatedly}} during his childhood. However, this would only shape Pahud's international outlook for his future. Only six weeks after Pahud was born, his parents moved to Baghdad for one year. They moved again when he was 1 to Paris, where Emmanuel's younger brother was born. In 1972, they then moved to Madrid for two years, and in 1974, finally settled in Rome for four years. The Swiss-French Binet family, whose four children played musical instruments, lived in the same apartment building in Rome. The father (François) was a flautist who studied in Zurich and Paris but stopped performing in later years. At the age of four, Pahud first heard the flute. As the eldest son Philippe played [...] Mozart's Flute Concerto No. 1, it set the course to a remarkable chapter of Pahud's life. He recalls: I could hear the flute, the violin, the cello, the piano. I don't know why I chose the flute but <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the eldest son was playing it, so he was the one playing at the best level at that time - or because the father was also a flute player, so {{there was a kind of}} authority there. Anyhow, I said to my parents, [...] "I want to play the flute, I want to play the Mozart concerto that guy next door is practicing." [...] That Christmas, after receiving his first flute, Pahud began his first year of lessons with Philippe (who was only 15 years old) and the next three years with Phillipe's father, François.In 1978, at the age of eight, the Pahud family moved to Brussels, Belgium. Emmanuel then began studying at the Music Academy of Uccle in Southern Brussels. There he studied with Michel Moinil from 1979 to 1985. As he became more determined and focused on playing the flute at a higher level, Pahud began to study from 1984-87 with Carlos Bruneel, the then and current principal flautist of the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie opera house in Brussels. In 1985, Pahud won the National Competition of Belgium (le concours National de Belgique) and in the same year, he played his first concert with the National Orchestra of Belgium, performing the piece that inspired him 11 years earlier: Mozart Concerto K.313 in G Major. Pahud remained in Brussels until receiving his A-Level at the age of 17 and went off to finish his schooling in Paris. With the strong support of his family, he also received lessons with other of Europe's finest players, including Peter-Lukas Graf in Basel.|$|E
30|$|Just like system calls (syscall, for short) {{may be used}} by attackers to {{escalate}} privileges, hypercalls {{can be used by}} attackers to break virtualization’s isolation and escape virtual machines’ constraints and finally attack the hypervisors. For example, CVE- 2015 - 2045 allows local guest users to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors. As HInjector (Milenkoski et al. 2013) summaries, hypercall injection attacks can be classified into three types, namely invoking hypercalls from irregular call sites, invoking hypercalls with anomalous parameter values and invoking a series of hypercalls in irregular order. Besides these misuse cases, there are also vulnerabilities in hypercall handlers, which are studied in detail based on practical CVE vulnerabilities (Milenkoski et al. 2014 a, b), some of which are also repeated by reverse engineering the patches and creating POC codes. These vulnerabilities are divided into two types: implementation errors which include value validation errors and incorrect implementation of inverse procedures, and non-implementation errors. Besides, for open source hypervisors such as Xen and KVM, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that the source code is being tampered and stealthy malicious hypercalls are being added as backdoors to attackers. Even though there is no real such hypercall-based attack being reported, that doesn’t mean <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not important or <b>it</b> doesn’t exist. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the current security tools are unable to detect this advanced type of attack.|$|R

I am recalling this personal history to situate my own position in the understanding of gender mainstreaming. I am not of the Beijing generation, therefore my engagement with gender mainstreaming has been a reconstruction exercise; over the past seven years or so, as I have tried to understand the context in which gender mainstreaming was launched, and the high expectations of as well as the disappointments in it. In this effort I have mostly been inspired, rather than disappointed or frustrated. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> I have not lived the highs of the global get-together of women in the mid- 1990 s, that I also have not lived the disappointment in the same way as some of the Beijing generation.
