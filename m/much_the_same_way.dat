5|$|Adaptation is {{the central}} unifying concept in {{behavioural}} ecology.

5|$|On the {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Dom Pedro's wife Maria in 1777, Pombal was dismissed, and Dom Pedro and Maria ruled jointly in his place, using the partially completed Rococo palace at Queluz as a retreat from affairs of state in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as Frederick the Great used Europe's other famed Rococo palace, Sanssouci.|$|E

Releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery and climb, upon the deflection of the dive brakes.

These {{anisotropic}} self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, NY365's old routing between Harrietstown and Gabriels was {{designated}} as NY192A, a spur route of NY192. NY192A {{was removed from}} the state highway system on January7, 1980, when NY192 was rerouted east of Gabriels to follow NY192A. On March28, 1989, NY192 was eliminated in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as its spur route as NY86 was rerouted to follow NY192 through Gabriels to Paul Smiths.

5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Two {{series of}} {{nitrogen}} oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first are very reactive gases {{that can be}} made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide. Nitrosyl fluoride (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) behaves in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> and has often been used as an ionising solvent. Nitrosyl bromide (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: nitryl fluoride (FNO2) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.|$|E

5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves. They {{also use the}} cowpea paste as a {{supplement}} in infant formula when weaning babies off milk. Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> {{as they did in}} Africa, although many people in the American South considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption. A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork. Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen as a traditional Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E
5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in {{inactive}} forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks cellular respiration. Glucosinolates are activated in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause gastroenteritis, salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{outstanding}} example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England. Barns of this type {{were based on a}} longitudinal frame, with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to be both long and high, they experience high structural loads from the wind. They therefore have numerous internal braces, acting in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof. The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time, and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved.|$|E

5|$|It {{soon became}} {{evident that the}} Dominicans needed to {{reestablish}} themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, while de las Casas was in Spain, Francisco Marroquín, bishop of Guatemala, placed the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real. The Dominicans dedicated themselves to destroying indigenous temples and idols, and preached sermons with destructive imagery, such as from the Book of Revelation, that were more familiar to the Mesoamerican worldview. Saints were associated with animals, in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as the Indians identified themselves with nahual spirit-forms. Different Mesoamerican otherworlds were tied to Christian concepts, where the Mictlan world of the dead became Hell, Ihuicatl became Heaven, and Tlalocan became Paradise.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 season {{started in}} <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> with the Crusaders {{finishing}} fourth during the round robin stage and {{losing to the}} Bulls in the semi-final.

New Zealand recorded victories over the touring Ireland and Wales teams, Ireland losing their match by a record 66–28 after number eight Jamie Heaslip received a red card for kneeing McCaw in the head. The All Blacks went through the TriNations undefeated with {{the final game of}} the tournament against Australia marking McCaw's 52nd time captaining the All Blacks, surpassing Sean Fitzpatrick as New Zealand's most-capped test captain.|$|E

Another cut scene follows in which the crippled boat returns to a hangar in the sea with 'Evil' written above the entrance. The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water, now with mechanical claws attached, and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries playing the game.|$|E

50|$|Prevention of VAP {{involves}} limiting {{exposure to}} resistant bacteria, discontinuing mechanical ventilation {{as soon as}} possible, {{and a variety of}} strategies to limit infection while intubated. Resistant bacteria are spread in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>ways</b> as any communicable disease. Proper hand washing, sterile technique for invasive procedures, and isolation of individuals with known resistant organisms are all mandatory for effective infection control. A variety of aggressive weaning protocols to limit the amount of time a person spends intubated have been proposed. One important aspect is limiting the amount of sedation that a ventilated person receives.|$|R
