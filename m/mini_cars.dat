2500|$|The compact Rambler {{line was}} {{designed}} with several body styles, but the inaugural year {{was limited to}} a single model: a fully equipped fixed-profile 2-door convertible. The decision to bring the new car out first in a higher market segment with more standard features was a calculated risk by Mason. Foremost in this strategy was the need to give the new Rambler a positive public image. Mason knew the car would fail if seen by the public as a [...] "cheap little car". This was confirmed in small car comparisons in the media that described the [...] "well-equipped and stylish, the little Rambler is economical and easy to drive" [...] with no [...] "stripped-down" [...] versions, but in only high end convertible, station wagon, or hardtop (no [...] "B-pillar") body styles. He knew what Crosley was just finding out with its line of <b>mini</b> <b>cars,</b> and what the Henry J would teach Kaiser Motors; namely, that Americans would rather buy a nice used car than a new car that is perceived as inferior or substandard.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} {{of technology in}} computers, lighting, software, wireless data transmission, CCD-Sensors, Videoendoscope and more, was so rapid in the decades following 1995, that an architecture student in the 2010s can barely imagine how laborious model simulation and visualization was earlier.

At the EAEA Conference in Milan in 2013, a demonstration was made of a <b>mini</b> <b>car</b> with a micro-camera that could go into a model street, 2.2 cm wide, to record a video from the eye-level perspective in the car.
