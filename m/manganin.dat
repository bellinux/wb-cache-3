25|$|An ammeter shunt is {{a special}} type of current-sensing resistor, having four {{terminals}} and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the voltage drop is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two solid metal blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base.

Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a voltage drop of 50 mV at rated current. Such meters are adapted to the shunt full current rating by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.|$|E

50|$|An ammeter shunt {{allows the}} {{measurement}} of current values too large to be directly measured by a particular ammeter. In this case the shunt, a <b>manganin</b> resistor of accurately known resistance, is placed in parallel with the moving coil galvanometer , thus all of the current to be measured will flow through it. In order not to disrupt the circuit, {{the resistance of the}} shunt is normally very small. The voltage drop across the shunt is proportional to the current flowing through it and as its resistance is known, a voltmeter connected across the shunt can be scaled to directly display the current value.|$|E

5000|$|Shunts {{are rated}} by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500 A, 75 mV shunt {{would have a}} {{resistance}} of 0.15 milliohms, a maximum allowable current of 500 amps and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 millivolts. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50 mV, 75 mV or 100 mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100 mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, {{at which point the}} derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly. At 80 °C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120 °C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140 °C the <b>manganin</b> alloy becomes permanently damaged due to annealing resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. [...] If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg (grounded side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are Hall effect current sensors and current transformers (see clamp meters). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common accuracy of such devices are ±0.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%.|$|E

A precision abrasive trimming system for fine tuning the resistance tolerance of high current <b>Manganin</b> shunt resistors is proposed. The system is shown {{to be capable of}} reducing the resistance tolerance of 100 μΩ shunts from their standard value of ± 5 % to <± 1 % by removing controlled amounts of <b>Manganin</b> material using a square cut trim geometry. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), high current, and high temperature performance of the trimmed shunts was compared to that of untrimmed parts to determine if trimming had any detrimental effect on these key electrical performance parameters of the device. It was shown that the TCR value was reduced following trimming with typical results of + 106 ppm/°C and + 93 ppm/°C for untrimmed and trimmed parts respectively. When subjected to a high current of 200 A the trimmed parts showed a slight increase in temperature rise to 203 °C, as compared to 194 °C for the untrimmed parts, but both had significant temporary increases in resistance of up to 1. 3 μΩ. The results for resistance change following high temperature storage at 200 °C for 168 h were also significant for both untrimmed and trimmed parts with shifts of 1. 85 % and 2. 29 % respectively and these results were related to surface oxidation of the <b>Manganin</b> alloy which was accelerated for the freshly exposed surfaces of the trimmed part...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this program was to extend an {{existing}} <b>manganin</b> gage calibration curve, correlating stress {{as a function of}} change in gage resistance/gage resistance ({Delta}R/R), and obtain gage repeatability data from stripped <b>manganin</b> thin-foiled gages manufactured by the Measurements Group Inc., Micro-Measurements division. The experiments extended the existing calibration curve range from the current 0. 5 GPa to 6. 1 GPa by examining impact stresses of 0. 1 GPa in the lower range, and 8. 0 and 10. 0 GPa in the higher range. The <b>manganin</b> gages were embedded in ALOX (42 % by volume alumina in EPON 828 epoxy) material. A light gas-gun was used at Sandia National Laboratories Explosive Components Facility (ECF) to drive an impactor material, ALOX or Tungsten, into the ALOX target containing two gages in a centered arrangement. Tilt and velocity of the impactor were measured along with the gage outputs. A total of 11 tests were conducted using the same ALOX target material that was used when obtaining the original calibration curve. Two initial tests were completed using Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) as the impactor and target at an impact pressure of 3. 3 GPa for comparison of gage output with analysis and literature values. The installed gage, stripped of its backing, has a nominal thickness of 5 microns. The thin gage and high speed instrumentation allowed higher output resolution measurements than can be obtained with 76 microns <b>manganin</b> wire used previously.

The potential for using HTS films as thermal bridges has provided the motivation for the design and the analysis of a spaceflight experiment to evaluate the performance of this superconductive technology in the space environment. The initial efforts were focused on the preliminary design of the experimental system which allows for the quantitative comparison of superconductive leads with <b>manganin</b> leads, and on the thermal conduction modeling of the proposed system. Most of the HTS materials were indicated to be potential replacements for the <b>manganin</b> wires. In the continuation of this multi-year research, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the sources of heat transfer on the thermal bridges that have been neglected in the preliminary conductive model and then to develop a methodology for the estimation of the thermal conductivities of the HTS thermal bridges in space. The Joule heating created by the electrical current through the <b>manganin</b> wires was incorporated as a volumetric heat source into the <b>manganin</b> conductive model. The radiative heat source on the HTS thermal bridges was determined by performing a separate radiant interchange analysis within a high-T(sub c) superconductor housing area. Both heat sources indicated no significant contribution on the cryogenic heat load, which validates the results obtained in the preliminary conduction model. A methodology was presented for the estimation of the thermal conductivities of the individual HTS thermal bridge materials and the effective thermal conductivities of the composite HTS thermal bridges as functions of temperature. This methodology included a sensitivity analysis and the demonstration of the estimation procedure using simulated data with added random errors.
