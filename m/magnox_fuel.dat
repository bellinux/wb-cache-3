40|$|The fuel used in {{commercial}} nuclear power reactors is uranium, generally {{in the form}} of an oxide. The gas-cooled reactors developed in England use metallic uranium enclosed in a thin layer of <b>Magnox.</b> Since this <b>fuel</b> must be processed into a more stable form before disposal, we will not consider the characteristics of the <b>Magnox</b> spent <b>fuel.</b> The vast majority of the remaining power reactors in the world use uranium dioxide pellets in Zircaloy cladding as the fuel material. Reactors that are fueled with uranium dioxide generally use water as the moderator. If ordinary water is used, the reactors are called Light Water Reactors (LWR), while if water enriched in the deuterium isotope of hydrogen is used, the reactors are called Heavy Water reactors. The LWRs can be either pressurized reactors (PWR) or boiling water reactors (BWR). Both of these reactor types use uranium that has been enriched in the 235 isotope to about 3. 5 to 4 % total abundance. There may be minor differences in the details of the spent fuel characteristics for PWRs and BWRs, but for simplicity we will not consider these second-order effects. The Canadian designed reactor (CANDU) that is moderated by heavy water uses natural uranium without enrichment of the 235 isotope as the fuel. These reactors run at higher linear power density than LWRs and produce spent fuel with lower total burn-up than LWRs. Where these difference are important with respect to spent fuel management, we will discuss them. Otherwise, we will concentrate on spent fuel from LWRs...|$|R

40|$|Conducting {{ultrasound}} measurements in {{a nuclear}} environment necessitates a non-invasive and non-intrusive transducer design, capable of operating through thick walled stainless steel vessels. Decommissioning of legacy infrastructure requires transducers capable of retro fitting. Achieving spatial measurements across vessel or pipe cross-sections requires a tomographic approach, typically using multiple invasive or intrusive point source transducers with a fanbeam profile enabling point to multipoint measurements. Non-invasive point source transducers are unable to create fan beams within the vessel. Differing path lengths within the vessel wall combined with the ultrasonic velocity mismatch between the wall and vessel contents creates a plane wave ultrasound beam within the vessel which is unsuitable for tomography. The objective {{of this study is}} to create a non-invasive transducer array with the spatial diversity to allow point to multipoint measurement. A non-intrusive array design methodology, overcoming the inherent focusing effects of curved inner pipe surface, is proposed and illustrated through the design, manufacture and testing of an 18 virtual point tomographic array on a stainless steel 6 ″ pipe with 18 mm thick walls. The pipe transfers a slurry of corroded <b>Magnox</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> rods during decommissioning activities. A point to multi-point transducer arrangement is achieved through the creation of virtual sources, located on the inner surface of the pipe wall. Transducers are arranged at discrete angles around the virtual point such that refraction at the inner pipe surface creates multiple beams, each directed at individual, virtual points, to create point to multipoint measurements.

40|$|Nuclear fuel {{reprocessing}} schemes such as PUREX and UREX utilise HNO 3 media. An {{understanding of the}} corrosion of process engineering materials such as stainless steel in such media {{is a major concern}} for the nuclear industry. Two key species are cerium and chromium which, as Ce(IV), Cr(VI), may act as corrosion accelerants. An on-line analytical technique for these quantities would be useful for determining the relationship between corrosion rate and [Ce(IV) ] and [Cr(VI) ]. Consequently, a strategy for simultaneous quantification of Ce(IV), Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in the presence of other ions found in average burn-up <b>Magnox</b> / PWR <b>fuel</b> reprocessing stream (Fe, Mg, Nd, Al) is being developed. This involves simultaneous UV-vis absorbance measurement at 620, 540, 450 nm, wavelengths where Ce and Cr absorb but other ions do not. Mixed solutions of Cr(VI) and Ce(IV) are found to present higher absorbance values at 540 nm than those predicted from absorbances recorded from single component solutions of those ions. This is attributed to the formation of a 3 : 1 Cr(VI) -Ce(IV) complex and we report on the complexation and UV-visible spectrophotometric characteristics of this species.

40|$|A diverse {{range of}} wastes are {{generated}} from reprocessing spent light water reactor (LWR), advanced gas cooled reactor (AGR) and magnesium alloy (<b>Magnox)</b> clad uranium <b>fuels.</b> Much of this waste has a high beta gamma activity due {{to the presence of}} activation products and residues of spent fuel. As the processes for treatment and storage of the waste have evolved, so has the radiometric instrumentation used to monitor it.

BNFL Instruments Ltd has developed several generations of radiometric instrumentation to produce accurate and reliable measurements on current arisings of the waste as it is generated. These systems use high integrity software to generate a valid inventory for individual waste products as well as providing useful process control information and ensuring criticality safety. Similar measurement systems are also required for the characterisation of historic wastes which will soon be retrieved from storage facilities. These measurements present a greater challenge due to the highly variable nature of the materials and the length of storage (up to 40 years). Solutions have been developed based on the operational experience gained from process measurements. All systems are designed such that they are capable of providing fully reproducible and meaningful measurements within a plant environment...|$|R

A combination of the COSMO continuum solvation model and one or two shells of explicit water molecules is employed. Inclusion of only a single explicit solvation shell is unsatisfactory; open regions are present in the strontium coordination shell which would not exist in real aqueous complexes, and many optimised structures possess unavoidable energetic instabilities. Incorporation of a second shell of explicit waters, however, yields energetically minimal structures without open regions in the first strontium coordination shell. The most stable systems with one, two or three hydroxide ions are all 6 -coordinated with a distorted trigonal antiprismatic geometry, whereas systems with four OH− ions have a most stable coordination number of five. Transformation, via a proton transfer mechanism, from one coordination mode to another (e. g. from a system with two hydroxides bound directly to the strontium to one in which a hydroxide ion migrates into the second coordination shell) is found to be energetically facile.

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen some major {{developments}} in UK government policy related to the nuclear fuel cycle, culminating in the publication, through the Government Chief Scientist's Office, {{of a series of}} documents that set out the nuclear landscape in the UK up to 2050 and beyond. These documents deal primarily with the future of nuclear energy in the UK and the options for dealing with spent fuel from a possible expansion of new nuclear build. In parallel, management of spent fuel from existing and historical reactor operations (Magnox, AGR and Sizewell B) is the responsibility the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), whose strategy is: “to secure and subsequently implement the most appropriate management approach for <b>Magnox</b> and oxide <b>fuels</b> and, where possible, take advantage of these approaches to manage exotic fuels. Any remaining fuels will continue to be managed on a case-specific basis in a safe and secure manner pending subsequent disposition. The most cost-effective solutions for <b>Magnox</b> and oxide <b>fuels</b> will include continued and extensive use of our existing reprocessing and storage facilities. ” The NDA recently set its plans for dealing with spent fuel] and it intends to continue to reprocess until the planned closure of THORP; after which it will store any remaining fuel, pending packing for disposal. In addition to spent fuel, the NDA is responsible for the stockpile of civil separated plutonium, stored on the Sellafield site. A recent report published by the NDA reported the amount of separated Pu owned by the UK at > 100 t and the cost associated with treating the Pu, either through re-use as thermal MOx fuel or disposal as a waste, is between £ 2. 75 billion and £ 4 billion respectively. Subsequent work by the NDA and UK National Nuclear Laboratory considering options for re-use led to the UK government releasing a policy statement in late 2011 stating that the preferred option for UK civil plutonium was to re-use as thermal MOx. The UK is at a cross roads and decisions that are made in the remainder of this decade will set the path for the nuclear fuel cycle for most of the 21 st century. Should the UK continue with the present strategy of an open cycle, will partial recycle into MOx be sufficient to deal with the stockpile of civil separated plutonium or does the UK need to adopt a fully closed fuel cycle? These are the key strategic questions facing the UK and to answer each one and assess their relative merits will require R&D. The University of Leeds, together with many other UK universities, is working on a range of R&D programmes that will form the bedrock of developing the UK's nuclear strategy and providing technology options for implementation in the coming decades.
