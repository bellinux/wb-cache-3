5|$|Another {{exception}} to the general rule that courts will generally only judicially review errors of law is where action is taken or a decision is <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of material fact. In such situations, intervention by the High Court is warranted as the action or decision is factually unsustainable.|$|E

5000|$|The {{resistance}} to over turning adoption orders once <b>made,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> {{that to do}} so is unlikely to be {{in the best interests of}} a child, has been criticised by the Council of Europe as based on a misunderstanding of what is meant by the child's best interests ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that a NIFTP diagnosis cannot be <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> fine needle aspiration alone.

5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions had to be <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> compromise, cooperation and consensus.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans were}} varied {{again in the}} {{following}} years, but the design of Lake Burley Griffin remained based largely on the original committee's plan. It was later gazetted and legally protected by the federal parliament in 1926, based on a 1918 plan. However, Griffin had a strained working relationship with the Australian authorities {{and a lack of}} federal government funding meant that by the time he left in 1920, little significant work had been done on the city. A 1920s proposal to reduce West Lake into a ribbon of water was <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> flood safety. However, the Owen and Peake report of 1929 ruled that the original design was hydrologically sound.|$|E
5|$|Comparative {{analyses}} between metagenomes {{can provide}} additional {{insight into the}} function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health. Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made {{at the level of}} sequence composition (comparing GC-content or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or—in the case of low-diversity communities—by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset. Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or KEGG, and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance. This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of {{the community as a whole}} rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions. Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.|$|E
50|$|The {{raspberry}} orchardists sued Trevor Ivory in negligence and Heron J in the Nelson High Court {{found in}} their favour and awarded damages of $145,332 plus interest.

50|$|The song {{takes the}} form of a warning to would-be {{migrants}} to stay where they are (places of origin mentioned include Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia and Tennessee). <b>The</b> argument is <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> that there are already too many migrants, and not enough money or work available to make the hardships and expense of the trip worthwhile.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, {{due to the}} {{discovery}} of a name conflict with an unrelated crab species also originally described as Ocypode convexus by the Dutch zoologist Wilhem de Haan in 1833, <b>the</b> International Commission <b>on</b> Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) suppressed Quoy and Gaimard's Ocypode convexus. This ruling was <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> that <b>the</b> consulted specialists regarded Quoy and Gaimard's Ocypode convexus as nomen dubium.|$|R
5|$|The {{dramatic}} {{contrast between}} Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard {{of the advice}} of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.|$|E
