40|$|Abstract Background In many countries, {{the need}} for {{physical}} therapists to use standardised measures has been recognised and is recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Research has shown a lack of clinimetric knowledge and clinical application of <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments</b> in daily practice may hamper implementation of these guidelines. Objectives The aims of our study were a) to investigate the current use of <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments</b> by Dutch physical therapists; b) to investigate the facilitators and barriers in using <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments.</b> Methods To get a complete and valid overview of relevant barriers and facilitators, different methods of data collection were used. We conducted a literature search, semi-structured interviews with 20 physical therapists and an online survey. Results Facilitators are {{the fact that most}} therapists indicated a positive attitude and were convinced of the advantages of the use of <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments.</b> The most important barriers to the use of <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments</b> included physical therapists' competence and problems in changing behaviour, practice organisation (no room; no time) and the unavailability and feasibility of <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments.</b> Furthermore, physical therapists indicated the need to have a core set of <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments</b> with a short user's instruction on application, scoring and interpretation. Conclusions The main barriers are on the level of the physical therapist (lack of knowledge; not focusing on the use of outcome measures) and organisation (lack of time; availability; lack of management support). There seems to be a disparity between what physical therapists say and what they do. The majority of participating physical therapists indicated a positive attitude and were convinced of the advantages of the use of <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments.</b> However, the main problem for physical therapists is when to use which instrument for what patient (lack of knowledge). Furthermore, physical therapists indicated a need to compile a core set of <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments</b> with instructions concerning application, scoring and interpretation. Based on the identified factors, a number of strategies will be developed and evaluated in future studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aims of {{this study}} were to provide a {{selection}} of biomedical domains based on the comprehensive International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) core sets for spinal cord injury (SCI) and to present an overview of the corresponding <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments.</b> DESIGN: Based on the Biomedical Domain Set, the SCI literature, the International Spinal Cord Society international data sets, and the Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Evidence project publications were used to derive category specifications for use in SCI research. Expert opinion was used to derive a priority selection. The same sources were used to determine candidate <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments</b> for the specification of body functions and body structures using an example, and guiding principles were applied to select the most appropriate biomedical <b>measurement</b> <b>instrument(s)</b> for use in an SCI research project. RESULTS: Literature searches were performed for 41 second-level ICF body functions categories and for four second-level ICF body structures categories. For some of these categories, only a few candidate <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments</b> were found with limited variation in the type of <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments.</b> CONCLUSIONS: An ICF-based measurement set for biomedical aspects of functioning with SCI was established. For some categories of the ICF core sets for SCI, {{there is a need to}} develop <b>measurement</b> <b>instruments...</b>|$|R

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of the IEEE 1451 standards {{is the definition of}} TEDS for each transducer. The TEDS can be implemented as a memory device attached to the transducer and containing information needed by a <b>measurement</b> <b>instrument</b> or control system to interface with a transducer. TEDS can, however, be implemented in two ways. First, the TEDS can reside in embedded memory, typically an EEPROM, within the transducer itself which is connected to the <b>measurement</b> <b>instrument</b> or control system. Second, a virtual TEDS can exist as a data file accessible by the <b>measurement</b> <b>instrument</b> or control system. A virtual TEDS extends the standardized TEDS to legacy sensors and applications where embedded memory may not be available.|$|E
