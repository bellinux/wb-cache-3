This was a little contrary to my own experience, it is true, but as I had no means of seeing the interior clock-work of my own frame, like the somnambule, had I ventured to raise a doubt, it would have been overturned by the evidence of one who had ocular proofs of what she said, and should, beyond question, have incurred the ridicule of being accounted a malade imaginaire.|$|E

6000|$|This was disconcerting. The book gave {{three or}} four methods of buying boots; George had {{carefully}} selected the one centred round [...] "Mr. X," [...] as being of all the most courtly. You talked a good deal with the shopkeeper about this [...] "Mr. X," [...] and then, when by this means friendship and understanding had been established, you slid naturally and gracefully into the immediate object of your coming, namely, your desire for boots, [...] "cheap and good." [...] This gross, <b>material</b> <b>man</b> cared, apparently, nothing for the niceties of retail dealing. It was necessary with such an one to come to business with brutal directness. George abandoned [...] "Mr. X," [...] and turning back to a previous page, took a sentence at random. It was not a happy selection; it was a speech {{that would have been}} superfluous made to any bootmaker. Under the present circumstances, threatened and stifled as we were on every side by boots, it possessed the dignity of positive imbecility. It ran:--"One has told me that you have here boots for sale." ...|$|E

The action was brought {{by members of}} a contractors' union against a bricklayers' union and its various members and officers active in the controversy. The issue at hand was the lawfulness of 'boycotting'. Judge Buchwalter charged the jury that contractors:may combine for the honest purpose of benefitting their order by encouraging favorable terms to their employers in the purchase of material, and to procure contracts for such contractors as employ members of their union; but they become engaged in illegal enterprise whenever they agree to accomplish their purpose by threats, intimidation, violence or like molestation, either toward the apprentice, the expelled member, the non-union workman, the contractor and the employer, the <b>material</b> <b>man</b> or the owner who proposes to make a contract." ...|$|E

Attempting to undercut the most serious charge against Manning—aiding the enemy—defense lawyers called Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler, who testified that until WikiLeaks started publishing the <b>material</b> <b>Manning</b> leaked, even The Pentagon apparently viewed the anti-secrecy website as a legitimate journalistic enterprise. Thereafter, said Benkler, the public, the military and traditional news media perceived WikiLeaks as a group that supported terrorism.|$|R
5000|$|The percentage-of-completion method {{says that}} if the {{contract}} clearly specifies the price and payment options with transfer of ownership, the buyer is expected to pay the whole amount and the seller is expected to complete the project, then revenues, costs, and gross profit can be recognized each period based upon the progress of construction (that is, percentage of completion). For example, if during the year, 25% of the building was completed, the builder can recognize 25% of the expected total profit on the contract. This method is preferred. However, expected loss should be recognized fully and immediately due to conservatism constraint. Apart from accounting requirement, {{there is a need}} for calculating the percentage of completion for comparing budgets and actuals to control the cost of long term projects and optimize <b>Material,</b> <b>Man,</b> Machine, Money and time (OPTM4) [...]The method used for determining revenue of a long term contract can be complex. Usually two methods are employed to calculate the percentage of completion: (i) by calculating the percentage of accumulated cost incurred to the total budgeted cost. (ii) by determining the percentage of deliverable completed as a percentage of total deliverable. The second method is accurate but cumbersome. To achieve this, one needs the help of a software ERP package which integrates Financial, inventory, Human resources and WBS (Work breakdown structure) based planning and scheduling while booking of all cost components should be done with reference to one of the WBS elements. There are very few contracting ERP software packages which have the complete integrated module to do this.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} firms' {{output and}} factor demands before, during, and after episodes of lumpy investment. By using a rich employer-employee panel data set for two manufacturing industries and one service industry, {{we focus on}} simultaneous variations in output, capital, <b>materials,</b> <b>man</b> hours, labour productivity, and the skill composition and hourly cost of labour. Investment spikes are followed by roughly proportional changes in sales, labour, and materials, and significant increases in capital intensity. The changes in labour productivity {{that are associated with}} the investment spikes are small, which indicates that productivity improvements are not related to instantaneous technological change through investment spikes. Focusing on sectoral differences, capital adjustments are found to be smoother in the service industry than in the two manufacturing industries which may be related to differences in labour intensities between the industries.
