40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{hazardous}} effect of coal dust and to examine whether there still may be {{an increased risk of}} respiratory symptoms among underground <b>miners</b> such as working <b>miners</b> and retired <b>miners</b> in Zonguldak, Turkey. Current <b>miners</b> had to have worked for at least 5 years. Retired <b>miners</b> had worked 10 - 20 years. Both groups are historically associated with exposure to higher levels of coal dust. Some haematological markers of blood samples taken from coal <b>miners</b> were measured in this study. The variations on haematological markers such as hemoglobin, prolactin, lactat dehydrogenase of these <b>miners</b> were observed. There were higher mean values of hemoglobin levels in both current <b>miners</b> and retired <b>miners.</b> Ca+ 2 levels as releated with increase of lactat dehydrogenase increase almost 5 times. The differences in prolactin levels were releated with levels of haemoglobin, ferritin and anemia. There may be high risk of respiratory symptoms even in retired coal <b>miners.</b> Measurements of this parameters make an attractive approach for monitoring the effect of coal dust in coal workers. Coal dust together with aging factor effect accelerates to catch respiratory symptoms in the retired coal <b>miners</b> and working <b>miners...</b>|$|R

5|$|As the Great Depression hit the United States, Fairbanks bucked {{the poor}} {{economic}} trend. Thanks to the Alaska Railroad, large gold dredges {{could be brought}} in, and these returned the area's gold mines to profitability.

The <b>Miner</b> covered happenings in the gold-mining camps outside Fairbanks and was focused on areas outside the city. In 1939, Fairbanks radio station KFAR was founded, and it shared the Lathrop building with the News-Miner, which occupied the bottom floors of the building.|$|E

Liddell's participation in organised football began at age eight when he joined his school team, which had an average age of ten.|$|E
