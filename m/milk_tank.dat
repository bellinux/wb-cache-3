2500|$|Plate heat {{exchangers}} have also evolved {{as a result}} of the increase of dairy farm herd sizes in the United States. As a dairyman increases the size of his herd, he must also increase the capacity of his milking parlor in order to harvest the additional milk. This increase in parlor sizes has resulted in tremendous increases in milk throughput and cooling demand. Today's larger farms produce milk at a rate which direct expansion refrigeration systems on bulk milk coolers cannot cool in a timely manner. PHE's are typically utilized in this instance to rapidly cool the milk to the desired temperature (or close to it) before it reaches the bulk <b>milk</b> <b>tank.</b> Typically, ground water is still utilized to provide some initial cooling to bring the milk to between [...] A second (and sometimes third) section of the PHE is added to remove the remaining heat with a mixture of chilled pure water and propylene glycol. These chiller systems can be made to incorporate large evaporator surface areas and high chilled water flow rates to cool high flow rates of milk.|$|E

40|$|Background: Brucellosis is a {{neglected}} tropical zoonosis allegedly reemerging in Middle Eastern countries. Infected ruminants {{are the primary}} source of human infection; consequently, estimates of the frequency of ruminant brucellosis are useful elements for building effective control strategies. Unfortunately, these estimates are lacking in most Middle East countries including Egypt. Our objectives are to estimate the frequency of ruminant brucellosis and to describe its spatial distribution in Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Nile Delta, Egypt. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 791 sheep, 383 goats, 188 cattle <b>milk</b> <b>tanks</b> and 173 buffalo <b>milk</b> <b>tanks</b> were randomly selected in 40 villages and tested for the presence of antibodies against Brucella spp. The seroprevalence among different species was estimated and visualized using choropleth maps. A spatial scanning method was used to identify areas with significantly higher proportions of seropositive flocks and <b>milk</b> <b>tanks.</b> We estimated that 12. 2 % of sheep and 11. 3 % of goats in the study area were seropositive against Brucella spp. and that 12. 2 % and 12 % of cattle and buffalo <b>milk</b> <b>tanks</b> had antibodies against Brucella spp. The southern part of the governorate had the highest seroprevalence with significant spatial clustering of seropositive flocks in the proximity of its capital and around the main animal markets. Conclusions / Significance: Our study revealed that brucellosis is endemic at high levels in all ruminant species in the stud...|$|R
50|$|In {{dairy farming}} a bulk <b>milk</b> cooling <b>tank</b> {{is a large}} storage tank for cooling and holding milk at a cold {{temperature}} until it can {{be picked up by}} a milk hauler. The bulk <b>milk</b> cooling <b>tank</b> is an important milk farm equipment. It is usually made of stainless steel and used every day to store the raw milk on the farm in good condition.

40|$|ATP-bioluminescence assay {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the cleaning and sanitizing procedures of stainless steel milk contact surfaces. Surfaces of a raw <b>milk</b> transportation <b>tank,</b> a raw <b>milk</b> cooling storage <b>tank,</b> an equalization pasteurizing <b>tank,</b> a pasteurized <b>milk</b> storage <b>tank</b> and a pasteurized <b>milk</b> packaging <b>tank,</b> as well as a milk centrifuge were evaluated. The Relative Light Unit (RLU) using a commercial luminometer and mesophilic aerobic counts (CFU. cm- 2) on surfaces were determined. There were no significant differences (p> 0. 05) in RLU on the assessed surfaces before and after the cleaning and sanitizing procedures. Also, {{there were no significant differences}} (p> 0. 05) in CFU. cm- 2 on the surfaces before the cleaning and sanitizing procedures, whereas different bacterial numbers were found on surfaces after the hygiene procedures. The surfaces of the milk centrifuge, raw <b>milk</b> cooling <b>tank</b> and <b>milk</b> packaging <b>tank</b> showed the largest mesophilic aerobic numbers after the hygiene, reaching 2. 21, 2. 18, and 1. 21 log 10, respectively. The results demonstrated that there is no agreement among the techniques for classification of hygienic conditions of the evaluated surfaces, showing a non-direct relation between RLU and CFU. cm- 2. The ATP-bioluminescence method showed that 100 % of the surfaces were under inadequate hygiene conditions, while the plate count method detected only 50 %, based on the APHA's recommendation, and 33 %, based on the WHO's recommendation. High variations in RLU measurements were observed, suggesting the need for more than only one surface analysis. The ATP-bioluminescence is not a direct replacement for microbiological testing, but provides complementary information and should be used as part of an integrated strategy...|$|R

Due {{to the lack}} of studies of this topic, this study evaluated the microbiological conditions of raw <b>milk</b> cooling <b>tanks</b> on farms and characterized the microorganisms isolated from these tanks. Samples were wiped off with sterile swabs from seven <b>milk</b> cooling <b>tanks</b> in three different points in each tank. Mesophiles and psychrotrophic counts were performed in all samples. The isolation of Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus cereus and atypical colonies formed on selective media were also performed, totalizing 297 isolates.

The most widespread genus inside the <b>milk</b> cooling <b>tank</b> was Pseudomonas since {{it was not possible to}} associate this contamination with a single sampling point in the equipment.
