5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb penetrated the flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, {{but it was not}} a <b>major</b> <b>breach</b> of hull integrity.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck {{spent his}} final years {{composing}} his memoirs (Gedanken und Erinnerungen, or Thoughts and Memories), a work lauded by historians. In the memoirs Bismarck continued his feud with Wilhelm II by attacking him here, and {{by increasing the}} drama around every event and by often presenting himself in a favorable light.

25|$|Mr A.J.Harmsworth later {{purchased}} the canal (in 1922) {{and ran a}} number of boats {{on it for a}} mixture of limited commercial carrying and pleasure cruising. The canal was sold upon his death in 1947 and by 1950 was {{in the hands of the}} New Basingstoke Canal Co Ltd. This company continued the restoration of the canal (under the management of the General Manager, Mrs. Joan Marshall) but there was a serious setback in 1957 and a <b>major</b> <b>breach</b> in 1968. By the late-1960s it was essentially derelict despite volunteer efforts to improve the situation.|$|E
25|$|A <b>major</b> <b>breach</b> {{occurred}} in 1911, {{resulting in the}} canal being closed for nearly a year, and further breaches {{occurred in}} 1945 and 1946. The Aire and Calder applied to abandon the canal in 1947, and despite protestations from the fledgling Inland Waterways Association, {{the right to do}} so was granted in 1953. The aqueduct over the River Dearne was demolished immediately. The Barnsley Canal Group was formed in 1984, to campaign for restoration, eventually becoming the Barnsley, Dearne and Dove Canal Trust in June 2000. They are now part of the Barnsley Canal Consortium, which has commissioned a study which showed that restoration is feasible. A restored route would involve three diversions from the historic route, at Walton locks, near Cold Hiendley reservoir, and where the canal crosses the River Dearne.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the profits}} came {{as a result of}} the company acting as a carrier, rather than from tolls. In {{addition}} to running narrow boats on the canals, they had a thriving business carrying goods across the River Mersey, between Liverpool, Ellesmere Port, and Birkenhead. They made a healthy operating profit until the 1870s, but this then diminished during the next 30 years. They looked at upgrading the canal to take larger vessels in the 1890s, prompted by the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal, but this did not occur. They saw a brief improvement in their financial position in the early 20th century, but this collapsed with the onset of the First World War. Government subsidies sustained them until 1920, but rising wage costs and the 8-hour day resulted in them ceasing to act as a carrier, and the LNWR bought the company in late 1922. On 1 January 1923, the LNWR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), with the passing of the Railways Act 1921 (Grouping Act). The Montgomery Canal closed in 1936 after a <b>major</b> <b>breach,</b> and most of the canals were closed under the provisions of an abandonment order obtained in 1944.|$|E

The NRL announced the club would be deducted four competition points and the club would also be assessed a A$430,000 fine. Those four points would cost the team a place in the finals.|$|R
50|$|The floodwall {{along the}} 17th Street Canal’s east bank {{breached}} {{just south of}} the Old Hammond Highway Bridge. In addition, two <b>major</b> <b>breaches</b> occurred {{on both sides of the}} London Avenue Canal - one on the west side near Robert E. Lee Boulevard and another on the east side near Mirabeau Avenue. The Orleans Avenue Canal’s floodwalls did not breach.|$|R
500|$|The gaps, {{the longest}} of which {{measures}} about [...] long, {{appear to have}} followed {{the line of the}} hull plates. This suggests that the iron rivets along the plate seams snapped off or popped open to create narrow gaps through which water flooded. An engineer from Titanics builders, Harland and Wolff, suggested this scenario at the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry following the disaster but his view was discounted. Titanics discoverer Robert Ballard has commented that the assumption that the ship had suffered a <b>major</b> <b>breach</b> was [...] "a by-product of the mystique of the Titanic. No one could believe that the great ship was sunk by a little sliver." [...] Faults in the ship's hull may have been a contributing factor. Recovered pieces of Titanics hull plates appear to have shattered on impact with the iceberg, without bending.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, {{urban renewal}} {{projects}} were undertaken {{with funding from}} the federal New Town Program.

2500|$|Passing {{under the}} A495 {{road to the}} north of Whittington, it enters the parkland of Halston Hall, {{supplying}} a large ornamental lake. The hall is a red-brick country house, originally built in the 1690s, but altered for its owner John Mytton by Robert Mylne between 1766 and 1768. It is a grade I listed structure. The river briefly heads south to leave the park, and then turns to the east, where it is crossed by the Montgomery Canal. At this point it is below the [...] contour. The Perry aqueduct, which carries the canal over the river, was the scene of a <b>major</b> <b>breach</b> in 1936, which led to the canal closing. It was not reopened until 1987.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>major</b> <b>breach</b> of {{the canal}} {{occurred}} on 20 November 1911, when subsidence caused part of the aqueduct and the adjacent embankment to fail. Repairs were not completed until 10 July 1912, when the canal was reopened. The canal had to close for four months {{at the end of}} 1922 due to drought conditions. In 1934, the County Council installed an electric lift bridge at Royston. Traffic continued to fall, and maintenance costs increased as the effects of subsidence damaged the infrastructure, but the canal remained profitable until 1942. The following year, the Royston bridge was operated 856 times to allow boats to pass. Mottram Wood colliery was flooded on 13 June 1945, when another leak occurred near the aqueduct, and in 1946, [...] of water escaped from the canal on 22 November, flooding a housing estate and the surrounding countryside. The Aire and Calder applied to abandon the canal in May 1947, and although the fledgeling Inland Waterways Association campaigned for its retention, the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive (DIWE) expressed [...] "grave doubts as to whether {{it would be in the}} national interest to reinstate the waterway." [...] The DIWE then offered compensation to carriers who were affected by the closure, and the abandonment order was finally granted in 1953. The aqueduct was demolished immediately, as it was deemed to be unsafe.|$|E

2500|$|The canal {{continued}} to carry significant tonnages, which gradually decreased, from 138,117 tons in 1862 to 113,659 tons in 1882. After that, the decline was more rapid, dropping to 33,329 tons by 1893. By the 1890s, the railway owners had reduced maintenance on the canal, {{knowing that the}} Coventry Canal were unlikely to invoke their powers under the 1846 Act, since they too were in trouble. On 2 January 1918, there was a <b>major</b> <b>breach</b> in the canal when an embankment some [...] below Moira collapsed. The cost of reinstatement was £9,864, and the canal reopened on 23 July 1919. The upper section was increasingly affected by subsidence from the coal mining. Despite this, the Moira Coal Company shipped 20,807 tons along the canal in 1943, and the total tonnage on the canal that year was 43,733 tons. The owners, by now the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), tried to give the canal to the Coventry Canal company in 1944, but they refused it unless there was money to fund the maintenance. The [...] section from Moira to Donisthorpe was promptly abandoned, allowing the Moira Coal Company to mine under its course. Another [...] were closed in 1957, under an Act of Parliament obtained by the British Transport Commission, and the Measham to Snarestone section was closed in 1966, even though coal was regularly loaded there.|$|E
