25|$|Fiber with a core {{diameter}} less than about {{ten times the}} wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when coherent light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E

6000|$|... “Unexpected and peculiarly {{striking}} confirmations of inductive laws frequently {{occur in}} the form of residual phenomena, in the course of investigations of a widely different nature from those which gave rise to the inductions themselves. A very elegant example may be cited in the unexpected confirmation of the law of the development of heat in elastic fluids by compression, which is afforded by the phenomena of sound. The inquiry into the cause of sound had led to conclusions respecting its <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation,</b> from which its velocity in the air could be precisely calculated. The calculations were performed; but, when compared with fact, though the agreement was quite sufficient to show the general correctness of the cause and <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> assigned, yet the whole velocity could not be shown to arise from this theory. There was still a residual velocity to be accounted for, which placed dynamical philosophers {{for a long time in}} great dilemma. At length Laplace struck on the happy idea, that this might arise from the heat developed in the act of that condensation which necessarily takes place at every vibration by which sound is conveyed. The matter was subjected to exact calculation, and the result was at once the complete explanation of the residual phenomenon, and a striking confirmation of the general law of the development of heat by compression, under circumstances beyond artificial imitation.” ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{concentrates}} {{around to}} determine the velocities <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> (VOPs) in three phase medium voltage (MV) cables for different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> using high frequency measurements, {{which could be used}} for diagnostic purposes and design of communication through power cables. For this purpose, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurement techniques are applied. The measurements are taken on three phase medium voltage cables for different possible <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> by making different electrical connections. The experimental test set-up is modeled with lumped resistors and the relation between the actual and measured pulses is developed through correction factor. This transmission line modeling is helpful in determining the VOPs in three phase MV cables for different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> The relation between measured and actual pulses, in terms of correction factor, is used for more accurate results. The attenuation, phase constant, and VOPs are determined for different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> Finally, VOPs are compared for different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> for different cables to have an insight and for drawing some useful results.

Two distinct types <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> are reported; the first involves charge density variation within the plasma (body wave) and the second involves a perturbation of the surface of the plasma (surface wave).
