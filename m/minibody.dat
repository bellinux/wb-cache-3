40|$|Prostate {{stem cell}} antigen (PSCA) is a cell surface {{glycoprotein}} that has {{low levels of}} expression in normal prostate, bladder, and stomach, but is expressed in 83 - 100 %, and overexpressed in 40 - 100 %, of prostate cancers. PSCA expression {{has been shown to}} correlate with the Gleason score, seminal vesicle and capsular invasion, advanced clinical stage, androgen independence, MYC gene-amplification, and a poor prognosis. PSCA is also highly overexpressed in the majority of prostate cancer bone metastases (87 - 100 %) and many metastases to other sites (67 % liver, 67 - 95 % lymph node). ImmunoPET is a highly flexible imaging technique that can be utilized to image virtually any cell surface protein using radiolabeled antibodies or antibody fragments. This dissertation describes the use of a radiolabeled anti-PSCA A 11 <b>minibody</b> (scFv-CH 3 dimer, 80 kDa) for immunoPET imaging of PSCA expression in mouse models of prostate cancer and demonstrates the potential of the A 11 <b>minibody</b> for highly specific imaging of local prostate cancer and metastases in the clinic. In this work, 124 I and 89 Zr-DFO radiolabeling of the anti-PSCA <b>minibody</b> are compared. Imaging with both radionuclides showed specific tumor targeting in 22 rv 1 ï¿½PSCA and LAPC- 9 tumors and achieved high contrast imaging in both tumor models. However, 124 I- labeled A 11 <b>minibody</b> achieved superior tumor:soft tissue contrast and was determined to have higher clinical potential. A quantitative method of μPET imaging of both 124 I and 89 Zr radionuclides using recovery coefficient based partial volume correction was also established and validated. The PSCA promoter contains an androgen response element and expression of PSCA {{has been shown to be}} regulated by androgens in the mouse prostate and in human prostate cancer biopsy tissue. In the present work, treatment with the second generation anti-androgen MDV- 3100 was demonstrated to cause downregulation of PSCA in LAPC- 9 xenografts. In addition, 124 I-labeled A 11 <b>minibody</b> showed decreased uptake in LAPC- 9 xenografts treated with MDV- 3100 compared to vehicle controls suggesting a potential use for the A 11 <b>minibody</b> in imaging response to androgen deprivation therapy. The highest percentage of prostate cancer metastases are osteoblastic bone metastases and most clinical staging of prostate cancer metastases utilizes 99 m Tc-MDP or 18 F- Fluoride bone scans to image increases in bone turnover in response to these metastases. In this work we demonstrate that 124 I-labeled A 11 <b>minibody</b> has higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting LAPC- 9 intratibial xenografts than 18 F-Fluoride bone scans. The A 11 <b>minibody</b> binds only to human PSCA (hPSCA) and does not cross-react with the murine homologue mPSCA. In order to address the background uptake caused by endoge- nous hPSCA expression, the creation of an hPSCA knock-in mouse and imaging using the A 11 <b>minibody</b> in this model is described. We found a pattern of hPSCA expression in these mice similar to the pattern of normal expression in humans. Uptake of 124 I-labeled A 11 <b>minibody</b> correlated strongly with the expression of hPSCA, but demonstrated that the overall increase in background uptake of the A 11 <b>minibody</b> due to endogenous expression of human PSCA is minimal. The results presented in this work demonstrate robust targeting of PSCA expression by the A 11 <b>minibody</b> and clinical investigation of the A 11 <b>minibody</b> for imaging local prostate cancer and prostate cancer metastases is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although several {{therapeutic}} options {{have become}} available {{for patients with}} Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL), no therapy has been curative. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} CTCL cells overexpress the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR 4). Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, a xenograft model of CTCL was established and a recombinant adeno-associated viral serotype 8 (AAV 8) vector expressing a humanized single-chain variable fragment (scFv) -Fc fusion (scFvFc or ‘‘minibody’’) of anti-CCR 4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) h 1567 was evaluated for curative treatment. Human CCR 4 + tumor-bearing mice treated once with intravenous infusion of AAV 8 virions encoding the h 1567 (AAV 8 -h 1567) <b>minibody</b> showed anti-tumor activity in vivo and increased survival. The AAV 8 -h 1567 <b>minibody</b> notably increased the number of tumor-infiltrating Ly- 6 G+ FccRIIIa(CD 16 A) + murine neutrophils in the tumor xenografts over that of AAV 8 -control <b>minibody</b> treated mice.

30|$|In conclusion, {{this study}} {{demonstrated}} that chimerization of mAb 14 C 5 {{had little effect}} on the properties of the mAb. The characteristics of the 14 C 5 chAb are promising for RIT and monitoring, while the chF(ab') 2 and chFab 14 C 5 have a high potential for RID of cancer. In addition to these fragments, other Ab constructs could be created with improved characteristics for both RID and RIT. Smaller constructs, such as diabodies and nanobodies for example, provide high penetration into the tumor and a rapid blood clearance, which is highly advantageous for RID. Larger constructs, such as <b>minibodies</b> for example, provide longer target retention and could be used in RIT [41].|$|R
30|$|A new {{generation}} of PCa-specific tracers is being developed and tested that target tumor antigens that are unique to prostate cancer. These include ligands such as antibodies and small molecules that bind to specific sites associated with PCa growth; for example, the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Most new tracers are presently in the animal testing phase or early human testing phase. PSMA and PSA are being targeted with antibodies, such as 89 Zr-J 591 or 64 Cu-J 591 for PSMA [24] and 89 Zr- 5 A 10 for PSA [25]. Other PSMA ligands are 68 Ga-PSMA [26] and 18 F-DCFBC [27]; both tracers are already being tested on patients. Animal studies showed excellent imaging capabilities of 124 I and 18 F <b>minibodies</b> binding to the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) [28, 29].|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} shows potential of anti-PSMA imaging {{in patients with}} solid tumors. While the tumor types were not selected based on confirmation of PSMA staining, targeting of lesions was seen in all tumor types imaged in this study consistent with prior reports that showed PSMA expression in vasculature of these tumors [10, 11, 22]. PSMA-directed imaging and targeting of neovasculature in these tumors may play a potential role in developing novel therapies through direct use as a radioimmunotherapy agent or biomarker for assessment of efficacy of treatment, especially anti-angiogenic agents. Imaging time post-injection due to longer circulation time of the antibody and image quality related to single-photon-emitting radioisotope are both limitations of 111 In-J 591. Smaller anti-PSMA molecules, <b>minibodies,</b> or ligands directed to PSMA, preferably using PET imaging techniques, {{may be a more}} suitable approach in imaging these tumors. This approach also needs to be established in larger populations with a focus on specific tumor types.|$|R
40|$|The surface {{topology}} of the <b>Minibody,</b> a small de novo-designed beta-protein, has been probed by {{a strategy that}} combines selective chemical modification {{with a variety of}} reagents and mass spectrometric analysis of the modified fragments. Under appropriate conditions, the susceptibility of individual residues primarily depends on their surface accessibility so that their relative reactivities can be correlated with their position in the tertiary structure of the protein. Moreover, this approach provides information on interacting residues, since intramolecular interactions might greatly affect the reactivity of individual side chains by altering their pKa values. The results of this study indicate that, while overall the <b>Minibody</b> model is correct, the beta-sheet formed by the N- and C-terminal segments is most likely distorted. This is also in agreement with previous results that were obtained using a similar approach where mass spectrometry was used to identify <b>Minibody</b> fragments from limited proteolysis (Zappacosta F, Pessi A, Bianchi E, Venturini S, Sollazzo M, Tramontano A, Ma?ino G, Pucci P. 1996. Probing the tertiary structure of proteins by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry: The case of <b>Minibody.</b> Protein Sci 5 : 802 - 813). The chemical modification approach, in combination with limited proteolysis procedures, can provide useful, albeit partial, structural information to complement simulation techniques. This is especially valuable when, as in the <b>Minibody</b> case, an NMR and/or X-ray structure cannot be obtained due to insufficient solubility of the molecule...|$|E
40|$|A MAJOR {{challenge}} in protein design {{is to create}} stable scaffolds into which tailored functions can be introduced. Here we present the design, synthesis and characterization of a 61 -residue all-beta protein: the <b>minibody.</b> We used {{a portion of the}} heavy chain variable domain of an immunoglobulin as a template, obtaining a molecule with a novel beta-sheet scaffold and two regions corresponding to the hypervariable loops H 1 and H 2. To exploit the potential for creating functional centres in the <b>minibody,</b> we engineered a metal-binding site into it. This site is formed by one histidine in H 1 and two in H 2. The protein is folded, compact and able to bind metal, thus representing the first designed beta-protein with a novel fold and a tailored function. By randomizing the sequence of the hypervariable loops, we are using the <b>minibody</b> scaffold to construct a conformationally constrained peptide library displayed on phage...|$|E
40|$|The humanized {{antibody}} (hu 1 G 8) {{has been}} shown to localize to prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) and image PSCA-positive xenografts. We previously constructed hu 1 G 8 anti-PSCA antibody fragments and tested them for tumor targeting and the ability to image prostate cancer at early and late time points postinjection by positron emission tomography (PET). We now then compare the PET imaging and the radioactivity accumulation properties in prostate cancer tumors and nontarget tissues to determine the superior 124 I-labeled hu 1 G 8 antibody format. 124 I-labeled diabody, <b>minibody,</b> scFv-Fc, scFv-Fc double mutant (DM), and parental IgG were administered into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing LAPC- 9 xenografts and followed by whole-body PET imaging of mice at preselected time points. Regions of interest were manually drawn around tumor and nontarget tissues and evaluated for radioactivity accumulation. The 124 I-hu 1 G 8 IgG has its best time point for tumor high-contrast imaging at 168 hours postinjection. The 124 I-hu 1 G 8 <b>minibody</b> at 44 hours postinjection results in superior tumor high-contrast imaging compared to the other antibody formats. The 124 I-hu 1 G 8 <b>minibody</b> at 44 hours postinjection also has comparable percent tumor radioactivity compared to 124 I-hu 1 G 8 IgG at 168 hours postinjection.

40|$|Given {{the extent}} of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection as a worldwide health problem {{and the lack of}} effective treatment, the development of anti-HCV drugs is an important and pressing objective. Previous studies have indicated that proteolytic events mediated by the NS 3 protease of HCV are fundamental to the generation of an active viral replication apparatus, as unequivocably demonstrated for flaviviruses. As a result, the NS 3 protease has become a major target for discovering anti-HCV drugs. To gain further insight into the biochemical and biophysical properties of the NS 3 enzyme binding pocket(s) and to generate biological tools for developing antiviral strategies, we decided to engineer macromolecular ligands of the NS 3 protease domain. Phage-displayed repertoires of <b>minibodies</b> ("minimized" antibody-like proteins) and human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor were sampled by using the recombinant NS 3 protease domain as a ligate molecule. Two protease inhibitors were identified and characterized biochemically. These inhibitors show marked specificity for the viral protease and potency in the micromolar range but display different mechanisms of inhibition. The implications for prospective development of low-molecular-weight inhibitors of this enzyme are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Overall, this {{proof-of-concept}} {{study is}} quite unique {{as it has}} coupled PSMA-based SPECT/CT images {{to the growth of}} DPC- 1 prostatic tumors and metastases both local and distant, then histopathologically confirmed and showed to express the targeted PSMA/antigen in a time-wise manner resembling the natural history of prostate cancer. PSMA-based studies are primarily performed on heterotopic xenografts in rodents bearing a relatively low tumor volume [36] compared to canines. This is particularly attractive as, in contrast to most mammalian species, canines spontaneously develop prostate cancer although at a low incidence rate with ageing [20, 29, 37]. Unfortunately, the cancer is generally advanced at diagnosis and has reached the terminal stage [28 – 30]. The DPC- 1 preclinical model would prove to be most advantageous to enhance resolution or track down very small lesions using newly developed radiopharmaceuticals (diabodies, <b>minibodies,</b> small molecule inhibitors), imaging tools (PET/CT, PET/MRI vs. SPECT/CT), etc. It may find substantial utility to test new drugs or therapeutic modalities to destroy a high tumor/metastasis load not achievable in small rodent models. Finally, the use of equipment from the clinical setting in large size animals is attractive and could accelerate applicability of new devices prior moving to patients and impact on disease from time of early diagnosis to late stages.|$|R
30|$|Historically, PSMA-targeted {{molecular}} imaging {{was achieved}} through 111 indium (In)-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) like 7 E 11 (first generation) and J 591 (second generation) which permitted {{the detection of}} necrotic tissue vs. LN and bone metastases due to the recognition of intracellular vs. extracellular epitopes, respectively [9, 10]. Recently, PET/CT with 89 Zr-labeled J 591 has identified prostatic tumor foci in 8 of 11 (72  %) patients prior to prostatectomy, although the standardized uptake value did not correlate significantly with the Gleason score [13]. To counter the slow elimination of full-length mAbs from circulation and also optimize tumor contrast, PSMA derivatives were developed, notably radiolabeled <b>minibodies</b> (diabody/J 591 mAb), small molecule inhibitors (MIP 1072, MIP 1095), and ligands [10, 14 – 19]. Utility in clinical practice is being demonstrated; for instance, PET/MRI with 68 Ga-based PSMA ligands revealed LN and bone metastases in patients with progressive disease after conventional treatments [16]. The inhibitor MIP 1095 showed utility for PET/CT target imaging once labeled with 124 I (iodine) and also tumor therapy in CRPC patients once labeled with 131 I [19]. These observations highlight molecular imaging as a promising avenue to better stage and treat patients with locally advanced and recurrent PCa.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: As imaging of {{the cell}} surface tetraspan protein {{epithelial}} membrane protein- 2 (EMP 2) expression in malignant tumors may provide important prognostic and predictive diagnostic information, {{the goal of this}} study is to determine if antibody fragments to EMP 2 may be useful for imaging EMP 2 positive tumors. Procedures: The normal tissue distribution of EMP 2 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and found to be discretely expressed in both mouse and human tissues. To detect EMP 2 in tumors, a recombinant human anti-EMP 2 <b>minibody</b> (scFv-hinge-CH 3 dimer; 80 kDa) was designed to recognize a common epitope in mice and humans and characterized. In human tumor cell lines, the antibody binding induced EMP 2 internalization and degradation, prompting the need for a residualizing imaging strategy. Following conjugation to DOTA (1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane-N,N′,N′,N′″-tetraacetic acid), the <b>minibody</b> was radiolabeled with 64 Cu (t 1 / 2012. 7 h) and evaluated in mice as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent for human EMP 2 -expressing endometrial tumor xenografts.

30|$|Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), another {{target for}} imaging tracers, is a transmembrane protein {{that is highly}} overexpressed in {{prostate}} cancer compared to normal prostate and non-prostatic tissues (Ristau et al., 2014). Several PSMA-directed radiolabeled agents have been developed, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody-fragments, <b>minibodies,</b> and more recently small molecules. During the last 5  years, small-molecule ligands for PSMA have shown exceptional sensitivity and specificity for detection of recurrent prostate cancer. On {{the basis of these}} data, PSMA PET/CT, as noted earlier, is now the de-facto clinical standard for restaging of patients with biochemical recurrence in many countries. For instance, in a retrospective analysis of 1007 patients undergoing PET/CT with a radiolabeled small molecule PSMA-ligand (i.e. 68 Ga-PSMA- 11) for the evaluation of recurrent prostate cancer, the detection rate in patients with PSA levels ≤ 1  ng/ml was reported to be 57 % (Afshar-Oromieh et al., 2017). In another study of 48 patients with biochemical recurrence, 68 Ga-PSMA PET detected 53 of 68 pathology-proven lymph node metastases, yielding an area of 0.878 (95 % confidence interval: 0.819 – 0.937) under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve in a field-based analysis (Rauscher et al., 2016). In a patient-based analysis of the same population, the area under the ROC curve for detection of lymph node metastases was 0.732 (95 % confidence interval: 0.583 – 0.850). Some other PSMA-directed agents have not only been linked to positron-emitting isotopes for diagnostic purposes but also to α/β-emitters for radioisotope therapy, e.g., 177 Lu (Baum et al., 2016). By linking both diagnostic and therapeutic isotopes to the same tracer (i.e., creating ‘theranostic’ agents), one can reliably predict the in-vivo binding of the therapeutic agent and achieve patient- and organ-tailored dose calculation. Recent retrospective European studies have demonstrated promising surrogate response rates for this kind of therapy (Rahbar et al., 2017; Brauer et al., 2017), and future randomized phase II/III trials are warranted to evaluate whether these will ultimately translate into survival benefits. A more detailed description and imaging example of this ‘theranostic’ concept is provided in the paragraph on neuroendocrine tumors later in this article.|$|R

Characterization of the polypeptide by circular dichroism spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, and metal binding studies showed the molecule to be folded, monomeric, globular and able to bind metals. The main obstacle which prevented a more detailed characterization was the very low solubility of the protein in water (about 10 microM). To address this problem, we used two independent approaches: (1) mutagenesis of the beta-sheet framework residues and (2) addition of a solubilizing motif, made of three lysine residues, at the N or C termini. Engineering and production of mutants was facilitated by the achievement of high level expression of the protein in Escherichia coli. Both approaches led to <b>minibody</b> variants with a solubility ranging from tenfold higher up to millimolar levels.

The macrocyclic chelating agent 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane-N,N′,N′′, N′′′-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) was conjugated to the anti-CEA <b>minibody</b> for labeling with copper- 64, a positron-emitting radionuclide (t 1 / 2 = 12. 7 h). In vivo distribution was evaluated in athymic mice bearing paired LS 174 T human colon carcinoma (CEA positive) and C 6 rat glioma (CEA negative) xenografts. Five hours after injection with 64 Cu-DOTA-minibody, microPET imaging showed high uptake in CEA-positive tumor (17. 9 % injected dose per gram ± 3. 79) compared with control tumor (6. 0 % injected dose per gram ± 1. 0). In addition, significant uptake was seen in liver, with low uptake in other tissues. Average target/background ratios relative to neighboring tissue were 3 – 4 : 1. Engineered antibody fragments labeled with positron-emitting isotopes such as copper- 64 provide {{a new class of}} agents for PET imaging of tumors...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of {{patients}} suffering from chronic {{diseases such as}} rheumatoid arthritis with recombinant antibodies is time consuming and fairly expensive and {{can be associated with}} side effects due to generalized depletion of the target molecule. We have addressed these issues by developing an alternative approach consisting of the intraarticular injection of a DNA vector encoding for the anti-C 5 neutralizing recombinant miniantibody MB 12 / 22. This method allows local production of the antibody in sufficient amount to be effective in preventing joint inflammation in a rat model of antigen-induced arthritis. Injection of the DNA vector in a right knee of normal rats resulted in the production of the <b>minibody</b> detected in the synovial washes by western blot with a strong signal peaking at 3 days after administration. DNA encoding for the <b>minibody</b> was shown for 14 days in the synovial tissue and was undetectable in the controlateral knee and in other organs. The preventive effect of this approach was evaluated in rats receiving a single injection of the vector 3 days before the induction of antigen-induced arthritis and analyzed 3 days later. The treated rats exhibited a lower increase in swelling, associated with a lower number of PMN in the articular washes and reduced deposition of C 9 in synovial tissue compared to control rats. These results suggest that treating the inflamed joints with a vector that induces a local production of a neutralizing anti-C 5 antibody may represent a useful strategy to inhibit in situ complement activation and to treat patients with monoarthritis. Moreover, this approach may be adopted as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent monoarthritis as a...|$|E
30|$|In 2014, Li et al. radiolabeled fully human {{single-chain}} variable fragments-cys-diabodies (scFv-cysdimmers, H 2) with 89 Zr for immuno-PET {{studies in}} xenografts in mice models expressing c-MET [52]. The 89 Zr-labeled H 2 cys-diabody (89 Zr-DFO-H 2 cys-diabody) was site-specifically conjugated with maleimide-DFO, and prepared with labeling efficiency of 49 %, radiochemical purity of 95 %, and specific activity of 0.13  MBq/μg. The 89 Zr-DFO-H 2 cys-diabody showed a specific uptake in Hcc 827 -GR 6 tumors (gefitinib-resistant human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high c-MET expression) that {{was higher than}} the uptake in Hcc 827 (human NSCLC with low c-MET expression) tumors in PET scans at both 4 and 20  h p.i.; high-contrast images were obtained as early as 4  h p.i. In ex vivo biodistribution assays, at 4  h after injection, Hcc 827 -GR 6 tumors had higher uptake levels at 1.8 [*]±[*] 0.2 %ID/g {{when compared to the}} negative control Hcc 827 tumors at 0.65 [*]±[*] 0.15 %ID/g. High kidney uptakes observed in both biodistribution and PET images were induced by clearance of these low molecular weight cys-diabody proteins. The specificity of anti-c-MET targeting by the H 2 <b>minibody</b> (antibody fragment reformatted from H 2 but with larger molecular weight) was also assessed in immuno-PET studies. Biodistribution analyses revealed higher specific uptake levels in Hcc 827 -GR 6 tumors than other groups. However, the image contrast was not improved due to higher background signal in the blood (Hcc 827 -GR 6 tumor: blood[*]=[*] 4.2 [*]±[*] 0.5) resulting from the longer persistence of the <b>minibody</b> in the serum. Overall, the H 2 cys-diabody is the preferred choice for rapid immuno-PET applications because it has the unique advantage of cross-reacting with mouse c-MET, thus allowing more representative imaging studies in the presence of endogenous c-MET expression in normal mouse tissues.|$|E

Photoimmunotherapy induces rapid and highly specific necrosis in targeted cancer cells after exposure to near-infrared (NIR) light. Cells not expressing the antigen are not affected. To date, photoimmunotherapy has been demonstrated only with full antibody-IR 700 conjugates. In this study, small and bivalent antibody fragments, including anti–prostate-specific mem-brane antigen (PSMA) diabody (Db) and <b>minibody</b> (Mb), were com-pared with intact IgG for their effectiveness as photoimmunotherapy agents.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is {{a promising}} natural anticancer therapeutic agent because through its death receptors, TRAIL-R 1 and TRAIL-R 2, it induces apoptosis in many transformed tumor cells, {{but not in}} the majority of normal cells. Hence, agonistic compounds directed against TRAIL death receptors have the potential of being excellent cancer therapeutic agents, with minimal cytotoxicity in normal tissues. Here, we report the selection and characterization of a new single-chain fragment variable (scFv) to TRAIL-R 2 receptor isolated from a human phage-display library, produced as <b>minibody</b> (MB), and characterized for the in vitro anti-leukemic tumoricidal activity. The anti-TRAIL-R 2 MB 2. 23 efficiently and specifically bound to membrane-associated TRAIL-R 2 on different leukemic cell lines and could act as a direct agonist in vitro, initiating apoptotic signaling as well as complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, providing a rationale for further investigations of MB 2. 23 in anticancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although cervico-vaginal {{epithelial}} {{cells of the}} female lower genital tract provide the initial defense system against HIV- 1 infection, the protection is sometimes incomplete. Thus, enhancing anti-HIV- 1 humoral immunity at the mucosal cell surface by local expression of anti-HIV- 1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (BnAb) that block HIV- 1 entry would provide an important new intervention that could slow the spread of HIV/AIDS. Methods and Findings: This study tested the hypothesis that adeno-associated virus (AAV) -BnAb gene transfer to cervico-vaginal {{epithelial cells}} will lead to protection against HIV- 1. Accordingly, a recombinant AAV vector that encodes human b 12 anti-HIV gp 120 BnAb as a single-chain variable fragment Fc fusion (scFvFc), or ‘‘minibody’ ’ was constructed. The secreted b 12 <b>minibody</b> was shown to be biologically functional in binding to virus envelope protein, neutralizing HIV- 1 and importantly, blocking transfer and infectivity of HIV- 1 bal in an organotypic human vaginal epithelial cell (VEC) model. Furthermore, cervico-vaginal epithelial stem cells {{were found to be}} efficiently transduced by the optimal AAV serotype mediated expression of GFP. Conclusion: This study provides the foundation for a novel microbicide strategy to protect against sexual transmission of HIV- 1 by AAV transfer of broadly neutralizing antibody genes to cervico-vaginal epithelial stem cells that could replenis...|$|E
30|$|The FcRn {{receptor}} recycles IgG antibodies {{into the}} blood circulation. During the last decade, the Fc-FcRn binding site has been well characterised, with I 253, H 310 in the CH 2 domain and H 435 in the CH 3 domain identified as the key residues involved in the Fc-FcRn binding [16 – 19]. The FcRn-mediated IgG recycling {{can be described as}} a three-step process: (1) passive pinocytosis of IgG into endothelial cells; (2) in the acidic environment of endosomes (pH < 6.5), histidine residues in the Fc fragment of IgG become protonated and this allows high-affinity binding of IgG to FcRn; and (3) unbound IgG will undergo lysosomal degradation whilst FcRn-bound IgG is released back {{into the blood}} circulation [19]. Therefore, more recent engineering approaches to reduce the serum half-life of antibodies or Fc-coupled biological compounds used for payload delivery focus on mutating the specific amino acids in the CH 2 or CH 3 domain of the Fc fragment involved in the binding site of FcRn. Recycling of the variants is reduced, due to their diminished interaction with the FcRn receptor at pH < 6.5. Most work has been done with radiolabelled Fc-containing antibody fragments such as scFv-Fc [20 – 23] and a <b>minibody</b> [22]. Only one intact radiolabelled antibody (chTNT- 3) carrying the I 253 A mutation has been studied in biodistribution studies and imaging studies [24].|$|E
40|$|The noninvasive {{detection}} and quantification of CD 8 + T cells in vivo {{are important for}} both the {{detection and}} staging of CD 8 + lymphomas and for the monitoring of successful cancer immunotherapies, such as adoptive cell transfer and antibody-based immunotherapeutics. Here, antibody fragments are constructed to target murine CD 8 to obtain rapid, high-contrast immuno-positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) images {{for the detection of}} CD 8 expression in vivo. The variable regions of two anti-murine CD 8 -depleting antibodies (clones 2. 43 and YTS 169. 4. 2. 1) were sequenced and reformatted into <b>minibody</b> (Mb) fragments (scFv-CH 3). After production and purification, the Mbs retained their antigen specificity and bound primary CD 8 + T cells from the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. Importantly, engineering of the parental antibodies into Mbs abolished the ability to deplete CD 8 + T cells in vivo. The Mbs were subsequently conjugated to S- 2 -(4 -isothiocyanatobenzyl) - 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane- 1, 4, 7 -triacetic acid for 64 Cu radiolabeling. The radiotracers were injected i. v. into antigen-positive, antigen-negative, immunodeficient, antigenblocked, and antigen-depleted mice to evaluate specificity of uptake in lymphoid tissues by immuno-PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution. Both 64 Cu-radiolabeled Mbs produced high-contrast immuno-PET images 4 h postinjection and showed specific uptake in the spleen and lymph nodes of antigen-positive mice...|$|E
40|$|MET, the {{receptor}} of hepatocyte growth factor, plays {{important roles}} in tumorigenesis anddrug resistance in numerous cancers, including non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As increasing numbers of MET inhibitors are being developed for clinical applications, antibody fragment–based immunopositron emission tomogra-phy (immunoPET) {{has the potential to}} rapidly quantify in vivo MET expression levels for drug response evaluation and patient stratification for these targeted therapies. Here, fully human single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) isolated from aphage display librarywere reformatted into bivalent cys-diabodies (scFv-cys dimers) with affinities toMET ranging from 0. 7 to 5. 1 nmol/L. The candidatewith the highest affinity, H 2,was radiolabeledwith 89 Zr for immunoPET studies targetingNSCLC xenografts: lowMET-expressingHcc 827 and the gefitinib-resistant Hcc 827 -GR 6 with 4 -fold MET overexpression. ImmunoPET at as early as 4 hours after injection produced high-contrast images, and ex vivo biodistribution analysis at 20 hours after injection showed about 2 -fold difference in tracer uptake levels between the parental and resistant tumors (P < 0. 01). Further immunoPET studies using a larger fragment, the H 2 <b>minibody</b> (scFv-CH 3 dimer), produced similar results at later time points. Two of the antibody clones (H 2 and H 5) showed in vitro growth inhibitory effects on MET-dependent gefitinib-resistant cell lines, whereas no effects were observed on resistant lines lacking MET activation. In conclusion, these fully human antibody fragments inhibit MET-dependent cancer cells and enable rapid immunoPET imaging to assessMET expression levels, showing potential for both therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

40|$|Background: Fibroblast {{activation}} protein (FAP) {{is a type}} II {{membrane protein}} expressed on tumor stroma fibroblasts in more than 90 % of all carcinomas. FAP serves as a diagnostic marker and is potential therapeutic target for treatment {{of a wide variety}} of FAP � carcinomas. Murine tumor stroma models and FAP-specific antibodies are required to investigate the functional role of FAP in tumor biology and its usefulness for drug targeting. We here describe the development of antibodies with crossreactivity for human (hFAP) and murine FAP (mFAP), which share 89 % amino acid identity. Material and Methods: An FAP �/ � mouse was sequentially immunized with recombinant murine and human FAP-CD 8 fusion proteins. Immunoglobulin cDNA derived from hyperimmune spleen cells was used for the construction of a combinatorial single chain Fv (scFv) library. Phage display selection of FAP-specific scFv was performed on immobilized hFAP followed by selection on cells expressing murine FAP. Results: High-affinity, species-crossreactive, FAP-specific scFv were isolated upon sequential phage display selection. A bivalent derivative (<b>minibody</b> MO 36) constructed thereof was applied for immunohistochemical analyses and allowed detection of FAP expression on stroma cells of different human carcinomas as well as on murine host stroma in a tumor xenograft model. Conclusions: MB MO 36, derived from phage display selected species crossreactive scFv, is suitable for tumor stroma targeting and will be a valuable tool in the analyses of the functional role of FAP in tumor biology as well as in the evaluation of the suitability of FAP for drug targeting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), highly {{expressed}} in many cancer types, {{is an important}} target for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Radionuclide-based imaging techniques (gamma camera, single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT] and positron emission tomography [PET]) have been extensively explored for CEA-targeted cancer imaging both preclinically and clinically. Briefly, these studies {{can be divided into}} three major categories: antibody-based, antibody fragment-based and pretargeted imaging. Radiolabeled anti-CEA antibodies, reported the earliest among the three categories, typically gave suboptimal tumor contrast due to the prolonged circulation life time of intact antibodies. Subsequently, a number of engineered anti-CEA antibody fragments (e. g. Fab’, scFv, <b>minibody,</b> diabody and scFv-Fc) have been labeled with a variety of radioisotopes for CEA imaging, many of which have entered clinical investigation. CEA-Scan (a 99 m Tc-labeled anti-CEA Fab ’ fragment) has already been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for cancer imaging. Meanwhile, pretargeting strategies have also been developed for CEA imaging which can give much better tumor contrast than the other two methods, if the system is designed properly. In this review article, we will summarize the current state-of-the-art of radionuclide-based cancer imaging targeting CEA. Generally, isotopes with short half-lives (e. g. 18 F and 99 m Tc) are more suitable for labeling small engineered antibody fragments while the isotopes with longer half-lives (e. g. 123 I and 111 In) are needed for antibody labeling to match its relatively long circulation half-life. With further improvement in tumor targeting efficacy and radiolabeling strategies, novel CEA-targeted agents may play a...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer-related death among American men, and current therapies are nonspecific with many {{negative}} side effects. As described in Chapter 1, these side effects are generally due to inadvertent harm to healthy cells, and therefore, the development of targeted therapies can improve patient welfare, as well as improve the efficacy of current therapies. Furthermore, the materials used for these therapies should be biocompatible and avoid undesired immune responses. One type of novel biomaterial is the polypeptide, which is comprised of amino acids that have {{a wide variety of}} chemical and physical properties. Polypeptides can also be designed to adopt secondary structures, such as alpha-helices, as well as self-assemble into macromolecular structures, such as nano-sized vesicles. Using polypeptides as the “core” material in this thesis, we have developed and investigated (i) novel cell penetrating peptides comprised of galactosylated poly(methionine), which can efficiently internalize into prostate cancer cells, and (ii) photoresponsive polypeptide-based gold nanoshells, where gold-coated polypeptide vesicles generate heat in response to near infrared light to kill cancer cells. 	Naturally-occurring cell penetrating peptides, such as HIV-Tat, are generally cationic, with an abundance of the positively-charged amino acids arginine and lysine. Researchers have shown that synthetic polypeptides can be created to mimic the primary and secondary structures of natural cell penetrating peptides. Furthermore, these synthetic polypeptides can be modified to increase their internalization efficiency to outperform the natural peptides, for example, through incorporation of alpha-helical structures, cationic and functional side chains, and hydrophobic moieties. In Chapter 2, we investigated a novel polypeptide material synthesized by Dr. Timothy Deming’s lab at UCLA for use as a cell penetrating peptide, galactosylated poly(methionine). To optimize the polypeptide, we performed cytotoxicity and fluorescent cellular uptake studies using polypeptides with a variety of properties, such as chain length and percent functionalization with galactose groups. We determined that the 50 % functionalized galactosylated poly(methionine) was non-toxic to cells, and demonstrated significantly greater cellular uptake compared to nona-arginine (R 9), which is known to be efficiently internalized by cells. This novel polypeptide represents a promising biomaterial for delivering anti-cancer therapies to prostate cancer cells. 	The second focus of this thesis has been the use of self-assembled vesicles comprised of the block copolypeptide, poly(L-lysine) 60 -b-poly(L-leucine) 20 (K 60 L 20), as the core material for photothermal therapy using near infrared light. Researchers have developed gold nanostructures, which demonstrate enhanced absorption of light due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The SPR of the gold nanostructures can be tuned to a variety of wavelengths, ranging from ultraviolet to visible to the near infrared. In order to non-invasively treat tumors beneath the skin, near infrared light is desired, where light at this wavelength can penetrate a few centimeters into the tissue. Gold nanoshells, where a core material is coated with a thin layer of gold, have been shown to generate heat in response to irradiation with near infrared light. The core materials used for gold nanoshells include solid silica nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, and more recently, liposomes. In Chapter 3, we report the first ever use of polypeptide materials as the core material for a gold nanoshell. Our polypeptide based K 60 L 20 gold nanoshells have demonstrated low toxicity in the absence of laser exposure, significant heat generation upon exposure to near infrared light, and as a result, localized cytotoxicity within the region of laser irradiation. In Chapter 4, we demonstrate the ability to reduce the overall size of the polypeptide-based gold nanoshells, so that they are in the size range {{to take advantage of the}} enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which leads to the collection of nanoparticles at a solid tumor site. These smaller gold nanoshells similarly demonstrated significant heat generation in response to near infrared irradiation and localized laser-induced cytotoxicity. To gain a better understanding of our gold nanoshells in the context of photothermal therapy, we developed a comprehensive mathematical model for heat transfer in Chapter 5 to predict the temperature as a function of time and position in our in vitro experimental set-up. Our mathematical model was validated by comparing our predictions with our experimental results. This model can therefore be used in the future to determine which parameters in our gold nanoshells can be manipulated to improve heat generation, and therefore, potentially improve the destruction of tumors. 	In Chapter 6, we conjugated a targeting ligand, the A 11 <b>minibody,</b> to the polypeptide-based K 60 L 20 gold nanoshells to improve their efficacy. Researchers have shown that active targeting agents, such as proteins and antibodies, can improve the specificity and effectiveness of photothermal therapy for cancer cells. The A 11 <b>minibody,</b> which binds specifically to the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) overexpressed on the surfaces of local and metastatic prostate cancer cells, has successfully been demonstrated by Dr. Anna Wu’s group at UCLA as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent for prostate cancer with in vivo models. Here, we demonstrate the first use of the A 11 <b>minibody</b> to target a therapeutic agent to prostate cancer cells. Specifically, we were able to generate A 11 -conjugated nanoshells with the appropriate size and heat generation properties. These PSCA-targeted polypeptide-based gold nanoshells also showed promise by exhibiting greater efficacy as a photothermal therapy agent compared to non-targeted gold nanoshells...|$|E
