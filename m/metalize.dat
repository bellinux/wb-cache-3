Although {{the player}} must choose between {{a young boy}} and girl {{character}} (given the default names of Yumil and Tia respectively) when beginning a new game, the main story-line remains vastly unchanged. Yumil/Tia has been assigned the task of recording everything around him or her in the Book of Prophecy, becoming its new Chosen One in title.

At one point in the game, he or she is given the choice to align with one of four legendary Weapon Schools. Although Yumil/Tia begins the game under the protective wing of fellow slum-dwelling pickpocket Rex and is seen to correspond frequently with the sickly town girl Fana, his or her past (including reference to any family members deceased or living) is largely left unrefined. However, it can be assumed that the player continues to live on with the Spirits in a home in the New World.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Graphene-based {{devices have}} {{garnered}} tremendous attention {{due to the}} unique physical properties arising from this purely two-dimensional carbon sheet leading to tremendous efficiency in the transport of thermal carriers (i. e., phonons). However, {{it is necessary for}} this two-dimensional material to be able to efficiently transport heat into the surrounding 3 D device architecture in order to fully capitalize on its intrinsic transport capabilities. Therefore, the thermal boundary conductance at graphene interfaces is a critical parameter in the realization of graphene electronics and thermal solutions. In this work, we examine the role of chemical functionalization on the thermal boundary conductance across metal/graphene interfaces. Specifically, we <b>metalize</b> graphene that has been plasma functionalized and then measure the thermal boundary conductance at Al/graphene/ SiO 2 contacts with time domain thermoreflectance. The addition of adsorbates to the graphene surfaces are shown to influence the cross plane thermal conductance; this behavior is attributed to changes in the bonding between the metal and the graphene, as both the phonon flux and the vibrational mismatch between the materials are each subject to the interfacial bond strength.

Antistatic and antibacterial textile materials are highly required in medical centers, clean rooms, military basis and electronic device manufacturers. Moreover, these materials are increasingly studied in many scientific committees by several method. Functional textile fabrics can be produced by surface finishing or adding conductive fibers. Many methods are employed to obtain conductive fiber but Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) offer better homogeneity and high efficiency when compared to Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) methods. Magnetron sputtering is the industrial scale thin film production technique among PVD methods. However, mainly used planar magnetron sputtering systems do not enable samples to be coated all sides of cylindrical surface of a fiber so that an inverted cylindrical magnetron (ICM) sputtering system was designed for this research. ICM system was optimized and operated to deposit silver thin film {{on all sides of}} PA fibers which have diameters 85 and 150 um. A continuous roll to roll mechanism was mounted to system that enables to <b>metalize</b> fibers at high speed continuously. Conductive fibers are proposed to be produced at industrial scale.

In order to obtain thin film thickness of fibers, they are investigated by three different methods which can be calculating from i) bulk resistivity formula by using measured resistance, ii) deposited silver mass by using density of silver and iii) system calibration sample which is basically sending a glass lamella with same sputtering parameters and measuring sputtered thin film on it. These all results were compared to find optimum thickness. These conductive fibers woven in synthetic fabrics to promote them antistatic and shielding property.

Metallization in the application {{is the process of}} vaporization of the needed metal with tungsten in vacuumed media. This system among the PVD Coating groups is known as Evaporation Coating all through the world. Although the very fine metal layer that condenses over the product to be coated varies from sector to sector; it is generally used with aesthetic and decorative aims. The surface of the part to be coated is cleaned off the effects such as dirt, dust and oils etc. this cleaning method varies according to the size, shape and material of the piece to be coated. Surface cleaning before coating is very important in the sense of coating life, quality and strength. Otherwise, expected yield cannot be attained from the <b>metalized</b> and corrosion start can be observed shortly due to remnants on the places which are not thoroughly cleaned. Since metallization is a vaporization method; it is ionized by melting on all places which are in high-vacuumed.

Recently, a substantial international effort has been invested in developing a range of compound semiconductors with wide band gap and high atomic number for X-ray and Gamma ray detectors. Among the compound semiconductors Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) is the most promising material for radiation detectors with good energy resolution, high detection efficiency and room temperature operation. In parallel to the main activity on the tuning of grown technique to produce CZT crystals with the required performance, such as high resistivity, good charge collection efficiency and low tellurium inclusions density; several efforts have been also dedicated {{on the development of}} a reliable method to <b>metalize</b> the surface for the realization of efficient contacts and to control surface resistivity. They are still an open challenge in the detector preparation technology. Undersigned’s phd work fits in this background as will be exposed in the following. First of all the problem of inclusions in CZT crystals is treated. A new diagnostic technique based on near infrared transmission microscopy is proposed by the author of this thesis in order to characterize tellurium inclusions in CZT crystals. By means of the described technique it was possible to perform an interesting study on the role played by these inclusions on the performance of CZT based detectors and on the influence of the latter on transport properties of photo-generated carriers inside the material. Then a new approach to eliminate tellurium inclusion in CZT crystals is proposed. A novel laser-induced thermo-migration system is proposed and evaluated. Then importance of metallization process during the CZT device production was take into account. A very interesting technique to realize metal deposition on CZT surfaces is proposed and a special metal deposition equipment was developed. Reliability of the process was demonstrate by means of a study on the influence of the contact deposition technique on the detection performance, in term of charge collection efficiency.

40|$|The {{demand for}} higher bit rates to support new {{services}} and more users is pushing wireless systems to millimetre-wave frequency bands with more available bandwidth and less interference. However at these frequencies, antenna dimensions are dramatically reduced complicating the fabrication process. Conductor loss is also significant, reducing {{the efficiency and}} gain of fabricated metallic antennas. To better utilize millimetre-wave frequencies for wireless applications, antennas with simple fabrication, higher efficiency, and larger impedance bandwidth are required. Dielectric Resonator Antennas (DRAs) offer many appealing features such as large impedance bandwidth and high radiation efficiency {{due to the lack}} of conductor and surface wave losses. DRAs also provide design flexibility and versatility. Different radiation patterns can be achieved by different geometries or resonance modes, wideband or compact antennas can be provided by different dielectric constants, and DRAs can be excited by a wide variety of feeding structures. Nevertheless, compared to their metallic counterparts, fabrication of DRAs is challenging since they have traditionally been made of high permittivity ceramics, which are naturally hard and extremely difficult to machine and cannot be easily made in an automatic way. The fabrication of these three dimensional structures is even more difficult at millimetre-wave frequencies where the size of the antenna is reduced to the millimetre or sub-millimetre range, and tolerances to common manufacturing imperfections are even smaller. These fabrication problems restrict the wide use of DRAs, especially for high volume commercial applications. A new approach to utilize the superior features of DRAs for commercial applications, introduced in this thesis, is to exploit polymer-based resonator antennas (PRAs), which dramatically simplifies fabrication due to the natural softness and results in a wide impedance bandwidth due to the low permittivity of polymers. Numerous polymer types with exceptional characteristics can be used to fulfill the requirements of particular applications or achieve extraordinary benefits. For instance, in this thesis photoresist polymers facilitate the fabrication of PRAs using lithographic processes. Another advantage derived from this approach is the capability of mixing polymers with a wide variety of fillers to produce composite materials with improved or extraordinary characteristics. The key contributions of this thesis are in introducing SU- 8 photoresist as a radiating material, developing three lithographic methods to fabricate photoresist-ceramic composite structures, introducing a simple and non-destructive measurement method to define electrical properties of the photoresist composites, and demonstrating these structures as improved antenna components. It is shown that pure SU- 8 resonators can be highly efficient antennas with wideband characteristics. To achieve more advantages for RF applications, the microwave properties of photoresists are modified by producing ceramic composite materials. X-ray lithography fabrication is optimized and as a result one direct and two indirect methods are proposed to pattern ultra thick (up to 2. 3 mm) structures and complicated shapes with an aspect ratio as high as 36 : 1. To measure the permittivity and loss tangent of the resulting materials, a modified ring resonator technique in one-layer and two-layer microstrip configurations is developed. This method eliminates the requirement to <b>metalize</b> the samples and enables characterization of permittivity and dielectric loss in a wide frequency range from 2 to 40 GHz. Various composite PRAs with new designs (e. g. frame-based and strip-fed structures) are lithographically fabricated, tested, and discussed.

40|$|The ongoing {{downscaling}} of {{the dimensions}} of the integrated circuit (IC) building blocks forces the semiconductor industry to search for new material combinations and innovative technological solutions in order to satisfy the requirements set for future generations. The fabrication of interconnects is no exception to this trend. The current technologies used to <b>metalize</b> interconnect vias and trenches are facing their limits as {{the dimensions of the}} vias become increasingly smaller. One alternative technology that could meet the requirements set by the ITRS, is a carbonnanotube based interconnect. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unique electrical, thermal and mechanical properties that make them ideal candidates for future interconnect material. From theoretical calculations, it was shown that at a sufficiently high CNT shell density (> 1013 shells/cm 2) the electrical resistance of the CNT bundle can compete with Cu. Also the theoretical current carrying capacity of CNTs is order of magnitudes higher compared to Cu, providing a better resistance towards electromigration. From a technological perspective, CNTs offer an additional advantage as the growth process is truly bottom-up. Therefore no void issues are expected in the fill of the via. In this thesis, the main challenges associated with the integration of CNTs in IC interconnects are addressed. The first challenge is to obtain a high CNT forest density (> 1013 cm- 2) on a conductive substrate. For large diameter vias, several densely packed CNT forests are needed to meet the technology requirements. To obtain high density CNT forests on conductive substrates, a high density of catalytic nanoparticles is needed. The first part of this thesis deals with how the density of catalytic nanoparticles can be increased. By inhibiting the growth of nanoparticles during electrochemical deposition, the nanoparticle density can be increased up to the point that film closure occurs when the film thickness is below 1 nm. CNT forests from these highly inhibited nanoparticles were densely packed and showed promise for obtaining high density CNT forests on conductive substrates. Another challenge for the CNT integration process is togrow high quality CNTs at a low growth temperature. The growth temperature is limited to CNTgrowth in this low temperature range. The balance between hydrogen and the hydrocarbon species played a dual role during CNT growth as no growth was observed in the absence of H 2. In contrast, when the amount of hydrogen was too high, catalyst-mediated etching of the CNT forests occurred. Decreasing the growth temperature resulted in smaller CNT forest lengths. A cross-over in CNT length between Ni and Co catalyzed CNT forests was observed at 455 °C. As a result, at 400 °C CNT forests could only be grown using a Ni catalyst particle. Furthermore, the CNT growth mechanism was linked with its termination mechanism thereby limiting the ultimate CNT length that could be achieved at a given temperature. The last part of this thesis deals with the development of an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template that enables the study of CNT growth in confined dimensions. Especially for DRAM contacts where one multi-walled CNT per via is sufficient to meet the technology requirements, achieving CNT growth in sub- 10 nm vias is crucial. The successful fabrication of a test vehicle with catalytic nanoparticles selectively {{at the bottom of the}} pores was demonstrated. Preliminary results have indicated that bottom-up CNT growth is possible in AAO structures with relaxed geometrical dimensions (40 nm pore diameter, AR = 7. 5), but further work is still required to study CNT growth in sub- 10 nm high aspect ratio pores. Aside from the development of the CNT structure, it was also found that by changing the composition of the Al film, the vertical pores in the AAO template become horizontally interconnected. The formation mechanism of the horizontal interconnects was studied in more detail and a model was proposed describing the events. These 3 -dimensional AAO templates wereused to fabricate 3 -dimensional Ni nanowire networks that are well suited for energy storage applications. status: publishe...|$|E
