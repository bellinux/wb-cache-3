40|$|Case summary A 13 -year-old {{domestic}} shorthair cat presented {{for evaluation of}} pain and difficulty ambulating. Orthopedic examination and CT facilitated a diagnosis of bilateral elbow synovial osteochondromatosis with <b>medial</b> humeral <b>epicondylitis</b> and concurrent osteoarthritis. Right humeroradial subluxation was evident on CT images, but no instability was evident preoperatively. Surgical treatment was elected, including external neurolysis of the ulnar nerve, removal of the areas of mineralization within the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and medial arthrotomy to remove intra-articular mineralized bodies. Following closure, instability of the right elbow was noted with humeroradial subluxation necessitating placement of circumferential suture prostheses to provide satisfactory stability. Reassessment was performed 2, 6, 12, 24 and 40 weeks postoperatively and revealed maintenance of elbow stability and substantial improvement in mobility and comfort. Relevance and novel information While humeroradial subluxation {{has been reported in}} association with <b>medial</b> humeral <b>epicondylitis</b> on post-mortem examination, associated clinically significant instability has not been documented previously.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the clinical signs and histologic changes in cats clinically affected with <b>medial</b> humeral <b>epicondylitis</b> (MHE) and evaluate long-term outcome after either conservative or surgical treatment. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Animals: Client-owned cats (n[*]=[*] 17) with MHE. Methods: Cats diagnosed with MHE, based on clinical signs, radiographs and computed tomography (CT), were prospectively recruited. Cats were treated conservatively for an initial 4 weeks, followed by either surgery or continued conservative treatment. Followup examinations were performed at 6 and 12 weeks and at 6 – 49 months. Results: Cats {{had a mean}} age of 10. 3 years and presented for chronic lameness. Examination revealed pain on palpation caudodistal to the medial epicondyle and by exerting antebrachial supination/pronation with elbow and carpal flexion. Lameness was restricted to 1 limb although CT revealed bilateral disease in 11 / 17 cats. Free mineralized joint bodies were identified in 9 / 17 cats. Nine cats were treated surgically and 8 cats were treated conservatively. Intraoperative findings included new bone formation at the origin of the humeral head of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle with displacement and adhesions of the ulnar nerve. Microscopic examination revealed neurogenic myopathy in 4 / 9 cats treated surgically. Seven of 9 cats treated surgically were free from lameness by 12 weeks.

Methods: In 1993 - 1994 and again in 1996 - 1997, 598 workers exposed to repetitive job were examined by 18 occupational health physicians and completed a self-administered questionnaire. The study was performed in order to consider all upper-limb occupational disorders; we focused here on the evolution and prevention of <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis.</b> Results: Prevalence was 5. 2 percent in this population.

40|$|<b>Medial</b> <b>epicondylitis,</b> a {{condition}} seen commonly in golfers and pitchers, develops {{as a result}} of medial stress overload on the flexor musculature at the elbow. 2, 14 The medial elbow muscle overload is typically obtained by repetitive golf swings or pitching—hence, the term golfer’s elbow or pitcher’s elbow. Most pathology occurs in the musculotendinous origin of the flexor carpi radialis and pronator teres. 1, 8 Large diffuse tears can also occur in the palmaris longus, flexor digitorum superficialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris. 10, 11 The injury is a result of tendinous microtearing owing to muscle-tendon overload. 13 Following the overload, tendon degeneration occurs instead of repair. 10, 11 <b>Medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> presents as pain at the medial epicondyle, aggravated by activities that resist the flexor muscles of the wrist. <b>Medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> can cause pain and weakness throughout the upper extremity and can result in impairment or disability. 9, 11 Treatment of <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> before surgery includes anti-inflammatory drugs, massages, elbow braces, and steroid injections. 5 Cervical radiculopathy can radiate pain, paresthesia, numbness, or weakness into the arms. 12, 15 Multiple associations of lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) to the cervical spine have been made, but minimal association between the <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> and the cervical spine has been proposed. 9 Gunn documented 50 patients with nonresolving lateral elbow symptoms. 7 Cervical spine treatment produced improvement of elbow symptoms within 5. 25 weeks.

40|$|Ultrasonography of {{the elbow}} {{is a very}} helpful and {{reliable}} diagnostic procedure for {{a broad spectrum of}} rheumatic and orthopedic conditions, representing a possible substitute to magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of soft tissues of the elbow.

In addition, ultrasonography is cost effective, easy available, and has excellent and multiplanar capability to visualize superficial soft tissue structures. Among all imaging procedures, US is highly accepted by patients. US assessment of the elbow requires good operator experience in the assessment of normal anatomy, and suitable high-quality equipment. US of the elbow provides detailed information including joint effusions, <b>medial</b> and lateral <b>epicondylitis,</b> tears of the distal biceps and triceps tendons, radial and ulnar collateral ligament tears, ulnar nerve entrapment, cubital or olecranon bursitis and intra-articular loose bodies.

30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} {{an increased risk of}} epicondylitis in association with strenuous manual tasks (Descatha et al. 2003, 2013; Herquelot et al. 2013; Walker-Bone et al. 2003 a, b). Repetitive forceful flexing or extending of the elbow and wrist, and twisting, rotating, and screwing motions of the forearm with extreme non-neutral postures have been associated with <b>medial</b> or lateral <b>epicondylitis</b> (Bernard 1997; Descatha et al. 2003, 2013; Haahr and Andersen 2003; Herquelot et al. 2013; Kurppa et al. 1991; Ono et al. 1998; Walker-Bone et al. 2003 a, b). According to our results, unexpectedly, {{there was no significant difference}} in prevalence of lateral epicondilitis among occupational categories. One of the considerable reasons is that the categories using in this study might not reflect the actual amount of manual tasks involving the upper extremities. In addition, the majority of the residents, including unemployed subjects, would be engaged in agriculture as a family business along with their own occupation. To make a precise assessment of association between the occupation and lateral epicondilitis, detailed evaluation of the actual amount of manual tasks at each occupation would be needed.|$|R
40|$|Chronic tendinopathy, like <b>medial</b> {{and lateral}} <b>epicondylitis</b> and patellar and Achilles tendinopathy, is a {{well-known}} painful orthopaedic disease. The characteristic pathologic characteristics of all these tendinosis conditions are linked to microrupture of the tendon, 4, 5 granulation tissue, 9 and degenerative changes. 13, 15 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy, steroid injections, and orthoses are symptomatic treatment for these and various other orthopaedic conditions, while arthroscopic or open surgery is reserved for patients with insufficient response to less invasive procedures. Neovessels and accompanying free nerve endings have been observed in tendinosis tissue using Protein Gene Product 9. 5 immunohistochemistry. 2 Furthermore, the ten-don insertion, which is supplied with substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) innervation, has been implicated in the origins of tennis elbow. 11 The rat model of Achilles tendinosis showed an increased number of nerve filaments and increased immunoreactivity for SP and CGRP. 12 Neuropeptides SP and CGRP are not only involved in transmitting nociceptive information to the spinal cord, but also in peripheral effects, including microvascular leakage and local edema formation. 21 Pathological nerve ingrowth {{may have been involved}} in the origin of tendinosis. 11 On th...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> of the elbow, an overuse injury {{characterized}} by angiofibroblastic tendinosis {{of the common}} flexor-pronator origin, generally responds to nonoperative treatment. Refractory cases may require surgical debridement and repair. This study discusses physical examination and imaging findings and an updated surgical technique used in patients with recalcitrant <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis.</b> METHODS: The surgical records of 60 patients with refractory <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> were reviewed. All received a course of nonoperative care. After 3 to 6 months of failed therapy, imaging was obtained, and surgical intervention was offered when indicated. This open procedure consisted of thorough debridement with repair and restoration of the flexor-pronator origin, using a suture anchor. Accelerated rehabilitation, emphasizing early motion, was used. One-year follow-ups were obtained. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score was calculated preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: Pronation weakness at 90 degrees was a critical physical examination finding. Preoperative magnetic resonance images demonstrated pathologic partial tearing at the flexor-pronator origin. Ulnar neuritis was addressed in 20 %. Postoperatively, the Mayo Elbow Performance Score significantly increased (preoperatively, 58 +/- 7. 7; postoperatively, 88 +/- 7. 8; P = 5. 6 E- 34), and pain significantly decreased (preoperatively, 2. 2 +/- 0. 3; postoperatively, 0. 6 +/- 0. 5; P = 3. 8 E- 33). There was one retear in a patient noncompliant with the postoperative protocol. He responded positively to reoperation.

40|$|Epicondylitis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common elbow {{problems}} in adults, occurring both laterally and medially. <b>Medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> of the elbow, commonly referred to as ‘‘golfer’s elbow,’ ’ is characterized by pathologic changes to the musculo-tendonous origin at the medial epicondyle. Accurate diagnosis is dependent upon a complete understanding of the anatomic, epidemiologic, and pathophysiologic factors that distinguish epicondylitis from other elbow conditions. Originally described by Henry Morris in 1882 as ‘‘lawn-tennis elbow,’’ epicondylitis has since been studied and written on extensively [1]. Lateral epicondylitis, often labeled ‘‘tennis elbow,’ ’ has received the majority of this attention. There exists, however, a paucity of literature regarding <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis,</b> likely due to its infrequent incidence of only 9. 8 % to 20 % of all epicondylitis diagnoses [2 – 4]. Originally thought to be an inflammatory process, as the name suggests, epicondylitis has been shown histologically to result from tendonous microtearing, followed by an incomplete reparative response. Conse-quently, some physicians prefer the more accurate term, tendonosis, when describing elbow epicondylitis.

40|$|Abstract The {{etiology}} of musculoskeletal disorders is complex, with physical and psychosocial working condi-tions playing an important role. This study aimed {{to determine the}} relationship between psychosocial work conditions, such as psychological job demands, decision latitude, social support and job insecurity and musculo-skeletal complains (MSCs) and (repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) in a 1 -year prospective study. The job content questionnaire, the Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire and provocation tests were used to study 725 employees aged 20 – 70 years. Pain in the lower back (58 % of sub-jects), neck (57 %), wrists/hands (47 %) and upper back (44 %) was most frequent. The carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (33. 6 %), rotator cuff tendinitis (15. 4 %), Guyon’s canal syndrome (13. 4 %), lateral epicondylitis (7. 6 %), <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> (5. 3 %), tendinitis of forearm–wrist extensors (7. 8 %) and tendinitis of forearm–wrist flexors (7. 3 %) were the most frequent RSIs. Logistic analysis showed that increased psychological job demands statisti-cally significantly increased the probability of lateral and <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis,</b> and increased control (decision lati-tude) statistically significantly decreased the risk of CTS. There was no relationship between job insecurity, social support and the studied RSIs. Psychosocial factors at work predict prevalence of MSCs and RSIs, irrespectively of demographic factors, e. g., age or gender, and organiza-tional and physical factors...|$|E
30|$|The {{diagnosis}} of epicondylitis {{was based on}} symptoms and clinical signs during a standardized physical examination. The diagnostic criteria for lateral epicondylitis were (1) tenderness at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and (2) lateral elbow pain around the lateral epicondyle of the humerus on resisted extension of the wrist or finger with the elbow extended. The diagnostic criteria for <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> were (1) tenderness at the medial epicondyle of the humerus and (2) medial elbow pain around the medial epicondyle of the humerus on resisted flexion of the wrist or on resisted forearm pronation with the elbow extended.|$|E
40|$|The lateral and <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> {{is often}} {{manifested}} {{in a professional}} or in a sport context leading to repetitive wrist movements. The diagnosis is primarily clinical. Additional tests are indicated in chronic evolution and in searching for differential diagnoses. Elbow X-ray can be completed with ultrasound or MRI, the most efficient but expensive diagnostic procedure. There is no consensus on treatment. After a period of rest, stretching then strengthening exercises are recommended. Corticosteroid injections may provide a short-term beneficial effect. Platelet-Rich Plasma injections have recently gained notoriety. In case of failure of treatment, surgery is possible, but only in a minority of patients...|$|E
30|$|The overall {{prevalence}} of lateral and <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> was 2.5  % and 0.3  %, respectively. A shortened {{version of the}} disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (The QuickDASH) score was significantly higher in subjects with lateral epicondylitis than in those without (15.0  ±  12.7 vs 8.5  ±  11.1). Subjects with definite chronic hyperglycemia (HbA 1 c ≥  6.5) showed a 3.37 -times higher risk of lateral epicondylitis than those with favorable glycemic control (HbA 1 c <  5.5) (95  % confidence interval (CI) 1.16 – 8.56). Age and sex, as well as occupational status, smoking and alcohol preference, and other metabolic factors were not significantly related to higher risk of lateral epicondylitis.|$|E
40|$|Objective – Conservative {{treatment}} of <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis</b> including splinting, physical therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and local injection of steroids {{has been reported}} to be successful in most reported cases. In the present study, we evaluated the effectiveness of local injection of steroids. Methods – Over a period of 5 years (1997 – 2001), we randomized 38 patients (40 elbows) seen in our private clinics into two groups. The treatment group (20 elbows) received one injection of 40 mg methylprednisolone and 1 % lidocaine, and the control group (20 elbows) received one injection of normal saline and 1 % lidocaine. Patients in both groups were given standard NSAIDs, physical therapy, and splinting. Pain severity was assessed at 2, 4, and 12 months. Results – The severity of pain in both groups was same before the treatment and {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups. The difference in pain score between the two groups at 2 months was statistically significant (p = 0. 01). At 4 months, the mean pain scores in the two groups were similar (p = 0. 673) and there were no significant differences between the two groups at 12 months (p = 0. 942, Mann-Witney test). Conclusion – Since local injection of a steroid had only short-term benefits, we do not recommend it for the {{treatment of}} <b>medial</b> <b>epicondylitis.</b> NSAIDs, splinting, and physical therapy provide the best conservative approach in this condition; steroid injection near a sensitive nerve (ulnar nerve) is not justified...|$|E
