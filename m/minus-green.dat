5000|$|While {{there are}} many {{techniques}} for reproducing images in color, specific graphic processes and industrial equipment are used for mass reproduction of color images on paper. In this sense, [...] "color printing" [...] involves reproduction techniques suited for printing presses capable of thousands or millions of impressions for publishing newspapers and magazines, brochures, cards, posters and similar mass-market items. In this type of industrial or commercial printing, the technique used to print full-color images, such as color photographs, {{is referred to as}} four-color-process or merely process printing. Four inks are used: three secondary colors plus black. These ink colors are cyan, magenta, yellow and key (black); abbreviated as CMYK. Cyan {{can be thought of as}} minus-red, magenta as <b>minus-green,</b> and yellow as minus-blue. These inks are semi-transparent or translucent. Where two such inks overlap on the paper due to sequential printing impressions, a primary color is perceived. For example, yellow (minus-blue) overprinted by magenta (minus green) yields red. Where all three inks may overlap, almost all incident light is absorbed or subtracted, yielding near black, but in practical terms it is better and cheaper to use a separate black ink instead of combining three colored inks. The secondary or subtractive colors cyan, magenta and yellow may be considered [...] "primary" [...] by printers and watercolorists (whose basic inks and paints are transparent).|$|E
