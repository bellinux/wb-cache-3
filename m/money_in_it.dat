5|$|Ricardo Flores {{said that}} police found date rape drugs in his daughter's car, parked about 50 {{blocks from the}} hotel where she died. Her jewelry, money, {{identification}} and credit cards were missing, including about $1,000 her father had given her to purchase a laptop, and over $10,000 she had won earlier at the casino. Stephany reportedly kept this money in her car, but a police search found no <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Dude {{finds his}} {{bungalow}} completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him. He figures that Treehorn drugged {{him so that}} his goons could look for the ransom money at the Dude's home. After Maude has sex with him, she says she hopes to conceive a child; the Dude protests being a father, but Maude tells him {{that he will not}} be involved in the child's upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. Having an epiphany, the Dude and Walter travel to the Lebowski estate, while the Dude explains: when Lebowski, who apparently hated his wife, heard of the kidnapping, he withdrew money from the foundation, kept it for himself, and gave the Dude a briefcase without any <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> saying that it contained a million dollar ransom. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends (the nihilists) faked a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski. Walter and the Dude confront the Big Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, but is thrown out of his wheelchair by Walter, who believes that he's faking his paralysis.|$|E

500|$|Adams {{was educated}} at the Douglas County High School. She was not academically inclined, but was {{interested}} in the creative arts and sang in the school choir. Although she competed in track and gymnastics, she harbored ambitions of becoming a ballerina and trained as an apprentice at the local David Taylor Dance Company. She disliked her experience in high school and kept mostly to herself. After her graduation, she moved to Atlanta with her mother. She did not intend to go to college, which disappointed her parents, and she later regretted not getting more of an education. Realizing, at age 18, that she was not gifted enough to be a professional ballerina, Adams inclined towards musical theater, which she found was [...] "much better suited to [...] personality". One of her first jobs was in a community theater production of Annie, but she made no <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> To support herself, Adams worked as a greeter at a Gap store. She also {{took a job as a}} waitress at Hooters, where she had to work wearing tight gym outfits, and customers frequently misbehaved with her. Adams left the job soon after she had saved enough money to buy a used car.|$|E
