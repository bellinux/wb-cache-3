40|$|Voltage source {{inverter}} (VSI) -fed six-phase {{induction motor}} (IM) drives have high 6 n +/- 1, n = odd-order harmonic currents. This is because these currents, {{driven by the}} corresponding harmonic voltages in the inverter output, are limited only by the stator leakage impedance, as these harmonics are absent in the back electromotive force of the motor. To suppress the harmonic currents, either bulky inductive harmonic filters or complex pulsewidth modulation (PWM) techniques have to be used. This paper proposes a harmonic elimination scheme using switched capacitor filters for a VSI-fed split-phase IM drive. Two 3 -phase inverters fed from capacitors are used on the open-end side of the motor to suppress 6 n +/- 1, n = odd-order harmonics. A PWM scheme that can suppress the harmonics as well as balance the capacitor voltage is also proposed. The capacitor fed inverters are switched so that the fundamental voltage is not affected, and the fundamental power is always drawn from the <b>main</b> <b>inverters.</b> The proposed scheme is verified with a detailed experimental study.

These stipulations must be respected by the distributed power generators (suppliers), which put a cap on the penetration level.

However, there are few investigations that analyze these modulation methods applied to permanent magnet (PM) and wound-field synchronous machines, in which the rotor induces a back emf in the stator. In this thesis, three different three-level space vector PWM switching sequences are applied to a three-level neutral-point-clamped (NP) inverter driving an internal permanent magnet (IPM) machine load. The inherent qualities {{of each of the}} switching sequences when under the influence of a forcing function (the back emf) created by the permanent magnets of the machine are investigated. In particular, output voltage quality, output current quality, and dc bus neutral point balance are analyzed and compared. Two machine operating conditions are considered: rated speed, rated load and half speed, rated load. By considering these two different operating speeds, the three switching sequences may be analyzed under both two-level operation and three-level operation of the inverter.

30|$|An {{important}} consideration in power quality is that, {{according to the}} standards (e.g. IEEE Std 519 - 1992) the output waveform should obtain low level of THD. The power conversion process can endanger quality [85]. Power quality consists of current quality and voltage quality [86]. Current and voltage quality are related to deviations from the standards [87]. A single-frequency sine wave of constant frequency and amplitude has perfect quality [87]. Harmonics, voltage flickers, voltage dips and noise are examples of problems that negatively affect power quality. The {{most important of these}} problems is harmonics [86], which can cause decreased volt-ampere capacity, equipment overheating, current and voltage waveform distortion and increased losses [88]. The harmonic level is determined by the THD value, which is a measure of similarity of shape between a waveform and its <b>main</b> mechanisms [30]. <b>Inverter</b> output involves harmonics that might be harmful to the loads. Therefore, the inverter must use filters prior to sending power to the loads [89]. In addition, in inverters, and generally power converters, the quality of DC input voltage has {{an important role in the}} quality of the output waveform [90]. Accordingly, one way of enhancing the quality of the output waveform is filtering the DC input voltage. Generally, the second order low-pass LC filter is used for this purpose. It is simple and inexpensive and can decrease the output waveform’s higher harmonics components.|$|R

The main {{aim of this}} tutorial is to explain the phenomena of electric drives related to the torsional vibrations. All the components of an electric drive may affect torsional dynamics of the system. Naturally the main concern is torsional excitations. Another aspect is the electromechanical interaction in the air-gap of the motor that produces electromagnetic torsional stiffness and damping. These and other similar phenomena, related to the electric drives, have been observed on test fields and site conditions. The scope of the paper includes the most common induction, synchronous and permanent magnet motors. First, the various rotor structures of electric motors are discussed. Then, the effects of electromagnetic stiffness and damping on the torsional dynamics are introduced. Next, the main electric excitations are presented and their effect on drivetrain dimensioning is discussed.

40|$|Grid-connected {{photovoltaic}} {{power plants}} (GCPPPs) {{are affected by}} grid requirements and affect the system by different control strategies. The GCPPP should support the system based on the grid code requirements including FRT capability, reactive power injection during voltage sags and power quality. From the GCPPP side, the <b>main</b> reasons for <b>inverter</b> disconnection are: loss of synchronization, excessive ac currents, excessive dc voltage, and voltage rise in non-faulty phases under unbalanced voltage sags due to the reactive current injection. The thesis deals with large-scale GCPPPs studies covering both static and dynamic aspects. The focus on the static studies is to support the grid voltages by the capability of the inverter to inject reactive currents. Four different methods based on the grid codes are designed and applied to a 10 -MVA GCPPP. Considering dynamic studies, different control strategies are proposed to address the mentioned problems for inverter disconnection. The solutions are offered for three main controller strategies: controlling only the positive-sequence, controlling positive- and negative sequences and individual control of the phase currents. Dealing with the positive-sequence control of the currents, inverter disconnection issues are addressed for single-stage dc-ac and two-stage dc-dc-ac conversions by applying a current limiter and using an advanced phase-locked-loop (PLL). The difference in these two conversions is {{the protection of the}} dc voltage from overvoltage. While the dc voltage in the single-stage conversion is self-protected, three different methods are proposed to control the dc voltage in the two-stage conversion under voltage sag conditions. Limitations on using PI controllers in the current loops are demonstrated when controlling both positive- and negative-sequences of the grid currents. An alternative method based on resonant controllers is proposed with the capability to operate without a PLL for grid synchronization. The individual control of the phases is proposed, allowing the injection of a different reactive current to each phase. This prevents from overvoltage in the non-faulty phases during unbalanced voltage sags. For this control strategy a frequency-adaptive PLL is also designed that enables the extraction of the individual phase angles. Finally, the results confirm the viability of the proposed solutions using both simulation and experiments...|$|R
40|$|The former Research Institute for Sustainable Energy (RISE) testing {{laboratory}} was originally a facility for measuring, monitoring and testing {{a variety of}} renewable energy systems. The RISE facility was independent of the School of Engineering and Energy, but has recently {{been taken over by}} the School as the Engineering and Energy Laboratory. Many of the systems associated with the laboratory have not been operated {{for a number of years}} and the condition of these systems, and the equipment that is associated with them, is not known. Personnel involved with the former RISE facility have since left Murdoch taking with them their knowledge of the facility. This project was primarily concerned with re-commissioning these systems and developing an operational knowledge of the SCADA based control system. Areas to be covered in particular were: •	connections to the grid from PV arrays and wind turbines •	PLC system and software •	inverters, solar array simulator, environmental chamber and other peripheral equipment •	power supplies such as the diesel generator, motor generator set and battery banks •	 3 phase permanently connected power monitors •	AC and DC electrical systems Initial inspections of the electrical systems showed that two key components of the facility were found to be defective and would need to be rectified if the facility was to function properly. These components were the diesel generator which provided electricity totally independent of the grid for testing purposes, and a fault on the PLC which was affecting the operation of the electrical systems. Also several main pieces of equipment had since been removed from the facility; most notably of these being the battery banks, <b>main</b> test <b>inverter</b> and the DC supply from the wind turbines located in what is now known as the Renewable Energy Outdoor Test Area (ROTA). Several pieces of equipment required for the operation of the diesel generator would also require attention such as the fuel tank and starting battery. Approval was granted for the alternator to be repaired and placed back into service. Approval was also granted for the purchase of a replacement analogue input card to rectify the fault with the PLC. In addition to this another requirement of the project was to develop a system so that the laboratory could be used as a training facility for future students. A procedure was developed so that an electrical system consisting of actual real components; a source, a transmission and distribution system and a load could be simulated. Software was also developed using National Instruments LabVIEW software to monitor and record various power parameters from the system. The system is referred to as the “Small Electrical Distribution System”. As an aside to this a program has been developed that monitors and records voltage, current and power that is being produced by the Real PV Array located on the roof of the Energy and Engineering Laboratory building. For someone who is unfamiliar with the setup of the electrical systems that make up the Energy and Engineering Laboratory a simplified block diagram of the Main AC switchboard has been produced. Schedules have been included of all socket inlets and outlets, main AC and communications cables and the Main AC Switchboard nomenclature. The diesel generator is nearly ready to be re-commissioned after approximately 5 years of non use. Procedures have been developed so that a user can configure the Main AC switchboard so that the “Small Electrical Distribution System” can be operated safely and measurements obtained and analysed. The main goal of the project was to get the diesel generator operating; therefore this report is focused on the equipment associated with the diesel generator. The equipment focused on was the diesel generator itself, the Main AC Switchboard, the Load Bank and the PLC system. Systems such as the Main DC switchboard and Solar Array Simulator were not covered in as much detail as they are not required for the “Small Electrical Distribution System”...|$|R
