40|$|AbstractThe paper ios {{concerned}} {{with the problem of}} finding a real, diagonal matrix M such that A + M has prescribed eigenvalues where A is any given symmetric matrix. This problem represents a discrete analog of the inverse eigenvalue problem in which we seek to determine a “potential” g(x) such that the operator in Hilbert space, l(y) = − y″ + g(x) y with appropriate boundary conditions, possesses a prescribed spectrum. Section 2 defines the “inverse problem” and its generalization. In Section 3, upper and lower bounds are given for the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix, obtained by the iterative application of Temple's theorem. Also, an estimate is given for the changes in the eigenvalues produced by perturbing a given symmetric matrix by a diagonal <b>matrix.</b> <b>Section</b> 4 contains a complete discussion of the case of 2 × 2 matrices. In Section 5, from simple considerations concerning rotations in an n(n + 1) 2 -dimensional space, necessary conditions are given for the inverse problem to have a solution. In Section 6, the Brouwer fixed point theorem is applied to an operator equation which is equivalent to the “inverse problem. ” A sufficient condition is given for the problem to have a solution: let k denote a certain seminorm on the set of all symmetric matrices and let d be the minimal mutual distance of the given eigenvalues. Then the inverse problem has a solution provided k(A) d ⩽ 0. 288. Under only slightly stronger conditions (k(A) d ⩽ 0. 25), it is shown in Section 7, using the Banach contraction theorem, that the iteration converges and the solution is locally unique.

40|$|The aim of {{this short}} lecture course is to develop Selberg’s trace formula for a compact {{hyperbolic}} surface M, and discuss some of its applications. The main motivation for our studies is quantum chaos: the Laplace-Beltrami operator − ∆ on the surface M represents the quantum Hamiltonian of a particle, whose classical dynamics is governed by the (strongly chaotic) geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of M. The trace formula is currently the only available tool to analyze the fine structure of the spectrum of −∆; no individual formulas for its eigenvalues are known. In the case of more general quantum systems, the role of Selberg’s formula is {{taken over by the}} semiclassical Gutzwiller trace formula [10], [7]. We begin by reviewing the trace formulas for the simplest compact manifolds, the circle S 1 (Section 1) and the sphere S 2 (Section 2). In both cases, the corresponding geodesic flow is integrable, and the trace formula is a consequence of the Poisson summation formula. In the remaining sections we shall discuss the following topics: the Laplacian on the hyperbolic plane and isometries (Section 3); Green’s functions (Section 4); Selberg’s point pair invariants (Section 5); The ghost of the sphere (Section 6); Linear operators on hyperbolic surfaces (Section 7); A trace formula for hyperbolic cylinders and poles of the scattering <b>matrix</b> (<b>Section</b> 8); Back to general hyperbolic surfaces (Section 9); The spectrum of a compact surface, Selberg’s pre-trace and trace formulas (Section 10); Heat kernel and Weyl’s law (Section 11); Density of closed geodesics (Section 12); Trace of the resolvent (Section 13); Selberg’s zeta function (Section 14); Suggestions for exercises and further reading (Section 15).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{computational}} complexity of approximating the 2 ->q norm of linear operators (defined as ||A||_{ 2 ->q} = sup_v ||Av||_q/||v||_ 2), {{as well as}} connections between this question and issues arising in quantum information theory {{and the study of}} Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). We show the following: 1. For any constant even integer q>= 4, a graph $G$ is a "small-set expander" if and only if the projector into the span of the top eigenvectors of G's adjacency matrix has bounded 2 ->q norm. As a corollary, a good approximation to the 2 ->q norm will refute the Small-Set Expansion Conjecture [...] a close variant of the UGC. We also show that such a good approximation can be obtained in exp(n^(2 /q)) time, thus obtaining a different proof of the known subexponential algorithm for Small Set Expansion. 2. Constant rounds of the "Sum of Squares" semidefinite programing hierarchy certify an upper bound on the 2 -> 4 norm of the projector to low-degree polynomials over the Boolean cube, as well certify the unsatisfiability of the "noisy cube" and "short code" based instances of Unique Games considered by prior works. This improves on the previous upper bound of exp(poly log n) rounds (for the "short code"), as well as separates the "Sum of Squares"/"Lasserre" hierarchy from weaker hierarchies that were known to require omega(1) rounds. 3. We show reductions between computing the 2 -> 4 norm and computing the injective tensor norm of a tensor, a problem with connections to quantum information theory. Three corollaries are: (i) the 2 -> 4 norm is NP-hard to approximate to precision inverse-polynomial in the dimension, (ii) the 2 -> 4 norm does not have a good approximation (in the sense above) unless 3 -SAT can be solved in time exp(sqrt(n) polylog(n)), and (iii) known algorithms for the quantum separability problem imply a non-trivial additive approximation for the 2 -> 4 norm.
