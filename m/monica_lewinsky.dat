5|$|In 1998 and 2000, Moran faced Republican {{and flat}} tax {{advocate}} Demaris H. Miller. In the 1998 campaign Miller accused Moran of flip-flopping in {{his support of}} President Bill Clinton, after Moran, {{who had been a}} vocal supporter of the Clinton White House, voted in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry following the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal.|$|E
5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E
5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime {{economic}} expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E

To combat the threat of factual or historical error, Rogan kept copious notes during every significant meeting relating to impeachment from his first day on the Committee. He did this so there would be a complete and accurate historical chronicle - - the best evidence - - of what really happened behind the scenes in the unfolding drama.|$|R
25|$|The 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis began as the property bubble in the Far East began to burst in Thailand, causing large financial losses {{in those countries}} that greatly affected foreign investors.

25|$|Starr {{served as}} a federal Court of Appeals judge and as {{solicitor}} general for George H. W. Bush. He received the most publicity for his tenure as independent counsel while Bill Clinton was U.S.president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater real estate investments of Bill Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering the Independent Counsel Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including an extramarital affair that Bill Clinton had with <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> After several years of investigation, Starr filed the Starr Report, which alleged that Bill Clinton lied {{about the existence of}} the affair during a sworn deposition. The allegation lead to the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the five-year suspension of Clinton's law license.|$|E
5000|$|Other staffers, {{many of whom}} {{themselves}} {{began their}} careers as interns, reported later that they had seen young women come in for internships wearing [...] "gold stiletto heels, thigh-high boots and belly shirts" [...] in addition to short skirts. Most male staffers did not mind, but female staffers, even those {{just a few years}} older, were often resentful and offended. The scandal in which White House intern <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky's</b> sexual affair with President Bill Clinton had led to his impeachment was fresh in institutional memory, and some staffers and journalists wondered if the skimpily dressed young female interns were trying to emulate her. In 2004, Jessica Cutler, a staffer for Ohio Senator Mike DeWine, wrote for a while a blog in which she detailed an active sex life with a variety of men she met through her work, which did little to dispel that idea.|$|R

25|$|Hitchens met Carol Blue in Los Angeles in 1989 {{and they}} married in 1991. Hitchens called it love at first sight. In 1999, as harsh critics of Clinton, Hitchens and Carol Blue {{submitted}} an affidavit to the trial managers of the Republican Party in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Therein they swore that their then-friend, Sidney Blumenthal, had described <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> as a stalker. This allegation contradicted Blumenthal's own sworn deposition in the trial, and it resulted in a hostile exchange of opinion {{in the public sphere}} between Hitchens and Blumenthal. Following the publication of Blumenthal's The Clinton Wars, Hitchens wrote several pieces in which he accused Blumenthal of manipulating the facts. The incident ended their friendship and sparked a personal crisis for Hitchens who was stridently criticised by friends for what they saw as a cynical and ultimately politically futile act.|$|E
25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.|$|E

For defending the legal rights of Lewinsky, Kohn and his partners, brother Stephen and David K.
