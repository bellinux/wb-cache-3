40|$|GaV_ 4 S_ 8 is a multiferroic {{semiconductor}} hosting Néel-type magnetic skyrmions {{dressed with}} electric polarization. At T_s = 42 K, the compound undergoes a structural phase transition of weakly first-order, from a non-centrosymmetric cubic phase at high temperatures to a polar rhombohedral structure at low temperatures. Below T_s, ferroelectric domains are formed with the electric polarization pointing along {{any of the}} four axes. Although in this material the size and the shape of the ferroelectric-ferroelastic domains may act as important limiting factors {{in the formation of the}} Néel-type skyrmion lattice emerging below T_C= 13 K, the characteristics of polar domains in GaV_ 4 S_ 8 have not been studied yet. Here, we report on the inspection of the local-scale ferroelectric domain distribution in rhombohedral GaV_ 4 S_ 8 using low-temperature piezoresponse force microscopy. We observed mechanically and electrically compatible lamellar domain patterns, where the lamellae are aligned parallel to the (100) -type planes with a typical spacing between 100 nm- 1. 2 μm. We expect that the control of ferroelectric domain size in polar skyrmion hosts can be exploited for the spatial confinement and <b>manupulation</b> of Néel-type skyrmions...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the current investigation were to: (a) examine the structure of subjective health risk perception in terms of some major variables (representativeness, availability, distress), hypothesized as influencing judgments of probability and severity of consequences; (b) {{determine the effects of}} anchoring (low, middle, high), referencing (self, other), and response format (frequency, analogue), conditions on the invariance of risk ratings; and (c) explore the degree to which personality factors (health concern, hypochondriasis), contribute to judgments of health risk. The stimuli used were 55 physical symptoms. A total of 500 subjects participated in this study. A threshold model of responding was used to decompose probability and severity judgments into threshold, salience and distance components for detailed analysis. LISREL modelling techniques were used in a double-cross validated study to determine the operating parameters relating components of probability and severity judgments to major cognitive, emotive and personality dimensions. Major results and conclusions of the study were: (a) A two component factor model of risk judgment was offered as an extension and refinement to models previously proposed in the literature; (b) The overriding dimensions contributing to judgments of risk appear to be distress and perceived controllability; (c) Both optimistic and pessimistic biases in probability and severity judgments were observed depending on the referencing context. These biases tended to decrease as familiarity of the symptoms increased; (d) Anchoring manipulations affected individuals 2 ̆ 7 judgments of probability, but did not influence judgments of severity: Referencing <b>manupulations</b> affected judgments of severity but did not influence judgments of probability; (e) LISREL results indicated some support for the model proposed by Kahneman and Tversky, for data where the aggregation is over stimuli. The use of a two component threshold model to break judgments down into psychometric components revealed relationships between variables, otherwise missed by more molar approaches; and (f) Personality dimensions had both direct and indirect influences on probability judgments (but not on severity judgments) under self-referenced conditions...|$|R

40|$|Single bronchiolar ciliary {{cells were}} {{isolated}} from rat lungs. The β 2 -adrenergic regulation of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was studied using video-optical microscopy. Terbutaline (a β 2 -adrenergic agonist) increased CBF in a dose-dependent manner, {{and it also}} decreased {{the volume of the}} ciliary cells. These terbutaline actions were inhibited by a PKA inhibitor (H- 89) and mimicked by forskolin, IBMX and DBcAMP. Ion transport inhibitors were used to isosmotically manipulate the volume of the terbutaline-stimulated bronchiolar ciliary cells. Amiloride (1 μm) and bumetanide (20 μm) potentiated cell shrinkage and the CBF increase, and they shifted the terbutaline dose–response curve to the lower-concentration side. Quinidine (500 μm), in contrast, increased cell volume and suppressed the CBF increase. Moreover, a KCl solution containing amiloride (1 μm) and strophanthidin (100 μm) increased cell volume and suppressed the CBF increase, and then the subsequent removal of either amiloride or strophanthidin decreased cell volume and further increased CBF. NPPB (10 μm) or glybenclamide (200 μm) had no effect on the action of terbutaline. Thus, in terbutaline-stimulated ciliary cells, cell shrinkage enhances the CBF increase; in contrast, cell swelling suppresses it. However, the results of direct <b>manupulation</b> of cell volume by applying osmotic stresses (hyperosmotic shrinkage or hyposmotic swelling) were the opposite of the findings of the isosmotic experiments: hyposmotic cell swelling enhanced the CBF increase, while isosmotic swelling suppressed it. These results suggest that isosmotic and non-isosmotic volume changes in terbutaline-stimulated bronchiolar ciliary cells may trigger different signalling pathways. In conclusion, terbutaline increases CBF and decreases the volume of rat bronchiolar ciliary cells via cAMP accumulation under isosmotic conditions, and the isosmotic cell shrinkage enhances the CBF increase by increasing cAMP sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the {{economic}} analysis of contract farming with a comparison of income, access to technology and credit of contract and non-contract farmers. The advantages of contract farming for smallholders have also been evaluated. In contract farming, quality inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and plant protection chemicals are provided to the farmers at their farm gate, coupled with the technical advice on production aspects. This not only reduces the working capital needs of farmers but also substantially reduces their transaction cost per unit of output. Borrowing of crop loans has been found 33 per cent higher by non-contract farmers than contract farmers, as the former have to buy material inputs. The net returns have been found higher for contract than non-contract farmers. Within contract farming, net returns have been recorded higher under domestic than foreign contracts for both baby corn and chilli. In the case of non-contract farmers, the net returns (Rs 3, 035) have been found less than one-third of domestic contract farmers (Rs 10, 610) and slightly more than one-third of foreign contract farmers (Rs 8, 050). In the case of chilli also, the net returns realized per acre have been recorded maximum under domestic contract farmers, followed by foreign contract farmers and non-contract farmers. The returns per rupee invested have been noted higher in farming of baby corn in all the three categories than those of chilli farming. The constraints identified in the study include delay in payment and delivery of inputs, delay in lifting the produce, access to seeds, <b>manupulation</b> of grades by the buyers, and high cost of inputs in contract farming. Factors inducing farmers into contract are: low initial investment, better price for the produce, access to market, technical support on package of practices, access to inputs and easy transportation facilities.

40|$|Graph {{coloring}} is {{an assignment}} a color to each vertex, which each vertex that adjacent {{is given a}} different color. Graph coloring is a useful algorithm for channel allocation on Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS). Through this algorithm,each access point (AP) that adjacent gives different channels based on colors available. Welsh Powell algorithm and Degree of saturation (Dsatur) are the popular algorithms being used for channel allocation in this domain. Welsh Powell algorithm is an algorithm that tries to solve the graph coloring problem. Dsatur algorithm is an algorithm coloring sorted by building sequence of vertices dynamically. However,these algorithms have its weaknesses {{in terms of the}} minimum number of channel required. In this study,channel allocation called Vertex Merge Algorithm (VMA) is proposed with aim to minimize number of required channels. It is based on the logical structure of vertex in order to a coloring the graph. Each vertex on the graph arranged based on decreasing number of degree. The vertex in the first place on the set gives a color,and then this vertex is merged with non-adjacent vertex. This process is repeatedly until all vertices colored. The assignment provides a minimum number of channels required. A series of an experiment was carried out by using one computer. Vertex Merge Algorithm (VMA) simulation is developed under Linux platform. It was carried out in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) programming integrated with GNU Image <b>Manupulation</b> Program (GIMP) for open and edit image. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm work successfully in channel allocation on DSSS with the minimum of channels required. The average percentage {{reduction in the number of}} required channels among the VMA, Dsatur algorithm and Welsh Powell algorithm in the simple graph is equivalent to 0. 0 %. Meanwhile between the VMA and Dsatur algorithm in the complex graph is equivalent to 18. 1 %. However,VMA and Welsh Powell algorithm is not compared in the complex graph since its drawback in terms of not fulfill the graph coloring concept. This is because there are two adjacent vertices have the same color. Overall, even there is no reduction for number of required channel among VMA,Dsatur algorithm and Welsh Powell algorithm in the simple graph,but the outstanding significant contribution of VMA since it has reduction in the complex graph...|$|E
