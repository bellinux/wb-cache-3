40|$|One {{hundred and}} {{thirteen}} selected cases of ectopic pregnancy were analyzed {{to clarify the}} diagnostic and therapeutic factors. The incidence of this condition was higher in “ward” patients and in the Negro. Salpingitis was the commonest etiological factor. The common symptoms were pain, a <b>missed</b> <b>period,</b> vaginal bleeding, faintness, nausea and vomiting, and shoulder pain. The common signs were abdominal tenderness, a positive “chandelier sign”, rebound tenderness, a pelvic mass and pallor. Fertility {{of the women in}} this series was equal to that of women in the general population of the same age group. The frog (pregnancy) test was the only significant laboratory test. Colpocentesis proved very helpful, whereas dilatation and curettage did not. Conservative operation, consisting of salpingectomy plus a uterine wedge, was recommended for tubal pregnancy and was performed in 107 patients. The ovary was removed only if involved. Interstitial pregnancies were treated by removal of the corneal portion of the uterus and by salpingectomy, rather than hysterectomy; this procedure was successful in four out of four patients.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease of central nervous system. Women {{are more susceptible}} to this disease. One of the obvious clinical complaints in women with multiple sclerosis specially treated with Beta Interferones is menstrual cycle irregularity. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of menstrual irregularities and probable changes in blood levels of related hormones (FSH, LH, PRL, TSH, T 4, T 3) in 58 females with definite MS treated with beta interferones versus 58 healthy women. In comparison to the control group, the patients had higher prevalence of irregular menstruation (P= 0. 001), oligomenorrhea (p= 0. 03), abnormal amount of menstrual blood flow (P= 0. 001), abnormal duration of menstrual flow (P= 0. 01) and <b>missed</b> <b>period</b> (P= 0. 04). Mean LH level in patients group was higher than control group (P= 0. 04). Hyperprolactinemia (&gt; 25. 5 ng/ml) was more prevalent in patients group. There were not a significant difference in plasma levels of FSH and thyroid hormones between two groups.

40|$|We {{begin by}} {{defining}} "biological markers" {{for the purposes}} of the present review, distinguishing markers from other types of information, such as subject reports or conventional clinical data. We find the distinctions to be hazy. Next, from the standpoint of epidemiologists, we set out circumstances in which exposure markers might be needed, suggesting requirements for useful markers. We give two instances (lead, PCB), drawn from studies of female reproduction, where the use of exposure markers is compared to environmental or anamnestic data. Effect markers are considered in turn. It is argued that their usefulness (if they are to be more informative than exposure markers) depends on their sensitivity and specificity in relation to the disease outcome. Also, their timeliness, and the use that can be made of the gain in time, for individuals and populations is discussed. In this context, we consider markers of events before and around fertilization; more specifically, we consider those events that precede the clinical marker of the first <b>missed</b> <b>period.</b> In returning to the potential uses of biological markers in discovering or interpreting female reproductive disorders that might be owed to environmental causes, we compare markers of the pre- and peri-implantation phases with markers of the postimplantation phase, drawing on experience with studies of chromosome anomaly in spontaneous abortion. Finally, we suggest other sensitive reproductive processes for which biological markers might usefully be developed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tubal {{sterilization}} is {{the permanent}} and effective contraception method. This {{can be performed}} at any time, but at least half are performed in conjunction with cesarean or vaginal delivery and are termed puerperal. The most complication after tubal ligation is ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy {{is the leading cause}} of maternal death in first trimester. Case presentation: We present a 33 years old woman gravida 5, para 4, all normal vaginal delivery, presented with complaints of delayed menstrual period, pelvic pain and spotting. She underwent tubal ligation for two times. For the first time she had puerperal Pomeroy tubal sterilization after third child delivery. Intra uterine pregnancy occurred three years later. One day after vaginal delivery of fourth child, she underwent post partum tubal ligation with the Parkland method. Tubal pregnancy occurred nine months later. Physical examination identified acute abdomen. Pelvic ultrasound showed no gestational sac in uterine cavity. The sac with fetal pole was in right adnexa. Beta-HCG was 2840 mIU/ml. She underwent laparotomy. Surgical management included salpingectomy with cornual resection in both sides. The surgery identified Ectopic pregnancy. Conclusion: Any symptoms of pregnancy in a woman after tubal ligation must be investigated; an ectopic pregnancy should be excluded. Ectopic pregnancy must be considered, in any woman with lower abdominal pain, <b>missed</b> <b>period</b> and vaginal bleed-ing. Conception after tubal sterilization can be explained by fistula formation and re-canalization of fallopian tube...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis was to develop and evaluate two rapid, colloidal gold-based, immunochromatographic assays, a ‘cassette’ and ‘wick’ type, both for the qualitative detection of the glycoprotein hormone, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in human urine and serum. hCG is present in large quantities in the urine and serum of pregnant women and thus, provides a means for diagnosing pregnancy. A key element of this work was to develop assays, which {{would be capable of}} competing strongly in this market. The outcome of this project was a highly sensitive and specific cassette and wick hCG assay, having the capability to detect as low as 25 IU/L hCG {{on the first day of}} a <b>missed</b> <b>period.</b> These assays also had the capacity to detect levels up to 250, 000 IU/L hCG before a ‘hook’ effect was observed. This analytical range was equal to the majority of the tests already on the market. Evaluation of the two assays yielded 100 % sensitivity and specificity for the cassette assay with urine samples and 98. 5 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for serum samples. A sensitivity of 99. 4 % (urine) and 100 % (serum) and a specificity of 100 % (urine) and 98 % (serum) were obtained for the wick assay. It should be emphasised that these assays are limited to the qualitative detection of hCG and subsequently, all positive results should be confirmed by a doctor. It is a measure of the success of the assays that predicted sales for the first six months of 2000 are estimated at -$ 60, 000 for the cassette assay and -$ 100, 000 for the wick assay...|$|E

40|$|Background: Standard {{treatment}} of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD) is chemotherapy. Single-agent chemotherapy regime including Methotrexate (MTX) or Actinomycin. Single-agent {{is widely used}} in {{treatment of}} persistent trophoblastic disease. We reported an uncommon toxicity of low-dose single-agent methotrexate in a patient. Case Presentation: A 20 -year-old woman, primary gravid after two months <b>missed</b> <b>period</b> and spotting with diagnosis of incomplete abortion with uterine size equivalent of ten weeks pregnancy (8 - 10 cm) underwent evacuation curettage. In serial follow-up, based on rise of beta-hCG titer and absence of metastatic disease, it was categorized as low-risk persistent trophoblastic disease. She was referred to gynecology oncology center of Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in May 2014. Because of rise of beta-hCG titer, after complete metastatic work-up and lack of disease in other sites, persistent disease was diagnosed and candidate for chemotherapy (single agent low-dose). The patient received first course of therapy with MTX (50 mg/m&sup 2;, intra muscular). Unfortunately, {{after two days of}} treatment she developed uncommon severe toxicity, fever, severe nausea and vomiting, tachycardia, and generalized weakness. Also, we found hematologic abnormality (WBC: - 14000 - 15000 µI, platelet- 540 µI and sever neutropenia), and abnormal rising in liver function test (SGOT, SGPT) (three to four times) and renal function test (BUN and Creatinine) (two times). In addition, she had disseminated erosive lesion in all of body especially in face. Due to the fatal side effects of chemotherapy, she was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Fortunately, after two to three weeks, she was improved by conservative management. After few weeks beta-hCG titer was in normal limit. However she had normal serial beta-hCG in one year of follow-up. Conclusion: It is important to emphasis unpredictable side effects of chemotherapy with low-dose methotrexate...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a visual assay for rapid detection of choriogona-dotropin (hGC) in human urine, and evaluate a pregnancy test kit {{that is based}} on this assay and designed for use by the general public. The assay involves the formation of an antibody-antigen complex between the anti-hGC antibodies coated on the membrane protein of Staphylococcus aureus bactena, prestained with hematoxylin, and the hGC concen-trated on a column of Sepharose-concanavalin A. The test was calibrated to detect as little hGC as 0. 9 (SD 0. 15) mt. unitJmL. The kit, clinically tested with 448 urine samples, was 99. 6 % accurate. Simple to perform, the test gives highly reliable results as early as five days after the missed men-strual period. Addftlonal Keyphrases: pregnancy test “kit”methods im-mobilizedantibodieson S. aureusmembraneprotein Diagnosis of both normal and abnormal pregnancies has been improved with the advent of immunological methods for detection of pregnancy (1, 2). Concentrations of human choriogonadotropin (hGC) in urine increase from undetect-able at the beginning of pregnancy to about 100 mt. units/ mL at 10 weeks of gestation. Thereafter they decline and remain at approximately 10 to 20 int. units/mL (3). Rapid measurement of hOC to detect pregnancy and to investigate gynecological emergencies is now a common procedure. Procedures in current use are based on immunoassay with use of radioisotopic, fluorescent, or enzyme tracers (4, 5). Although accurate and sensitive, these methods are usually time consuming, because the sample must be brought to the laboratory and the techniques and equipment ordinarily are available only during working hours. A test of equivalent sensitivity and accuracy that could be performed at any time by untrained individuals would therefore be of great value. We describe here the immunochemistry method and clinical studies of a pregnancy kit based on this method and designed for home use by the general public. The method is sensitive enough to detect as little as 1 int. unit of hCG per milliliter of urine, so the kit can be expected to give reliable results as early as five days after the <b>missed</b> <b>period...</b>|$|E
