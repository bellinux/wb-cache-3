5|$|Before the 1958 season, O'Connell, who {{lacked the}} stature and {{durability}} Paul Brown wanted in a starter, retired {{to take a}} coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named as his replacement. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527yards – almost twice as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other back and a league record at the time.|$|E
5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor {{for three and}} a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Wartime {{affected}} the club as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other; despite spending cuts and other economies, by 1917 the situation became untenable. Aberdeen {{dropped out of}} competitive football, along with Dundee and Raith Rovers. Senior football returned on 16 August 1919, and Aberdeen resumed with a fixture against Albion Rovers. Philip was still in charge, and continued to oversee a team capable of isolated good results, but never quite able to sustain a challenge long enough to win a trophy. In 1923, Aberdeen were drawn against Peterhead in the Scottish Cup, and posted their record score—a 13–0 victory. Philip retired a year later, and was replaced as manager by Paddy Travers. He presided over the team's first Scottish Cup final in 1937.|$|E

25|$|His congressional {{speeches and}} {{published}} writings demonstrate {{the central role}} that Morgan played in the drama of racial politics on Capitol Hill and in the national press from 1889 to 1891. More importantly, they reveal his leadership in forging the ideology of white supremacy that dominated American race relations from the 1890s to the 1960s. Indeed, Morgan emerged as the most prominent and notorious racist ideologue of his day, a man who, as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other individual, {{set the tone for}} the coming Jim Crow era.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{psychology}}, as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other {{field of}} psychology heavily {{relies on a}} balance of pure observation and quantitative methods in psychology. The study of education generally combines the studies of history, sociology, and ethics with theoretical approaches. Smeyers and Depaepe explain that historically, the study of education and child rearing {{have been associated with}} the interests of policymakers and practitioners within the educational field, however, the recent shift to sociology and psychology has opened the door for new findings in education as a social science. Now being its own academic discipline, educational psychology has proven to be helpful for social science researchers.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1958 season, Cleveland {{was again}} {{in search of}} a quarterback. O'Connell had played well in the {{previous}} two seasons – he led the league in passing in 1957 – but lacked the stature and durability Paul Brown wanted in a starter. He stood at just 5 feet, 10 inches tall and was hurt numerous times, including a sprained ankle and a broken bone in his leg that kept him out of the last two games of the 1957 regular season. Due in part to these injuries, O'Connell retired early in 1958 to take a coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named the starter. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527 yards – almost twice as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other back and a league record at the time.|$|E

25|$|The Sound of Music {{is one of}} {{the most}} commercially {{successful}} films of all time. Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States, from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week. It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965. One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers. In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population. By January 1966, the film had earned $20 million in distributor rentals from just 140 roadshow engagements in the United States and Canada. Overseas, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, including the United Kingdom, where the film earned £4 million in rentals and grossed £6 million—more than twice as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other film had ever taken in. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time, surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years.|$|E
25|$|Dryden was prolific; and he {{was often}} accused of plagiarism. Both before and after his Laureateship, he wrote public odes. He {{attempted}} the Jacobean pastoral {{along the lines of}} Walter Raleigh and Philip Sidney, but his greatest successes and fame came from his attempts at apologetics for the restored court and the Established Church. His Absalom and Achitophel and Religio Laici both served the King directly by making controversial royal actions seem reasonable. He also pioneered the mock-heroic. Although Samuel Butler had invented the mock-heroic in English with Hudibras (written during the Interregnum but published in the Restoration), Dryden's MacFlecknoe set up the satirical parody. Dryden was himself not of noble blood, {{and he was}} never awarded the honours that he had been promised by the King (nor was he repaid the loans he had made to the King), but he did as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> peer to serve Charles II. Even when James II came to the throne and Roman Catholicism was on the rise, Dryden attempted to serve the court, and his The Hind and the Panther praised the Roman church above all others. After that point, Dryden suffered for his conversions, and he was the victim of many satires.|$|E

Lady Constance Kell commented that [...] "most of the agents employed by the Germans worked only for the money they gained and were regarded with utter contempt". Similarly, Thomson described [...] "the scum of neutral spies", of whom he said, [...] "we came to wish that a distinction could have been made between patriotic spies like Lody and the hirelings who pestered us through the ensuing years". Shortly after Lody's death he was described in the House of Commons as [...] "a patriot who had died for his country as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> soldier who fell in the field." ...|$|E
500|$|The Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) is {{the deity}} of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or Pastafarianism.

According to adherents, Pastafarianism is a [...] "real, legitimate religion, as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other". It is legally recognized as a religion in the Netherlands and New Zealand – where Pastafarian representatives have been authorized to celebrate weddings and where the first legally recognized Pastafarian wedding was performed in April 2016. However, in the United States, a federal judge has ruled that the [...] "Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster" [...] is not a real religion.|$|E

For {{the rest of his}} life, Kennan continued to reiterate that the article did not imply an automatic commitment to resist Soviet [...] "expansionism" [...] wherever it occurred, with little distinction of primary and secondary interests. The article did not make it obvious that Kennan favored employing political and economic rather than military methods as the chief agent of containment. [...] "My thoughts about containment" [...] said Kennan in a 1996 interview to CNN, [...] "were of course distorted by the people who understood it and pursued it exclusively as a military concept; and I think that that, as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> other cause, led to [...] 40 years of unnecessary, fearfully expensive and disoriented process of the Cold War".|$|E
500|$|The male leads Horner and Harcourt {{were played}} by the contrasted actors Charles Hart and Edward Kynaston (or Kenaston). The forcefully {{masculine}} 45-year-old Hart [...] "was celebrated for superman roles, notably the arrogant, bloodthirsty Almanzor in John Dryden's Conquest of Granada", and also for playing rakish comedy heroes with nonchalance and charisma. Many critics credit the personalities and skills of Hart and Nell Gwyn with creating, as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>any</b> playwright did, the famous flirting/bantering Restoration comedy couple. The beautiful androgynous Kynaston, probably in his early thirties, was {{a different kind of}} hero. He had started his career in 1660 as the outstanding Restoration female impersonator [...] "the prettiest woman in the whole house" [...] before real women entered the profession in the fall of 1660. (The 2004 movie Stage Beauty is loosely based on Kynaston's career.) ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics, such as James Berardinelli, saw a {{fundamental}} {{weakness in the}} film: the [...] "overemphasis on story may be a mistake, because {{there are times when}} Licence to Kills narrative bogs down."

[...] Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, said of the film: [...] "It boggles my mind that Licence to Kill is so controversial. There's really more of a true Ian Fleming story in that script than in most of the post-60s Bond movies." [...] John Glen has said Licence to Kill [...] "is among my best Bond films, if not the best".|$|E
