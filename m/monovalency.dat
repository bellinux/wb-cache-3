50|$|The verb {{requires}} {{all of its}} {{arguments in}} a well-formed sentence, although they can sometimes undergo valency reduction or expansion. For instance, to eat is naturally divalent, as in he eats an apple, but may be reduced to <b>monovalency</b> in he eats. This is called valency reduction. In the southeastern United States, an emphatic trivalent form of eat is in use, as in I'll eat myself some supper. Verbs that are usually monovalent, like sleep, cannot take a direct object. However, there are cases where the valency of such verbs can be expanded, for instance in He sleeps the sleep of death. This is called valency expansion. Verb valence can also be {{described in terms of}} syntactic versus semantic criteria. The syntactic valency of a verb refers to the number of dependent arguments that the verb can have, while semantic valence describes the thematic relations associated with a verb.|$|E
5000|$|... “Movement {{within the}} study of {{literature}} concerned with {{the study of}} literature as a social system of interactions. The main question {{is what happens to}} literature: it is written, published, distributed, read, censored, imitated, etc. The empirical study of literature originated as a reaction to, and an attempt at, solving the basic problem of hermeneutics; that is, how the validation of literary interpretation can be demonstrated. From reception theory it had already become clear that interpretations are not only tied to the text, but also, and even to a great extent, to the reader — both in terms of the individual and of social conventions. This led to the theory of radical (cognitive) constructivism, based on the thesis that the subject largely construes its empirical world itself. The logical consequence of all this, to be seen in the work of Siegfried J. Schmidt, is the separation of interpretation and the strictly scientific study of literature based on radical constructivism. The literary system of actions is observed from the outside — not experienced — and roughly characterized as depending on two conventions (hypotheses) that are tested continually. These conventions are the aesthetic convention (as opposed to the convention of facts in the daily language of reference) and the polyvalence convention (as opposed to the <b>monovalency</b> in the daily empirical world). Thus, the object of study of the empirical study of literature is not only the text in itself, but the roles of action within the literary system, namely, production, distribution, reception, and the processing of texts. The methods used are primarily taken from the social sciences, reception theory, cognitive science, psychology, etc. In general the steps to be taken in empirical research are the formation of a hypothesis, putting it into practice, testing, and evaluation. More concretely, for the study of reader response a wide array of techniques are used, ranging from protocol techniques and thinking aloud protocol to pre-structured techniques, such as the semantic seven point scale (C. Osgood) and the classification technique (card sorting), and forms of content analysis, discourse analysis, association techniques, etc. Some objections often raised to the empirical study of literature are the triviality of many of its research results such as confirmation of what was already known or suspected or its reductionism (artificiality of the framework and set-up, and limitation to reader response instead of the study of the text). It is clear, however, that the empirical study of literature by its specific approach of the object and its focus on methodology is an outstanding way to explore the socio-cultural aspects of the literary system. It makes an irreplaceable contribution {{to the development of a}} more rational, scientific, and socially relevant study of literature.” ...|$|E

40|$|A {{cardinal}} {{property of}} neural stem cells (NSCs) is {{their ability to}} adopt multiple fates upon differentiation. The epigenome is widely seen as a read-out of cellular potential and a manifestation {{of this can be}} seen in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where promoters of many lineage-specific regulators are marked by a bivalent epigenetic signature comprising trimethylation of both lysine 4 and lysine 27 of histone H 3 (H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 me 3, respectively). Bivalency has subsequently emerged as a powerful epigenetic indicator of stem cell potential. Here, we have interrogated the epigenome during differentiation of ESC-derived NSCs to immature GABAergic interneurons. We show that developmental transitions are accompanied by loss of bivalency at many promoters in line with their increasing developmental restriction from pluripotent ESC through multipotent NSC to committed GABAergic interneuron. At the NSC stage, the promoters of genes encoding many transcriptional regulators required for differentiation of multiple neuronal subtypes and neural crest appear to be bivalent, consistent with the broad developmental potential of NSCs. Upon differentiation to GABAergic neurons, all non-GABAergic promoters resolve to H 3 K 27 me 3 <b>monovalency,</b> whereas GABAergic promoters resolve to H 3 K 4 me 3 <b>monovalency</b> or retain bivalency. Importantly, many of these epigenetic changes occur before any corresponding changes in gene expression. Intriguingly, another group of gene promoters gain bivalency as NSCs differentiate toward neurons, the majority of which are associated with functions connected with maturation and establishment and maintenance of connectivity. These data show that bivalency provides a dynamic epigenetic signature of developmental potential in both NSCs and in early neurons. Stem Cells 2013; 31 : 1868 - 1880...|$|E

The advantage of its <b>monovalency</b> for one antigen and simultaneous binding of a marker enzyme has been explored for its potential use in competitive immunoassays.

40|$|Unlike other {{immunoglobulin}} G (IgG) subclasses, IgG 4 antibodies in plasma {{have been}} reported to be functionally monovalent. In this paper we show that the apparent <b>monovalency</b> of circulating IgG 4 is caused by asymmetry of plasma IgG 4.

Sera from patients with IgG 4 antibodies to both house dust mite and grass pollen induced cross-linking of Sepharose-bound grass pollen antigen to radiolabelled house dust mite allergen Der p I. This bispecific binding activity was not observed in sera with IgG 4 antibodies to either grass pollen or house dust mite exclusively. Depletion of IgG 4 antibodies resulted in disappearance of the bispecific activity. By size exclusion chromatography we excluded the possibility that bispecific activity was caused by aggregation of IgG 4 antibodies.

The IgG 4 isotype is the major antibody in the immune response induced by hyposensitization therapy and is presumably the only IgG subclass with homocytotropic properties. Immunochemical characteristics of IgG 4, such as functional <b>monovalency</b> and inability to activate the complement system, underline the special place of this isotype in the humoral immune response. Detection of IgG 4 antibodies in serum has a very limited use in allergy diagnosis.

We generated bivalent CD 28 constructs by fusing the extracellular domains of CTLA- 4 or CD 80 with the intracellular domains of CD 28. Bivalent or monovalent CD 28 constructs were ligated with recombinant ligands with or without TCR coligation. Monovalent CD 28 ligation did not induce responses unless the TCR was coligated. By contrast, bivalent CD 28 ligation induced responses in the absence of TCR engagement. To extend these findings to primary cells, we used novel superagonistic and conventional CD 28 Abs.

40|$|Clearance {{kinetics}} and renal {{deposition of}} soluble IgA immune complexes (IgA IC) were examined {{to determine the}} nephritogenic potential of IgA molecular form in mediating experimental IgA nephropathy. The immune complexes were prepared by mixing purified radiolabelled monomeric (mIgA) or polymeric (pIgA) IgA anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP), derived from MOPC- 315 myeloma, with DNP conjugated Ficoll (DNP 8 -Ficoll). Clearance of IgAIC from the circulation was curve fitted by two exponential components. The first component was similar for both mIgA IC and pIgA IC. The second component was slightly more rapid for mIgA IC than for pIgA IC. Immunofluorescence studies, however, showed that only pIgA IC deposited in the kidneys. Analysis of IgA IC by gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that mIgA formed only small latticed complexes. The critical role of IgA IC lattice size in renal deposition was confirmed by demonstrating that large latticed mIgA IC, prepared by covalent cross-linking mIgA with a specific affinity labelling antigen, deposited in the kidneys in a pattern similar to pIgA IC.

Pre-treatment of neutrophils at 37 degrees for 30 min with cytochalasin B, colchicine, both of the reagents, concanavalin A, and tetracaine did not alter the clustering of FcR on the surface, which was demonstrated by the ligand at 0 degrees. The effectiveness of these employed cytoskeletal reagents was determined ultrastructurally by observing the changes of morphology and cytoskeletal structures of treated neutrophils; a novel and unique cellular change of cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils was described which we called arachnocytosis. Under our experimental conditions the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane under the receptor patches did not show any specialized density resembling coated membrane regions. These data verify our previous finding that FeR is naturally clustered on human neutrophils, and suggest strongly that the FcR natural clustering is not primarily mediated by the cytoskeletons consisting of microfilaments (actin) and microtubules, and the coated membrane region. The exact mechanism for FcR clustering on human neutrophils is not clear and remains to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Met, {{the high}} {{affinity}} receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, {{is one of}} the most frequently activated tyrosine kinases in human cancer and a validated target for cancer therapy. We previously developed a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular portion of Met (DN- 30) that induces Met proteolytic cleavage (receptor “shedding”) followed by proteasome-mediated receptor degradation. This translates into inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor/Met-mediated biological activities. However, DN- 30 binding to Met also results in partial activation of the Met kinase due to antibody-mediated receptor homodimerization. To safely harness the therapeutic potential of DN- 30, its shedding activity must be disassociated from its agonistic activity. Here we show that the DN- 30 Fab fragment maintains high affinity Met binding, elicits efficient receptor shedding and down-regulation, and does not promote kinase activation. In Met-addicted tumor cell lines, DN- 30 Fab displays potent cytostatic and cytotoxic activity in a dose-dependent fashion. DN- 30 Fab also inhibits anchorage-independent growth of several tumor cell lines. In mouse tumorigenesis assays using Met-addicted carcinoma cells, intratumor administration of DN- 30 Fab or systemic delivery of a chemically stabilized form of the same molecule results in reduction of Met phosphorylation and inhibition of tumor growth. These data provide proof of concept that <b>monovalency</b> unleashes the full therapeutic potential of the DN- 30 antibody and point at DN- 30 Fab as a promising tool for Met-targeted therapy...|$|E

Based on these findings, to minimize the deteriorative influences on the MCP- 1 specificity of MC 32, we aimed to achieve the affinity maturation of MC 32 using MC 32 L-chain shuffling library and select MC 32 variants. Most MC 32 variants increased their affinity by reducing the koff value with no influence of the antigen specificity.

40|$|The rapid {{diffusion}} of H in metals permits an easy segregation to the grain boundary and an easy trapping to the vacancy. H-induced intergranular embrittlement in metals such as Fe and Ni is generally {{a result of}} coalition of segregated H and other embrittling impurities at the grain boundary. Ab initio total energy calculations based on the density functional theory have shown that H alone can also weaken the cohesion across the grain boundary. The stronger binding of H with a free surface than with a grain boundary, which results in grain boundary embrittlement according to the Rice–Wang theory, can be ascribed to its <b>monovalency.</b> New tensile experiments point to a H-enhanced vacancy contribution to the increased susceptibility of steel to H embrittlement.

On the other hand, the H-induced increase of vacancy cluster formation energy is a support of the experimentally observed enhancement of dislocation mobility in the presence of H, which, through the mechanism of H-enhanced localized plasticity, makes fracture easier...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDiscrimination between {{self and}} {{non-self}} {{is a prerequisite for}} any defence mechanism; in innate defence, this discrimination is often mediated by lectins recognizing non-self carbohydrate structures and so relies on an arsenal of host lectins with different specificities towards target organism carbohydrate structures. Recently, cytoplasmic lectins isolated from fungal fruiting bodies have been shown {{to play a role in}} the defence of multicellular fungi against predators and parasites. Here, we present a novel fruiting body lectin, CCL 2, from the ink cap mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea. We demonstrate the toxicity of the lectin towards Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster and present its NMR solution structure in complex with the trisaccharide, GlcNAcβ 1, 4 [Fucα 1, 3]GlcNAc, to which it binds with high specificity and affinity in vitro. The structure reveals that the monomeric CCL 2 adopts a β-trefoil fold and recognizes the trisaccharide by a single, topologically novel carbohydrate-binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of CCL 2 and identification of C. elegans mutants resistant to this lectin show that its nematotoxicity is mediated by binding to α 1, 3 -fucosylated N-glycan core structures of nematode glycoproteins; feeding with fluorescently labeled CCL 2 demonstrates that these target glycoproteins localize to the C. elegans intestine. Since the identified glycoepitope is characteristic for invertebrates but absent from fungi, our data show that the defence function of fruiting body lectins is based on the specific recognition of non-self carbohydrate structures. The trisaccharide specifically recognized by CCL 2 is a key carbohydrate determinant of pollen and insect venom allergens implying this particular glycoepitope is targeted by both fungal defence and mammalian immune systems. In summary, our results demonstrate how the plasticity of a common protein fold can contribute to the recognition and control of antagonists by an innate defence mechanism, whereby the <b>monovalency</b> of the lectin for its ligand implies a novel mechanism of lectin-mediated toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Structurally simple {{synthetic}} molecules {{have proven}} useful for elucidating {{relationships between the}} structure and immunologic properties of antigens (1, 2) because {{it is possible to}} chemically modify such molecules to address specific questions. Although immunogens are generally considered to be large molecules [...] as opposed to haptens-and the most potent clearly are, a number of noteworthy exceptions to this principle have been recorded. For example, L-tyrosine-p-azobenzene-p-arsonate (RAT), t with a molecular weight of only- 400 daltons, induces in guinea pigs specific delayed hypersensitivity, DNA synthesis by lymphocytes from sensitized animals, and functional carrier activity for anti-hapten responses (2). However, the murine anti-hapten PFC response to the bifunctional antigen used in guinea pigs, N- 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl- 6 amino-caproyl-tyrosine-p-aminobenzine-p-arsonate (DNP-SAC-RAT), was extremely weak (2). Evidence is presented here that the response to this antigen in mice is exclusively of the IgM class in both primary and secondary responses. It is generally believed that IgM antibody responses are less T dependent than IgG responses, and that carrier-specific helper T cells are responsible for the switch from IgM to other Ig isotypes (3). Indeed, it has been recently suggested that at least two types of carrier-specific helper cells synergize for optimal antibody responses, one of which is Ig-dependent (4). In view of these emerging concepts, a possible basis for the weak, exclusively IgM anti- 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) plaque-forming cell (PFC) response in mice to DNP-SAC-RAT could be its <b>monovalency</b> with respect to carrier epitopes, which might limit interaction to a single helper T cell. This consideration prompted an investigation of the effect of adding a second homologous carrier epitope to the bifunctional conjugate, creating, in effect, a trifunctional antigen comprised of two identical carrier epitopes and a single haptenic epitope. The murine response to this trifunctional antigen is the major theme of this report...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulin G 4 (IgG 4) {{antibodies}} {{have been}} {{known for some time}} to be functionally monovalent. Recently, the structural basis for this <b>monovalency</b> has been elucidated: the in vivo exchange of IgG half-molecules (one H-plus one L-chain) among IgG 4. This process results in bispecific antibodies that in most situations will behave as functionally monovalent antibodies. The structural basis for the abnormal behaviour of IgG 4 seems to be largely the result of a single amino acid change relative to human IgG 1 : the change of a proline in core hinge of IgG 1 to serine. This results in a marked shift in the equilibrium between interchain disulphide bridges and intrachain disulphide bridges, which for IgG 4 results in 25 - 75 % absence of a covalent interaction between the H-chains. Because of strong non-covalent interactions between the CH 3 domains (and possibly also between the CH 1 domain and the trans-CH 2 domain) IgG 4 is a stable four-chain molecule and does not easily exchange half-molecules under standard physiological conditions in vitro. We postulate that the exchange is catalysed in vivo by protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) and/or FcRn (the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -related Fc receptor) during transit of IgG 4 in the endosomal pathway in endothelial cells. Because IgG 4 is predominantly expressed under conditions of chronic antigen exposure, the biological relevance of this exchange of half-molecules is that it generates antibodies that are unable to form large immune complexes and therefore have a low potential for inducing immune inflammation. In contrast to monovalent immunoglobulin fragments, these scrambled immunoglobulins have a normal half-life. The significance of the ensuing bispecificity needs further evaluation, because this will be relevant only in situations where high IgG 4 responses are found to two unrelated antigens that happen to be present in the body {{at the same time and}} place. In this context the significance of IgG 4 autoreactivity might have to be re-evaluated.

40|$|Immune {{mediated}} inflammatory diseases (IMDM) {{can affect}} {{a variety of}} tissues and organs causing {{a broad spectrum of}} symptoms. Yet, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease share mechanistic similarities. A major factor in the development is the imbalance of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) regulation. With a prevalence of 5 - 7 % in the western society, a great interest exists in the development of an effective therapy. Current treatment involves primarily corticosteroids and non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate (MTX). The fast progression made in the development of biopharmaceutics, especially of antibody based therapeutics allowed for a more specific treatment. TNF-related diseases are tried to tackle by intervention in the TNF signaling. To date, five such therapeutics are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are aiming at the neutralization of TNF or lymphotoxin alpha (LT&# 945;), thereby reducing exaggerated TNF signaling and curtailing inflammation. However, neutralization of TNF facilitates opportunistic infections and several warnings have been issued by the FDA. In 1990, an antibody directed specifically against TNFR 1 was discovered, when mice were immunized with human TNFR 1. A humanized variant was generated in 2008, paving the way for the use of this antibody as a therapeutic in humans. The present study describes the development of chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing three different variants of the humanized TNFR 1 specific antibody IZI 06. 1, a full length antibody and two human serum albumin fusion proteins (scFv-HSA and Fab-HSA). Cell lines were generated by site directed integration of the GOI into the CHO host genome in order to investigate the influence of the individual construct on growth performance and producibility. Cell lines expressing the IgG 1 and the scFv-HSA perfomed similarly, showing productivities of 5 - 10 pg/c/d. Both proteins assembled properly and could be purified to satisfactory purity. These constructs were found to be applicable for the generation of a regulatory compliant cell line. The Fab HSA revealed multiple issues in terms of productivity and purification and was therefore excluded from further investigation. The monovalent fusion protein scFv HSA and full length antibody (termed ATROSAB) were investigated in more detail to determine the impact of variables like composition, size and valency on their biochemical and functional properties. Reduced size of the fusion protein translated into a reduced plasma half-life compared to the antibody. But although being also more susceptible to thermal degradation, comparison with the respective scFv showed that the scFv-HSA clearly benefits from fusion to HSA in terms of stability. It could be further demonstrated that both proteins specifically bind TNFR 1, but not TNFR 2 and that both proteins are generally able to inhibit TNF-induced TNFR 1 signaling. However, potency of the fusion protein was demonstrated to be significantly reduced, most probably due to its <b>monovalency.</b> Without further improvement of the scFv HSA, the full length IgG remains first choice {{for the development of a}} prospective, highly specific therapeutic with indication for TNF mediated inflammatory diseases. These results are in accordance with bio-functional data generated earlier for the three constructs that also indicated a better affinity of the full length IgG to hTNFR 1 compared to the scFv HSA and upon which it was decided to generate a full regulatory compliant cell line in CHO for the IgG 1 (ATROSAB). A set of cell lines could be developed, that meet all requirements for a prospective use in an industrial, GMP regulated environment. This includes next to a high productivity and favorable growth characteristics the absence of adventitious agents. The cell lines were generated by Limiting Dilution, clonality was verified by microscopy. More than 400 clones were screened from which high producers were identified and cell banked. The most promising clone K 20 - 3 achieved a productivity of 10 pg/c/d. In order to further enhance productivity without employing destabilizing gene amplification, this clone was re-transfected with the slightly modified expression vector for the IgG 1. A more than 3 -fold increase in productivity could be achieved with clone K 35 - 1. However, quality analysis of ATROSAB produced by the re transfected clone revealed a greater heterogeneity and also bio functionality was affected negatively. Therefore it was decided for the time being to proceed with original, not re-transfected clone in order to set up a GMP production process. Yet, further analysis of the re-transfected clones may be worthwhile regarding their increased productivity. Adapted process and handling protocols probably can overcome the encountered limitations in product quality. Chronisch entzündliche Erkrankungen betreffen eine Vielzahl von Geweben und können sich in einem breiten Spektrum von Symptomen manifestieren. Bestimmte molekulare Mechanismen haben sie jedoch gemein. So spielen im Verlauf der Krankheit zumeist eine fehlgeleitete, gegen körpereigene Epitope gerichtete Immunantwort sowie ein Ungleichgewicht in der Regulation pro-inflammatorischer Zytokine wie TNF eine entscheidende Rolle. Entzündliche Erkrankungen der Gelenke (Rheumatoide Arthritis) oder chronisch entzündliche Darmerkrankungen (Morbus Crohn, Colitis ulcerosa) haben eine hohe Prävalenz in der Bevölkerung (geschätzte 5 - 7 % in der westlichen Gesellschaft). Es besteht daher ein hohes Interesse an der Entwicklung effektiver Therapien. Bisherige Therapieansätze sehen den Einsatz von Kortikosteroiden oder nicht biologischen, sogenannten „disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) “ wie Methotrexat (MTX) vor. Der in den letzten Jahren erzielte Fortschritt im Bereich der Biotherapeutika, insbesondere von pathogen spezifischen Antikörpern, ermöglicht heutzutage eine gezieltere Behandlung. Für den Einsatz gegen TNF-vermittelte entzündliche Erkrankungen sind zurzeit fünf Antikörper basierte Therapeutika für den Markt zugelassen, die alle TNF im Blut neutralisieren. Dieser Wirkmechanismus begünstigt jedoch opportunistische Infektionen, weswegen bereits mehrere Warnungen durch die Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ausgegeben wurden. 1990 wurde ein Antikörper entdeckt, der für den humanen TNFR 1 spezifisch ist. Die Entwicklung einer humanisierten Variante im Jahr 2008 ebnete den Weg für die Weiterentwicklung zu einem potentiellen Therapeutikum für den Einsatz im Menschen. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschreibt zunächst die Entwicklung von CHO basierten Zelllinien für die Expression von drei Antikörperderivaten des humanisierten hTNFR 1 -spezifischen Antikörpers, einem IgG 1, einem scFv-HSA und einem Fab-HSA Fusionsprotein. Alle Zelllinien wurden durch Locus-spezifische Genintegration erzeugt, um eine höhere Vergleichbarkeit in Bezug auf Wachstumsverhalten und Produzierbarkeit zu erzielen. Die Zelllinien für den Antikörper und das scFv-HSA Fusionsprotein zeigten ein günstiges Wachstums- und Produktionsverhalten mit Produktivitäten von 5 - 10 pg/c/d. Beide Proteine wurden korrekt exprimiert und konnten mit vergleichbar geringem Aufwand bis zu einer zufriedenstellenden Reinheit aufgearbeitet werden. Im Gegensatz dazu bereiteten sowohl die Produktion wie auch die Aufreinigung des Fab-HSA Probleme. Um den Einfluss von Größe, Aufbau und Valenz auf die biochemischen und funktionalen Eigenschaften des TNFR 1 Blockers zu untersuchen, wurden das monovalente scFv-HSA und der bivalente IgG 1 (ATROSAB) miteinander verglichen. Die geringere Größe des Fusionsproteins bedingte eine verringerte Plasmahalbwertszeit. Eine ebenfalls beobachtete geringere thermische Stabilität wurde jedoch im Vergleich zu dem einfachen scFv Fragment durch die Fusion mit HSA deutlich verbessert, wenngleich die Stabilität des Antikörpers nicht erreicht wurde. Die Bindungsspezifität beider Moleküle für den humanen TNFR 1 blieb von ihrem unterschiedlichen Aufbau unbeeinflusst. Die Affinität war jedoch deutlich verringert für das Fusionsprotein, was zum größten Teil auf seine Monovalenz zurückzuführen ist. Entsprechend konnte für beide Proteine die Fähigkeit nachgewiesen werden, eine TNF vermittelte Ausschüttung von pro-inflammatorischen Zytokinen zu verhindern, wobei sich der Antikörper als deutlich effektiver herausstellte. Ohne weitere Optimierung der Bindungsaffinität blieb daher der IgG 1 der vielversprechendste Kandidat für eine Weiterentwicklung zum Therapeutikum...|$|E
