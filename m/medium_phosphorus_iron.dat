40|$|Filamentous microalgae Tribonema is {{promising}} for biodiesel production {{in terms of}} high lipid content, easy harvesting and good contamination tolerance. As high lipid productivity is a key basis, several methods including different culture <b>medium,</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> <b>iron</b> and CO 2 inductions were tested to enhance lipid productivity in Tribonema minus. T. minus subjected to BG 11 -freshwater medium achieved a favorable lipid productivity of 216. 18 mg L- 1 d(- 1), much higher than those in other culture medium (BG 11 -S, Kuhl, f/ 2, f, 2 f, BBM, ASWand ES). Secondly, the optimal phosphorus, iron and CO 2 concentrations for high lipid productivity of T. minus were obtained, respectively. Finally, the cells of T. minus grown in optimized BG 11 medium containing 80 mg L- 1 KH 2 PO 4 and 6 mg L- 1 FeC 6 H 5 O 7 -NH 4 OH with 2 % CO 2 achieved a lipid productivity of 384. 67 mg L- 1 d(- 1), representing a 1. 56 -fold increase from the control. Therefore, the strategy to enhance lipid productivity of T. minus was successfully proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
