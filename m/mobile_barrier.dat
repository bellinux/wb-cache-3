The <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> is usually a car or ute with two long arms, behind which the horses line up before moving to the starting line. The barrier may cover the entire track and in some cases the mobile can be ten horses wide. When the wings of the gate swing back, the starting vehicle speeds off, thus releasing the horses. This is the most common method of starting pacers and trotters in Australia.|$|E

50|$|A <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> {{was first}} used at Harold Park, New South Wales track on 2 November 1956 in a mile race won by Mineral Spring in 2:01.2. However the barrier was deemed unsafe after two races {{and it took a}} further 9 years before further {{attempts}} were made.The prototype hydraulically operated <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> was introduced into NSW in 1963 by William (Bill) George Smith, a Sydney motor body builder who had a passion for harness racing and wanted to make it more exciting for the public and punters. On 14 October 1970 in an article on the success of the Miracle Mile the Sydney Morning Herald reflected on the introduction of new barrier in 1965. The article stated that after months of testing the barrier at Sunday gymkhanas, shows and trials during 1964 and 65 it was then decided to introduce the barrier at Harold Park. Harold Park trialled and approved the use of the Smith designed barrier on 21 May 1965. 'Late in 1966 The New South Wales Trotting club Ltd and H O & W D Wills promoted a new feature race call the Craven Filter Miracle Mile'. the idea was to break the two minute mile and for Australian horses to gain worldwide recognition. The first Miracle Mile was held at Harold Park in 1967 and the New Zealand mare Robyn Dundee won by breaking the two minute barrier at 1:59.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper studies <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> {{coverage}} (MBC) surrounding dynamic objects. In {{the real}} world, several dynamic objects {{can benefit from}} MBC. For example, marching troop can detect any adversary intrusion without blind spot by MBC. However, conventional works only focused on barrier coverage for static objects, which fail when the objects start to move. Issues to address these dynamic-object scenarios, we propose the problem of <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> coverage for dynamic objects. The most challenge is how to effectively maintain MBC when the motion of objects are unpredictable. We propose a fully distributed algorithm for mobile sensor nodes to cooperatively move and maintain the high-quality barrier coverage. The extensive simulations based on large-scale trace data demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

40|$|Dummy {{responses}} {{in a crash}} test can vary depending {{not only on the}} change of velocity but also on how the impact was generated. Literature reporting how acceleration pulses can vary in cars impacted in different configurations is limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect and categorise different acceleration pulses in 3 different types of rear collision. The acceleration pulse resulting from a solid, 1000 kg, <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> test at 40 % overlap and an impact velocity of 15 km/h was studied for 33 different cars. Seven cars were impacted at 100 % overlap at higher impact velocities using the same <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier.</b> Acceleration pulses from two different car types in real-world collisions producing a similar change of velocity were also analysed. The results from the barrier tests show that a similar change of velocity can be generated by a large variety of pulse shapes in low velocity rear impacts. The results from real-world collisions showed that a similar change of velocity was generated in different ways both in terms of peak and mean acceleration. The results of this study highlight the importance of knowing the acceleration pulse both when evaluating the severity of a real world crash and when designing test methods for evaluating vehicle safety performance in low velocity rear-end impacts, particularly in respect of soft tissue neck injuries...|$|E
40|$|To protect Venice against tidal flooding, the MOSE system (Experimental Electro-mechanic Module) {{has been}} under {{construction}} since 2003. This safeguarding system is composed of four batteries of <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers</b> at the Lagoon's inlets (Lido, Malamocco, Chioggia), which will be lifted before the occurrence of exceptional high tides (> 1. 10 m above the mean sea level), isolating the Venetian Lagoon from the sea. The end of the construction work is foreseen by 2016. In this paper, {{the results of the}} groundwater monitoring at the building site of Punta Sabbioni at the Lido inlet are described. A large dewatered basin (tura), formerly occupied by the sea and close to the shoreline, was used for the precasting of the <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers,</b> and the impact of groundwater control was therefore monitored in the phreatic and shallow confined aquifers. Although a slurry wall barrier was excavated to isolate the tura, a drawdown cone in the confined aquifer was observed, extending to 1 km from the construction site. In contrast, the phreatic aquifer was only influenced by tides, rainfall and evapotranspiration, and the slurry wall of the tura had a positive effect of decreasing the groundwater salinity by limiting the seawater intrusion, as confirmed by the electrical conductivity profiles measured inside the piezometers. The monitoring activity was successful in assessing the impacts of the construction work on the aquifer system and in distinguishing them from the effects of natural driving force...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{adaptive}} barrier coverage system in wireless sensor networks, where multiple mobile sensor nodes collaboratively move based on cloud computing. This system aims to adaptively maintain a barrier coverage surrounding a dynamic zone, such as nuclear leakage area and toxic gas area.

Existing studies on <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> coverage mainly focus on static zones, which cannot directly apply into dynamic zones because their movement strategies are not flexible with dynamics. To address such a problem, we propose a novel adaptive barrier coverage system. The challenge is to effectively maintain the barrier when the change of dynamic zone is unpredictable. The proposed system leverages the software defined concept, in which the mobile sensor nodes execute the local sensing tasks and the cloud computes the real-time optimal strategy to control the movements of nodes.

40|$|Secretory {{epithelial}} {{cells of the}} proximal airways synthesize and secrete gel-forming poly-meric mucins. The secreted mucins adsorb water to form mucus that is propelled by neighboring ciliated cells, providing a <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> which removes inhaled particles and pathogens from the lungs. Several features of the intracellular trafficking of mucins make the airway secretory cell an interesting comparator for the cell biology of regulated exocy-tosis. Polymeric mucins are exceedingly large molecules (up to 3 × 106 Da per monomer) whose folding and initial polymerization in the ER requires the protein disulfide isomerase Agr 2. In the Golgi, mucins further polymerize to form chains and possibly branched net-works comprising more than 20 monomers. The large size of mucin polymers imposes constraints on their packaging into transport vesicles along the secretory pathway. Sugar side chains account for> 70 % {{of the mass of}} mucins, and their attachment to the protein core by O-glycosylation occurs in the Golgi. Mature polymeric mucins are stored in large secretory granules ∼ 1 µm in diameter. These are translocated to the apical membrane to be positioned for exocytosis by cooperative interactions among myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, cysteine string protein, heat shock protein 70, and the cytoskeleton...|$|E

40|$|Neck {{injuries}} {{often occur}} at low impact velocities, typically less than 20 kph. Such accidents usually result in minor 'whiplash' injuries, but about 10 % of them lead to permanent disability with {{degree of disability}} over 10 %. Factors that could influence the risk of sustaining neck injuries in rear impacts include: (1) {{the distance between the}} head and the head restraint; (2) the seat's stiffness structure; and (3) the car's rear structure. This article outlines some tests to show whether the seats or the structure affect neck injuries more. Two cars, with empty weights 705 kg and 725 kg, were impacted from the rear at 20 kph by a <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> in two full-scale rear-impact tests. The drivers' seats were retained, but the front passenger seats and their attachments were swapped over. Various motion sensors and high-speed cameras recorded the motions of the dummies in the passenger seats. The motion of dummies in mini-sled rear-impact tests was also recorded. It was found that seat design, not car structure, was the reason for differential dummy loading. Dummy acceleration does not really start until car acceleration has almost finished.

40|$|International audienceThe Langmuir trough {{described}} is {{specially designed}} to fabricate alternate multilayers automatically by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Its working principle consists of: (i) making two different films {{at the surface}} of a double Langmuir trough; (ii) programming the path of the substrate so that it passes in turn through each film. The apparatus consists principally of a two-compartment Langmuir trough and a system to transfer the substrate from one compartment to the other underneath water. The Langmuir trough contains a single subphase. Its surface is divided into two compartments by a fixed surface barrier located above the central well. Each compartment is equipped with a <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier,</b> {{so that it can be}} operated independently for film fabrication and compression. Each compartment is also equipped with an independently programmable dipping arm. Substrate transfer is carried out in the following way: while the two dipping arms are at rest, an auxiliary rotating arm picks up the substrate from one of the arms, transfers it to the other compartment underneath the central barrier and hangs it on the other dipping arm. This sample transferrer is described in detail, together with the way it operates. When the films in the compartments are made of different molecules, this trough builds up alternate LB layers. According to the programme imposed on the substrate transferrer, either centrosymmetric, or non-centrosymmetric, or paired alternate layers can be built. Examples of such alternate layers are given.

40|$|The MoSE project (construction of <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> to {{safeguard}} the Lagoon of Venice) entails changes {{to the structure of}} the lagoon 2 ̆ 7 s inlets. This could have consequences for the areas near the inlets and for the dynamics of the lagoon ecosystem as a whole. In order to predict the effects of the proposed alterations on the hydrodynamics of the lagoon, a well-tested hydrodynamic-dispersion model was applied. Simulations were carried out considering both idealised and realistic tide and wind scenarios. The results show that with the new structures the Lido sub-basin tends to increase its extension due the southward movement of the watershed, {{at the expense of the}} Chioggia sub-basin, whereas the Malamocco sub-basin changes its relative position, but not its extension. The residence time shows variations in agreement with this trend, decreasing in the southern part of the Lido sub-basin and increasing in the inner part of the Chioggia sub-basin. The variations in residence time and return fl ow factor indicate that they are caused by changes in both instantaneous current velocities and sea-lagoon interaction. In fact the new breakwaters in front of the Malamocco and Chioggia inlets modify the length and direction of the out fl ow jet (up to 1 ms&# 8722; 1) and the patterns of the currents around the inlets and the nearby coast. The new arti fi cial island in the Lido inlet changes the current pattern and increases the current velocity on the southern side of the channel propagating this effect up to the Venice city. The risks and benefits individuated from our conclusion are that the Lido sub-basin can improve its renewal time, but the more intense current speeds can be a risk for the conservation of habitats and infrastructures. Finally the micro-circulation between the breakwater and the coast in Chioggia and Malamocco inlets can be a trap for pollutants or suspended sediment...|$|E
40|$|The Venice lagoon {{identifies}} {{a complex}} natural system hosting {{a number of}} economic activities. Due to its hydro-geological conformation, it is consistently threatened by climate change. In particular, it is strongly threatened by global worming and average sea level rise inducing a higher frequency and intensity of the acqua alta phenomenon (i. e. the periodical flooding of the city centre due to particular astronomical and meteorological conditions). In order to protect Venice from the damages induced by the more and more frequent flooding episodes, various mitigation and prevention measures have been adopted, among which the <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers</b> system (MOSE) at the inlets. The adoption of such a protection measure limits the damages caused to Venetians and to the economic activities carried out within the lagoon (trade, tourism, public services, ¿). Nevertheless, it could interfere with port traffic, one of the still currently most relevant economic activities of Venice: the <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers</b> procedure of closing isolates the lagoon from the open Adriatic Sea and then interrupts the in and outflow of ships. Longer waiting time for ships entering or exiting from the lagoon could therefore induce additional costs, in terms for example of the charter costs and, for ships blocked within the lagoon from the <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers</b> closure, even mooring costs. As a consequence, {{the analysis of the}} potentially negative effects of MOSE functioning on port activities represent a relevant component of the analysis of the 'acqua alta' impacts on the Venice lagoon. Moving from this background, the present paper is aimed to estimate the costs induced by the interruption of ships' flow due to MOSE functioning through an hydrodynamic model applied to the port traffic experienced during the period 2000 - 2002. A partial analysis is proposed taking into account only the estimated costs for port users (direct costs) and not even the costs deriving from the eventual reduction of ships' flow (indirect costs). Nevertheless, the present paper contributes to the analysis of the effects of MOSE functioning on Venice port activities by integrating, even if through different methodologies, the study proposed by Nunes et al. (2005) on the benefits of MOSE functioning on the commercial activities carried out within the city centre and by enlarging the paper of Chiabai and Nunes (2008) on the negative effects on port activities. Our results show that the negative effects are limited. The present paper is structured as follows: Section 1 briefly describes the 'acqua alta' phenomenon and its evolution over the last century. Section 2 introduces the MOSE and its procedure of functioning. Section 3 discusses the effects of MOSE functioning on the Venetian port activities, considering the evolution of ship traffic since the Second World War. Section 4 provides an hydrodynamic analysis of MOSE interferences with the Venetian port traffic experienced during the period 2000 - 2002. Section 5 provides an estimate of the direct costs for port users due to MOSE functioning. Section 6 concludes. JRC. DG. J. 2 -The economics of climate change, energy and transpor...|$|R

25|$|Seiches {{have been}} {{observed}} in seas such as the Adriatic Sea and the Baltic Sea. This results in the flooding of Venice and St. Petersburg, respectively, as both cities are constructed on former marshland. In St. Petersburg, seiche-induced flooding is common along the Neva River in the autumn. The seiche is driven by a low pressure region in the North Atlantic moving onshore, giving rise to cyclonic lows on the Baltic Sea. The low pressure of the cyclone draws greater-than-normal quantities of water into the virtually land-locked Baltic. As the cyclone continues inland, long, low-frequency seiche waves with wavelengths up to several hundred kilometres are established in the Baltic. When the waves reach the narrow and shallow Neva Bay, they become much higher — ultimately flooding the Neva embankments. Similar phenomena are observed at Venice, resulting in the MOSE Project, a system of 79 <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers</b> {{designed to protect the}} three entrances to the Venetian Lagoon.|$|R
