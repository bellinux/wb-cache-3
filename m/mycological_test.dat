At first, the infection in the human patient was suggested to be a zoogenic glabrous skin mycosis. The patient was carefully interviewed and a careful dermatological examination was conducted. Additional tests including <b>mycological</b> <b>test</b> on material from patient?s skin lesions and toenails {{as well as on}} material from infected animal?s skin lesions. It allowed a proper diagnosis and identication of the pathogen as an antropophilic dermatophyte T. rubrum in both cases. Moreover, certain factors increasing the risk of fungal infection in patients working on farms and with close contact with homestead animals were taken into consideration. This study emphasises the importance of culture and a direct <b>mycological</b> <b>test</b> in proper diagnosis.

40|$|Abstract: Onychomycosis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} onychopathy and it requires a correct early diagnosis. Currently, the diagnostic gold standard is the association of direct <b>mycological</b> <b>test</b> with culture; however, it shows variable sensitivity. The histopathological examination of the distal nail plate, called clipping, has shown to be an adjuvant in diagnosing onychomycosis. This is an easy-to-perform, relatively cheap examination that is little dependent of the examiner, rapidly provides results, has high sensitivity, and for patients it is painless and harmless...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Dermatitis herpetiformis {{is a rare}} bullous disorder. Autoimmunological {{disturbances}} {{associated with}} hypersensitivity to gluten play the main role in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. Clinical manifestations include polymorphic skin lesions which may cause diagnostic difficulties. Objective. To present a case of dermatitis herpetiformis diagnosed and treated without any clinical improvement as tinea cutis glabrae. Case report. A 20 -year-old male patient was admitted {{for the evaluation of}} polymorphic skin lesions of 7 -month duration distributed symmetrically on the skin of elbows, knees, face and the gluteal and sacral region. The patient was previously treated with systemic and topical antimycotic drugs. Due to a typical distribution of skin lesions as well as symptoms reported by the patient, we started to suspect Duhring’s disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence of skin biopsy and serological tests. Systemic treatment with dapsone and a gluten-free diet led to clinical improvement. Conclusions. The morphology and localization of skin lesions in Duhring’s disease may be similar to the clinical presentation of fungal infection of the skin, which in equivocal cases should be excluded by a <b>mycological</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E

40|$|Family physician, {{because of}} a {{character}} of his specialization and a role which he plays in a health care system, {{as well as his}} availability to patients, is usually the first one to whom patients report nails disorders. The most frequent nail pathology is fungal infection, mostly caused by dermatophytes (the pathogen most frequently isolated is Trichophyton rubrum) and yeasts (mainly Candida albicans). Making a proper diagnosis requires conducting <b>mycological</b> <b>tests,</b> which unfortunately goes beyond the competence of a family physician specified by the National Health Fund. That makes cooperation with a dermatologist essential. The equally significant issue is to carry out differential diagnosis of onychomycosis; first of all one needs to consider psoriasis.

40|$|Mycological {{examination}} is {{the diagnostic}} procedure necessary to confirm a fungal disease, from the Greek word “mykes” meaning mushroom. The <b>mycological</b> <b>test</b> {{is also necessary}} to document the complete cure response to treatment, as clinical recovery is often followed by a relapse if the fungus has not been completely eliminated from the skin (mycological cure). The diagnosis of a fungal infection is considered simple from a clinical point of view, but the report of unusual presentations, misdiagnosed or sometimes neglected, has increased worldwide causing extensive and long-standing disease. General immunosuppressive treatment for inflammatory chronic diseases and acquired immune depression syndrome are frequently complicated with fungal superinfections, both from common strain and rare or opportunistic fungal species, such as cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, blastomycosis, and aspergillosis. In the immunocompetent patient, dermatophytes are the main fungal infection, being the primary pathogen. Clinical presentation has also changed with time, from the classic ringworm appearance (tinea) to more veiled eczematous undefined patches, simulating more frequent diseases, such as atopic or contact eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, impetigo, rosacea, and lupus erythematosus.

30|$|Mycological {{cultures}} {{require some}} {{days for the}} full process from the sampling to the susceptibility results. Mycological results were the main drivers for treatment modifications, which occurred in {{almost half of the}} targeted SATs. Empiric SAT was modified in one-third of patient, more often based on mycological results than on clinical changes. In 42  % patients whom treatment was modified, the SAT was terminated based on positive bacteriological results combined with negative <b>mycological</b> <b>tests</b> results. For empiric as for targeted SAT, the most frequent initial drug was caspofungin, and the most frequent agent modification was de-escalation to fluconazole. The delayed availability of mycological results likely explains the high rate of patients with empiric SAT [27]. Other laboratory tests, not based on cultures, have been developed, such as Candida-specific polymerase-chain-reaction, or tests based on the detection of yeasts antigens, or of antibodies directed against these antigens. In our study, the use of non-culture-based diagnostic methods to suspect IC and so to begin SAT was still anecdotal (less than 4  %). These tests are now recommended by the ESCMID guidelines for the IC diagnosis [8], and will probably be increasingly implemented as far as robust and standardized methods will be available.|$|R

40|$|Background: Invasive {{aspergillosis}} is {{an important}} opportunistic fungal infection in highly immunocompromised patients. Clinical diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis remains difficult in that clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific. Radiologic findings are not pathognomonic but can be suggestive. The isolation of aspergilli from a normally sterile environment, which lacks sensitivity, usually represents a problem. Blood cultures are of limited utility, because the recovery of Aspergillus species from blood cultures invariably represents contamination. Early diagnosis is critical to a medical treatment, but is difficult to achieve with current methods. Measurement of galactomannan and β-D-glucan {{can be used as}} an aid in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and it might promote a favourable outcome. The use of polymerase-chain-reaction assay (PCR), although promising, is currently investigational. Conclusions: The verification of aspergillosis requires isolation and microscopic analysis of sterile material showing the fungal structures. Non-culture-based <b>mycological</b> <b>tests,</b> especially assays for the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan and β-D-glucan in serum, or Aspergillus galactomannan in BAL and cerebrospinal fluid specimens are fit to convey useful information and may enable a diagnosis of probable invasive aspergillosis.

Although excellent laboratory methods for diagnosis are available, there are deficiencies that must be met by continued research. Understanding the uses and limitations of a battery of laboratory methods is essential to diagnose PCM. Clinicians and laboratory directors must be familiar with the uses and limitations of a battery of serologic and <b>mycological</b> <b>tests</b> to accurately diagnose of PCM. Antibody and antigen detections are valuable adjuncts to histopathology and culture. More recently, the gp 43 and gp 70 antigen detection assay have improved the methodology of diagnosis of this mycosis, which improves reproducibility and facilitates monitoring antigen clearance during antifungal treatment.

The latter medication was changed to clonazepam and after several weeks, clinical improvement began to be noticed and was accompanied by diminishing P. brasiliensis antigen and antibody titers.

40|$|Superficial mycoses are {{estimated}} to affect more than 20 - 25 % of the world’s population with a consistent increase over the years. Most patients referred to our clinic for suspected dermatomycoses have already been treated with pharmacotherapy, without a previous mycological examination and many show changes in the clinical manifestations. Indeed, some medications, such as steroids, antiviral, antibiotics and antihistamines {{are not able to}} erase a fungal infection, but also they can cause atypical clinical manifestations. The consequences of inappropriate treatment include delayed diagnosis, prolonged healing time, and additional costs. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the incidence of increased costs attributable to inappropriate therapy sustained by the National Health Service and patients and (2) to highlight the importance of mycological evaluation before starting treatment, in order to improve diagnostic accuracy. An observational retrospective and prospective study was performed from September 2013 to February 2014, in 765 patients referred to our center (University Hospital “ Federico II”) in Naples, Italy, for suspected mycological infection. The following treatments (alone or in combination) were defined as inappropriate: (1) cortisone in a patient with at least one positive site; (2) antifungals in (a) patients with all negative sites or (b) ineffective antifungal treatment (in terms of drug chosen, dose or duration) in those with all positive sites; or (3) antibiotics; (4) antivirals or (5) antihistamines, in patients with ≥ 1 positive site. Five hundred and fifty patients were using medications before the assessment visit. The total amount of avoidable costs related to inappropriate previous treatments was € 121, 417, representing 74 % of the total treatment costs. 253 / 550 patients received drugs also after the visit.

No relation between the oral candidiasis and sex, smoking habit, succeptible disease, angular cheilitis; the recent condition of denture and the retention of denture were found. The findings of our investigation indicates that candida albicans is the causative agent of denture stomatitis while other factors such as denture cleanliness, removal of denture at night and presence of any suction may be considered as well...|$|R
40|$|Zucchini {{is a very}} {{valuable}} vegetable, easy to grow both {{in the field and}} under covers but it is often attacked by soil-borne fungi. The investigations were carried out in a farm near Lublin where three zucchini cultivars: Astra, Atena and Soraya, were grown in a tunnel and in the field in 2008 - 2009. Plants with stem and root rot were collected for laboratory <b>tests.</b> <b>Mycological</b> analysis showed that the predominant fungi were F. culmorum, F. equiseti and F. oxysporum. More Fusarium colonies were isolated from the roots of zucchini grown in the tunnel. In the pathogenicity test, all tested isolates of F. culmorum, F. equiseti and F. oxysporum proved to be pathogenic to zucchini seedlings, causing stunting, stem and root rot. The highest disease index was noticed in the combination with F. culmorum isolate fck 61...|$|R
40|$|In 2012, a pink mold rot was {{observed}} on unishiu orange (Citrus unshiu Mac.) fruits at the Wholesale Market for Agricultural Products, Jinju, Korea. The symptom on unishiu orange was a water-soaked lesion {{on the surface}} of fruit, which later on enlarged to form softened brown rot lesions. The diseased fruits were covered with pink-colored mold, consisting of conidia and conidiophores of the pathogen. Optimum temperature for mycelial growth was 25 oC. Conidia were hyaline, smooth, 2 -celled, and thick-walled conidia with truncate bases, ellipsoidal to pyriform, characteristically held together zig-zag chains and 12 − 26 × 8 − 12 μm in size. Conidiophore was erect, colorless, unbranched, and 4 − 5 μm wide. On the basis of <b>mycological</b> characteristics, pathogenicity <b>test,</b> and molecular analysis with complete ITS rDNA region, the causal fungus was identified as Trichothecium roseum (Pers.) Link ex Gray. This is the first report of pink mold rot caused by T. roseum on unishiu orange in Korea...|$|R
40|$|The {{outcome of}} {{antifungal}} therapy {{depends on the}} progression of the infection {{at the start of}} therapy. Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed once the fungal infection has progressed considerably {{as a result of the}} non-specific clinical signs of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients and the poor sensitivity of current <b>mycological</b> diagnostic <b>tests.</b> This review will highlight current fungal diagnostic techniques and will focus on scintigraphic methods for the specific detection of fungal infections in mice. For this purpose, antifungal components (e. g. fluconazole and antifungal peptides) are radiolabeled e. g. with technetium- 99 m ((99 m) Tc) and their in vivo distribution is monitored in infected mice. It has been demonstrated that (99 m) Tc-fluconazole is an excellent tracer to detect Candida albicans infections in mice as it distinguishes these infections from bacterial infections and sterile inflammations. However, this radiopharmaceutical only poorly detects infections with Aspergillus fumigatus in mice. (99 m) Tc-peptides derived from antifungal peptides/proteins, such as human ubiquicidin and lactoferrin, can distinguish C. albicans and A. fumigatus infections from sterile inflammations, but not from bacterial infections, in mice. Furthermore, the efficacy of fluconazole in C. albicans-infected mice could be successfully monitored using (99 m) Tc-ubiquicidin. In conclusion, neither (99 m) Tc-fluconazole nor the (99 m) Tc-peptides tested are optimal tracers for fungal infections. Nonetheless, since early initiation of antifungal therapy for candidemia reduces its high mortality rate, a positive result with (99 m) Tc-fluconazole scintigraphy is of clinical relevance. Finally, the possibility that other (radiolabeled) antifungal agents, e. g. voriconazole, caspofungin, antifungal plant or insect defensins, can be useful for detection of fungal infections should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Soft rot {{caused by}} Rhizopus oryzae {{occurred}} on unshiu orange (Citrus unshiu Marc.) sampled from commercial markets in Jinju, Korea, 2010. The first symptom of soft rot on orange is a water-soaked {{appearance of the}} affected tissue. The infected parts later disintegrated into a mushy mass of disorganized cells followed by rapid softening of the diseased tissue. The lesion on orange was rapidly softened and rotted, then became brown or dark brown. Optimum temperature for mycelial growth of the causal fungus on potato dextrose agar was 30 ℃ and growth was still apparent at 37 ℃. Sporangiophores were 6 ~ 20 μm in diameter. Sporangia were globose and 40 ~ 200 μm in size. The color of sporangia was brownish-grey to blackish-grey at maturity. Sporangiospores were sub-globose, brownish- black streaked and 4 ~ 10 μm in size. Columella were globose to sub-globose and 85 ~ 120 μm in size. On the basis of <b>mycological</b> characteristics, pathogenicity <b>test,</b> and the ITS sequence analysis, the causal fungus was identified as Rhizopus oryzae. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of soft rot caused by R. oryzae on unshiu orange in Korea...|$|R
