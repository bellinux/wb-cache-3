40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general {{computational}} framework for empirical estimation of financial agent based models, for which criterion functions {{do not have}} known analytical form. For this purpose, we adapt a nonparametric simulated maximum likelihood estimation based on kernel methods. Employing {{one of the most}} widely analysed heterogeneous agent models in the literature developed by Brock and Hommes (1998), we extensively test properties of the proposed estimator and its ability to recover parameters consistently and efficiently using simulations. Key empirical findings point us to the statistical insignificance of the switching coefficient but markedly significant belief parameters defining heterogeneous trading regimes with superiority of trend-following over contrarian strategies. In addition, we document slight proportional dominance of fundamentalists over trend following chartists in <b>main</b> <b>world</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and continued {{viability of the}} New Zealand economy {{is based on the}} competitiveness of the agricultural sector and the opportunities for sales of its output on the <b>main</b> <b>world</b> <b>markets</b> for food. This competitiveness of farming has continued to improve, primarily through a more efficient use of inputs rather than through any significant growth in total output, as the growth in output has been constrained by the problems of finding remunerative external markets. This problem has become of increasing complexity with the development of stronger protectionist policies in agricultural products {{in many areas of the}} world. This has been most evident in the case of the European Community (EC) where the Common Agricultural Policy has had a substantial impact on New Zealand's agriculture and therefore on the New Zealand economy as a whole. Agriculture in Europe, however, also faces major difficulties on its own domestic market, as the growth in output has created enormous problems of finding remunerative markets. The present study sets out to explain the underlying forces which have fashioned the evolution of the Common Agricultural Policy; the factors which are dominating the current developments in that policy and which will continue to determine its course over the coming years. The basic horizon for the consideration of future events is the end of the present decade. Even that may be too long a period over which to project the economic social and political factors which shape the decisions taken by the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. The purpose of the study is to present a reasonably comprehensive, but not too detailed, account of the CAP and an assessment of its current development for New Zealand agriculture, in the hope that a better understanding of the European situation might help to contribute towards a solution of the economic difficulties between New Zealand and the European Community...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the finite sample {{behavior}} of the Hill estimator under 3 ̆b 1 -stable distributions. Using large Monte Carlo simulations we show that the Hill estimator overestimates the true tail exponent and can hardly be used on samples with small length. Utilizing our results, we introduce a Monte Carlo-based method of estimation for the tail exponent. Our method is not sensitive to the choice of k and works well also on small samples. The new estimator gives unbiased results with symmetrical confidence intervals. Finally, we demonstrate the power of our estimator on the <b>main</b> <b>world</b> stock <b>market</b> indices.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{collection}} of articles in a logical progression. We begin by studying the relationship between the exchange rate and the stock markets. These markets have many properties in common. Both are dependent on the fundamentals of the economy, while still exhibiting large fluctuations and excess, clustered, volatility. Financial data is widely available, which gives an opportunity to test the validity of specific models. We focus on this field for the first two chapters, by adopting different theoretical axioms in each contribution. Finally, in the last chapter we take one of the most restrictive theoretical assumptions seen in the previous chapters, rational expectations, and we relax it for the wider class of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. More in detail, in the first chapter we impose a theoretical framework. This is the approach of order flows to exchange rates (Rey and Hau, 2006). More specifically we analyze the effect of a time-dependent risk aversion. We find that the switch in the parameter causes the equilibrium of the system to alternate between two regimes: an optimistic and a pessimistic one. The paper is complemented with an empirical section where the two equilibria are identified and specified for three of the <b>main</b> <b>world</b> <b>markets.</b> The regimes appear to be persistent and consistent with the existing literature on risk aversion. This also includes recent events of the financial crisis. The analysis uncovers a new development for exchange rate microstructure models. 3 of the 4 markets studied are consistent with both the order flow and the Markov switching models. The markets analyzed are the UK, Switzerland, Germany and Japan. The second chapter assumes a more complex structure of expectations. To do this we merge two branches of the literature. On the one hand we study a heterogeneous agents framework (of the type of De Grauwe and Grimaldi, 2006), which is used to model exchange rates and stock prices. On the other hand we model the macroeconomic relationship between these two series through a small open economy DSGE model. From the behavioral finance literature, investors may choose one of two rules to form their expectations and maximize profits. One rule is based on an open economy general equilibrium model, which gives forecasts as it reacts to the information coming from the financial markets. Through this macroeconomic structure, exchange rate misalignments may influence stocks and vice versa. The second rule follows a statistic, backward looking approach. As a result, agents endogenously choose between different combinations of rules as they invest in the home equity market and in the foreign exchange market. We show that the simulated series replicate the dynamics of the real data, including the specific correlation between stock prices and exchange rates. The main finding is that disequilibria (and bubbles) in one market may create values in the other that are similar to chartists bubbles, while following only DSGE driven expectations. The last chapter follows logically from the previous ones. In particular, we take chapter two and reverse the model. In stead of using a DSGE model to construct fundamentalist expectations, chapter four sees heterogeneous agents who live in a DSGE world (and therefore maximize utility of consumption and labor [...] .) and have rational beliefs. We study the behavior of this New Keynesian Model with diverse beliefs {{in the presence of a}} technology shock and a cost push shock. We take the model developed in Kurz, Piccillo, Wu (2012). This is its first application in a setting with a technology shock, therefore we set the ranges for the new parameters. Then we add the cost push and check the effect on the model. The difference of this model with its rational expectations counterpart is significant. From the point of view of replicating the actual data's volatilities, this model does so with shocks that are considerably smaller than the ones normally assumed in rational expectations. In particular, the technology shock that we assume is in line with the literature on total factor productivity. The cost push shock is also very small and with low persistence. Finally, we look at monetary policy under this more general assumption. We study the case when the central bank chooses the traditional weights on output and inflation as well as address the issue of optimal monetary policy. This application shows that when the uncertainty in an economy is amplified by diverse beliefs the central bank has the means to control excess volatility. Monetary policy takes up a crucial role to stabilize this economy. However the way that the central bank can stabilize the economy is different than in the policy guidelines given by using models with rational expectations. nrpages: 114 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} written {{based on a}} field-trip to Guangdong and Fujian in July 1991 during which visited about 35 {{factories}} and met {{with a variety of}} local officials. During the trip we tested a questionnaire which was subsequently used to obtain information from 420 firms in Guangdong, Fujian, and Sichuan provinces. China Enters <b>World</b> <b>Markets</b> Much drama surrounds Chinas explosive entry on to <b>world</b> <b>markets.</b> Threatened by a loss of its Most Favored Nation (MFN) status when selling to the United States, China potentially faces substantially higher duties and hence a diminished share in its most important market. A range of antidumping suits by U. S. and European producers allege that Chinese exports are being unfairly subsidised. Relations with Hong Kong, its <b>main</b> passage to <b>world</b> <b>markets,</b> remain clouded. Commerce with Taiwan has grown by leaps and bounds but the rules remain unclear. Chinas own reform process has been a series of stop-and-go measures. On top of all of this, the incidents in June 1989 did not help. Amid all this, Chinas market share {{in a wide variety of}} products has increased in a most impressive fashion (see Table 1). In the lower priced, most labor intensive segments of garments, shoes, and toys, China is now the worlds most dominant exporter. Rapidly, it is moving to higher value-added and higher quality products. In July 1991, we undertook a three week trip to Guangdong and Fujian as a prelude to a systematic study of the forces generating growth in the coastal provinces of China. The impressions of that trip, while by no means constituting conclusive evidence, are extremely suggestive, and we offer them as a set of hypotheses to be examined more carefully.

40|$|This is a {{prepublication}} {{version of}} the article by the same name in the Journal of Australian Political Economy. It should be cited as “Freeman, A. 2012 'The Profit Rate in the Presence of Financial Markets: a Necessary Correction'. Journal of Australian Political Economy, Number 70, Summer 2012, pp 167 - 192 ” In {{the past two decades}} the number, variety, and monetary value of marketable financial instruments have grown by orders of magnitude. While traditional equities have certainly grown in number and value, the greatest growth has taken place in securities since the turn to securitized lending in the 1970 s. This is probably the single most significant development in what many writers term ‘financialisation’. This article argues that these assets, when they function as money-capital, enter into the equalization of the rate of profit. They constitute part of the capital advanced by the capitalist class as a whole and should therefore be included in the denominator of the rate of profit. In the two <b>main</b> <b>world</b> financial <b>markets</b> at least – the UK and the US - The resulting measures of the rate of profit reveal a general, systematic and virtually uninterrupted decline in the rate of profit in these countries since the late 1960 s. The paper then re-examines the definition of the rate of profit found in Marx’s writings on the subject and argues that it confirms the inclusion of financial instruments in both the concept and measure of the general rate of profit as defined by Marx. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates price {{transmission}} for agricultural commodities between <b>world</b> <b>markets</b> and the Ugandan market {{in an attempt}} to determine the impact of <b>world</b> <b>market</b> prices on the Ugandan market. Based on the realization that price formation is not a static concept, a dynamic vector autoregressive (VAR) model is presented. The prices of Robusta coffee and sorghum are examined, as both of these crops are important for the domestic economy of Uganda - Robusta as a cash crop, mainly traded internationally, and sorghum for consumption at household level. The analysis focuses on the spatial price relations, i. e. the price variations between geographically separated markets in Uganda and the <b>world</b> <b>markets.</b> Our analysis indicates that food markets in Uganda, based on our study of sorghum {{price transmission}}, are not integrated into <b>world</b> <b>markets,</b> and that oil prices are a very determining factor for price transmission within the country. However, the case is a bit different for the cash crop, Robusta coffee. In the period in the 1990 's with high coffee prices on the <b>world</b> <b>market,</b> prices in Uganda were strongly connected to world prices, and did not depend on the oil price. This indicates that if high demand appears in <b>world</b> <b>markets,</b> such effects could transmit to local markets. Thus, price transmission from <b>world</b> <b>markets</b> has only been evident in the case of booming prices of an exported commodity, but otherwise agricultural commodity markets are poorly linked. The empirical analysis thus indicates that rising food prices (of little-traded crops) on <b>world</b> <b>markets</b> will not have a direct effect on food prices in Uganda.
