40|$|Image {{representation}} {{is one of}} the major aspects of automatic classification algorithms. In this paper, different feature extraction techniques have been utilized to represent <b>medical</b> <b>X-ray</b> images. They are categorized into two groups; (i) low-level image representation such as Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM), Canny Edge Operator, Local Binary Pattern(LBP), pixel value, and (ii) local patch-based image representation such as Bag of Words (BoW). These features have been exploited in different algorithms for automatic classification of <b>medical</b> <b>X-ray</b> images. We then analyzed the classification performance obtained with regard to the image representation techniques used. These experiments were evaluated on ImageCLEF 2007 database consists of 11000 <b>medical</b> <b>X-ray</b> images with 116 classes.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{symbolic}} approach for classification of <b>medical</b> <b>X-ray</b> images. Graph cut segmentation {{is applied to}} segment the body part of <b>medical</b> <b>X-ray</b> images. A complete directed graph is constructed using the centroid points in the boundary image of the segmented body part image. The complete directed graph is in turn used to extract features of distance and orientation. Further, the boundaries of segmented images are represented by its skeleton end points. Shape features are then extracted from the represented skeleton end points. To assimilate feature variations, we propose to symbolically represent the extracted features of each class {{in the form of}} interval valued features. Based on the proposed symbolic representation, symbolic classifier is then used for classification of <b>medical</b> <b>X-ray</b> images.
