25|$|According to Avi Shlaim, {{the real}} {{driving force behind}} the Israeli {{invasion}} to Lebanon was the defense <b>minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon.</b> One of his aims was the destruction of PLO military infrastructure in Lebanon and undermining it as a political organization, in order to facilitate the absorption of the West Bank by Israel. The second aim was the establishment of the Maronite government in Lebanon, headed by Bashir Gemayel and signing the peace treaty between two countries, the third aim was the expelling of the Syrian Army from Lebanon. Also, according to Shlaim, with the completion of Israeli withdrawals from Sinai in March 1982, {{under the terms of the}} Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, the Likud-led government of Israel hardened its attitude to the Arab world and became more aggressive.|$|E
