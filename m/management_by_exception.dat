50|$|<b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> {{has both}} a general {{business}} application {{and a business}} intelligence application. General business exceptions are cases that deviate from the normal behavior in a business process {{and need to be}} cared for in a unique manner, typically by human intervention. Their cause might include: process deviation, infrastructure or connectivity issues, external deviation, poor quality business rules, malformed data, etc. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> here is the practice of investigating, resolving and handling such occurrences by using skilled staff and software tools. Good management can contribute to efficiency of business processes. Often in these cases the process will be called exception management, as exceptional cases are not the sole focus of the managerial policy, and exception management (as opposed to <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception)</b> denotes a more moderate application of the process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> is a {{style of}} {{business}} management that focuses on identifying and handling cases that deviate from the norm, recommended as best practice by the project management method PRINCE2.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{creation}} {{and the proper}} functioning of the organizations efficient structures depend on the knowledge one has of the normal consumptions and expenses in expense centers and compartments of structures. The comparison between the actual performances and the stipulations facilitates the appraisal {{and control of the}} accuracy of the costs employed on the principle of reverse connection. Consequently, the organisation’s managers can intervene in due time to eliminate the factors and causes that disturb the proper functioning of the economical and financial mechanisms. Key words: the system of managerial methods, cost standards and expense budgets, deviations from the stipulations, the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> objectives and the <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exceptions,</b> the audit and the management control.

50|$|<b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (MBE), {{when applied}} to {{business}} is a style of management that gives employees the responsibility to take decisions and to fulfill their work or projects by themselves. It consists of focus and analysis of statistically relevant anomalies in the data. If an unusual situation or deviation in the recorded data appears, which could cause difficulties for the business and can’t be managed by the employee at his level, the employee should pass the decision {{on to the next}} higher level. For example, if all products are selling at their expected volumes for the quarter, except one particular product which is underperforming or overperforming at a statistically relevant margin, only the data for that product will be presented to the managers for further investigation and discovery of the root cause. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> can bring forward business errors and oversights, ineffective strategies that need to be improved, changes in competition and business opportunities. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> is intended to reduce the managerial load and enable managers to spend their time more effectively in areas where it will have the most impact.|$|E
5000|$|Management-by-exception {{allows the}} leader to {{maintain}} the status quo. The leader intervenes when subordinates do not meet acceptable performance levels and initiates corrective action to improve performance. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> helps reduce the workload of managers being that they are only called-in when workers deviate from course.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> is that problematic issues are identified rapidly and managers {{are able to}} use their time and energy more wisely for important issues rather than for less important ones that could provoke delays in their daily operations. Additionally, managers need to work less on statistics {{and the frequency of}} making decisions becomes less, which saves time. As managers take fewer decisions, employees have more responsibility, which increases their motivation.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the years}} the {{philosophical}} terminology of [...] "management" [...] and [...] "leadership" [...] have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings. Debate is fairly common about whether {{the use of these}} terms should be restricted, and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns (1978) between [...] "transactional" [...] leadership (characterized by e.g. emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception)</b> and [...] "transformational" [...] leadership (characterized by e.g. charisma, personal relationships, creativity).|$|E
50|$|The OGSM {{framework}} {{forms the}} basis for strategic planning and execution {{as well as a}} strong management routine that keep the plan part of the day-to-day operations. It aligns the leaders to the objective of the company, links key strategies to the financial goals, and bring visibility and accountability to the work of improving the capabilities of the company. Due to the concise format (usually one page) and simple color-coding to signal progress, OGSM allows for quick <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> of any underperforming activity. And finally, it is simple, robust and developed as a team.|$|E
5000|$|Hotspots are {{identified}} by analyzing very large sets of {{external and internal}} sources of business data to discover statistically significant anomalies in the trend patterns, taking into account historical data and performance along with up-to-date data. The anomalies are analyzed to determine common characteristics and condense multiple exceptional points into noteworthy, business-relevant alerts. [...] Analysis is then performed to identify potential causes for the exceptions. Alerts are categorized according to their application to the business, and delivered to users as actionable, categorized alerts. [...] Hotspots facilitate a style of business management termed <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>Exception</b> (MBE).|$|E

50|$|The {{accounting}} department {{is responsible for}} the forecasting of budgets and cost performance reports. The difference between the estimated and actual figures is defined as variance.To understand the cause of the difference, managers need to investigate the questions how the variance differs from last period and what are the causes for not reaching the estimated figures.Analysers consider two types of variances: adverse variance and favourable variance. Adverse variance “exists when the difference between the budgeted and actual figure leads to a lower than expected profit”. Favourable variance “exists when the difference between the budgeted and actual figure leads to a higher than expected profit”. Rather than considering all variances, managers establish criteria to determine which variances are significant to focus on. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> focuses mainly on large adverse variances, to find the areas of business, which deviates from predetermined standards in a negative way.|$|E

Expatriate managers in Malaysian 5 -star hotels, {{may have a}} different approach from local managers, hence the levels of the job satisfaction of middle managers may differ too. Information is still lacking {{on the influence of}} expatriate managers leadership styles on employees’ job satisfaction in Malaysian 5 -star hotels. The purpose of this paper was twofold, to shed light on employees’ job satisfaction under the leadership of expatriate managers as well as the differences in leadership styles of local and expatriate managers. Results showed that transformational leadership styles such as; idealized influence (behavior), intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation had a significant positive effect on employees job satisfaction. Even transactional leadership styles of expatriates such as contingent reward produced significant positive effect on employees job satisfaction. However transactional leadership of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (passive) of expatriate managers had a significant negative effect on job satisfaction. The combination of five leadership styles of expatriate managers, was able to produce 92. 2 % of employees’ job satisfaction. Except for <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (passive), the other four leadership styles had a positive effect on job satisfaction. Results further revealed that expatriate managers have different leadership styles, with higher individual consideration, and contingent reward score, but lower <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (passive) score compared to local managers. The difference in leadership styles enabled expatriate managers to achieve higher job satisfaction scores compared to local managers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTOrganizational {{culture and}} leadership: a viable relationship?This work {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} organizational culture and the leadership of managers from 37 restaurants in a Brazilian state capital. As a theoretical approach, the study adopts the concept of organizational culture as variable; the concepts of transformational and transactional leadership; {{and the relationship between}} organizational culture and leadership. Using a questionnaire, we investigate the relationship between four types of organizational culture – clan, adhocracy, market, and hierarchy – and transformational leadership (in terms of four categories: idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration). We also examine the relationship between those four types of culture and transactional leadership (focusing in three dimensions: contingent reward leadership, <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception,</b> and absence of leadership). We found a negative correlation between the dimension of <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> and adhocracy culture, and between the dimension of individualized consideration and hierarchy culture. Furthermore, we observed the predominance of adhocracy and clan cultures...|$|E

40|$|Spacecraft {{management}} {{is becoming more}} human intensive as spacecraft become more complex and as operations costs are growing accordingly. Several automation approaches have been proposed to lower these costs. However, most of these approaches are not flexible enough in the operations processes and levels of automation that they support. This paper presents a concept called the Virtual Mission Operations Center (VMOC) that provides highly flexible support for dynamic spacecraft management processes and automation. In a VMOC, operations personnel can be shared among missions, the operations team can change personnel and their locations, and automation can be added and removed as appropriate. The VMOC employs a form of on-demand supervisory control called <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> to free operators from having to actively monitor their system. The VMOC extends <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception,</b> however, so that distributed, dynamic teams can work together. The VMOC uses work-group computing concepts and groupware tools to provide a team infrastructure, and it employs user agents to allow operators to define and control system automation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between transformational and transactional leadership, and labour flexibility within small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using a sample comprising 755 employees, rating 121 supervisors within 50 Dutch small and medium-sized companies, the authors examined the relationship between transformational and transactional leadership on the one hand, and temporal and functional flexibility on the other. Further, to test whether the expected associations could be perceived as a social exchange between supervisor and employees, this study investigated the mediating role of affective organisational commitment. Design/methodology/approach – Because data were nested, the authors used multilevel analysis for hypothesis testing. Findings – Both dimensions of transformational leadership, visionary leadership and coaching, were positively related to temporal flexibility; also two dimensions of transactional leadership, contingent reward and active <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception,</b> were also positively associated with temporal flexibility. All of these associations were mediated by affective organisational commitment, indicating social exchange relationships. As opposed to expectations, passive <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception,</b> representing poor transactional leadership, was positively related to temporal and functional flexibility. Affective commitment did not mediate these relationships. Practical implications – SMEs are therefore advised to improve visionary leadership, coaching skills, contingent reward, and active <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception.</b> Originality/value – The paper shows that, remarkably, labour flexibility can be increased by both effective and poor leadership. On the one hand, effective leadership seems to promote temporal flexibility by creating employees’ commitment to the organisation. Poor leadership, on the other hand, does not call for people's affective commitment and thus seems to be forcing employees into demonstrating flexible behaviours, as a way of compensating for bad managemen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Future air traf®c {{management}} architectures {{propose to}} give aircraft more ¯ight path autonomy {{and turn the}} air traf®c controller into a manager of exceptions. This article reports on one experiment {{in a series of}} studies that empirically explored the cognitive work underlying <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> in air traf®c control. Active practitioners (controllers, pilots, dispatchers) were prepared on the rules of the envisioned system and presented with a series of future incidents, each of which they were required to jointly resolve. <b>Management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> turns out to trap human controllers in a double bind, where intervening early seems appealing but is dif®cult to justify (airspace throughput) and carry out (controller workload problems). Late interventions are just as dif®cult, since controllers will have to take over {{in the middle of a}} potentially challenging or deteriorating situation. Computerised decision support that ¯ags exceptions migrates the decision criterion into a device, creating a threshold crossing that is typically set either too early or too late. This article lays out the intertwined trade-offs and dilemmas for the exception manager, and makes recommendations for cooperative human±machine architectures in future air traf®c management...|$|E

This paper explores {{the nature of}} Leadership in The Royal Thai Airforce to gain some fundamental information which {{may be useful in}} a long term planning. Relevant theories of Leadership are reviewed. Three major types of Leadership styles are considered: transformation, transaction, and Laissez-Faire. 30 commanders with ranks equal or higher than squadron leader with experience in RTAF at least 10 years were selected for a questionnaire survey. The majority Leadership characters found is transformation Leadership characters (X = 3. 99 out of 5) follows by Laissez-Faire (3. 67) and transaction (3. 44). All the Transformational Leadership characters possess high score: Idealized Behavior (3. 94), Inspirational Motivation (3. 93), Intellectual Stimulation (3. 89), and Individual Consideration (4. 21) show high scores while active <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> gains only moderate score (3. 35) and so are passive <b>management</b> <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (2. 99).
