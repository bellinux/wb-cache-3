5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how rennet (an enzyme from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in cheesemaking.

The pneuma first <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The pneuma then <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> other organs develop.|$|E
