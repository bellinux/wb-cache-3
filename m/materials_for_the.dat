5|$|Dr. John Lescher was a {{business}} partner and friend of Thomas S. Hinde. Both men invested in the Wabash Navigation Company. Lescher later joined Hinde's children in {{a lawsuit against the}} company. Not long after the death of Hinde, his son James and his son-in-law Charles H. Constable joined with Lescher and sued the company for entering their land and taking timber and other <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction of dam. But, the company's charter permitted them to enter the land and take construction material without the owner's consent, forcing the owner to seek legal redress. The court ordered compensation.|$|E

5|$|However, British Waterways {{decided that}} their full {{restoration}} {{was an important}} aim in 2002, {{and the construction of}} the main stadium for the 2012 Summer Olympics on an island formed by the rivers provided funding to construct a new lock and sluices which stabilised water levels throughout the Olympic site. It was hoped that significant amounts of <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction of the Olympic facilities would be delivered by barge, but this did not happen. Improvements to the channels which form a central feature of the Olympic Park included the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Matejko began {{collecting}} <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> painting in 1874. He started painting the canvas {{some time in}} 1875 and finished it in 1878. Soon afterwards, he received a scepter from the council of Kraków in an official ceremony, in recognition of his work and his position {{as one of the}} most respected Polish artists. The painting was sold that year to Dawid Rosenblum, a private individual in Warsaw. Displayed in numerous international exhibitions, in 1902 the painting was bought from Rosenblum's heirs by the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (Towarzystwo Zachęty Sztuk Pięknych) and displayed in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|<b>Materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision. To match {{the look and}} texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|E

5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} affected 123,320people across Veracruz and Hidalgo, prompting {{the declaration of}} a state of emergency in 112municipalities. The declaration allowed the usage of emergency resources for the affected people. There were a total of six deaths in the country, five of which in Puebla. By about three days after the storm, all schools were reopened. The Mexican government distributed food, water, and construction <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> areas most affected in Veracruz. Following the storm, about 500power workers were dispatched in Veracruz to restore electricity in the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Sestero further postulates that Wiseau based Lisa's {{explicit}} conniving on {{the character}} Tom Ripley, after Wiseau had a profound emotional reaction to the film The Talented Mr. Ripley, and matches elements of its three main characters to those in The Room; Sestero has likewise indicated that the character Mark was named for the Ripley actor Matt Damon, whose first name Wiseau had misheard. Wiseau also drew on the chamber plays of Tennessee Williams, whose highly emotional scenes he enjoyed acting out in drama school – many advertising <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Room make explicit parallels to Williams's work.|$|E
5|$|The art of batik is {{most highly}} {{developed}} in the island of Java in Indonesia. In Java, all the <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> process are readily available — cotton and beeswax and plants from which different vegetable dyes are made. Indonesian batik predates written records: G. P. Rouffaer argues that the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the Dutch archaeologist J.L.A. Brandes and the Indonesian archaeologist F.A. Sutjipto believe Indonesian batik is a native tradition, since other regions in Indonesia such as Toraja, Flores, Halmahera, and Papua, which were not directly influenced by Hinduism, have an age-old tradition of batik making.|$|E

Construction of the dams utilized nearby materials, and was one of the largest earthworks projects in the United States. Excavation of core <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dams resulted in many paleontological finds, all of which are displayed at the Western Science Center at the lake's East end.

5|$|Adolf Hitler was {{concerned}} about a Balkan invasion, as the area had {{been the source of}} raw <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, thereby keeping Sicily less defended than it could have been. In doing so, the deception operation reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. Falsified communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using land-lines wherever possible.|$|E
5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
