The performance of the macro-micro cross section model of POLCA 7 is very crucial for providing appropriate nodal parameters required by the core simu- lator’s neutron flux solver in order to carry out desired core physics calculations. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} thesis is to validate the most important components of the cross section model such as the isotopic history model, the xenon feedback model, spectrum interaction models and the tabulation of <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> data as function of the fuel exposure, coolant density and coolant density history. For the purpose of quantifying the accuracy of these cross section model components, the thesis has been divided into three broad numerical studies, starting with a set of simplistic two-dimensional single-node test problems involving shutdown cooling that has been evaluated against reference solutions prepared by solving the neutron transport equation (i. e. PHOENIX 4). Following this, similar comparison for a set of two-dimensional 2 x 2 mini-cores involving one shuffling was conducted while the final evaluation involved a set of three-dimensional 2 x 2 mini-cores. Based on the numerical results obtained from the three different phases, it is concluded that the current cross section model of POLCA 7, in combination with the standard three-dimensional tabulation of <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> data performs well with an acceptable accuracy for the considered depletion history, i. e. for the most severe history cases the error in reactivity is below 200 pcm in single-node simulations.

40|$|An {{accurate}} and computationally fast method to generate nodal cross sections for the Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) was presented. In this method, named Spectral History Correction (SHC), {{a set of}} fine group <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> libraries, pre-computed at specified depletion and moderation states, was coupled with the nodal nuclide densities and group bucklings to compute the new fine group spectrum for each node. The relevant fine group cross-section library was then recollapsed to the local broad group cross-section structure with this new fine group spectrum. This library set was tracked in terms of fuel isotopic densities. Fine group modulation factors (to correct the homogeneous flux for heterogeneous effects) and fission spectra were also stored with the cross section library. As the PBR simulation converges to a steady state fuel cycle, the initial nodal cross section library becomes inaccurate due to the burnup of the fuel and the neutron leakage {{into and out of}} the node. Because of the recirculation of discharged fuel pebbles with fresh fuel pebbles, a node can consist of a collection of pebbles at various burnup stages. To account for the nodal burnup, the microscopic cross sections were combined with nodal averaged atom densities to approximate the fine group macroscopic cross-sections for that node. These constructed, homogeneous macroscopic cross sections within the node were used to calculate a numerical solution for the fine group spectrum with B 1 theory. This new fine spectrum was used to collapse the pre-computed <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> library to the broad group structure employed by the fuel cycle code. This SHC technique was developed and practically implemented as a subroutine within the PBR fuel cycle code PEBBED. The SHC subroutine was called to recalculate the broad group cross sections during the code convergence. The result was a fast method that compared favorably to the benchmark scheme of cross section calculation with the lattice cross-section generator for two PBR reactor designs. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} cross sections {{far from the}} valley of stability poses a challenge for nuclear reaction models. So far, predictions of cross sections have relied on more or less phenomenological approaches, depending on parameters adjusted to available experimental data or deduced from systematic expressions. While such predictions {{are expected to be}} reliable for nuclei not too far from the experimentally known regions, it is clearly preferable to use more fundamental approaches, based on sound physical principles, when dealing with very exotic nuclei. Thanks to the high computer power available today, all the ingredients required to model a nuclear reaction can now be (and have been) microscopically (or semi-microscopically) determined starting from the information provided by a nucleon-nucleon effective interaction. This concerns nuclear masses, optical model potential, nuclear level densities, photon strength functions, as well as fission barriers. All these nuclear model ingredients, traditionally given by phenomenological expressions, now have a microscopic counterpart implemented in the TALYS nuclear reaction code. We are thus now able to perform fully <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> calculations.

40|$|Introduction Technetium- 99 m, the {{daughter}} of 99 Mo is {{the most commonly used}} radioisotope in nuclear medicine [1 – 2]. Current global crisis of 99 Mo supply, aging of nuclear reactors and staggering costs force the search for alternative sources of 99 mTc. Radioisotope Centre POLATOM joined the IAEA Coordinated Research Project on “Accelerator-based Alternatives to Non-HEU Production of 99 Mo/ 99 mTc”. The planned outcome of this project is development of 99 mTc production method using the reaction of 100 Mo(p, 2 n) 99 mTc [3] in Polish cyclotron. This work presents the results concerning preparation of 100 Mo target for irradiation with protons. Material and Methods The manufacturing of Mo target was performed using pressing of molybdenum powder into pellets and its sintering in hydrogen atmosphere at 1600 oC [4]. For this purpose a tantalum and stainless steel plates were used as support. Several pellets using molybdenum powder with particles size of 2 µm in diameter were pressed at different values of pressure. Results and Conclusion The optimized parameters of pressing molyb-denum pellets with various sizes are given in TABLE 1. It was found that the pellets did not adhere neither to the tantalum nor stainless steel plates but they conducted electricity very well. Pellets prepared with higher pressure were more mechanically resistant, however application, even the highest used pressure did not ensure its satisfactory stability. In order to improve mechanical strength, pressed Mo pellets were sintered in hydrogen atmosphere at temperature of 1600 °C. As a result of this process dimensions of Mo pellets decreased: diameter by 13 %, thickness by 12 %, weight by 1. 5 %, volume by 34 % while density increased by 50 %. The changes of these parameters are associated with reduction of molybdenum oxide and removal of oxygen from intermetallic space. It was confirmed by photos of <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> of pellets before and after sintering.

The United States of America and Ukraine have started collaboration activity for developing a conceptual design for this facility with low enrichment uranium (LEU) fuel. Different conceptual designs are being developed based on the facility mission and the engineering requirements including nuclear physics, neutronics, heat transfer, thermal hydraulics, structure, and material issues.

This report {{is a part of the}} Argonne National Laboratory Activity within this collaboration for developing and characterizing the subcritical assembly conceptual design. In this study, the medical isotope production function of the Kharkov facility is defined. First, a review was carried out to identify the medical isotopes and its medical use. Then a preliminary assessment was performed without including the self-shielding effect of the irradiated samples. Finally, more detailed investigation was carried out including the self-shielding effect, which defined the sample size and irradiation location for producing each medical isotope. In the first part, the reaction rates were calculated as the multiplication of the cross section with the unperturbed neutron flux of the facility. Over fifty isotopes were considered and all transmutation channels are used including (n,{gamma}), (n, 2 n), (n,p), and ({gamma},n).

40|$|Enhancements {{have been}} made to the REBUS- 3 /DIF 3 D code suite to {{facilitate}} its use for the design and analysis of prismatic Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTRs). A new cross section structure, using table-lookup, has been incorporated to account for cross section changes with burnup and fuel and moderator temperatures. For representing these cross section dependencies, three new modules have been developed using FORTRAN 90 / 95 object-oriented data structures and implemented within the REBUS- 3 code system. These modules provide a cross section storage procedure, construct <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> data for all isotopes, and contain a single block of banded scattering data for efficient data management. Fission products other than I, Xe, Pm, and Sm, can be merged into a single lumped fission product to save storage space, memory, and computing time without sacrificing the REBUS- 3 solution accuracy. A simple thermal-hydraulic (thermal-fluid) feedback model has been developed for prismatic VHTR cores and implemented in REBUS- 3 for temperature feedback calculations. Axial conduction was neglected in the formulation because of its small magnitude compared to radial (planar) conduction. With the simple model, the average fuel and graphite temperatures are accurately estimated compared to reference STAR-CD results. The feedback module is currently operational for the non-equilibrium fuel cycle analysis option of REBUS- 3. Future work should include the extension of this capability to the equilibrium cycle option of the code and additional verification of the feedback module. For the simulation of control rods in VHTR cores, macroscopic cross section deviations (deltas) have been defined to account for the effect of control rod insertion. The REBUS- 3 code has been modified to use the appropriately revised cross sections when control rods are inserted in a calculation node. In order to represent asymmetric core blocks (e. g., fuel blocks or reflector blocks containing asymmetric absorber rods), surface-dependent discontinuity factors based on nodal equivalence theory have been introduced into the nodal diffusion theory option of the DIF 3 D code (DIF 3 D-nodal) to improve modeling accuracy. Additionally, the discontinuity factors based on the Simplified Equivalence Theory (SET) have been incorporated as an alternative and may be employed for both the DIF 3 D-nodal and DIF 3 D-VARIANT (nodal transport) solution options. Two- and three-dimensional core calculations have been performed using the routines developed and modified in this work, along with cross sections generated from single fuel block and one-dimensional or two-dimensional fuel-reflector model. Generally, REBUS- 3 /DIF 3 D results for the core multiplication factor and power distribution are found to be in good agreement with reference results (generated with MCNP continuous energy calculations) particularly when discontinuity factors are applied. The DIF 3 D-VARIANT option was found to provide a more accurate solution in its diffusion approximation than the DIF 3 D-nodal option. Control rod worths can be estimated with acceptably small errors compared to MCNP results. However, estimation of the core power tilt needs to be improved by introducing the surface-dependent discontinuity factor capability in DIF 3 D-VARIANT...|$|E

This work describes a technique to automatically propagate the nuclear data uncertainties via the XSUSA approach through fuel lattice calculations in HELIOS 2. Application of the XSUSA methodology in HELIOS 2 presented some unusual challenges because of the highly-processed multi-group <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> data used in commercial lattice codes. Currently, uncertainties based on the SCALE 6. 1 covariance data file are being used, but the implementation can be adapted to other covariance data in multi-group structure. Pin-cell and assembly depletion calculations, based on models described in the UAM-LWR Phase I and II benchmarks, are performed and uncertainties in multiplication factor, reaction rates, isotope concentrations, and delayed-neutron data are calculated. With this extension, it will be possible for HELIOS 2 users to propagate nuclear data uncertainties directly from the <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> to subsequent core simulations...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{nuclear data}} {{evaluations}} {{have been performed}} {{in support of the}} analysis and design of thermal and fast reactors. In general, the neutron spectra characteristic of the thermal and fast systems used for data testing are predominantly in the low- and high-energy range with a relatively small influence from the intermediate-energy range. In the area of nuclear criticality safety, nuclear systems arising from applications involving fissionable materials outside reactors can lead to situations very different from those most commonly found in reactor analysis and design. These systems are not limited to thermal or fast and may have significant influence from the intermediate energy range. The extension of the range of applicability of the nuclear data evaluation beyond thermal and fast systems is therefore needed to cover problems found in nuclear criticality safety. Before criticality safety calculations are performed, the bias and uncertainties of the codes and <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> that are used must be determined. The most common sources of uncertainties, in general, are the calculational methodologies and the uncertainties related to the nuclear data, such as the <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections,</b> entering into the calculational procedure. The aim here is to focus on the evaluated nuclear data pertaining to applications in nuclear criticality safety...|$|R

These codes can be successfully used to predict the isotopic evolution during irradiation of the fuel {{of this kind of}} cores. At the moment, there are many computational systems based on MCNP that are available for performing depletion calculation. All these systems use MCNP to supply problem dependent fluxes and/or <b>microscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> to the depletion module. This latter then calculates the isotopic evolution of the fuel resolving Bateman's equations. In this paper, a comparative analysis of three different MCNP-based depletion codes is performed: Montburns 2. 0, MCNPX 2. 6. 0 and BGCore. Monteburns code can be considered as the reference code for HTR calculations, since it has been already verified during HTR-N and HTR-N 1 EU project. All calculations have been performed on a reference model representing an infinite lattice of thorium–plutonium fuelled pebbles. The evolution of k-inf as a function of burnup has been compared, as well as the inventory of the important actinides. The k-inf comparison among the codes shows a good agreement during the entire burnup history with the maximum difference lower than 1...|$|R
