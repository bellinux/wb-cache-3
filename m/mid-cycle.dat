5|$|In some women, {{ovulation}} {{features a}} characteristic pain called mittelschmerz (German term meaning middle pain). The sudden change in hormones {{at the time}} of ovulation sometimes also causes light <b>mid-cycle</b> blood flow.|$|E
5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a <b>mid-cycle</b> LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
25|$|Finally, calendar-based methods {{assume that}} all {{bleeding}} is true menstruation. However, <b>mid-cycle</b> or anovulatory bleeding {{can be caused by}} a number of factors. Incorrectly identifying bleeding as menstruation will cause the method's calculations to be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the GS 460, the GS lineup received a <b>mid-cycle</b> styling refresh, including a revised front bumper, headlights and grille, turn signals added to the side mirrors, and new wheel options and exterior colors. The interior received a redesigned steering wheel, revised instrument cluster gauges, and different trim pieces.|$|E

Redesigned {{front and rear}} fascias, new wheel designs, a reconfigurable 8 inch TFT instrument cluster, semi-aniline leather seating, and radar- and camera-based safety features such as Forward Collision Alert and side blind zone alert highlight the changes for this <b>mid-cycle</b> refresh.|$|E
25|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the GS 460, the GS lineup received a <b>mid-cycle</b> styling refresh, including a revised front bumper, headlights and grille, turn signals added to the side mirrors, and new wheel options and exterior colors. Inside the vehicle, the GS received a redesigned steering wheel, revised instrument cluster gauges, and different trim pieces.|$|E
25|$|Progestogen {{negative}} feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases {{the release of}} follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and greatly decreases the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen {{negative feedback}} {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a <b>mid-cycle</b> LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of certain}} {{calendar}} rules {{to determine the}} length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase allows unprotected intercourse during {{the first few days of}} the menstrual cycle while maintaining a very low risk of pregnancy. With mucus-only methods, there is a possibility of incorrectly identifying <b>mid-cycle</b> or anovulatory bleeding as menstruation. Keeping a BBT chart enables accurate identification of menstruation, when pre-ovulatory calendar rules may be reliably applied. In temperature-only systems, a calendar rule may be relied on alone to determine pre-ovulatory infertility. In symptothermal systems, the calendar rule is cross-checked by mucus records: observation of fertile cervical mucus overrides any calendar-determined infertility.|$|E
25|$|The first-generation SC lasted in {{production}} until 7 July 2000, over nine years, quite long {{compared to the}} other cars of the 1990s. Even with the SC's long production cycle, only minor exterior changes were made. New tail lighting and a modified spoiler design was part of the <b>mid-cycle</b> vehicle refresh. A front grille was added in 1996, along with a redesigned front bumper, side skirts and rocker panels. The SC 400 produced / from 1991 to 1995. The original 1991–1997 engines for the 2JZ-GE-powered SC 300 were rated at /. The output of the SC 300 was five horsepower more than the equivalent engine used in the Toyota Supra.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to impacting mating preferences, females {{have been found}} to exhibit differing mating behaviour at different cycle stages. An analysis of 121 studies with female birds showed that most mate outside their pair bond at a higher rate when fertile, especially when the primary partner possesses indicators of low quality genes. During infertile phases, birds showed reductions in this behaviour, suggesting that the function of extended female sexuality is not to increase the genetic quality of offspring. In humans, females show increased motivation for mating with other males at <b>mid-cycle</b> without an accompanying increase in copulation with their long term partner, especially if the partner was less physically attractive.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the IS line {{received}} a styling refresh, and the suspension and steering were retuned for improved stability and control. After {{three years with}} only one body style, the IS returned with a second body style, this time as a hardtop convertible, on 2 October 2008 when the IS 250 C debuted at the Paris Motor Show. A more powerful IS 350 C also became available, with engine specifications analogous to those on the sedan models. The IS convertible went on sale in Europe in 2009, in North America in May 2009, and an IS 300 C was also produced for certain regions. The <b>mid-cycle</b> refresh in 2008 saw slight styling revisions to the interior.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the CR-V {{received}} a <b>mid-cycle</b> refresh. The 2005 CR-V was now equipped with 16inch wheels, the earlier models had 15inch wheels. Visual changes included new taillights and headlights with clear indicators. The new headlights now have two separate H1 bulbs for low beams and high beams, the previous setup used H4 single bulb for both {{low and high}} beams. The taillights now used clear lenses instead of amber for the turning indicators. The grille was also changed; it had two horizontal bars instead of one. The front bumper design was slightly changed, it now has round fog lights compared to the previous rectangle fog lights {{and in addition to}} the lower grill there are two horizontal bars instead of one. The rear bumper reflectors were longer and narrower.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the 2010 {{model year}} ES {{underwent}} a <b>mid-cycle</b> facelift. A slightly revised grille resembled {{that of the}} new Lexus HS, and the lower bumper and taillights were changed. Other exterior changes included chrome-trimmed side moulding, turn signal indicators on the side mirrors, and new split 5-spoke alloy wheels. Memory seating, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and rear seat-mounted side-impact airbags were now standard. The steering wheel controls now had hard touch buttons {{as opposed to the}} previous soft ones. The navigation system shared with the then current Lexus RX now included upgraded VoiceBox speech recognition, Bluetooth phone book downloading, and Lexus Insider, XM Weather, Sports, and Stocks reports, and switched from DVD based maps to an internal hard drive. Bluetooth streaming audio and a USB port that included iPod integration was now built into the stereo.|$|E
25|$|Progestogens have antigonadotropic effects at {{sufficiently}} high dosages via {{activation of}} the PR and consequent negative feedback on and hence suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. The minimum ovulation-inhibiting (i.e., contraceptive) dosage of OMP in women, this effect being the result of suppression of the <b>mid-cycle</b> surge in gonadotropin secretion, is 300mg/day. Conversely, treatment with a high dosage of OMP of 100mg four times per day (or 400mg/day total) in men for 10days that resulted in approximately mid-luteal phase levels of progesterone (7.9–9.4ng/mL) did not cause any change in testosterone levels, suggesting that progesterone {{has little or no}} antigonadotropic effect in males at typical clinical dosages. On the other hand, a single 50mg intramuscular injection of progesterone, which is associated with very high progesterone levels of approximately 50ng/mL (or early- to mid-pregnancy levels), resulted in substantial (50–60%) suppression of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone levels in men.|$|E
25|$|Levels of {{estradiol}} in premenopausal {{women are}} highly variable throughout the menstrual cycle and reference ranges widely vary from source to source. Estradiol levels are minimal {{and according to}} most laboratories range from 20 to 80pg/mL during the early to mid follicular phase (or {{the first week of}} the menstrual cycle, also known as menses). Levels of estradiol gradually increase during this time and through the mid to late follicular phase (or the second week of the menstrual cycle) until the pre-ovulatory phase. At the time of pre-ovulation (a period of about 24 to 48hours), estradiol levels briefly surge and reach their highest concentrations of any other time during the menstrual cycle. Circulating levels are typically between 130 and 200pg/mL at this time, but in some women may be as high as 300 to 400pg/mL, and the upper limit of the reference range of some laboratories are even greater (for instance, 750pg/mL). Following ovulation (or <b>mid-cycle)</b> and during the latter half of the menstrual cycle or the luteal phase, estradiol levels plateau and fluctuate between around 100 and 150pg/mL during the early and mid luteal phase, and at the time of the late luteal phase, or a few days before menstruation, reach a low of around 40pg/mL. The mean integrated levels of estradiol during a full menstrual cycle have variously been reported by different sources as 80, 120, and 150pg/mL. Although contradictory reports exist, one study found mean integrated estradiol levels of 150pg/mL in younger women whereas mean integrated levels ranged from 50 to 120pg/mL in older women.|$|E
500|$|The [...] VY <b>mid-cycle</b> {{update of}} 2002 {{represented}} {{the first major}} styling shift since the 1997 VT. Designers discarded the rounded front and rear styling of the VT and VX models, adopting more aggressive, angular lines. The same approach {{was applied to the}} interior, whereby the curvaceous dashboard design was orphaned in favour of an angular, symmetrical design. Satin chrome plastic now dominated the façade of the centre console stack, and high-end models received fold-out cup holders borrowed from fellow GM subsidiary Saab. Leaving Eurovox behind, Holden turned towards German electronics manufacturer Blaupunkt to source audio systems—an arrangement that remains in place today.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{transgender}} men {{report a}} significantly increased libido. Some report that this decreases somewhat {{after several years}} on testosterone.

2500|$|In 2006 for the 2007 model year, the RX {{received}} a <b>mid-cycle</b> refresh {{consisting of a}} new 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 replacing the 3.3-liter 3MZ-FE V6 engine on non-hybrid models, updating the vehicle's name from RX 330 to RX 350, with new model codes GSU30 and GSU35. The RX 350 also featured an updated, Lexus Generation V DVD navigation system with improved graphics, voice controlled destination inputs, and a new feature called [...] "bread crumbs." [...] Bread crumbs will enable drivers to retrace their steps. The new navigation system also featured voice dial systems {{and the ability to}} enter destinations by voice address while driving.|$|E
2500|$|The Ford Taurus {{received}} its first redesign in mid-1991 for the 1992 model year. [...] Still {{based on the}} same chassis, every exterior body panel (with the exception of the doors) was restyled. [...] In spite of the extensive changes, few modifications were made to the successful styling; in the marketplace, the redesign was largely released as a <b>mid-cycle</b> facelift. [...] In terms of size, the 1992 Taurus gained several inches in length and over 200 pounds in curb weight. [...] Following market demand, the new Taurus was available solely with V6 engines and an automatic transmissions. [...] The Taurus SHO made its return, with an automatic transmission option joining the manual transmission.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mid-cycle</b> or ovulatory {{bleeding}} {{is thought}} to result from the sudden drop in estrogen that occurs just before ovulation. This drop in hormones can trigger withdrawal bleeding {{in the same way}} that switching from active to placebo birth control pills does. The rise in hormones that occurs after ovulation prevents such <b>mid-cycle</b> spotting from becoming as heavy or long lasting as a typical menstruation. Spotting is more common in longer cycles.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2012, Mercedes-Benz {{revealed}} the fourth generation E-Class (W212) facelift which included modest style and equipment changes.
