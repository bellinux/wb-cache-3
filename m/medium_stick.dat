50|$|In {{line with}} her eclectic avant-guard-like style, Ekster’s early {{paintings}} strongly influenced her costume design {{as well as}} her book illustrations, which are scarcely noted. All of Ekster’s works, no matter the <b>medium,</b> <b>stick</b> to her distinct style. Her works are vibrant, playful, dramatic, and theatrical in composition, subject matter, and color. Ekster constantly stayed true to her composition aesthetic across all mediums. Furthermore, each medium only enhanced and influenced her work in other mediums.|$|E
30|$|To enable {{mosaicking}} of IR image {{frames and}} aligning the image frames to a reference color image, the spatial sampling {{had to be}} sufficient to resolve fine cracks in the paint layers that are useful spatial features for image registration. Finally, the camera system had to allow for upgrades of the detector array by allowing for the same size IR area but with smaller individual pixels. Paint cracks are typically {{on the order of}} size of the diameter of a human hair, ~ 80 to 120  μm. A spatial sampling of ~ 90  μm also allows one to infer if an underdrawing is applied with a dry <b>medium</b> (<b>stick)</b> or wet medium (brush). For light sensitivity, the goal for the camera system was to keep the illumination near that of Gallery conditions, which are 200 – 300  lx for most paintings and 50  lx for drawings and illuminated manuscripts.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to verify the {{usefulness}} of high-energy milling, using electromagnetic mill, as a method for obtaining tetragonal (red) form of PbO, alternative to standard methods. Design/methodology/approach: Experiments were held to compare samples of the yellow form of PbO after milling in electromagnetic mill with the ones milled in high-energy planetary ball mill {{as a function of}} grinding <b>medium</b> (<b>sticks</b> or balls) to powder mass ratio, milling duration and instrumental conditions. Findings: Quantitative X-ray diffraction and analysis of granulation of mill products were applied. The characteristics of structural transitions of studied powder depending on milling conditions were defined. Practical implications: Utilization of electromagnetic mills was found to be suitable for milling of PbO. The speed and unit price of this process assure competitiveness of the method to standard methods. Tested method of high-energy milling assures possibility to supply, in certain conditions, good product. Obtained product may be used for manufacturing of minium. Originality/value: Optimum conditions of milling process and milling limitations were determined. Suggestions regarding optimization of mill construction were presented...|$|R
50|$|Metal {{tools and}} special brushes {{can be used}} to shape the paint before it cools, or heated metal tools {{can be used to}} {{manipulate}} the wax once it has cooled onto the surface. Today, tools such as heat lamps, heat guns, and other methods of applying heat allow artists to extend the amount of time they have to work with the material. Because wax is used as the pigment binder, encaustics can be sculpted as well as painted. Other materials can be encased or collaged into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic <b>medium</b> to <b>stick</b> them to the surface.|$|R
50|$|The nests are sturdy, bulky {{structures}} measuring about 50 cm {{in diameter}} and predominantly comprising <b>medium</b> live <b>sticks</b> of Avicenna species on which many leaves are still attached. These nests resemble those of the grey heron and the white ibis but are slightly more robust and comprise thicker twigs. However, other nests found have been small and flimsy structures that resemble those of doves. When collecting nesting material, milky storks break off live branches from trees by grasping the branch with their bill and flying upwards a short distance, {{which appears to be}} a difficult task and sometimes unsuccessful. If the stork does not manage the free the branch, it moves on to another one. Nest building continues even with young in the nest.|$|R

40|$|Embedding rigid {{inclusions}} into elastic matrix {{materials is}} a procedure of high practical relevance, for instance for the fabrication of elastic composite materials. We theoretically analyze the following situation. Rigid spherical inclusions are enclosed by a homogeneous elastic <b>medium</b> under <b>stick</b> boundary conditions. Forces and torques are directly imposed from outside onto the inclusions, or are externally induced between them. The inclusions {{respond to these}} forces and torques by translations and rotations against the surrounding elastic matrix. This leads to elastic matrix deformations, and in turn results in mutual long-ranged matrix-mediated interactions between the inclusions. Adapting a well-known approach from low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, we explicitly calculate the displacements and rotations of the inclusions from the externally imposed or induced forces and torques. Analytical expressions are presented {{as a function of}} the inclusion configuration in terms of displaceability and rotateability matrices. The role of the elastic environment is implicitly included in these relations. That is, the resulting expressions allow a calculation of the induced displacements and rotations directly from the inclusion configuration, without having to explicitly determine the deformations of the elastic environment. In contrast to the hydrodynamic case, compressibility of the surrounding medium is readily taken into account. We present the complete derivation based on the underlying equations of linear elasticity theory. In the future, the method will, for example, be helpful to characterize the behavior of externally tunable elastic composite materials, to accelerate numerical approaches, as well as to improve the quantitative interpretation of microrheological results.

40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{conflict}} between our intuition that no two things ever share a place {{at a time and}} these counterexamples to it, philosophers usually try to find a happy <b>medium</b> between <b>sticking</b> with the original intuition and rejecting all of its counterexamples or giving up the whole intuition and accepting all the counterexamples. Some counterexamples might be rejected on conceptual grounds : one may deny for instance that absolute space is in the same place that the entities located therein on the ground that absolute space is not itself located. One may also reject the distinct existence of some of the entities put forward in the examples : determinable properties might be nothing else than boolean combinations of determinate ones, spots on a screen may be just four dimensional worms whose passing through each other is a matter of part sharing rather than compenetration, etc. But as long as the conceivability of at least one counterexample is granted, the impenetrability intuition has to be weake- ned. To this end, one can weaken either the modal force of the impenetrability intuition or its scope. One may claim for instance that things are impenetrable in our world, but grant that the remaining counterexample refers to genuine metaphysical possibilities (although not natural ones). On the other hand, on may claim that the impenetrability intuition does not bear on every entity in the outside world, but only on some of them. Locke, famously, did not want to give up the metaphysical necessity of impenetrability, but agreed to restrict it to entities of the same kind. 4 One other way to restrict the scope of the intuition of impenetrability is to claim that only independent entities (substances, or things proper) are impenetrable, or that only material entities are...|$|R
40|$|METHOD 1. Place 2 mL of the {{appropriate}} sterile medium in a 13 mm yellow-capped culture tube. If more culture is needed, place up to 5 mL in a 16 mm green-capped culture tube. Large amount of culture should be made in growth flasks, using up to 25 % flask volume in medium (e. g., no more than 30 mL in a 125 mL flask, or 250 mL in a 1000 mL flask). - Touch a single colony {{with the end of}} an applicator stick and hold it in your primary hand (right hand if right-handed). - Holding the test tube in you other hand with palm and lower fingers, remove the cap of the test tube with your thumb and index finger. Dip the inoculated end of the applicator into the sterile medium and, if necessary, wipe the end onto the side of the tube. - Briefly flame the end of the test tube and replace the cap. - Always inoculate a dummy tube with no cells to verify that the <b>medium,</b> tubes, and <b>sticks</b> were sterile. - If inoculating large cultures, dilute an existing culture 1 : 100. - Grow culture for 12 to 18 hours. After 24 - 30 hours, cells have entered stationary phase and should not be used for critical procedures. - "Quicky" overnights can be made by rescuing a 2 or 3 day culture. Dilute culture 1 : 10 in sterile medium and grow for 3 hours. [![DOI]([URL]...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been held that triadic {{interactions}}, or interactions between individuals that include shared perception and goals concerning an outside entity, require elaborate cognitive processes such as joint attention. With their connection to shared intentionality, triadic interactions have been a key topic of interest for developmental and evolutionary psychologists, notably when making comparisons between humans and other ape species. There is good evidence that chimpanzees and bonobos engage in triadic interactions; however, convincing evidence for orangutans are more limited and {{so far have been}} found only in the context of feeding. I engaged 11 wild-born sanctuary orangutans through the <b>medium</b> of a <b>stick,</b> allowing them to decide how to use the object and how to interact with me. The participating orangutans developed idiosyncratic ways of using the stick and engaging with me during the activity, and six of them alternated their gaze between the stick and me. When I interrupted the activity, the participating orangutans displayed more numerous and different behaviors than before the interruption to actively reengage me in the game. Much like human infants, they appeared more interested in the social interaction than in the stick. These findings confirm that triadic interactions occur in nonenculturated orangutans and are consistent with studies of other nonhuman great ape species, which also show triadic interactions, suggesting that joint attention and potentially shared intentionality may have an early origin in our evolutionary history...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to study the {{structure}} and {{the properties of the}} diffuse ionized interstellar medium perpendicular to the plane of disk galaxies researchers obtained H alpha images and spectra of NGC 891. Perhaps the most remarkable property of the H alpha emission line in NGC 891 is its extension out of the plane of the galaxy: researchers are able to measure the H alpha line out to more than 30 seconds (1. 4 kpc) from the midplane. This means that the ionized hydrogen extends at least four times higher than the neutral hydrogen layer. An anomalously large scale-height for the ionized gas of approx. equals 1 kpc is also found in the Milky Way. The echelle spectra show a changing ratio of NII to H alpha. This excludes the possibility that the large scaleheight of the emission is due to scattering of disk emission by dust high above the plane. The z-extent of the H alpha emission is confirmed by the imaging result. The large z-extent of the ionized gas is confined to the inner half of the visible disk. In this inner region the H alpha distribution also shows a filamentary structure of the diffuse ionized <b>medium.</b> These filaments, <b>sticking</b> out of the plane, originate in HII regions in the plane. The H alpha image also shows a large scale asymmetry if the NE and SW parts of the disk are compared. The NE part is more prominent and extended in H alpha. The same asymmetry is also seen in the radio continuum distribution. This correlation between the diffuse ionized medium and the distribution of relativistic electrons is one example of a relation between star formation processes in the disk and the various components of the halo. Thermal filaments or spurs which are related to HII regions are also known in the Galaxy. These filamentary structures perpendicular to the galactic planes may represent the chimneys which result in the supernova dominated model of the Interstellar Medium by Norman and Ikeuchi (1989) ...|$|R
