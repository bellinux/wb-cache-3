The {{purpose of}} the present {{experimental}} investigations is to study the effect of moulding sand properties on reducing the shell wall thickness of <b>mould</b> <b>cavity</b> for cost effective, hybrid rapid casting solution of zinc alloy.

A typical form of designed ceramic micro parts involves the structuring of several micro columns and/or thin walls on a substrate. This work considers {{the use of}} a model mould with a straight <b>mould</b> <b>cavity</b> and a step-contracted cross-section in the filling direction. The injection moulding of such of ceramic micro part is experimentally simulated. The effect of the <b>mould</b> <b>cavity</b> contraction ratio, <b>moulding</b> conditions, and the solid loading of the ceramic/binder mixture on the distribution of the transverse shrinkage of the moulding parts at moulded, debinded, and sintered stages, respectively, are examined. Experimental results reveal that transverse shrinkage of the region downstream from the step-contracted cross-section clearly exceeds that of the region upstream in all three stages. Furthermore, transverse shrinkage varies greatly in the plane of the step-contracted cross-section. The magnitude of the variation in transverse shrinkage in the step-contracted cross-section increases with the contraction ratio of the <b>mould</b> <b>cavity.</b> Appropriately increasing either the holding pressure or the filling pressure of the <b>mould</b> <b>cavity</b> reduces the variation in the transverse shrinkage of the step-contracted cross-section.

The temperature distribution of the polymer, while it is inside the <b>mould</b> <b>cavity,</b> influences the properties of the product. The measurement and control of these temperature profiles can enhance the economy of the process and the part quality. A method to measure melt temperature inside the <b>mould</b> <b>cavity</b> was developed. It consists of an insert, located in the movable plate, that can place thermocouples at different positions. The depth of the thermocouple tip is adjusted manually. These sensors offer an attractive way to perform the measurements because of their easy calibration procedure. The temperature measurements were influenced by the thermocouple tip geometry. Data were collected at different locations and depths of the <b>mould</b> <b>cavity</b> and the temperature profiles were analyzed. The temperature distribution depended on the wall temperature and the temperature of the polymer as it enters the cavity. The effect of different flow rates was also studied and it demonstrated to affect the temperature profiles.

The manipulated variable was the coolant temperature and the process disturbance was the front barrel temperature. The transfer functions of the controlled variable with respect to the manipulated and disturbance variables were identified and modeled.
