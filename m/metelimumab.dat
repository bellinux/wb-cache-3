50|$|Fresolimumab was {{discovered}} by Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) scientists {{and was one of}} a pair of candidate drugs that were identified for the treatment of the fatal condition scleroderma. CAT chose to co-develop the two drugs <b>metelimumab</b> (CAT-192) and fresolimumab with Genzyme. During early development, around 2004, CAT decided to drop development of <b>metelimumab</b> in favour of fresolimumab.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metelimumab</b> (CAT-192) {{is a human}} IgG4 {{monoclonal}} antibody that neutralizes TGF beta 1 which had been chosen for further development {{for the treatment of}} diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma. Touted as a drug of the future, <b>metelimumab</b> was dropped from further development in favour of fresolimumab, which is currently being developed by Genzyme.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metelimumab</b> was {{isolated}} by Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) using its phage display technology. In 2000, CAT signed a collaborative deal with Genzyme to further develop TGF beta antibodies.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, CAT and Genzyme {{revealed}} that Phase I/II trials of <b>metelimumab</b> for scleroderma showed this antibody {{to be safe}} and well tolerated across all dose levels, although no conclusions regarding efficacy of the compound could be made.|$|E
5000|$|Genzyme, 2000. CAT held {{significant}} {{strength in}} the area of TGF beta with two products already — lerdelimumab (CAT-152) and <b>metelimumab</b> (CAT-192). The deal with Genzyme was [...] "a broad strategic alliance to develop and commercialise human monoclonal antibodies directed against TGF-beta." [...] All clinical indications, with the exception of ophthalmic uses, were covered by the agreement.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Metelimumab</b> (CAT-192) and fresolimumab (GC1008) {{are human}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies to transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1). Initial trials targeted the skin condition scleroderma but, after some unsuccessful clinical trial results, {{the product was}} dropped in favour of fresolimumab, which was initially developed by Genzyme. In February 2011, Sanofi-Aventis purchased Genzyme for approximately US$20 billion and, as of March 2013, Sanofi continue to list fresolimumab in their research and development portfolio.|$|E
40|$|Although 14 C-labelling {{has been}} {{routinely}} used for small molecules, {{this technique is}} not routinely applied to therapeutic proteins due to difficulties of incorporating the label into the protein to a sufficiently high specific activity. An analytical method known as accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) offers an extremely sensitive method of 14 C quantification, thereby enabling 14 C-labeling methods {{to be applied to}} therapeutic protein detection. The therapeutic protein CAT- 192 (<b>metelimumab),</b> a human anti-TGFÃ� 1 monocloncal antibody was manufactured in the presence of 14 C-precursors resulting in a low specific activity product (1. 4 14 C incorporation). 14 C-CAT- 192 was administered to rats (1 mg/kg and 222, 22 and 2. 2 dpm/kg) and serum samples were collected. 14 C in serum samples from the 2. 2 dpm dosing was not detectable but samples from the 22 and 2220 dpm doses were measured by AMS and by ELISA for comparison. By both ELISA and AMS bioassay, the half-lives approximated 140 h (S. E. M. 15 h). The estimates of clearance were also comparable, 7. 3 and 4. 6 Ã� 10 - 4 ml/h/g (S. E. M. 6. 6 and 5. 1 Ã� 10 - 5) for ELISA and AMS, respectively. The estimated limit of quantification (LOQ) was approximately 1 ng/ml, about 15 times lower than the ELISA LOQ of 15. 6 ng/ml.
