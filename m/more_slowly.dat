5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them <b>more</b> <b>slowly,</b> and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{interpolation}} {{search is}} slower than binary search for small arrays, as interpolation search requires extra computation. Although its time complexity grows <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than binary search, this only compensates {{for the extra}} computation for large arrays.|$|E
60|$|Outside the drive, {{and out of}} sight, he slackened {{his pace}} still <b>more.</b> Very <b>slowly,</b> <b>more</b> bent than when he came, lean, hungry, and disheartened, {{he made his way}} back to the station.|$|R

5|$|Neon is monatomic, {{making it}} {{lighter than the}} {{molecules}} of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen which form the bulk of Earth's atmosphere; a balloon filled with neon will rise in air, albeit <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than a helium balloon.|$|E
5|$|The loud bang that {{is heard}} is the super heated air around the {{lightning}} bolt expanding {{at the speed}} of sound. Because sound travels much <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than light the flash is seen before the bang, although both occur at the same moment.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent {{in the opposite direction}} (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E

5|$|At the end {{of primary}} school (or at the {{beginning}} of secondary school), pupils are separated according to their capacities in several (often three) sections. The fastest learners are taught advanced classes to be prepared for further studies and the matura, while students who assimilate a little <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> receive an education more adapted to their needs.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise <b>more</b> <b>slowly,</b> implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E
5|$|In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury {{destroyed}} the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, {{which includes the}} well, was consecrated in 1186. There is evidence that, in the 12th century, the ruined nave was renovated enough for services while the great new church was being constructed. Parts of {{the walls of the}} aisle and crossing having been completed by 1189, progress then continued <b>more</b> <b>slowly.</b>|$|E

5|$|Overall wages rose much <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> {{throughout}} the period than planned: wages {{across the entire}} state (not only industrial wages) rose by 22.9 percent between 1959 and 1965, against a plan for growth of 26 percent. Wage rises during the reform were made up for by increases in industrial productivity. For example, in the RSFSR (Russia) wages rose by 7 percent between 1959 and 1962, whilst productivity increased by some 20 percent.|$|E
5|$|Social {{divisions}} {{did appear}} both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and {{society of the}} north had modernized <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> {{than those of the}} south, there was a more pronounced conflict between Christianity and socialism in the north, and farmland had a major social status; ownership of even a small parcel of land created a motivation to fight against the Reds.|$|E
5|$|The album {{jumped to}} its peak {{position}} of No. 20 on the UK album charts in early October. In the US, it moved <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> and {{reached its peak}} of No. 61 in April 1983, spending 32 weeks on the Billboard charts. In Canada, it topped out at No. 83, while in New Zealand it hit No. 4 in its first week of release.|$|E

5000|$|Iron {{and steam}} ships {{became more and}} <b>more</b> popular, <b>slowly</b> {{replacing}} wooden sailing vessels. After years of economic difficulties, Imperial Chancellor Bismarck {{took charge of the}} situation by announcing a commission. Its advice: The association ought to turn into a public company. The change was finalised at a general assembly which took place on 5 October 1889.|$|R
60|$|It was not curiosity alone, but, {{it seems}} to me, {{something}} different mingled with it, which prompted me to drop my tortoise, and once <b>more</b> gaze <b>slowly</b> around. I remembered the husband buried by Hunilla's hands. A narrow pathway led into a dense part of the thickets. Following it through many mazes, I came out upon a small, round, open space, deeply chambered there.|$|R
5|$|The {{comparison}} {{has shown}} these two species diverged around 400,000years ago, more recently than was previously thought. Also, the orangutan genome {{was found to}} have evolved much <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than chimpanzee and human DNA. Previously, the species was estimated to have diverged 2.9 to 4.9mya. The researchers hope these data may help conservationists save the endangered ape, and also prove useful in further understanding of human genetic diseases. Bornean orangutans have 48diploid chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage path is shorter), whether the target flies {{in a straight line}} or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than it.|$|E
5|$|Warm fronts are at {{the leading}} edge of a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E
60|$|As Slone leaped within roping {{distance}} the avalanche slipped {{a foot or}} two, halted, slipped once <b>more,</b> and <b>slowly</b> started again with that low roar. He did not care whether it slipped or stopped. Like a wolf he leaped closer, whirling his rope. The loop hissed round his head and whistled as he flung it. And when fiercely he jerked back on the rope, the noose closed tight round Wildfire's neck.|$|R
25|$|Through each race's campaign, {{the player}} retains control {{of one or}} <b>more</b> heroes, which <b>slowly</b> grow in {{experience}} as the levels progress. This experience is carried over to subsequent missions, allowing the hero to grow {{throughout the course of}} the campaign.|$|R
25|$|The strikers, however, {{lost nearly}} all of the gains they had won in the next few years. The IWW disdained written {{contracts}}, holding that such contracts encouraged workers to abandon the daily class struggle. The mill owners proved <b>more</b> persistent, <b>slowly</b> chiseling away at the improvements in wages and working conditions, while firing union activists and installing labor spies {{to keep an eye on}} workers. A depression in the industry, followed by another speedup, led to further layoffs.|$|R
5|$|While {{the moment}} from {{gyroscopic}} forces is only 12% of this, it {{can play a}} significant part because it begins to act {{as soon as the}} rider applies the torque, instead of building up <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> as the wheel out-tracks. This can be especially helpful in motorcycle racing.|$|E
5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas seeds {{provide a}} rich source of {{proteins}} and calories, as well as minerals and vitamins. This complements the mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop. A seed can consist of 25% protein and has very low fat content. Cowpea starch is digested <b>more</b> <b>slowly</b> than the starch from cereals, which is more beneficial to human health. The grain is {{a rich source}} of folic acid, an important vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects in unborn babies.|$|E
