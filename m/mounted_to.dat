5|$|During the Vietnam War, Yehudi {{lights were}} again tried, this time <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> an F-4 Phantom painted in a dull blue-and-white {{camouflage}} pattern. The experiment reduced by 30% the distance at which an observer visually acquired the Phantom. In 1997, active camouflage was again investigated, {{this time with}} thin computer-controlled fluorescent panels or light-emitting polymer covering much of an aircraft's surface.|$|E

5|$|After the {{successful}} defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943. This advance was <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> {{divert attention from}} Lae, {{which was one of}} the main objectives of Operation Cartwheel, and proceeded slowly. In late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua. The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{agricultural}} policy reinforced the conventional methods for organising the collective farms. Output quotas {{continued to be}} imposed centrally. Khrushchev's policy of amalgamating farms was continued by Brezhnev, because he shared Khrushchev's belief that bigger kolkhozes would increase productivity. Brezhnev pushed {{for an increase in}} state investments in farming, which <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> an all-time high in the 1970s of 27% of all state investment– this figure did not include investments in farm equipment. In 1981 alone, 33 billion U.S. dollars (by contemporary exchange rate) was invested into agriculture.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in the missiles {{were supposed to}} have been removed before the missiles were taken from their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment.

5|$|While the {{majority}} of the meerkats filmed were partially habituated, the cinematographers had to move carefully to avoid scaring the animals. The crew used radios to keep in contact with one another as they followed the meerkat groups around. Although the park normally prohibits low-flying aircraft, the production crew was given permission to film for three days using a low-flying helicopter. <b>Mounted</b> <b>to</b> its front underside was a new type of camera that was not affected by the shaking of the helicopter. Full-color scenes depicting the birth of meerkat pups were obtained by filming captive meerkats at the Cotswold Wildlife Park in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> {{the inside}} of the gondola structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the LED lights {{at the top of the}} tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED lights on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the lights at the top of the tower come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED lights at the top of the tower remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E

5|$|Each module {{was fitted}} with {{external}} components {{specific to the}} experiments that were carried out within that module, the most obvious being the Travers antenna <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> Priroda. This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was {{most of the other}} equipment on Priroda, including various radiometers and scan platforms. Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or Ikar, was mated. This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned Buran {{in a manner similar to}} the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, but it was only used once, during EO-5.|$|E
5|$|Investors on Wall Street {{were putting}} their money into Marconi's system {{and some in}} the press began turning against Tesla's project, {{claiming}} it was a hoax, AuthorHouse, page 35 The project {{came to a halt}} in 1905 and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> $20,000 ($ in today's dollars). He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915 and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{communications}} provided telemetry {{and scientific}} data links between Mir and the RKA Mission Control Centre (TsUP). Radio links {{were also used}} during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, Mir was equipped with several communication systems used for different purposes. The station communicated directly with the ground via the Lira antenna <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> the core module. The Lira antenna also had the capability to use the Luch data relay satellite system (which fell into disrepair in the 1990s) and the network of Soviet tracking ships deployed in various locations around the world (which also became unavailable in the 1990s). UHF radio was used by cosmonauts conducting EVAs. UHF was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, and the Space Shuttle, {{in order to receive}} commands from the TsUP and Mir crew members via the TORU system.|$|E

5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT also tested Südwerke's two-stroke diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> their ordered vehicles on the assembly line. In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E
5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E
5|$|With the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve, Chauvel {{sent the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{to move on}} Magdhaba by the north and {{north-east}} {{to cut off the}} possibility of retreat while the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade followed the telegraph line straight to Magdhaba. The 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced <b>mounted</b> <b>to</b> the attack but fierce shrapnel fire forced them to advance up the wadi bed. By midday all three brigades and the Camel Brigade, despite support from machine-guns and artillery, were hotly engaged. Aerial reconnaissance from Australian and British aircraft, which scouted out the Turkish positions, greatly assisted the attack, although the Turkish positions were obscured by the effect of a mirage and dust clouds.|$|E
