The lawyers also quoted the official report of death that various of parts of Kazemi's body had been damaged and her clothes were torn and bloody, which proves that she had been tortured.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{political}} parties blamed each other, and sometimes other influences, for the attacks. The Gauteng provincial {{branch of the}} ANC has alleged that the violence is politically motivated by a [...] "third hand" [...] that is primarily targeting the ANC for the 2009 general elections. Both the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Intelligence,</b> Ronnie Kasrils, and the {{director general of the}} National Intelligence Agency, Manala Manzini, backed the Gauteng ANC's allegations that the anti-immigrant violence is politically motivated and targeted at the ANC. Referring to published allegations by one rioter that he was being paid to commit violent acts against immigrants, Manzini said that the violence was being stoked primarily within hostel facilities by a third party with financial incentives.|$|E
2500|$|The Central Bank of Iran is {{enforcing}} the [...] to curb possible crime. The <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>intelligence,</b> {{the governor of}} the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and several other ministers are among the members of the special committee in charge of the campaign against money laundering. In 2008, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Watchdog praised the Islamic Republic's crackdown on money laundering. The 34-member financial watchdog congratulated Tehran on its commitment to seal money laundering loopholes. However, in 2010, FATF, named Ecuador and Iran on a list of states that it says are failing to comply with international regulations against money laundering and financing terrorism. Despite president Hassan Rouhani showing interest in FATF, there has been a massive disagreements by hardliners related to supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Among them Ahmad Jannati, the chairman of the Assembly of Experts and the secretary of the Guardian Council and Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's former foreign secretary and Supreme leader top foreign relationship advisor are two notable people who are against the FATF. These disagreements and lack of FATF being approved by the Iranian parliament has brought FATF enforcement to halt.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Ahmadinejad, in [...] {{a speech}} praising the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, was {{translated}} by Iranian state-run media {{as saying that}} [...] "Israel must be wiped off the map." [...] A controversy erupted over the translation, with specialists such as Juan Cole of the University of Michigan and [...] Arash Norouzi of the Mossadegh Project {{pointing out that the}} original statement in Farsi did not say that Israel should be wiped off the map, but instead that it would collapse. The words [...] ‘Israel’, ‘map’, and ‘to wipe off’ [...] are non-existent in the Iranian speech's original. According to another IRNA translation, on the occasion of a commemoration of the anniversary of Khomeini's death on 3 June 2008, Ahmadinejad stated that [...] "The corrupt element will be wiped off the map." [...] Contextually, Ahmadinejad was quoting Khomeini's words about the imminent disappearance of the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime, and tacked on his remarks concerning Israel. In Katajun Amirpur's analysis, there is no implication in the text that Iran intended destroying Israel or annihilating the Jewish people, any more than Khomeini was suggesting with his words that the Russians, or the Iranian people themselves under the Shah would be extinguished. Ahmadinejad is on the record as stating that Iran had no plans to attack Israel. The statement itself was in fact a citation, with a minute verbal variation, of a remark made by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, which had created no furor at the time, but did so when Ahmadinejad quoted them in 2005. Dan Meridor, Israel's <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>intelligence</b> and atomic energy said during an Al Jazeera interview that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had repeatedly said [...] "that Israel is an unnatural creature, it will not survive. They didn’t say, ‘We’ll wipe it out,’ you’re right, but, ‘It will not survive.’" [...] adding [...] "If Iran says this, and continues to pile up uranium that they enrich, and build missiles in big numbers, and have a nuclear military plan -- if you put all this together, you can't say, they don't really mean it." [...] The Washington Post's fact-checker editor Glenn Kessler says the interpretation gets murkier when Ahmadinejad's quote is set against other Iranian propaganda. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cites proof that the Iranian government releases propaganda that clearly says Israel should be [...] "wiped off." [...] Joshua Teitelbaum of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs discovered pictures of Iranian propaganda banners that clearly say in English: [...] "Israel should be wiped out of the face of the world." [...] In March 2016, Iran tested a ballistic missile painted with the phrase [...] "Israel should be wiped off the Earth" [...] in Hebrew. The missile is reported to be capable of reaching Israel.|$|E
