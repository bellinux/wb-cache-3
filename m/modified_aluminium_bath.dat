50|$|Aluminized steel can be {{made using}} a variety of processes, cladding, hot dipping, {{galvanic}} coating, metallizing, and calorizing, but the most effective process is hot dipping. The process of hot dipping starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the <b>aluminium</b> <b>bath</b> to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The hot dipping process is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|R

Therefore, a new method, so far little known in metal forming industries, is the friction stir processing of surface layers. Friction stir processing (FSP) is an emerging surface engineering solid-state technology which provides the ability to thermomechnically process selective locations on the materials surface and to enhance specific properties to some considerable depth.

40|$|Aluminium {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{construction}} materials in machine and equipment manufacture as well as vehicle and aircraft construction. Particularly, in automotive and aircraft industries, the adhesive bonding of aluminium requires the pre-treatment of the adhesive surfaces. In this study laser pre-treatments were used to laterally control the surface roughness and clean the substrate surfaces by forming fresh aluminium oxide layers. In order to keep the adhesive properties stable over time, the laser pre-treated aluminium surfaces were subsequently coated with weak polyelectrolytes. The applied polyelectrolytes lower the driving forces for the adsorption of unwanted surface contaminations and provide reactive amino groups for the subsequent coupling of reactive adhesives. The surface topographies of the laser-treated aluminium surfaces were investigated in relation to the applied laser parameters (such as pulse frequency, and laser power) by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light-microscopic techniques (confocal microscopy). The adsorption of the polyelectrolytes was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Inverse water contact angle measurements using captive air bubbles were carried out to study the wettability (hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity) of the <b>modified</b> <b>aluminium</b> surfaces. Single lap joint tests carried out on joined AlMg 3 sheets showed that the shear strengths can be significantly increased by pre-treatment with laser and coating of the alloy surfaces with weak polyelectrolytes. Furthermore, the application of polyelectrolytes improved the stability against corrosion. The article shows the increase of tensile shear strengths at adhesively bonded single lap shear samples after laser pre-treatment and also an increase in long-term stability due to of the combination of laser pre-treatment and coating with polyelectrolytes.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to <b>modify</b> <b>aluminium</b> surface with iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) by Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. The Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is operating at a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm with 10 ns pulse duration. The laser optimized parameters in this work are focus distance, pulse width and pulse energy. The target consists of a pure aluminium plate and the two alloying elements used are iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) powders. The alloying elements were well mixed and prepared in four different ratios (Fe:Cu) of (1 : 0), (1 : 1), (2 : 1), and (3 : 1). The surface alloying process was carried out by varying the laser output energy delivered to the targets from 67 to 331 mJ per pulse. The modified surfaces were characterized by using three types of analysis; structural elemental, and mechanical analysis. The results from field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that the surface microstructures change significantly compared to the untreated surface. The formation of alloyed layer due to the rapid melting and solidification processes of alloying elements with aluminium substrate was observed. In addition, all the treated surfaces show less porosity and are free from any cracks. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the treated surface showed the formation of new compounds which comprise AlCu, AlFe, CuFe and AlFeCu. The maximum hardness of the treated surfaces as measured using microhardness tester is 86. 2 HV which is two times higher than that of the untreated surface. The formation of intermetallic phases and the change in the surface microstructures are responsible for the increase in the surface hardness compared to untreated one...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Aluminium alloy reinforced with 10 % vol. SiC particles with an average size of 15 microns has been joined using friction stir welding method. The joining process were carried out at rotation speed 560 rpm and linear velocity of 355 mm/min and the temperature was lower than 793 K. Microstructures of joined materials were observed according to the light and scanning electron microscopy. Changing of distribution of reinforcement particles were analysed by new RVE theory. The mechanical properties determined on the basis of compression tests. Tests were performed at room temperature at a strain rate 10 - 4 s- 1. Findings: In the resulting joints (welds) observed significant changes in the distribution of SiC particles, precipitation which was characterized by macro-heterogeneity. However, in micro scale, a few typical distributions and areas of fragmentation of the reinforcing particles were identified. Differences in the sizes of the ceramic particles were 15 microns in the initial material and 2 - 3 micron in the welded material, respectively. The analysis of these regions using the new RVE theory shows that the coefficient of mechanical properties anisotropy was varied from 0. 500328 to 0. 016961. Mechanical testing of selected parts of joints showed significant differences in the values of the plastic flow stress in advancing and retreating sides, approximately from 400 to 450 MPa.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the results of studies on the effect of silicon content in alphinising bath on the thickness of diffusion layer „g 1 ” and of coating „g” produced by immersion on the grey cast iron, grade EN-GJL- 250. The temperature of alphinising bath was 750 ± 5 °C, and the time of holding the cast iron insert was τ = 180 s. Design/methodology/approach: It has been proved that in the bath of commercially pure aluminium and of AlSi 1, 5 alloy, the diffusion layer and coating produced on grey cast iron are of the highest thickness, comprised in a range of g 1 = 40 ÷ 50 µm and g = 220 ÷ 230 µm., respectively. The diffusion layer produced in these baths is characterised by a compact, columnar structure of the Al 3 Fe phase. Findings: An increase in silicon concentration in the alphinising bath to about 11 % changes the structure of diffusion layer into the faceted one and makes other phases appear as well. Right {{on the surface of the}} cast iron insert, the Fe 4 CSi carbide is present, followed by the Al 12 Fe 3 Si 2 phase, on which the Al 9 Fe 3 Si 2 phase is superimposed. Raising further silicon concentration in bath to a level well above 11 % Si, i. e. to about 17 % Si, does not change the phase constitution of the diffusion layer. What it causes is only a fragmentation (breaking of continuity) of the layer, thus making it useless in the process of producing a layered casting. An increase in silicon concentration in the alphinising bath in a range of 7 ÷ 17 % Si reduces the thickness of diffusion layer in a range of g 1 = 38 ÷ 22 µm and that of coating in a range of g = 155 ÷ 92 µm. It is supposed that the decrease in thickness of the diffusion layer and of coating with the increasing concentration of silicon in alphinising bath is due to a reduced rate of the reactive diffusion. Originality/value: This is an immediate effect of the enlarged number of silicon atoms and of the presence of the precipitates of primary silicon crystals adhering to the surface of cast iron insert. The reason of occurrence of a monophase structure in the diffusion layer produced in <b>aluminium</b> <b>bath</b> or in bath of AlSi 1, 5 is the lack of silicon atoms or low concentration of this element in the region of the surface layer dissolved on cast iron insert...|$|R
