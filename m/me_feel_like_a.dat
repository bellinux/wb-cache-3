The refrain is backed by distorted synths and the guitar riff present during the first verse. Following the second chorus, Grande sings the hook, [...] "All girls wanna be like that/Bad girls underneath, like that/You know how I'm feeling inside" [...] accompanied by an electronic riff reminiscent of trap music. A reviewer from Sputnikmusic noted that the track's lyrics are [...] "a cross between sexually charged and fully empowering." [...] Commenting about the lyrical content of [...] "Dangerous Woman", Grande stated: [...] "This song is about an empowered woman who meets another person that brings out a different side of her. It's her decision to put her fears aside and explore these new feelings. It's about letting someone into your life in an intimate and vulnerable way and not letting that take away from your independence and strength." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{promotion}} for Carey's self-titled {{debut album}} (1990), she appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show to perform her first single, [...] "Vision of Love". During the very much talked about performance, singer-songwriter Carole King {{had been watching}} Carey perform, taking interest in her and her material. One year later, during the recording sessions for Carey's second studio album, Emotions (1991), King contacted Carey, asking if she {{would be interested in}} covering [...] "(You Make <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like)</b> <b>A</b> Natural Woman", a song she had written alongside Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. Carey declined, feeling uneasy about covering a song one of her musical influences executed so perfectly. Still determined to work with Carey, King flew out to New York City for one day, in hopes of writing and composing a ballad of some sort. Throughout the day, the two songwriters exchanged musical ideas and melodies on the piano until [...] "If It's Over" [...] came into conception. In an interview following the collaboration, King said the following regarding Carey: [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." ...|$|E

As a band, this to <b>me</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> really mature album for us.|$|R
500|$|... "Coming Home" [...] is a downtempo {{hip-hop and}} pop song, that {{opens with a}} [...] "simple piano intro" [...] and a [...] "delicate vocal verse from Skylar Grey". It was written by Diddy, Skylar Grey, Jay-Z, J. Cole, and Alex [...] "da Kid" [...] Grant, and {{produced}} by Jay-Z and Grant. When speaking to Kid about what he wanted, Diddy said, [...] "I want a beat that makes <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> white man in a basement in Atlanta". Diddy later called [...] "Coming Home" [...] a gift from Jay-Z and Kid. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by EMI Music Publishing, the song {{was written in the}} key of D major with a time signature of common time and a tempo of 69 beats per minute. It follows the basic chord progression of GDBmFm. [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV noted that the concept and theme of the song were similar to events in Diddy's life, [...] "referencing mistakes he has made in the past and that he wants to put behind him." [...] Rodriguez also noted the song's tribute to The Notorious B.I.G, in the line [...] "I miss you, B.I.G." [...] The chorus features vocals from the group's female members, Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard, as well as background vocals from fellow Bad Boy Records recording artist Cassie. The trio use a vocal range of A3A4. Grey also sings some of the vocals, predominately during the song's opening chorus.|$|E
500|$|Osborne {{was already}} {{at work on a}} new play, The Entertainer, an allegory of Britain's post-colonial decline, centred on a seedy variety comedian, Archie Rice. Having read the first act—all that was {{completed}} by then—Olivier asked to be cast in the part. He had for years maintained that he might easily have been a third-rate comedian called [...] "Larry Oliver", and would sometimes play the character at parties. Behind Archie's brazen façade there is a deep desolation, and Olivier caught both aspects, switching, {{in the words of the}} biographer Anthony Holden, [...] "from a gleefully tacky comic routine to moments of the most wrenching pathos". Tony Richardson's production for the English Stage Company transferred from the Royal Court to the Palace Theatre in September 1957; after that it toured and returned to the Palace. The role of Archie's daughter Jean was taken by three actresses during the various runs. The second of them was Joan Plowright, with whom Olivier began a relationship that endured for the rest of his life. Olivier said that playing Archie [...] "made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> modern actor again". In finding an avant-garde play that suited him, he was, as Osborne remarked, far ahead of Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, who did not successfully follow his lead for more than a decade. Their first substantial successes in works by any of Osborne's generation were Alan Bennett's Forty Years On (Gielgud in 1968) and David Storey's Home (Richardson and Gielgud in 1970).|$|E
500|$|Marge's {{flashback}} {{of her and}} {{her sisters}} swimming in a lake is based on The Prince of Tides. The singers at Duff Gardens, Hooray for Everything, are a parody of the musical group Up with People. The group is seen performing a kid-friendly version of the Lou Reed song [...] "Walk on the Wild Side". Homer and Bart start to sing [...] "Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead" [...] from The Wizard of Oz. The poem that Great Aunt Gladys reads {{at the start of}} her video will is [...] "The Road Not Taken" [...] by Robert Frost. [...] Duff Gardens is a parody of Busch Gardens, originally developed as a marketing vehicle for the Anheuser-Busch brewing company. [...] The song and ride that Bart, Lisa, and Selma go on, with animatronic kids {{from all over the world}} singing is a parody of the song [...] "It's a Small World". The Duff Gardens parade is a parody of Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade.as Lisa's hallucination where she sees Selma after drinking the water on the ride is based on the work of artist Ralph Steadman, particularly in the novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. When Lisa says [...] "I am the Lizard Queen!", it is a tribute to Jim Morrison's poem [...] "Celebration of the Lizard". After acquiring Jub-Jub, Selma sings [...] "(You Make <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like)</b> <b>A</b> Natural Woman", a reference to the season four finale of the sitcom Murphy Brown, in which reporter Murphy Brown sings the song after giving birth to her baby.|$|E

500|$|Carolyn Menyes of Music Times complimented the song's time {{signature}} {{for adding}} [...] "a {{bit of a}} waltz flavor, channeling the old school Ariana that fans first fell in love with", adding that [...] "a sultry, distorted guitar line and Grande's passionate, soaring vocals add a sense of texture and modernity that makes 'Dangerous Woman' feel as powerful as the title." [...] A writer of NME felt that Grande [...] "shows herself as someone who continues to be determined to challenge the norm." [...] The publication as well pointed out that [...] " [...] does sound empowered, even if it doesn't sound especially dangerous {{for her in the}} wake of her 2014 collaboration 'Love Me Harder' with The Weeknd." [...] Writing for Idolator, Robbie Daw, Carl Williot and Mike Wass reviewed [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] during their [...] "Pop Perspective" [...] article, with Daw calling it [...] "one walk of danger worth taking", Williot praising her vocal performance and highlighting the [...] "clever little flip of '(You Make <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like)</b> <b>A</b> Natural Woman'", and Wass naming it a [...] "decent song" [...] but noting that [...] " [...] still hasn't found her own lane." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy praised Grande's vocals, describing as [...] "angelic" [...] and completed writing it [...] "almost sound too pure over the seductive guitar line and prowling beat, which threatens to blindfold you and tie up your wrists within one listen.". Reviewing the album with the same name, the editor from Sputnikmusic described the song as [...] "the first moment that the album really shows flashes of becoming something special," [...] and continued, [...] "as it sways to a seductive beat that feels like it was extrapolated from the most revealing scene of a James Bond film." [...] Quinn Maryland of Pitchfork shared similar opinion, the reviewer described it as [...] "a slinky, empowered, Bond theme of a belter;" ...|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{aside from}} the three men, Carey worked with Carole King, a female singer-songwriter who had been {{predominantly}} popular in the 1970s. However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping {{to work with her}} after hearing her perform live on The Arsenio Hall Show. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover [...] "(You Make <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like)</b> <b>A</b> Natural Woman," [...] a song she had written with Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly. Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort. The two ladies sat together by a piano {{over the course of the}} day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled [...] "If It's Over." [...] After working with Carey, King said in an interview [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." [...] After recording [...] "If It's Over," [...] Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory. When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of, while he would follow her with the piano. In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as [...] "very unique," [...] and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies. While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivillés proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and key.|$|E
2500|$|Superfly's {{cover of}} [...] "(You Make <b>Me</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Like)</b> <b>A</b> Natural Woman", {{originally}} released on the [...] "Dancing on the Fire" [...] (2009) single, {{was used as}} the theme song for the film Tokyo-jima.
