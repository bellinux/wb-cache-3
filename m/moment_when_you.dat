500|$|In a {{significant}} {{scene in the}} book, Harry sees a memory of his own father humiliating Snape in their school days, and Snape insulting his mother after she stood up for him. In the film, it is abbreviated to an [...] "idea", in Goldenberg's words. [...] "It's an iconic <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> realise your parents are normal, flawed human beings. ... Things get trimmed out, but I kept the meat of that in there – {{and that was what}} really gave me the coming-of-age story." [...] Young Lily Potter did not appear at all, but promotional screenshots show unknown teenager Susie Shinner in the role.|$|E
500|$|Christian Louboutin {{said that}} he would {{dedicate}} his time to creating some [...] "scene-stealing designs for the single's video", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E
500|$|New York Magazine put [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as {{third of}} its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes", {{claiming}} that [...] "because with all his other problems, daddy issues don't feel like {{something that needs to}} be thrown at Hurley" [...] and David could have been written as a positive character [...] "just to add some variation to the bad-dad overkill on this show". IGN ranked [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as the second worst Lost episode, above only [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", explaining [...] "Is there a better metaphor that Lost was running in circles at this point in Season 3 than seeing several of the castaways driving in circles on the island, with goofy grins on their faces?... With a dull story on the island and flashbacks weakly giving Hurley the requisite daddy issues so many of the other characters already had, it was clear Lost needed to make a big change soon to recapture what was special about the show. Thankfully, they did." [...] A similar list by the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode much higher at 31, writing [...] "The haters need to shut up. This is a nearly pure embrace of the Lost ethos. You make your own fate up until the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't." ...|$|E

500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E
2500|$|Article 112 is {{typically}} deployed with politically expedient timing, {{rather than at}} the time of the supposed offense.

2500|$|... "Anytime I'm onstage or {{watching}} the music video, {{the first thing}} that comes into my mind is the person I wrote the song about.

5000|$|Ahana Bhattacharya of Koimoi {{gave the}} film 2.5/5 saying, [...] "The story is funny {{and the film}} has some really hilarious dialogues. However, sardar jokes are a bit clichéd and Bollywood needs to get over it. I loved the way the film builds up the {{confusion}} but it tends to drag towards the climax. Their are <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> will feel it is patriarchal, racist and regressive. Also, the climax is a bit predictable.|$|R
5000|$|In contrast, DAWN {{contributor}} Zara Khadeeja Majoka gave a {{far more}} negative review of the book stating, [...] "On the whole, the reader is neither able to muster any great empathy for the characters nor relate to them in any significant way. The novel is cluttered with many ‘almost’ moments; <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> almost feel something for a character or almost understand their motive but then soon enough an unnecessary tangent, a gross magnification of the obvious or a dreaded cliché rears its head and you’re back to feeling frustrated." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a 2007 {{article in}} Reason magazine, Hirsi Ali said that Islam, the religion, must be {{defeated}} and that [...] "we {{are at war}} with Islam. And there's no middle ground in wars." [...] She said, [...] "Islam, period. Once it's defeated, it can mutate into something peaceful. It's very difficult to even talk about peace now. They're not interested in peace...There comes a <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> crush your enemy." [...] She reiterated her position that the problem isn't just a few [...] "rotten apples" [...] in the Islamic community but [...] "I'm saying it's the entire basket." [...] She stated {{that the majority of}} Muslims aren't [...] "moderates" [...] and they must radically alter their religion. Max Rodenbeck, writing in The New York Review of Books, notes that Ali's view of Islam has shifted and [...] "mellowed," [...] as she no longer completely rejects Islam. She now narrowly criticizes what she calls [...] "Medina Muslims", meaning the fundamentalists who envision a regime based on sharia, and who ignore the more inclusive passages of Muhammad's Meccan period, a small minority of Muslims, who are, nevertheless, quite influential among young Muslims, according to Hirsi Ali: [...] "These men, I find them to be far more influential in inspiring and mobilising young men to see the religion of Islam the way they see it, than the way either Imam Faisal says he sees it, or Maajid Nawaz says he sees it." [...] Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, [...] "The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and hurt people, they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries is that the people who feel they should be governed under the Sharia Law, are not a fringe. (..) Islam can become a religion of peace, if politics is divorced from religion", and she stated that: [...] "The individual that wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam, is inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam, the example of the prophet Mohammed, the clergy that preached to him, and the reward that he will get in the hereafter." ...|$|E
