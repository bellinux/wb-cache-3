40|$|CEA {{has been}} {{conducting}} a comprehensive R&D program to identify and study key HLW storage design criteria to possibly meet the lifetime goal of a century and beyond. A novel approach is being used since such installations must {{be understood as a}} global system comprised of various <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> components, canisters, concrete and steel structures and specific procedures covering engineering steps from construction to operation including monitoring, care and maintenance as well as licensing. The challenge set by such a lifetime design goal made the R&D people focus on issues at stake and relevant to long term HLW storage in particular heat management, the effect of time on materials and the sustainability of care and maintenance. This opened up the R&D field from fundamental research areas to more conventional and technical aspects. Two major guiding principles have been devised as key design goals for the storage concepts under consideration. One is the paramount function of retrievability, which must allow the safe retrieval of any HLW package from the facility at any given time. Next is the passive containment philosophy requiring that a dual-barrier system be considered. In the case of spent fuel, CEA's early assessment of the long-term behavior of cladding shows that it may not qualify as a reliable barrier {{over a long period of}} time. Therefore, the overriding strategy of preventing corrosion and material degradation to achieve canister protection, and therefore containment of radioactive material throughout the time of period envisaged, is at the heart of the R&D program and several design alternatives are being studied to meet that objective. For instance available thermal power from SF is used to establish dry corrosion conditions within the storage facility. The paper reviews all of these different R&D and engineering aspects...|$|E

40|$|Head {{tracking}} {{is used in}} research: in many studies, {{the position}} of the eyes is measured, for instance in usability studies. Other research shows that head tracking has applications in distance education and video conferencing. Another application of head tracking is in Virtual Reality, where {{the position of the}} head influences the image the user is looking at. Yet another head tracking application is in games, where the position of the head is used to control parts of the games, most likely, but not limited to, the view of the user (i. e., looking around corners, looking left and right and looking up and down). Head tracking is also used in animation. As a Bachelor project we made a low-cost solution for head tracking for the PC using a WiiMote and self-made glasses with IR-LEDs, using a Bluetooth connection. We will explain the choice for this hardware in the chapter <b>Materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hardware</b> Realization. Normally a PC is controlled using a keyboard and a mouse. We aim to make a low-cost alternative {{to the use of the}} mouse. This alternative may help people with a disability to their arms or hands to control a PC. Also, our project could be used in one of the applications mentioned above. In this project we made the software which retrieves the data perceived by IR-sensors in the WiiMote, based on the position of the IR-LEDs. This data is then filtered and interpreted. This thesis will concentrate on the hardware components, the realization and implementation of the hardware components and technical details of the hardware. On the software side, this thesis will concentrate on the interpretation of the filtered points. Existing solutions for head tracking have several disadvantages: we will discuss a few commercially available products and look at the advantages and disadvantages in detail. As a case study we have decided to play a game with our head. The game we were able to play was Portal, by Valve Software. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract by Jason Katrina Abstract Statement: The {{purpose of}} this senior project {{is to create a}} jig that will enable a c-clamp to be locked in place while {{secondary}} machining processes can be performed. While it is held in place, a milling operation will be done to face the clamping surfaces. A separate bushing holder can be bolted onto the main mount so a hole can be drilled precisely on the threaded end of the c-clamp. To see this project through, it will require the use of engineering analysis techniques that have been learned in previous classes to find the forces applied to the c-clamp while it is held in place. The magnitude of the forces and dimensions of the C-clamp were used to develop the design of the fixture and drawn in Solidworks. After everything has been made to fit on the computer, raw <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>hardware</b> will be purchased to start the construction part of the project. The school has the necessary equipment to do all the machining operations needed for the project, so everything will be done on campus. The testing procedure involves putting the free end of the c-clamp under a pre-determined load in the x, y, and z-axes to test if the toggle clamps can hold it in place. The completed project meets all of the standards that were found in the analysis stage of the project and functions as originally envisioned. Keywords:,...|$|R
