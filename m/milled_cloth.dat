5000|$|According to old timers, {{people of}} Coimbatore started {{trickling}} to D.B. Road, {{which was then}} the Rathina Sabapathy Puram Street during 1930-40. The road abutted a burial ground, parts of which are today’s Shastri Maidan. Mr. C.R.V. Dass constructed a house on D.B. Road in 1942, and had his bakery on Raja Street - another busy commercial street in Coimbatore city, with an on premises store named [...] "Ayyar and Co" [...] at 221 Raja Street, which is still functional and now owned by his elder son Mr. V. Ramakrishnan. The street was lined with trees {{on both sides with}} street lights planted firmly on the middle of the road, in the median. A few years later - when the powers to grant approval for shops was available with the Coimbatore Municipality - the Ayyar and Co. founder managed to open a branch at D.B. Road.

Rangaswamy Chettiar Sons and Company. Very few buses passed through D.B. Road. Two of those were No.6 and 7, which run from Gandhipark to Gandhipark, with a stop at Ramoo and Co.

Parasuraman established the shop before Independence. In his assessment, the growth of D.B. Road is intrinsically linked to the growth of residential localities west of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. As the number of houses grew, the first stop for the people of those areas was D.B. Road.The other reason was the width of D.B. Road. And also that of T.V. Samy Road. The two broad roads presented ideal destinations for shopping as there was ample spacing for parking and walking, says Jegan S. Damodarasamy, Executive Director, Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar Group of Hotels.His family first started the Annapoorna hotels as a standalone unit on D.B. Road in 1968.|$|R
