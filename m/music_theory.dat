5|$|Many {{institutes of}} higher {{education}} teach music in Italy. About 75 music conservatories provide advanced training for future professional musicians. There are also many private music schools and workshops for instrument building and repair. Private teaching is also quite common in Italy. Elementary {{and high school students}} can expect to have one or two weekly hours of music teaching, generally in choral singing and basic <b>music</b> <b>theory,</b> though extracurricular opportunities are rare. Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E
5|$|Once Tchaikovsky {{graduated}} in 1865, Rubinstein's brother Nikolai offered him {{the post of}} Professor of <b>Music</b> <b>Theory</b> at the soon-to-open Moscow Conservatory. While the salary for his professorship was only 50 rubles a month, the offer itself boosted Tchaikovsky's morale and he accepted the post eagerly. He was further heartened by news of the first public performance {{of one of his}} works, his Characteristic Dances, conducted by Johann Strauss II at a concert in Pavlovsk Park on 11 September 1865 (Tchaikovsky later included this work, re-titled, Dances of the Hay Maidens, in his opera The Voyevoda).|$|E
5|$|The melody of {{the song}} is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its {{combination}} of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony.

Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in <b>music</b> <b>theory,</b> it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.|$|E

40|$|Modeling <b>music</b> <b>theories</b> with {{computer}} programs has attracted composers and scholars {{for a long}} time. On the one hand, the resulting programs can serve as algorithmic composition tools. On the other hand, such an approach leads {{to a better understanding}} of existing as well as newly developed theories, which in turn can lead {{to a better understanding of}} music, as well as to better ways to retrieve music from databases. Constraint programming (Apt 2003) has often been used to create computational models of <b>music</b> <b>theories</b> and composition. Constraint-based harmonization systems were surveyed by Pachet and Roy (2001); other examples include purely rhythmic tasks (Sandred 2003), Fuxian counterpoint (Schottstaedt 1989), Ligeti-like textures (Chemillier and Truchet 2001; Laurson and Kuuskankare 2001), and instrument-specific writing (Laurson an...|$|R

5|$|Eastwood favors jazz (especially bebop), blues, classic {{rhythm and}} blues, classical, and country-and-western music; his {{favorite}} musicians include saxophonists Charlie Parker and Lester Young, pianists Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson, Dave Brubeck, and Fats Waller, and Delta bluesman Robert Johnson. He {{is also a}} pianist and composer. Jazz has {{played an important role}} in Eastwood's life from a young age and, although he never made it as a professional musician, he passed on the influence to his son Kyle Eastwood, a successful jazz bassist and composer. Eastwood developed as a boogie-woogie pianist early on and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a <b>music</b> <b>theory</b> degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album Cowboy Favorites, released on the Cameo label.|$|E

5|$|In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in {{the music}} (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the {{conductor}} in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he {{said that he did}} not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume <b>music</b> <b>theory</b> treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie ("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").|$|E
5|$|Kikuta {{was born}} in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He first became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} ten after hearing songs by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He began writing his own songs two years later, after listening to country blues music; it inspired him to study acoustic guitar and write his own songs in hope of one day becoming a singer/songwriter. He was also inspired as a child by music from movies. It was not until he got a synthesizer, however, that he began to feel his potential as a composer. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading <b>music</b> <b>theory</b> books and listening {{to a wide variety of}} musical genres.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics {{were also}} used in musical tuning and <b>music</b> <b>theory.</b> The 2nd-century-BCE Huainanzi, {{compiled}} by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve tones on a musical scale. Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones. While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves. By calculating the difference at 177147⁄176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal temperament duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620–1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's comma). Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536–1611 CE) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548–1620 CE) of the Flemish Region in Europe would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal temperament.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Russian Musical Society (RMS) {{was founded}} in 1859 by the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna (a German-born aunt of Tsar Alexander II) and her protégé, pianist and {{composer}} Anton Rubinstein. Previous tsars and the aristocracy had focused almost exclusively on importing European talent. The aim of the RMS was to fulfill Alexander II's wish to foster native talent. It hosted a regular season of public concerts (previously held only during the six weeks of Lent when the Imperial Theaters were closed) and provided basic professional training in music. In 1861, Tchaikovsky attended RMS classes in <b>music</b> <b>theory</b> taught by Nikolai Zaremba at the Mikhailovsky Palace (now the Russian Museum). These classes were a precursor to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, which opened in 1862. Tchaikovsky enrolled at the Conservatory {{as part of its}} premiere class. He studied harmony and counterpoint with Zaremba and instrumentation and composition with Rubinstein.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen {{had five}} children, {{two of them}} illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate {{daughter}} was born– Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned. With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied <b>music</b> <b>theory</b> with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert Møller (1893–1978), a medical doctor who became {{a professor at the}} University of Copenhagen and director of the polyclinic at the National Hospital. The younger daughter Anne Marie, who graduated from the Copenhagen Academy of Arts, married the Hungarian violinist Emil Telmányi (1892–1988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen's music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen's son, Hans Børge, was handicapped as a result of meningitis and {{spent most of his life}} away from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{reputation}} at {{this time}} was as a master of orchestration, based on Sadko and Antar. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any counterpoint, could not harmonize a simple chorale, nor knew the names or intervals of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform. Aware of his technical shortcomings, Rimsky-Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, with whom {{he and the others}} in The Five had been in occasional contact. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and was serving as Professor of <b>Music</b> <b>Theory</b> at the Moscow Conservatory.

5|$|Sousa {{began his}} career playing violin and {{studying}} <b>music</b> <b>theory</b> and composition under John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. His father enlisted him in the United States Marine Band as an apprentice in 1868. After departing the band in 1875, Sousa learned to conduct. From 1880 until his death, he focused exclusively on conducting and the writing of music. He eventually rejoined the Marine Band and served there for 12 years as director. On leaving the Marine Band, Sousa organized his own band. Sousa aided {{in the development of}} the sousaphone, a large brass instrument similar to the helicon and tuba. At the outbreak of World War I, Sousa was commissioned as a lieutenant commander and led the Naval Reserve Band in Illinois. Following his tenure, he returned to conduct the Sousa Band until his death in 1932. In the 1920s he was promoted to lieutenant commander in the naval reserve, but never saw active service again.|$|E
