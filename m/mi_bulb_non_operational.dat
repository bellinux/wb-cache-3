40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Arusha {{municipality}} to determine the effectiveness of Board Governance in private secondary schools. The specific objectives of the study were to examine the Board structure of the private secondary school boards in Arusha and to examine the functioning of these boards of directors towards facilitating the teaching – learning process and smooth running of schools. The population of the study was all the private secondary schools in Arusha and a sample size of 40 respondents from 16 schools was selected. Purposeful sampling technique was used to select respondents. Primary data were collected using structured questionnaire while secondary data were obtained from the Regional Education Officer’s (REO) office and the Ministry of Education website.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{practice}} the set-up of multi-stage transfer presses results {{to be an}} intensive-labour and time-consuming activity which considerably contributes to the increase of <b>non</b> <b>operational</b> time of the press. Considering the high production rates of these machines when equipped with automatic transfer devices, {{as well as the}} high investments for equipment and tooling, a reduction of <b>non</b> <b>operational</b> time of the press can lead to an appreciable increase of production efficiency. A Virtual Environment has been developed and implemented for the design and test of the forging process. It consists of a set of software modules specifically devoted to assist the process designer in a set of tasks including (i) design of the forging sequence, (ii) design of components and assembly of the tooling system, and (iii) timing and setting up of the press. By this approach, the setting up of a press is moved from the operative level of the shop floor to the more decisional level of process planning, where preforms and tooling are designed. The present paper is focused on the module for timing and setting up of the press. This module assists the process designer in the off-line determination of press parameters for a specific forging task. It is based on 3 D parametric models of the objects and their animation in the working area of the press according to the kinematics of the machine. It allows a correct timing of movements of punches, ejectors, grippers and blanks without collisions and blank dropping. The virtual set-up has been applied in industrial environment and has demonstrated advantages summarised as follows: (i) easy generation and test of alternative sets of adjustment parameters, (ii) reduction of modifications of the tooling system, and (iii) considerable reduction of the time for setting up and timing of the press and, therefore, of the total lead time to manufacture...|$|R

50|$|Initially {{due to the}} {{prejudice}} encountered from male colleagues the ATA women flew <b>non</b> <b>operational</b> aircraft but by mid-1941 Marion Wilberforce was flying operational machines including Hurricanes and Spitfires which she piloted {{as a matter of}} course. The first Spitfire she flew was donated by the citizens of Grimsby and accordingly called Grimsby II. During 1942 she mastered the whole gamut of twin engined medium bombers including the Wellington and Mosquito. Two years later she became one of only eleven women pilots trained to fly four engined bombers such as the Lancaster. By the end of the War she had flown most of the one hundred and thirty aircraft flown by members of the ATA. In the early days she also had to fly civilian aircraft that had been impressed, including her own Hornet Moth which was later lost on a reconnaissance flight. Aircraft piloted by her ended up in South Africa, North East India, Ceylon, the Middle East and Russia. They were otherwise variously used for the invasion of Madagascar, for bomber crew training, anti-submarine duties, air sea rescue and the spectacular attack on the Gestapo Headquarters in Oslo in 1942. On 27 October 1944 she delivered to Armstrong Whitworth at Baginton a particularly interesting Lancaster which was to be fitted with the company's first axial flow turbojet. This was the forerunner of the modern day jet fighter. On some days she would ferry as many as four different aircraft, hopping from one aerodrome to another, and {{in the second half of}} 1944 alone she effected 114 deliveries.|$|R

In June 2006 the Ministry of Defense issued the Croatian Armed Forces Long Term Development Plan 2006-2015 (hr. Dugoročni plan razvoja Oružanih snaga Republike Hrvatske 2006-2015) in which it was stated that one of the Navy's priorities was equipping Kralj Petar Krešimir IV with new engines and anti-aircraft systems. The planned modernisation wasn't carried out, instead the ship was docked and underwent only basic maintenance during 2010.On 28 August 2008 Slobodna Dalmacija reported that certain countries were interested in buying Kralj Petar Krešimir IV, among them Georgia who lost most its fleet during the Russia-Georgia war; according to the report, the deal was stopped by Russia. Although the MoD {{declined to comment on the}} potential sale to Georgia, they did confirm that they would consider offers if any were given, as well as that the ship would remain in service until a deal was made. In 2010 frigate lieutenant Antonija Didović assumed command of Kralj Petar Krešimir IV becoming the first female commander in the Navy's history.

40|$|AbstractThe Crop Wind-Energy Experiment (CWEX) {{provides}} a platform {{to investigate the}} effect of wind turbines and large wind farms on surface fluxes of momentum, heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide (CO 2). In 2010 and 2011, eddy covariance flux stations were installed between two lines of turbines at the southwest edge of a large Iowa wind farm from late June to early September. We report changes in fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, latent heat, and CO 2 above a corn canopy after surface air had passed through a single line of turbines. In 2010, our flux stations were placed within a field with homogeneous land management practices (same tillage, cultivar, chemical treatments). We stratify the data according to wind direction, diurnal condition, and turbine operational status. Within these categories, the downwind–upwind flux differences quantify turbine influences at the crop surface. Flux differences were negligible in both westerly wind conditions and when the turbines were <b>non</b> <b>operational.</b> When the flow is perpendicular (southerly) or slightly oblique (southwesterly) to the row of turbines during the day, fluxes of CO 2 and water (H 2 O) are enhanced {{by a factor of}} five in the lee of the turbines (from three to five turbine diameter distances downwind from the tower) as compared to a west wind. However, we observe a smaller CO 2 flux increase of 30 – 40 % for these same wind directions when the turbines are off. In the nighttime, there is strong statistical significance that turbine wakes enhance upward CO 2 fluxes and entrain sensible heat toward the crop. The direction of the scalar flux perturbation seems closely associated to the differences in canopy friction velocity. Spectra and co-spectra of momentum components and co-spectra of heat also demonstrate nighttime influence of the wind turbine turbulence at the downwind station...|$|R
40|$|Central Queensland University {{offers its}} Bachelor of Engineering over three campuses, at Mackay, Rockhampton and Gladstone. First year only {{has been offered}} at Gladstone and Mackay for many years, but as of 2007, second year will be offered on all three campuses. The PBL {{philosophy}} requires that the students conduct significant work in teams. This has implications for the delivery of the expanded number of courses that must now be offered, based at one campus and delivered to all three. One of the main issues to be addressed for the students is communication. One solution being implemented is web based meetings using webcam technology. The faculty has investigated and selected an application “Click to Meet” ©, which allows the students to present, share and conference over the three sites. This will allow students {{to be part of}} a team that has members spread over the three campuses. This will allow the academic staff in each course (also spread over the three campuses) to be part of the communication process, as part of an academic team, part of the individual student teams, as well as part of the entire class team. They will not be limited to webcam. The person initiating the session, can invite any person to participate via telephone access or voice over internet, if the webcam is <b>non</b> <b>operational,</b> or away from their desk. While the faculty staff have been testing this process for six months, this technology will be trialled with the first year students, over all three campuses during the second half of 2006.
