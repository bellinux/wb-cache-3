50|$|Whilst reaching, the CE {{being set}} further back, will {{encourage}} a small craft to bear {{up into the}} wind, i.e. strong weather helm. The boat builder can compensate for this at design stage, e.g. by shifting the keel slightly aft, or having two jibs to counter the effect. The gaff-cutter {{is in fact a}} very popular sailplan for small craft. The helmsman can reduce weather helm significantly, simply by sheeting out the mainsail. Sheeting out may appear to create an inefficient belly in the sail, but it is often a pragmatic alternative to having a heavy helm. A swing keel lifted halfway is the perfect treatment for weather helm on a gaffer. The usual adjustments to <b>mast</b> <b>rake,</b> or even bowsprit length may be made to a gaffer with persistent heavy weather (or lee) helm.|$|E

Brogans typically used the same sail plan as the log canoes of the Tilghman Island region, a leg-of-mutton (i.e., triangular) foresail, mainsail and jib, with the foremast taller than the main. Both <b>masts</b> <b>raked</b> rather sharply aft, with the mainmast raked significantly more sharply than the foremast.1 ...|$|R
60|$|She {{who was my}} cradle {{in those}} years had been built on the River of Savona by a famous builder of boats, was rigged in Corsica by another good man, and was {{described}} on her papers as a 'tartane' of sixty tons. In reality, she was a true balancelle, with two short <b>masts</b> <b>raking</b> forward and two curved yards, each as long as her hull; a true child of the Latin lake, with a spread of two enormous sails resembling the pointed wings on a sea-bird's slender body, and herself, like a bird indeed, skimming rather than sailing the seas.|$|R

The batwing otter board is such a low AOA solution; incorporating a unique towing arrangement and a high aspect ratio, flexible, hydro-sail to spread trawls with minimal seabed contact. This study investigated the effects of twist and camber {{on the performance of}} two simple batwing sails in a flume tank. Six degree-of-freedom loads were measured for AOAs between 0 °and 40 °for five twist and camber combinations.

6000|$|Our Pilgrim Ship, the Silk al-Zahab, or the [...] "Golden Wire," [...] was a Sambuk, {{of about}} 400 ardebs (fifty tons), with narrow, wedge-like bows, a clean water-line, a sharp keel, and undecked, except upon the poop, which was {{high enough to}} act as a sail in a gale of wind. She carried two <b>masts,</b> <b>raking</b> imminently forwards, the main being {{considerably}} larger than the mizzen; the former was provided with a huge triangular latine, very deep in the tack, but the second sail was unaccountably wanting. She had no means of reefing, no compass, no log, no sounding lines, no spare ropes, nor even the suspicion of a chart: in her box-like cabin and ribbed hold there was something which savoured of close connection between her model and that of the Indian Toni,[FN#2] or [...] "dug-out." ...|$|R
50|$|In most situations, the H16 <b>mast</b> is <b>raked</b> {{back as far}} as possible. You {{are limited}} by the {{distance}} between the boom and the rear crossmember and the distance between the clew of the jib and the jibsheet blocks. The cut of the jib was changed in 2000 to allow further rake and low profile jib and mainsheet blocks are essential.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} periaguas or piraguas {{were the}} dugout canoes encountered by the Spanish in the Caribbean. Small craft of greater capacity {{were created by}} splitting a dugout and inserting a plank bottom, while the freeboard was increased for sea voyages by adding planks on the sides. By the 18th century the term [...] "periagua" [...] was being applied to flat-bottomed boats, which could be 30 feet (10 m) or more long and carry up to 30 men, {{with one or two}} masts, which could also be rowed. Later in the 18th century [...] "periagua" [...] became the name for a specific type of sailing rig, with gaff rigged sails on two masts that could be easily struck, commonly with the foremast raked forward and the main <b>mast</b> <b>raked</b> back. The [...] "periagua rig" [...] was used on U. S. Navy gunboats on Chesapeake Bay in the early 19th century. The term [...] "periagua" [...] was also applied to rowing scows similar to a john boat.|$|R

50|$|Decaen {{agreed to}} {{construct}} a ship to test Bouvet's ideas. In October 1807, after a six-week construction period, the patamar or felucca was ready. This vessel had two <b>masts</b> sharply <b>raked</b> forward at an angle of 23 degrees from the vertical, and 15 pairs of oars. She was armed with an 8-pounder gun and had a crew of 40 men. She was named and commissioned on 30 November 1807.|$|R
50|$|Junk sails are {{typically}} {{carried on a}} <b>mast</b> which <b>rakes</b> (slants) forward a few degrees from vertical, which can look odd to the unitiated. The forward rake of the sail encourages the sail to swing out, which makes {{the use of a}} preventer unnecessary. Another way to say this is that the sail is stable when swung out and doesn't return {{to the middle of the}} ship when the wind drops.|$|R
60|$|Here {{the most}} {{unexpected}} sights assailed us. It {{seemed to me}} as if a miraculous change had taken place on everybody and everything during the night. The ship when she had set sail was as untidy and lumbered about the decks as a merchantman usually is on quitting port. Now everything was clean, in its place, snugly fastened, and in order. The sails appeared to have undergone some modification. I fancied, too, that the <b>masts</b> <b>raked</b> aft a good deal more than they had done, and round the foot of them were ranged muskets, pistols, cutlasses, and boarding-pikes, where masses of cordage and handspikes had been before. The hencoops had vanished, and in their place were rows of brass carronades, while in the centre of the deck an enormous swivel gun occupied the place, on which the long-boat had formerly rested. Even the captain seemed to have changed. His costume was somewhat Eastern in its character, and his whole aspect was much more ferocious than when I first saw him.|$|R
2500|$|Since Munroe had {{no direct}} {{experience}} with proas, {{all he had}} to work with was the widely distributed and incorrect plan drawing from about 1742, made during Admiral Lord Anson's circumnavigation of the globe. [...] This drawing had been circulated in the press, for example in William Alden's articles in Harper's Magazine. (These were reprinted in a small book called [...] [...] This proa was one of several either captured or seen under sail when Anson stopped at Tinian during a Pacific crossing.

[...] A <b>raking</b> <b>mast</b> helps with helm balance by moving the center of effort of the sail fore and aft.|$|R
25|$|When commissioned, Explorer {{was painted}} a {{brilliant}} white, with a brown deckhouse and red funnel and masts.

50|$|The Lockwood is rigged {{with two}} pole masts, made from trimmed pine trees. The {{foremast}} is 50 ft high and 12 in in diameter, while the shorter mainmast is 46 ft high and 9 in in diameter. <b>Masts</b> are <b>raked</b> at a traditionally extreme 15 degrees, facilitating sail reefing {{and maintaining a}} steady center of force under most rigging conditions. The rake also permitted the mast {{to be used as}} a crane for unloading the hold. The fore and main masts carried baggy triangular leg of mutton sails, with a jib on the foremast to the bowsprit.|$|R
6000|$|This unusual {{visitor to}} the little bay was a very low and very long, black schooner, with tall <b>masts</b> which <b>raked</b> forward, and with {{something}} which looked {{very much like a}} black flag fluttering in its rigging. Now the truth struck into the soul of Abner. [...] "Hide yourself, Mary," [...] he whispered. [...] "It is a pirate ship!" [...] And almost at the same instant the young man and his wife laid themselves flat on the ground among the bushes, but they were very careful, each of them, to take a position which would allow them to peep out through the twigs and leaves upon the scene before them.|$|R
50|$|An S-shaped footbridge, {{supported}} by a <b>raking</b> <b>mast,</b> was built across the harbour in 2000, named Valentine Bridge. Another footbridge, named Meads Reach, was built in 2008, entirely out of stainless steel. It is covered in 55,000 perforations, which create vivid lighting effects at night. The surface was given dimples for slip resistance, but in 2015 it was coated with polyurea to provide a better non-slip surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{skipjack}} is sloop-rigged, with {{a sharply}} <b>raked</b> <b>mast</b> and extremely long boom (typically {{the same length}} as {{the deck of the}} boat). The mainsail is ordinarily triangular, though gaff rigged examples were built. The jib is self-tending and mounted on a bowsprit. This sail plan affords the power needed to pull the dredge, particularly in light winds, {{while at the same time}} minimizing the crew required to handle the boat.|$|R
60|$|But {{the vessel}} {{did not change}} her course. On she came; a fine large {{schooner}} with <b>raking</b> <b>masts,</b> and so trim and neat in her rig that she resembled a pleasure-yacht. As she drew near, Jarwin rose, and {{holding on to the}} mast, waved a piece of canvas, while Cuffy, who felt that there was now really good ground for rejoicing, wagged his tail and barked in an imbecile fashion, as if he didn't exactly know whether to laugh or cry.|$|R
50|$|The Kathryn {{carries the}} {{standard}} skipjack rig with a <b>raked</b> <b>mast,</b> 64 ft tall and 12 in in diameter, carrying a clubbed jib and a jib-headed mainsail. The mainsail is laced to the boom and {{is carried on}} wooden hoops on the mast. Unusually, the mast is topped with a gold-leafed wood ball. She has been altered from her original appearance by the features necessary to carry the pushboat. The rear of the cabin has been extended to provide better protection to the helmsman.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Chiyoda {{went into}} dry dock at Kure Naval Arsenal, where the {{locomotive}} boilers on her triple expansion steam engines were replaced with more modern Belleville boilers, and the fighting tops on her three <b>raked</b> <b>masts</b> were removed to improve stability. On {{completion of the}} retrofit in 1898, Chiyoda was re-designated a 3rd class cruiser. Later that year, during the Spanish-American War, she was based at Manila to safeguard Japanese civilians and economic interests in the Philippines. During the Boxer Rebellion, she was stationed at Taku and Yantai in northern China.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, Mulford had got the canvas spread. Forward, the Swash showed all the cloth of a full-rigged brig, even to royals and flying jib; while aft, her <b>mast</b> was the <b>raking,</b> tall, naked pole of an American schooner. There was a taunt topmast, too, {{to which a}} gaff-topsail was set, and the gear proved that she could also show, at need, a {{staysail}} {{in this part of}} her, if necessary. As the Gate was before them, however, the people had set none but the plain, manageable canvas.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{developed}} for smaller Bermudian vessels, and ultimately {{adapted to the}} larger, ocean-going Bermuda sloop, the Bermuda sail is set as the mainsail on the main mast. The Bermuda rigging has largely replaced the older gaff rigged fore-and-aft sails, except notably on schooners. The traditional design as developed in Bermuda features very tall, <b>raked</b> <b>masts,</b> a long bowsprit, and {{may or may not}} have a boom. In some configurations such as the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy vast areas of sail are achieved with this rig. Elsewhere, however, the design has omitted the bowsprit, and has otherwise become less extreme.|$|R
50|$|The lateen rig {{was also}} the {{ancestor}} of the Bermuda rig, {{by way of the}} Dutch bezaan rig. In the 16th century, when Spain ruled the Netherlands, the lateen rigs were introduced to Dutch boat builders, who soon modified the design by omitting the mast and fastening {{the lower end of the}} yard directly to the deck, the yard becoming a <b>raked</b> <b>mast</b> with a full-length, triangular (leg-of-mutton) mainsail aft. Introduced to Bermuda early in the 17th century, this developed into the Bermuda rig, which, in the 20th century, was adopted almost universally for small sailing vessels.|$|R
5000|$|Georgiana was a brig-rigged, iron hulled, {{propeller}} steamer of [...] with a jib and two heavily <b>raked</b> <b>masts,</b> {{hull and}} stack painted black. Her clipper bow sported the figurehead of a [...] "demi-woman". Georgiana was reportedly pierced for fourteen guns and could carry {{more than four}} hundred tons of cargo. She was built by the Lawrie shipyard at Glasgow - perhaps under subcontract from Lairds of Birkenhead (Liverpool) - and registered at that port in December 1862 as belonging to N. Matheson's Clyde service. The U.S. Consul at Tenerife was rightly apprehensive of her as being [...] "evidently a very swift vessel." ...|$|R
5000|$|Clara Claritas {{frames and}} outer {{planking}} were of white oak, the latter 2+1/2 in inches thick.

She had a high bow, two <b>raking</b> <b>masts,</b> schooner-rigged, and a single raked smokestack. For protection, she was armed with two steel 12-pounder (5.4 kg) Wiard boat howitzers with brass carriages.

50|$|The colony's {{lightweight}} Bermuda cedar vessels {{were widely}} prized for their agility and speed, especially upwind. The high, <b>raked</b> <b>masts</b> and long bowsprits and booms favoured in Bermuda allowed its vessels {{of all sizes}} to carry vast areas of sail when running down-wind with spinnakers and multiple jibs, allowing great speeds to be reached. Bermudian work boats, mostly small sloops, were ubiquitous on the archipelago's waters in the 19th century, moving freight, people, and everything else about. The rig was eventually adopted almost universally on small sailing craft in the 20th Century, although as seen on most modern vessels {{it is very much}} less extreme than on traditional Bermudian designs, with lower, vertical masts, shorter booms, omitted bowsprits, and much less area of canvas.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{the earlier}} brogan, the typical bugeye was two-masted, with leg-of-mutton mainsail, {{foresail}} and jib. By modern standards, this rig would {{be described as}} a ketch rig, but it appears that watermen of the time referred to it as simply a leg-of-mutton or a bugeye rig. Unlike modern ketches, the forward-most mast was referred to as the foremast and the after mast was termed the mainmast, although like the brogan and log canoe, the mainmast was shorter than the foremast. As with the earlier brogans and the log canoes, the <b>masts</b> were sharply <b>raked,</b> although they were set up with stays and shrouds. Unlike the brogan, however, the mainmast was raked only slightly more sharply than the foremast.4 [...] A bowsprit with trailboards was inevitably used.|$|R
50|$|A proa has one sail, {{and is thus}} a catboat, {{though it}} is rarely called a catboat. Both ends are alike, and the boat is sailed in either direction, {{but it has a}} fixed leeward side and a {{windward}} side. The boat is shunted from beam reach to beam reach to change direction, with the wind over the side, a low-force procedure. The bottom corner of the crabclaw sail is moved to the other end, which becomes the bow as the boat sets off back the way it came. The mast usually hinges, adjusting its <b>rake</b> (<b>mast).</b> The proa is a low-stress rig, which can be built with simple tools and low-tech materials, but it is extremely fast. On a beam reach, it may be the fastest simple rig.|$|R
50|$|The Bermuda rig, {{also known}} as a Marconi rig, refers to a {{configuration}} of mast and rigging with a triangular sail set aft of the mast with its headsail raised {{to the top of the}} mast. Its luff runs down the mast and is normally attached to the mast for its entire length. The sail's tack is attached at the base of the mast; its foot controlled by a boom; and its clew attached to the aft end of the boom, which is controlled by its sheet. In many early Bermudian vessels there were no booms, or only the outward corner of the mainsail might be attached to the boom, as is the case with Bermuda Fitted Dinghies. On traditional Bermudian designs, the <b>mast</b> was <b>raked,</b> and a long bowsprit was fitted, to which more than one jib might be fastened. This rig evolved on boats and small ships built in Bermuda throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, and had matured into its more or less modern form by the early 19th century. Although the rig became almost universally used on yachts and small boats during the 20th century, the traditional designs used in Bermuda were too demanding to sail for small or inexperienced crews, and there are few vessels outside of museums that have a traditional Bermudan rig - other than Bermuda Fitted Dinghies.|$|R
60|$|About {{three hundred}} of these vessels now lay, all crowded together, in one dense mob, at Whitehaven. The tide was out. They lay {{completely}} helpless, clear of water, and grounded. They were sooty in hue. Their black yards were deeply canted, like spears, to avoid collision. The three hundred grimy hulls lay wallowing in the mud, like {{a herd of}} hippopotami asleep in the alluvium of the Nile. Their sailless, <b>raking</b> <b>masts,</b> and canted yards, resembled a forest of fish-spears thrust into those same hippopotamus hides. Partly flanking {{one side of the}} grounded fleet was a fort, whose batteries were raised from the beach. On a little strip of this beach, {{at the base of the}} fort, lay a number of small rusty guns, dismounted, heaped together in disorder, as a litter of dogs. Above them projected the mounted cannon.|$|R
50|$|The Bermuda sloop {{is a type}} of fore-and-aft rigged {{sailing vessel}} {{developed}} on the islands of Bermuda in the 17th century. In its purest form, it is single-masted, though some ships with such rigging can be built with as many as three masts, which are also known as Schooners. Its original form had gaff rigging, but evolved to use what is now known as Bermuda rig, which had been used on smaller Bermudian boats since the early 17th century, making it the basis of nearly all modern sailing yachts. Although the Bermuda sloop is often described as a development of the narrower-beamed Jamaica sloop, which dates from the 1670s, the high, <b>raked</b> <b>masts</b> and triangular sails of the Bermuda rig are rooted in a tradition of Bermudian boat design dating from the earliest decades of the 17th century.|$|R
2500|$|Since Munroe wasn't {{aware of}} the <b>raking</b> <b>mast,</b> his 1900 model used two daggerboards set fore and aft of the mast, which would allow {{adjustment}} {{of the center of}} lateral resistance to provide helm balance. From the drawings, it appears the mast is higher as well, allowing a larger sail. The sail design also changed, with the upper spar now being slightly longer than the upper edge of the sail, and projecting past the apex slightly to allow the apex to be attached to the hull. The sail was loose footed, with the boom attached to the upper spar near the sail apex, and to the clew of the sail. His article in a 1900 issue of The Rudder included more details on the construction of his second proa. A 1948 book of sailboat plans published by The Rudder includes the following specifications for the 1900 proa: ...|$|R
