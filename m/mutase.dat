However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E

In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

The amino acid sequences of several adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzymes, the methylmalonyl coenzyme A <b>mutases</b> and glutamate <b>mutases,</b> show homology with the cobalamin-binding region of methionine synthase and retain conserved residues that are determinants for the binding of the prosthetic group, suggesting that these <b>mutases</b> and methionine synthase share common three-dimensional structures...|$|R

This frameshift affects the folding of the enzyme rendering its binding domain less effective. Patients with a complete deletion suffer an inactivation of methylmalonyl CoA <b>mutase</b> and exhibit the most sever symptoms of the deficiency, while patients with a partial mutations have a wide range of symptoms.

Nucleotide sugar <b>mutases</b> have been demonstrated to interconvert UDP-L-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) and UDP-L-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) in rice (Oryza sativa). These enzymes belong to a small gene family encoding the previously named Reversibly Glycosylated Proteins (RGPs). RGPs are plant-specific cytosolic proteins that tend to associate with the endomembrane system. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the RGP protein family consists of five closely related members. We characterized all five RGPs regarding their expression pattern and subcellular localizations in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Enzymatic activity assays of recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli identified three of the Arabidopsis RGP protein family members as UDP-L-Ara <b>mutases</b> that catalyze the formation of UDP-Araf from UDP-Arap. Coimmunoprecipitation and subsequent liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed a distinct interaction network between RGPs in different Arabidopsis organs. Examination of cell wall polysaccharide preparations from RGP 1 and RGP 2 knockout mutants showed a significant reduction in total L-Ara content (12 - 31 %) compared with wild-type plants.

Preliminary phylogenetic studies indicated that At- 74 cDNA and its close homologue in Arabidopsis, At- 74 H, belong, however, to an equally distinct group. At- 74 was ubiquitously expressed in vegetative organs and induced by glucose. The At- 74 cDNA was overexpressed in A. thaliana to investigate its function, but this overexpression did not result in a clear phenotype. Enzymatic assays performed on At- 74 -overproducing transgenic plants or E. coli cells showed no increase in either the activities of cofactor-dependent and -independent phosphoglycerate <b>mutases</b> (i-PGMases) and F 2, 6 Pase or that of acid phosphatases. The possible role of At- 74 in plant metabolism was further investigated by carbon partitioning experiments with [U- 14 C] glucose and measurements of soluble sugars in both young leaves and roots. Two overexpressing At- 74 lines showed a clear increase in glucose uptake. This paper introduces the At- 74 homologue of the d-PGMase superfamily members and supports a possible role of At- 74 in carbohydrate metabolism. © The Author [2005].

TIGAR is a fructose bisphosphatase which activates p53, in results of inhibiting the expression of glucose transporter and also regulating the expression of hexokinase and phosphoglycerate <b>mutase.</b> TIGAR also inhibit the Phosphofructokinase (PFK) by lowering the level of fructose-2,6,bisphosphate, therefore, glycolysis is inhibited and pentose phosphate pathway is promoted.|$|E
25|$|The {{final product}} of methylmalonyl-CoA <b>mutase</b> {{activity}} is succinyl-CoA {{which is a}} tricarboxylic acid cycle substrate. A side effect of excess methylmalonyl-CoA is an interruption of the enzymes responsible for other transformations earlier in the metabolism of propionyl-CoA, leading to propanoic acidemia as well. This, along with an excess of methylmalonyl-CoA leads to the depletion of ATP through oxidative stress and coenzyme A. This disrupts the biosynthesis of myelin, urea, and glucose. Specifically, excess methylmalonyl-CoA places oxidative stress on the mitochondrial enzymes involved in the urea cycle (such as ammonia-dependent-carbamoyl-phosphate synthase or CPS1), and inhibits its mechanism of action. The combination of inhibited urea synthesis and poor protein metabolism, {{as well as a}} weakly replenished tricarboxylic acid cycle contribute to the symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia.|$|E

Methods/Principal Findings: To examine the distribution of PGM NISE throughout the Bacteria, and gain insight into the evolutionary processes that shape their phyletic profiles, we searched bacterial genome sequences {{for the presence of}} dPGM and iPGM.

The use of many additional hydrogen bonds has several putative purposes. The stabilization of multiple hydrogen bonds to the enzyme helps overcome the entropic cost of binding. Additionally, the interactions help hold the substrate in a reactive conformation, and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction has near-zero entropy of activation, while typical Claisen rearrangements in solution have very negative entropies of activation.|$|E

As a result, the reduced form of adenosylcobalamin has been suggested to participate in B 12 catalysis and an alternate mechanism for explaining the origin of catalysis in adenosylcobalamin-dependent <b>mutases</b> has been proposed. The implications of the involvement of the reduced B 12 cofactor in the initial step of B 12 catalysis that involve Co-C 52 ̆ 7 cleavage and subsequent hydrogen atom abstraction from the substrate has been computationally studied by means of density functional calculations. The energetic demands of the reaction {{have been found to be}} significantly lowered when the reaction is mediated by the one-electron reduced form of the cofactor. During the second part of this dissertation, an unprecedented Co 1 + ion induced H-bonding interaction (Co 1 + [...] H) has been computationally validated. The H-bond forming capacity of Co 1 + ion that is a dominant d 8 configuration has been suggested to be rooted in the availability of appropriately oriented filled d-orbitals which can serve as H-bond acceptors to interact with the acidic ends of the axial ligands. Because of a Co 1 + [...] H interaction, cob(l) alamin, a Co 1 + ion-based ubiquitous B 12 intermediate, has been suggested to be a pentacoordinated square pyramidal or hexacoordinated octahedral complex in addition to its commonly accepted tetracoordinated square planar geometry. In specific, the QM/MM calculations on methionine synthase-bound cob(l) alamin (PDB-code: 3 IVA @ 2. 2 A resolution; 1 BMT @ 3. 0 A resolution) has provided the convincing evidence of an enzyme-induced Co 1 + [...] H interaction. The Co 1 + [...] H interaction exerts an anodic shift upon the reduction potential of the Co 2 +/Co 1 + process which is a common chemical event in a large family of methyltransferases and ATP:corrinoid adenosyltransferases. Building upon these insights, an alternate mechanistic pathway for the enzyme-induced Co 2 +/Co 1 + redox process has been suggested that is mediated by the square pyramidal cob(l) alamin rather than its square planar form...|$|R
