5|$|The Canadian Official Historian, C. P. Stacey {{wrote that}} several Canadian {{formations}} reported {{an increase in}} morale. Wilmot wrote that the bombing was essential because it raised the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the Second Army and depressed that of the German defenders.|$|E

5|$|As general Yang Pu {{returned}} north {{with his}} soldiers after the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, he requested the emperor's permission to annex Dongyue. The emperor refused after {{he considered the}} <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the troops. Zou Yushan had promised to supply an army to assist the Han in their war against the Nanyue. The army never arrived and Zou blamed the weather conditions, while secretly maintaining a diplomatic relationship with Nanyue.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, {{so as to avoid}} any panic within Muslim ranks.|$|E
5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that both sides were more evenly matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E

5|$|The American colonists {{met their}} goal of {{strengthening}} {{the siege of}} Boston by removing livestock and hay on those islands from {{the reach of the}} British regulars. The British armed schooner Diana was also destroyed and its weaponry was appropriated by the Colonial side. This was the first naval capture of the war, and it was a significant boost to the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the Colonial forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy {{toll on the}} Patriots. When they {{evacuated}} their forts, {{they were forced to}} leave behind critical supplies and munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the remaining troops was low. Few believed that they could win the war and gain independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees {{in front of the}} defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the Union troops stationed at Suffolk. This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|The victory {{lifted the}} <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the Christian princes of Europe and was {{recognized}} as a great victory over the Muslim Ottoman Empire. On the Ottoman side, Murad realized the effect Skanderbeg's rebellion would have on his realm and continued to take measures to defeat him, resulting in twenty-five years of war.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{initially}} {{estimated that}} they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees. Orde-Lees was not a popular man, and his presence apparently did little to improve the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.|$|E

The charity {{provides}} comforts {{of home and}} works to lift the spirits and <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> injured US troops and offers support to military families.

25|$|Since {{the peace}} accords Guatemala has had both {{economic}} growth and successive democratic elections, most recently in 2015. In the 2015 elections, Jimmy <b>Morales</b> <b>of</b> the National Convergence Front won the presidency. He assumed office on 14 January 2016.|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{was named after}} Richard M. Woodhull, the original landowner of the immediate area and credited with having laid out the Village of Williamsburg into an actual city. The name was proposed by middle school student, Victor <b>Morales,</b> <b>of</b> Intermediate School 318.|$|R
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
5|$|Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs {{repelled}} {{their attacks}} multiple times. With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered {{his men to}} join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the battle}} was over and Radzymin was secure, the Soviet forces {{continued}} to threaten the Polish northern flank. In {{the early hours of}} August 16 the Russians mounted yet another assault on Radzymin, reinforced by several armoured cars and led personally by the commanding officer of the 27th Rifle Division, Vitovt Putna. However, by this time the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the 27th Division was already broken, and the assault was easily thwarted by the Polish infantry and the three remaining operational FT tanks. The armoured cars withdrew as soon as the Polish tanks opened fire, and the Russian infantry followed.|$|E
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews {{were assigned to the}} same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Tallon's finger injury, Saggers made his Test debut in the Fourth Test, which started at Headingley on 22 July 1948. As England made 496runs in their first innings, Saggers took catches to remove Denis Compton for 23, caught down the leg side, and Jim Laker for four. During the innings, Saggers was noted by Fingleton for {{maintaining}} a quiet presence behind the stumps, whereas Tallon was characteristically known for loudly appealing {{in concert with the}} bowler when he was playing. Fingleton felt that Saggers' failure to appeal dampened the <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the bowlers, who were vocally supported by Tallon in the other four Tests. Australia conceded 496 runs but Saggers leaked only two byes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film has}} been well {{received}} by critics.
