500|$|In 2012, Gilmour and Mason {{decided to}} revisit {{recordings}} made with Wright, mainly during the Division Bell sessions, {{to create a}} new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and [...] "generally harness studio technology". Waters was not involved. Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: [...] "I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing {{was at the heart of}} the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> special player he was." ...|$|E
500|$|F-Zero {{has been}} {{credited}} with being the game that set a standard for the racing genre and inventing the [...] "futuristic racing" [...] subgenre of video gaming. IGN credits the game for having inspired the future creation of numerous racing games inside {{and out of the}} futuristic subgenre, including the Wipeout series and Daytona USA. Amusement Vision's President, Toshihiro Nagoshi, stated in 2002 that F-Zero [...] "actually taught <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> game should be" [...] and that it served as an influence for him to create Daytona USA and other racing games. Amusement Vision collaborated with Nintendo to develop F-Zero GX and AX, with Nagoshi serving as one of the co-producers for these games.|$|E
500|$|F-Zero GX and AX was {{the first}} {{significant}} video game collaboration between Nintendo and Sega. After Sega transited from first to third-party development in 2001, the two companies developed a close relationship and worked together on F-Zero GX and AX. Amusement Vision president, Toshihiro Nagoshi, was working on Super Monkey Ball for GameCube which opened up {{the opportunity for a}} collaboration between the two companies. Since Sega helped to develop Nintendo's Triforce arcade system, the company wanted to support it with software that would [...] "stand out and draw attention to Nintendo's platform." [...] Nagoshi was suggested to develop a driving game and agreed under the stipulation he could come up with something unique—which was working on the next installment in Nintendo's F-Zero series. During its development, Nagoshi focused on what he called the self-explanatory [...] "Interface" [...] of the game, and [...] "Rhythm"—to give the way the tracks are laid out a rhythmic feel. Miyamoto stated [...] " [...] have gained a lot of fans among current game developers, including famous producers like Mr. Nagoshi who grew up playing Nintendo games and are big fans of some of our titles." [...] In 2002, Nagoshi claimed that 1991's F-Zero [...] "actually taught <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> game should be" [...] and that it served as an influence for him to create Daytona USA and other racing games. Before development started on F-Zero GX and AX, he mentioned abandoning the project due to personal pressures he faced to make a great impression on Nintendo and personal admiration of an established franchise. Still the announcement that Nintendo had handled development of one of its franchises to former competitor Sega came as a surprise to some critics.|$|E

2500|$|On March 17, 1974, García {{was visiting}} {{with some friends}} in her apartment. Medrano also had a guest, with whom he was smoking marijuana. Louie Castillo and Miguel Jimenez, Soledad locals and acquaintances of Medrano, arrived {{in a state of}} {{inebriation}} to purchase heroin from Medrano. They began harassing García and her friends, who left García and the others at the apartment. Soon an argument arose between Medrano and Castillo, who was envious of Medrano's status as the primary drug connection in Soledad and was resentful that an [...] "outsider" [...] had become so successful. The argument became physical, and Medrano was winning the fight (Castillo was a wiry seventeen-year-old) until the 300-pound Jimenez intervened, beating Medrano and threatening him with a knife. Jimenez and Castillo took García to an alley behind the building where Jimenez restrained and Castillo raped her, according to García's testimony, [...] "to show <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> hometown boy was." [...] The two men left the scene for a neighbor's house. Shortly after arriving, they (or someone else) called the García-Medrano residence, laughing, taunting, and threatening García's life if she did not leave town. García armed herself with her son's [...]22 rifle and she and Medrano drove the six blocks to the residence where Castillo and Jimenez were located. Accounts vary as to precisely what occurred next, but by most of them, Jimenez again brandished his knife and García shot him. Castillo, meanwhile, escaped into a nearby park. Medrano and García continued to the home of the two friends that had visited her earlier, and when police arrived, she surrendered to them without incident.|$|E
