5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese made <b>more</b> <b>threatening</b> {{phone calls}} to the embassy. A second bomb {{exploded}} at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants {{will try to}} appear <b>more</b> <b>threatening</b> by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, <b>more</b> <b>threatening</b> creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|On October18, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued along the Mexican coastline from Zihuatanejo, Guerrero to Manzanillo, Colima, and {{a tropical}} storm watch extended northward to La Fortuna, Mexico, as Kiko was forecast to make landfall in that region on October21. Above-normal tides and dangerous waves were expected along the coast. Rainfall totals of 4inches (100millimetres) to 7in (180mm) were possible over southwestern Mexico with isolated totals reaching 10in (250mm). As a precaution, port captains shut down shipping and advised residents to avoid low-lying areas that might flood. Civil Defense advised these residents to move to temporary shelters and tourists were told to stay indoors. Emergency procedures were on standby in case conditions became <b>more</b> <b>threatening.</b>|$|E
5|$|Theophilos now sent {{a second}} embassy to the caliph, {{headed by the}} tourmarches of Charsianon, Basil, bearing gifts and an apologetic letter, and {{offering}} to ransom the high-ranking prisoners for 20,000 Byzantine pounds (about 6,500kg) of gold and to release all Arabs held captive by the Byzantines. In reply, Mu'tasim refused the ransom, saying that the expedition alone had cost him over 100,000 pounds, and demanded the surrender of Theophobos and the Domestic of the Schools, Manuel the Armenian, who had some years ago deserted from Arab service. The Byzantine ambassador refused to comply to this and indeed could not, as Theophobos was in revolt and Manuel had died, according to some accounts, from wounds received at Anzen. Instead, Basil handed over a second, much <b>more</b> <b>threatening</b> letter by Theophilos. Mu'tasim, angered by this, returned the emperor's gifts.|$|E
5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and <b>more</b> <b>threatening</b> by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E
40|$|The {{geographic}} distribution, community distribution, taxonomy, {{and growth}} {{form of the}} flora listed as threatened under Schedules 1 and 2 of the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 were examined. The North Coast and Central Coast Botanical Divisions have {{the highest number of}} threatened plant species, with both these divisions having significantly <b>more</b> <b>threatened</b> plant species than expected. A large disparity between the east and the west of the state was found, with the eastern divisions generally containing larger numbers and higher proportions of threatened plant species than the western divisions. Rainforest, sclerophyll forest and sclerophyll woodland communities were all found to contain large numbers of threatened plant species, with woodland containing <b>more</b> <b>threatened</b> plant species than expected. Some large families and genera contain significantly <b>more</b> <b>threatened</b> plant species than expected (e. g. Myrtaceae, Proteaceae, Grevillea and Zieria), while others contain significantly fewer (e. g. Asteraceae, Poaceae and Cyperaceae). The analysis of habit showed that fewer than expected threatened plant species were herbs. Possible explanations for the apparent distribution of threatened flora are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} sex drive can be {{regarded}} as a fundamental correlate of individual differences in mating strategies, and that it modulates men's tendencies to engage in intrasexual competition. We expected that men with a high sex drive would be <b>more</b> <b>threatened</b> by a rival in a sexual context than in a commitment context, whereas men with a low sex drive would be <b>more</b> <b>threatened</b> by a rival in a commitment context. Male participants were subliminally primed with either sex-related or commitment-related words, and then confronted with a romantic rival. The results confirm expectations and are discussed in light of other research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Arsenal {{began to}} play with purpose once going behind, {{but for the rest}} of the half {{struggled}} to get the better of Luton's defence. A long ball by Davis sent Rocastle charging forward in the 16th minute, and momentarily upset Luton's shape, but it was caught by Dibble. The Luton goalkeeper was again called into action when Arsenal were awarded a set piece; Sansom slid the ball to Nigel Winterburn, whose shot was gathered. Foster made a timely challenge on Davis on the edge of the penalty area to end another Arsenal attack; Graham's team had been <b>more</b> <b>threatening</b> on right-hand flank with Rocastle and Winterburn. Harford, who had been a long figure up front for Luton, still managed to trouble the Arsenal defence with little service; near the end of the first half, he collected a pass from the left, bypassed his marker Adams and aimed his shot at goal, which went wide of the right-hand post.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its formation, forecasters {{determined}} that Fern might loop around in the Gulf of Mexico and it was <b>more</b> <b>threatening</b> to land than Hurricane Edith which was also projected to hit the Gulf Coast. On September 9, as Fern was becoming organized, forecasters issued a hurricane watch along the Texas coast, anticipating that Fern might strengthen into a hurricane. In addition, small boats were warned to stay in port and residents were advised to be aware of storm conditions brought by Fern. The next day, the hurricane watches were changed to warnings, forcing residents living on the Texas coast to board up and evacuate. In preparation for the storm's impact, Civil Defense workers and the American Red Cross were put on alert. In Galveston, eight emergency shelters were planned to open but five were closed when officials learned that they were not needed as most residents chose to ride out the storm in their homes. When Fern moved inland, the National Weather Service issued 21 tornado warnings and numerous flood warnings. In North Beach, city buses were used to transport evacuees inland and local officials were concerned {{about what to do with}} the relief trailers used to house survivors of Hurricane Celia a year earlier.|$|E
5|$|Standard Oil {{moved its}} {{headquarters}} to New York City at 26 Broadway, and Rockefeller became {{a central figure}} in the city's business community. He bought a residence in 1884 on 54th Street near the mansions of other magnates such as William Henry Vanderbilt. Despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity, Rockefeller took the new elevated train to his downtown office daily. In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, but by then Standard depended more on pipeline transport. <b>More</b> <b>threatening</b> to Standard's power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to {{the breakup of the}} Standard Oil trust. Ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state anti-trust laws, and finally forced a separation of Standard Oil of Ohio {{from the rest of the}} company in 1892, the first step in the dissolution of the trust.|$|E

5|$|When {{directly}} threatened, many mantis species {{stand tall}} and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem larger and <b>more</b> <b>threatening,</b> with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs {{and attempt to}} pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward {{the safety of the}} ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.|$|E

Abd-Ashirta and his son Aziru, at first afraid of the Hittites, afterwards made a treaty with their king, and joining with the Hittites, attacked and conquered the districts remaining loyal to Egypt. In vain did Rib-Hadda send touching appeals for aid to the distant Pharaoh, who was far too engaged in his religious innovations to attend to such messages.|$|E

Children were warned against saying the names, lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a person—sometimes to be killed.

25|$|Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001), {{directed}} by Christophe Gans, {{is a popular}} feature film based on the legend. The film took several creative liberties {{in order to make}} the story more interesting to a general audience. Rather than a wolf or wolf-dog crossbreed, the movie portrays the creature as the offspring of a lion crossbred with another unknown big cat, equipped with armor to make it seem <b>more</b> <b>threatening.</b> The Beast is the instrument of the film's eponymous secret organisation, which attempts to undermine public confidence in the king and ultimately take over the country by stating that the Beast is a divine punishment for the King's indulgence of the modern embrace of science over religion.|$|E
25|$|Though {{aggression}} {{can occur}} within groups, the response towards intruders of another species {{is much more}} drastic and can involve a sexual dimorphism in displays. Females typically employ scent-marking intruder response tactics, whereas males {{are more prone to}} vocalizing threats, physical aggression, and piloerection. Scent-marking in cotton-top tamarins is done in two ways: either using anogenital scent-marking, or suprapubic scent-marking. The ability to use both of these separate glandular fields for threat signals may indicate females have developed diverging evolutionary threats through differential use of these markings. These variable signals may be used to sign a territorial encounter, or serve as a reproductive signal. The intensity of female threats are generally comparable when directed at intruders of either genders. In contrast, male cotton-tops are considerably <b>more</b> <b>threatening</b> towards fellow males than towards females.|$|E
