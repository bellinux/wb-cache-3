In the modern cosmological models, most energy in the universe is in forms that have never been detected directly, namely dark energy and dark matter. There have been several controversial proposals to remove the need for these enigmatic forms of matter and energy, by modifying the laws governing gravity and the dynamics of cosmic expansion, for example <b>modified</b> <b>Newtonian</b> <b>dynamics.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Whittaker's {{claims were}} criticized by Gerald Holton (1960, 1973). He {{argued that there}} are {{fundamental}} differences between the theories of Einstein on one hand, and Poincaré and Lorentz on the other hand. Einstein radically reformulated the concepts of space and time, and by that removed [...] "absolute space" [...] and thus the stationary luminiferous aether from physics. On the other hand, Holton argued that Poincaré and Lorentz still adhered to the stationary aether concept, and tried only to <b>modify</b> <b>Newtonian</b> <b>dynamics,</b> not to replace it. Holton argued, that [...] "Poincaré's silence" [...] (i.e., why Poincaré never mentioned Einstein's contributions to relativity) was due to their fundamentally different conceptual viewpoints. Einstein's views on space and time and the abandonment of the aether were, according to Holton, not acceptable to Poincaré, therefore the latter only referred to Lorentz as {{the creator of the}} [...] "new mechanics". Holton also pointed out that although Poincaré's 1904 St. Louis speech was [...] "acute and penetrating" [...] and contained a [...] "principle of relativity" [...] that is confirmed by experience and needs new development, it did not [...] "enunciate a new relativity principle". He also alluded to mistakes of Whittaker, like predating Lorentz's 1904 paper (published April 1904) to 1903.|$|R
40|$|We {{look for}} {{observational}} signatures that could discriminate between <b>Newtonian</b> and <b>modified</b> <b>Newtonian</b> (MOND) <b>dynamics</b> in the Milky Way, {{in view of}} the advent of large astrometric and spectroscopic surveys. Indeed, a typical signature of MOND is an apparent disk of "phantom" dark matter, which is uniquely correlated with the visible disk-density distribution. Due to this phantom dark disk, Newtonian models with a spherical halo have different signatures from MOND models close to the Galactic plane. The models can thus be differentiated by measuring dynamically (within <b>Newtonian</b> <b>dynamics)</b> the disk surface density at the solar radius, the radial mass gradient within the disk, or the velocity ellipsoid tilt angle above the Galactic plane. Using the most realistic possible baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we predict that, if MOND applies, the local surface density measured by a Newtonist will be approximately 78 Msun/pc 2 within 1. 1 kpc of the Galactic plane, the dynamically measured disk scale-length will be enhanced by a factor of 1. 25 with respect to the visible disk scale-length, and the local vertical tilt of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpc above the plane will be approximately 6 degrees. None of these tests can be conclusive for the present-day accuracy of Milky Way data, but they will be of prime interest with the advent of large surveys such as GAIA. Comment: 5 page...|$|R

40|$|The {{observed}} {{matter in}} the universe accounts for just 5 % of the observed gravity. A {{possible explanation is that}} Newton’s and Einstein’s theories of gravity fail where gravity is either weak or enhanced. The <b>modified</b> theory of <b>Newtonian</b> <b>dynamics</b> (MOND) reproduces, without dark matter, spiral-galaxy orbital motions and the relation between luminosity and rotation in galaxies, although not in clusters. Recent extensions of Einstein’s theory are theoretically more complete. They inevitably include dark fields that seed structure growth, and they may explain recent weak lensing data.
