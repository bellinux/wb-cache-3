25|$|Most of the {{vineyard}} soils {{in the region}} {{date back to the}} Jurassic period of 195-135 million BC when the entire Burgundy region was part of a large inland sea. This left a foundation of predominately limestone made from the skeletal fragments of the marine life that once roamed this sea. The marlstone of the region is made up of the <b>marl,</b> <b>clay,</b> sand and gravel fragments that came from the weathering of old mountain chains in the area such as the Ardennes.

500|$|Five {{geologic}} formations make up {{the southern}} portion of Florida: the Tamiami Formation, Caloosahatchee Formation, Anastasia Formation, Miami Limestone (or Miami Oolite), and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Tamiami Formation is a compression of highly permeable light colored fossiliferous sands and pockets of quartz, [...] thick. It is named for the Tamiami Trail that follows the upper bedrock of the Big Cypress Swamp, and underlies the southern portion of the Everglades. Between the Tamiami Formation and Lake Okeechobee is the Caloosahatchee Formation, named for the river over it. Much less permeable, this formation is highly calcitic and is composed of sandy shell <b>marl,</b> <b>clay,</b> and sand. Water underneath the Caloosahatchee Formation is typically very mineralized. Both the Tamiami and Caloosahatchee Formations developed during the Pliocene Epoch.|$|E

5000|$|Marlton {{was founded}} by Welsh and English farmers {{beginning}} in 1676. The name Marlton {{first appeared in the}} early 19th century. The name is derived from <b>marl</b> <b>clay,</b> which is commonly found in the local soil. The discovery of the marl content helped local business and farmers, and caused the first [...] "building boom", occurring in the 1830s and 1840s. Marl continued to be excavated in Marlton until 1930, when the pits were shut down. The marl was sold locally, and shipped directly, by rail to Burlington City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Atlantic City, for reshipping as an alternate for green manure, water treatment amendment, and semi-flowable fill.|$|E

In recent decades, in the east of the area revealed a minor recoverable oil reserves and deposits of bentonite clays. In the area is the largest in Europe Vyatsko-Kama deposit of phosphate rock.

40|$|The Miocene {{sedimentary}} {{sequences of}} Greece {{are represented by}} both continental and marine deposits and present an intense synsedimentary tectonism. The continental sediments predominate mainly {{in the eastern part}} of Greece, consisting of dark marls with important lignite deposits, clays and conglomerates. The marine sediments, outcropping mainly along the Western Greek coastal zone and the nearby Ionian Islands, consist of limestones, <b>marls,</b> <b>clays</b> and gypsum. The Miocene basins are usually bounded by major normal faults while minor faults affect basin infillings. In this work, the most extended and significant Miocene deposits of the Greek territory have been studied, using a number of 1230 rock samples collected from outcrops and boreholes drilled during lignite investigations. An effort is made to specify more precisely the vegetational development during the Miocene and the changes due to climatic fluctuations reflected in the pollen records...|$|R
40|$|The {{central part}} of the Piave River valley in the Venetian pre-Alps of NE Italy exposes an {{expanded}} and continuous marine sediment succession that encompasses the Paleocene series and the Paleocene to Eocene transition. The Paleocene through lowermost Eocene succession is > 100 m thick and was deposited at middle to lower bathyal depths in a hemipelagic, near-continental setting in the central western Tethys. In the Forada section, the Paleocene succession of limestone-marl couplets is sharply interrupted by an ~ 3. 30 m-thick unit of <b>clays</b> and <b>marls</b> (<b>clay</b> <b>marl</b> unit). The very base of this unit represents the biostratigraphic Paleocene-Eocene boundary, and the entire unit coincides with the main carbon isotope excursion of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum event. Concentrations of hematite and biogenic carbonate, delta 13 C measurements, and abundance of radiolarians, all oscillate in a cyclical fashion and are interpreted to represent precession cycles. The main excursion interval spans five complete cycles, that is, 105 ± 10 k. y. The overlying carbon isotope recovery interval, which is composed of six distinct limestone-marl couplets, is interpreted to represent six precessional cycles with a duration of 126 ± 12 k. y. The entire carbon isotope excursion interval in Forada has a total duration of ~ 231 ± 22 k. y., which is 5 %– 10 % longer than previous estimates derived from open ocean sites (210 – 220 k. y.). Geochemical proxies for redox conditions indicate oxygenated conditions before, during, and after the carbon isotope excursion event. The Forada section exhibits a nonstepped sharp decrease in delta 13 C (- 2. 35 ‰) {{at the base of the}} <b>clay</b> <b>marl</b> unit. The hemipelagic, near-continental depositional setting of Forada and the sharply elevated sedimentation rates throughout the <b>clay</b> <b>marl</b> unit argue for continuous rather than interrupted deposition and show that the initial nonstepped carbon isotope shift was not caused by a hiatus. A single sample at the base of the unit lacks biogenic carbonate. Preservation of carbonate thereafter improves progressively up-section in the <b>clay</b> <b>marl</b> unit, which is consistent with a prodigiously abrupt and rapid acidifi cation of the oceans followed by a slower, successive deepening of the carbonate compensation depth. Increased sedimentation rates through the <b>clay</b> <b>marl</b> unit (approximately the main interval of the carbon isotope excursion) are consistent with an intensified hydrological cycle driven by supergreenhouse conditions and enhanced weathering and transport of terrigenous material to this near-continental, hemipelagic environment in the central western Tethys. The sharp transition in lithology from the <b>clay</b> <b>marl</b> unit to the overlying limestone-marl couplets in the recovery interval and the coincident shift toward heavier delta 13 C values suggest that the silicate pump and continental weathering, the cause of the enhanced terrigenous flux to Forada, stopped abruptly. This implies that the source of the light CO 2 ceased to be added to the ocean-atmosphere system at the top of the <b>clay</b> <b>marl</b> unit...|$|R
40|$|North from Lisbon (Fig. 1). The basin {{is part of}} a Meso-Cenozoic {{sedimentary}} {{unit and}} is generally composed by Kimmeridgian limestones (12 % of the study area), and <b>marls</b> and <b>clays</b> (81 % of the study area). The geological structure is anticline with a NE-SW direction. The central part of this structure is strongly eroded and corresponds to a basin tailed on <b>marls</b> and <b>clays</b> and dominated by limestone cliffs high 5 to 15 meters. The slope profile is gener-ally concave, being sometimes interrupted by small platforms associated to the intercalation of sand-stones within the <b>marls</b> and <b>clays</b> unit. Slope gradi-ent is mostly moderated (5 °- 15 º on 50 % of the area), with the exception of cliffs where it is higher than 25 º. The basin (4 th order according to Strahler hierarchy) is drained by the Sangue River, the only permanent stream, with a drainage density of 4 km/km 2. The geomorphological mapping of the area allows the identification of 105 slope movements (15. 8 per km 2). The total unstable area is around 94, 000 m 2 (1. 4 % of the total area). Landslides were classified into five categories according to typology (Table 1) : rotational slides, soil falls/slides due to bank erosion, shallow translational slides, complex slope move-ments and undefined movements (old movements without clear topographical signs). 32 of the total slope movements occurred during the last period o...|$|R
