25|$|Goodwin Heart Pine's {{specialties}} include antique river-recovered heart {{pine and}} heart cypress, antique heart pine, wild black cherry and precision-engineered wood, flooring, stair parts and <b>millwork.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} a family {{endeavor}} from the beginning, with brothers Bob, Ed, Tom and Charles all contributing to the growing business. In 1951, the company’s in-house <b>millwork</b> shop was established and, four years later, Nabholz Construction was incorporated {{in the state of}} Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|The {{company had}} a data breach in September 2014. One {{major reason for}} the data breach was the {{practice}} of entering credit card numbers directly into computers at the service-desk and pro-desk, and in specialty departments including flooring, kitchen cabinets, appliances, and <b>millwork,</b> rather than using POS credit card terminals directly. The practice was stopped, and Home Depot offered a year of free credit monitoring through AllClearID for any customers who requested it. There were also reports of credit card numbers being stolen when used to make purchases on Homedepot.com.|$|E
25|$|Ceiling medallions, cornices, {{staircase}} <b>millwork,</b> and fireplace {{designs were}} individualized features, chosen from home order catalogs. Most of the wrought or cast ironwork {{in the neighborhood}} {{was made in the}} Hayward-Bartlett Factory near the B Yards to the south of the neighborhood. The buildings were brick and low-scale – no more than three stories except for some commercial buildings. Evenly spaced doorsteps, windows, and doors, as well as continuous rooflines create the visual rhythms for which Baltimore rowhouses are noted. Although residential construction ended in the 1880s, commercial building continued into the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Kenmore also hosts one of {{the last}} {{industrial}} ports on Lake Washington, {{at the mouth of the}} Sammamish River. Larger local businesses near the port include Rinker Materials's Kenmore plant, Kenmore Ready-Mix (cements and asphalts, a division of Glacier Northwest), Pacific Topsoils (topsoils and landscape construction materials), Michael Homchick Stoneworks (stone fabrication and installation), Plywood Supply (lumber, plywood, and <b>millwork,</b> wholesale, retail, and company headquarters), and several others. As home to the James G. Murphy Company, {{one of the}} ten largest commercial/industrial auction houses in the United States, the city is also an auction center.|$|E
25|$|Goodwin Heart Pine is {{a company}} located in Micanopy, Florida and specializes in {{reclaiming}} antique heart pine and heart cypress from rivers and old buildings to produce lumber for flooring, stair parts and <b>millwork.</b> Goodwin's product range also includes other sustainable and rare woods, including wild black cherry. Goodwin Heart Pine also produces precision-engineered wood flooring, from these specialty woods. The company has a unique focus of harvesting resin-saturated deadhead logs from rivers that loggers felled in the 1800s, which sank due to their high resin content. The interior of the reclaimed logs is typically preserved by the tree's resin.|$|E
2500|$|Shipping labels: Often {{found on}} the back of <b>millwork</b> like {{baseboard}} molding or door and window trim, shipping labels associated with Sears may indicate that the home is a Sears Catalog house. Most of the <b>millwork</b> was fulfilled by the Sears-owned [...] "Norwood Sash and Door Company" [...] of Cincinnati, Ohio. However, building materials like <b>millwork</b> could be purchased separately from Sears so <b>millwork</b> with shipping labels is not, by itself, a definitive indicator of a Sears Catalog house.|$|E
2500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Barber {{was the first to}} sell prefabricated houses in crates, but {{there is no evidence that}} he was actually engaged in manufacturing. [...] While he occasionally supplied builders with manufactured windows, doors, staircases and other components, and that a number of <b>millwork</b> companies advertised in Barber's magazine, it is unclear whether entire houses were sold as kits by anyone prior to 1900.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{the triple}} Xs {{made a huge}} comeback. [...] When the old horse stables were {{converted}} from the Jersey Lilly into the Pearl Stable by Silver Ventures, the “xXx” was a massive part of the building’s motif. [...] The triple Xs were incorporated into {{areas such as the}} chandeliers, the <b>millwork</b> above all the doors, massive bronze plagues above the stage and around the mezzanine, in the custom carpet, and even the rafter bracing. [...] At almost every event, the audience is dared to count all the sets of triple Xs.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{especially}} important to get the hand and swing correct on exterior doors, as the transom is usually sloped and sealed to resist water entry, and to properly drain. [...] In some custom <b>millwork</b> (or with some master carpenters), the manufacture or installer will bevel the leading edge (the first edge to meet the jamb as the door is closing) so that the door fits tight without binding. [...] Specifying an incorrect hand or swing will cause the door to bind, not close properly or leak (for exterior doors). Fixing this specification error will be expensive or time consuming.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{carpentry}} industry, {{the timber}} {{is referred to}} as satin walnut [...] {{and is one of the}} most important materials for plywood manufacturers. It is used for furniture, interior trim, railroad ties, cigar boxes, crates, flooring, barrels, woodenware, and wood pulp. It is also used for veneer for plywood. The wood is very compact and fine-grained, the heartwood being reddish, and, when cut into planks, marked transversely with blackish belts. Sweetgum is used principally for lumber, veneer, plywood, slack cooperage, fuel, and pulpwood. The lumber is made into boxes and crates, furniture, cabinets for radios, televisions, and phonographs, interior trim, and <b>millwork.</b> The veneer and plywood, (typically backed with some other kind of wood which shrinks and warps less) are used for boxes, pallets, crates, baskets, and interior woodwork. [...] It was formerly used in the interior finish of railroad sleeping cars. Being readily dyed black, it is sometimes substituted for ebony for such uses as inexpensive picture frames.|$|E
2500|$|To {{continue}} {{providing for}} the family after the fire, Nist and sons established the Queen City Box Manufacturing company and began production in October 1889. The original Queen City Manufacturing facility was next to the Nist family home {{on the shore of}} Lake Union. The company started slowly, and according to the Seattle City Directory three of Nist's sons, Michael, Jacob J., and John were also employed in 1890 by Skookum Manufacturing Company, another local sawmill. The company made <b>millwork,</b> sashes and door frames. The Nists incorporated the company two years into production, in November 1891, with $10,000 capital, 100 shares at $100 each. The company objectives were to [...] "manufacture, buy, sell and deal in all kinds of lumber, sashes, doors, window blinds, molding, stairs, stair rails and banisters, and all kinds of woodwork and finishing material−to operate sawmills, sash and door factories, shingle mills, box factories, and to build houses, deal in timber and own land." ...|$|E
6000|$|On the contrary, mere deteriorations, or coarse, stridulent, and, in the {{ordinary}} sense of the phrase, [...] "broad" [...] forms of utterance, are not dialects at all, having nothing dialectic in them; and all phrases developed in states of rude employment, and restricted intercourse, are injurious to the tone and narrowing {{to the power of}} the language they affect. Mere breadth of accent does not spoil a dialect as long as the speakers are men of varied idea and good intelligence; but the moment the life is contracted by mining, <b>millwork,</b> or any oppressive and monotonous labor, the accents and phrases become debased. It is part of the popular folly of the day to find pleasure in trying to write and spell these abortive, crippled, and more or less brutal forms of human speech.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Millwork</b> {{building}} materials are historically any woodmill-produced building construction interior-finish, exterior-finish, or decorative components. Stock profiled and patterned <b>millwork</b> building components fabricated by milling at a planing mill {{can usually be}} installed with minimal alteration.

5000|$|<b>Millwork</b> {{building}} materials include the ready-made carpentry elements usually installed in any building. [...] Many {{of the specific}} features of the space are created using different types of architectural millwork: doors, window casings, and cabinets {{to name just a}} few. [...] The materials used in <b>millwork</b> items today are most often graded-lumber, code compliant fasteners, various glasses, and other decorative coatings and finishes.
