The main idea of the F-Z model is to use field model for rooms (in which the two-layer assumption of zone model is inadequate.) of fire origin, with strong ventilation or the rooms in which a detail simul. tion is required, and to use zone model for other spaces in the compartment.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{formalism}} for performing real space renormalization group transformations of the ”decimation type ” using low temperature perturbation theory. This type of transformations beyond d = 1 is highly nontrivial even for free theories. We construct such a solution in arbitrary dimensions {{and develop a}} weak coupling perturbation theory for it. The method utilizes Schur formula to convert summation over decorated lattice into summation over either original lattice or sublattice. We check the formalism on solvable case of O(N) symmetric Heisenberg chain. The transformation is particularly useful to study models undergoing phase transition at zero temperature (various d = 1 and d = 2 spin <b>models,</b> <b>d</b> = 2 fermionic <b>models,</b> <b>d</b> = 3, 4 nonabelian gauge models [...] .) for which the weak coupling perturbation theory is a good approximation for sufficiently small lattice spacing.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Dugan {{developed}} a gain limiting improvement to the automixing algorithm. The Dugan Gain Limiting System was patented in September 1989 and {{presented to the}} 87th AES convention in October. Dugan described for the AES his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console, operated by a person, to help in mixing multiple live microphones to have less reverberation and noise, more focus on the desired sound, eliminating the mixing engineer's problem of too-slow human reaction time. The gain limiting system provided smooth, continuous control over the equivalent number of open microphones (NOM) that the automixer would send at its outputs. The NOM could be set anywhere between 1 and 10, with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio, and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback {{in the presence of}} sound reinforcement loudspeakers. An embodiment of Dugan's three patents was produced as the <b>Model</b> <b>D</b> Automatic Mixing Controller, a 3U rack unit handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other Model Ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously.|$|E

Two barotropic two dimensional (2 <b>d)</b> <b>models</b> and one three dimensional (3 <b>d)</b> <b>model</b> are used. Both 2 <b>d</b> <b>models</b> indicate that the contribution of direct atmospheric forcing causes localised trends of up to 2 mm/yr. The 3 <b>d</b> <b>model</b> successfully describes the evolution in temperature of the upper and intermediate waters. However the salinity changes are not well described. The steric contribution of sea level rise during this period is in places in excess of 10 mm/yr. Notably oceanic circulation is also found to contribute to sea level trends by up to − 3 mm/yr. Thus the observed sea level changes in the 1990 s are better understood. The exceptional nature of the sea level behaviour in 1990 s, especially in the eastern basin, when compared with previous decades is confirmed on the basis of both the 2 d and the 3 <b>d</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{effort to}} develop mechanistic dry particle deposition parameterizations for atmospheric transport models, current knowledge has been inadequate to propose quantitative measures of the relative performance of available parameterizations. In this study, we evaluated the performance of five dry particle deposition parameterizations developed by Zhang et al.  (2001) (Z 01), Petroff and Zhang (2010) (PZ 10), Kouznetsov and Sofiev (2012) (KS 12), Zhang and He (2014) (ZH 14), and Zhang and Shao (2014) (ZS 14), respectively. The evaluation was performed in three dimensions: model ability to reproduce observed deposition velocities, V d (accuracy); the influence of imprecision in input parameter values on the <b>modeled</b> V <b>d</b> (uncertainty); and identification {{of the most influential}} parameter(s) (sensitivity). The accuracy of the <b>modeled</b> V <b>d</b> was evaluated using observations obtained from five land use categories (LUCs) : grass, coniferous and deciduous forests, natural water, and ice/snow. To ascertain the uncertainty in <b>modeled</b> V <b>d,</b> and quantify the influence of imprecision in key model input parameters, a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis was performed. The Sobol' sensitivity analysis was conducted with the objective to determine the parameter ranking from the most to the least influential. Comparing the normalized mean bias factors (indicators of accuracy), we find that the ZH 14 parameterization is the most accurate for all LUCs except for coniferous forest, for which it is second most accurate. From Monte Carlo simulations, the estimated mean normalized uncertainties in the <b>modeled</b> V <b>d</b> obtained for seven particle sizes (ranging from 0. 005 to 2. 5  µm) for the five LUCs are 17, 12, 13, 16, and 27...|$|R
