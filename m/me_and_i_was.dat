[...] However, Yankovic's next album, Even Worse, would resurrect his career and become his best-selling album at the time; the experience led Yankovic to realize that [...] "careers have peaks and valleys, and whenever I go through the rough times, another peak might be right around the corner." ...|$|E

500|$|Rank was {{important}} in Heian court society and Murasaki would not have felt herself to have much, if anything, {{in common with the}} higher ranked and more powerful Fujiwaras. In her diary, she wrote of her life at court: [...] "I realized that my branch of the family was a very humble one; but the thought seldom troubled <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in those days far indeed from the painful consciousness of inferiority which makes life at Court a continual torment to me." [...] A court position would have increased her social standing, but more importantly she gained a greater experience to write about. Court life, as she experienced it, is well reflected in the chapters of Genji written after she joined Shōshi. The name Murasaki was most probably given to her at a court dinner in an incident she recorded in her diary: in c.1008 the well-known court poet Fujiwara no Kintō inquired after the [...] "Young Murasaki"—an allusion to the character named Murasaki in Genji—which would have been considered a compliment from a male court poet to a female author.|$|E
500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Frozen" [...] was among these tracks. [...] "I was {{a huge fan of}} William's earlier records. [...] I also loved all the remixes he did for <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal feel, something really lush and romantic". They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing writing the track.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{unexpected}} success of [...] "Good for You" [...] on music charts worldwide, Gomez met with label representatives to {{request that the}} album's mixing be delayed in order to record additional music with [...] "Good for You" [...] songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter. After their previous collaboration, Gomez became [...] "super obsessed" [...] with Michaels and Tranter, and felt that they created [...] "magic" [...] in the studio, with the singer going on to say she [...] "felt like Julia was <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Julia." [...] Her label authorized the delay and the team worked for four days, ultimately creating three songs, two of which appeared on the record: [...] "Hands to Myself" [...] and [...] "Me & the Rhythm". Me & the Rhythm" [...] was written by Selena Gomez, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels and [...] production team Mattman & Robin (Mattias Larsson and Robin Fredriksson). The latter also produced the track, {{as well as being}} responsible for programming, drums, percussion, synths, bass and vocal production. Michaels provided background vocals. Serban Ghenea {{was in charge of the}} mixing, while John Hanes was the mixing engineer". It was recorded and mixed in Wolf Cousins Studios, Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California.|$|E

500|$|After {{abandoning the}} songs {{she had written}} with Babyface, Madonna turned to {{musician}} Rick Nowels, who had previously co-written songs with Stevie Nicks and Celine Dion. The collaboration produced seven songs in nine days, but those songs also did not display the album's future electronic musical direction. Three of the songs, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye", [...] "To Have and Not to Hold" [...] and [...] "Little Star", appear on the album. Madonna then began writing songs with Leonard, who had produced many songs for Madonna in the late 1980s. Unlike her previous albums, Leonard's song writing collaborations were accompanied by very little studio input. Madonna believed that Leonard's production [...] "would have lent the songs more of a Peter Gabriel vibe", a sound {{that she did not}} want for the album. Guy Oseary, chairman of Maverick Records, then phoned British electronic musician William Orbit, and suggested that he send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape to Madonna. [...] "I was a huge fan of William's earlier records, Strange Cargo 1 and 2 and all that. I also loved all the remixes he did for <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time," [...] Madonna said.|$|E

She recalled one meeting, [...] "she played it for <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in love with it and just felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration", because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see."

500|$|Tolkien {{had been}} writing The Lord of the Rings {{for several years}} when Saruman came into {{existence}} as the solution to a long-unresolved plot development, and his role and characteristics continued {{to emerge in the}} course of writing. Tolkien started work on the book in late 1937, but was initially unsure of how the story would develop. Unlike some of the other characters in the book, Saruman had not appeared in Tolkien's 1937 novel, The Hobbit, or in his then-unpublished Quenta Silmarillion and related mythology, which date back to 1917. When he wrote of Gandalf’s failure to meet Frodo, Tolkien did not know what had caused it and later said: [...] "Most disquieting of all, Saruman had never been revealed to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> as concerned as Frodo at Gandalf's failure to appear." [...] Tolkien's son, Christopher, has said that {{the early stages of the}} creation of The Lord of the Rings proceeded in a series of waves, and that having produced the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien rewrote the tale from the start three times. Saruman first appeared during a fourth phase of writing in a rough narrative outline dated August 1940. Intended to account for Gandalf's absence, it describes how a wizard titled [...] "Saramond the White" [...] or [...] "Saramund the Grey", who has fallen under the influence of Sauron, lures Gandalf to his stronghold and traps him. The full story of Saruman's betrayal was later added to the existing chapters.|$|E

2500|$|The album's bookending and two-part poem [...] "On Coming from a Broken Home" [...] {{features}} {{piano and}} a sampled string loop from Kanye West's [...] "Flashing Lights" [...] (2007). It {{is a tribute}} to the women in his family, particularly Scott-Heron's grandmother Lily Scott, with whom he was sent to live as a child in Tennessee. The song reflects on his upbringing around strong female figures and challenges the sociological perception of a broken home: [...] "Womenfolk raised <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> full-grown before knew I came from a broken home". It defends Scott-Heron's upbringing and arguing that his grandmother's love and devotion taught him passionate humanity, despite lacking of a positive male figure. According to music writers, [...] "On Coming from a Broken Home" [...] introduces and concludes the album's prominent theme of unapologetic confession.|$|E
