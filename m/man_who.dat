40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with <b>men</b> and women <b>who</b> are HIV-positive in the United States, and to compare HIV prevalence rates between <b>men</b> <b>who</b> {{have sex with men}} and women, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men only, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with women exclusively. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports referencing HIV prevalence and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men and women. We searched PubMed and Ovid PsycINFO for peer-reviewed, U. S. -based articles reporting on HIV prevalence among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men and women. We conducted event rate, effect size, moderation and sensitivity analyses. Results: We estimate that 1. 0 % of U. S. males are bisexually-behaving, and that 121, 800 bisexually-behaving men are HIV-positive. Men {{who have sex with men}} and women are less than half as likely to be HIV-positive as <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men only (16. 9 % vs. 33. 3 %; OR = 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 31, 0. 54), but more than five times as likely to be HIV-positive as <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with women exclusively (18. 3 % vs. 3. 5 %; OR = 5. 71, 95 % CI: 3. 47, 9. 39). They are less likely to engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse than <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men only (15. 9 % vs. 35. 0 %; OR = 0. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 28, 0. 46). Men who have sex with men and women in samples with high racial/ethnic minority proportions had significantly higher HIV prevalence than their counterparts in low racial/ethnic minority samples. Conclusions: This represents the first meta-analysis of HIV prevalence in the U. S. between <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men and women and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men only. Data collection, research, and HIV prevention and care delivery specifically tailored to <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men and women are necessary to better quantify and ameliorate this population's HIV burden. © 2014 Friedman et al...|$|R

2500|$|Some other {{cultures}} {{do not recognize}} a homosexual/heterosexual/bisexual distinction. It is common to distinguish a person's sexuality according to their sexual role (active/passive; insertive/penetrated). In this distinction, the passive role is typically associated with femininity or inferiority, while the active role is typically associated with masculinity or superiority. For example, an investigation of a small Brazilian fishing village revealed three sexual categories for men: <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex only with men (consistently in a passive role), <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex only with women, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with women and men (consistently in an active role). [...] While <b>men</b> <b>who</b> consistently occupied the passive role were recognized as a distinct group by locals, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with only women, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with women and men, were not differentiated. Little is known about same-sex attracted females, or sexual behavior between females in these cultures.|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{estimate}} {{the number of}} men in the U. S. military who are gay, bisexual, or other <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men (MSM) to inform the development of military and other federal policies. Study designWe analyzed data from the National Surveys of Family Growth to {{estimate the}} number of U. S. <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were gay, bisexual, or MSM, and who had served in the military, compared to those who did not serve. We stratified using hierarchical categories of gay, bisexual, and other MSM to compare proportions in the military and general population. ResultsWe found that 4. 23 % of men self-reported as gay, bisexual, or other MSM among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> served in the military, compared to 4. 14 % among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had not served (p = 0. 93). When stratified, we found that 0. 78 % self-reported as gay among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> served in the military, compared to 2. 12 % among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had not served (p< 0. 001). ConclusionsThe proportion of <b>men</b> <b>who</b> identified as a gay was lower in the military than in the general population. This finding might have been influenced by historical military policies related to sexual orientation. 28763487 PMC 553866...|$|R
