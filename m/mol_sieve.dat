In this context, we discuss the effects of different templating structures on the carbons yielded. We describe templating using a com. cationic clay (Wyoming bentonite), a com. zeolite (Tosoh H-Beta) and a synthetic mesoporous aluminosilicate (Al-MCM- 48), as exemplars of the categories of inorg. templates we have studied. The main carbon precursor used was furfuryl alc., complemented in some materials by an addnl. treatment using propylene carbon vapor deposition. The structures of the templates and carbons were compared using electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. Carbons were further characterized with elemental anal. and nitrogen adsorption.

40|$|In this paper, new generic {{synthesis}} routes for {{the single}} step prodn. of adsorbent composite hollow fibers, based on polymer dry/wet spinning followed by a phase inversion process, is presented. This prepn. technique avoids impregnation of precursors {{or the use of}} chems. for zeolite deposition while prodn. times and costs are dramatically reduced. Primary factors (such as type of solvent and viscosity), affecting the structure and adsorption performance of the <b>mol.</b> <b>sieving</b> hollow fibers are studied. The produced fibers show very good quality and reveal an asym. structure with a porosity between 37 % and 45 %. The adsorptive/sepn. properties of silicalite fibers and their particulate counterparts have been obtained in a lab. -scale flow system using n-butane as the adsorbate. The fibers prepd. from three different solvents, N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP), are compared. The hollow fiber prepd. from 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent gave the sharpest breakthrough curve and the longest breakthrough time compared to fibers prepd. from N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and com. pellets. With this new method, membranes with unique adsorbent properties and a high surface area per unit vol. ratio can be achieved with a range of adsorbents to target a range of pollutants. The proposed method is not limited to silicalite; in principle many adsorbent materials or catalytic or metallic powders may be used. This means that this method can pave the way {{for a new generation of}} adsorbent fiber membranes with low mass transfer resistance. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R
40|$|Porous mixed-valent {{manganese}} oxides are {{a group of}} multifunctional materials {{that can be used}} as mol. sieves, catalysts, battery materials, and gas sensors. However, material properties and thus activity can vary significantly with different synthesis methods or process conditions, such as temp. and time. Here, we report on a new synthesis route for MnO 2 and LaSr-doped <b>mol.</b> <b>sieve</b> single cryst. nanowires based on a soln. chem. methodol. combined with the use of nanoporous polymer templates supported on top of single cryst. substrates. Because of the confined nucleation in high aspect ratio nanopores and of the high temps. attained, new structures with novel phys. properties have been produced. During the calcination process, the nucleation and crystn. of ε-MnO 2 nanoparticles with a new hexagonal structure is promoted. These nanoparticles generated up to 30 μm long and flexible hexagonal nanowires at mild growth temps. (Tg = 700 °C) {{as a consequence of the}} large crystallog. anisotropy of ε-MnO 2. The nanocrystallites of MnO 2 formed at low temps. serve as seeds for the growth of La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 nanowires at growth temps. above 800 °C, through the diffusion of La and Sr into the empty 1 D-channels of ε-MnO 2.

The resultant {{product is}} used as a catalyst to inhibit the oxidn. of D-glucose by Chloramine-B (CAB) in NaOH medium at 37 Â°C. The inhibition of oxidn. arises from the migration of ions exchange through the zeolite framework. The ion exchange property and dehydration of respect to AlPO 4 - 5 was confirmed by FT-IRS and cond. expts. The inhibition effect follows first order kinetics with respect to [AlPO 4 - 5]. The kinetic studies show a first order dependence on [CAB] and first order dependence on [D-glucose], second order dependence on [OH-] and inverse first order for [Cl-]. The variation of benzene sulfonamide concn. and dielec. const. of the medium do not exert any significant effect on the reaction rate. The activation energies have been evaluated.

40|$|Monosaccharide and {{disaccharide}} isomerization and epimerization {{reactions are}} catalyzed by Lewis acidic sites (M = Sn, Ti, Zr) isolated in silica-based heterogeneous solids, with selectivity and stereochem. specificity that are inaccessible to sugar rearrangements involving enolate intermediates catalyzed by bases. Such selectivity and specificity reflect {{the ability of}} electrophilic Lewis acid centers to coordinate with oxygenated sugar functional groups and to subsequently mediate intramol. rearrangements of specific H and C atoms, the mechanistic details of which are probed using D and ^(13) C isotopically-labeled reactants. Here, we discuss recent progress in understanding the influence of: (i) heteroatom and solvent identity on active site structures and reaction mechanisms and (ii) the surrounding silicate environments on the turnover rates of sugar reactions. For example, glucose isomerization to fructose is mediated by Lewis acidic Ti sites isolated within hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments provided by cryst. <b>mol.</b> <b>sieves</b> with the Beta topol. and by amorphous silica. Measured first-order rate consts. (per total Ti atom; 373 K), detd. from batch reactor studies under conditions of strict kinetic control, are {{an order of magnitude}} higher in liq. water for hydrophobic than for hydrophilic solids. Mechanistic interpretation of these rate consts. indicates that the environments surrounding Ti centers influence free energy differences between isomerization transition states and two bound solvent mols. that adsorb competitively at Lewis sites and are most abundant surface intermediates during catalysis. Similar roles of hydrophobic pockets confining Lewis centers are found in heterogeneous, homogeneous and enzymic active sites that mediate sugar reactions. These findings help clarify the mechanistic details and site requirements for sugar conversion on heterogeneous Lewis acid solids, and also provide guidance for active site structural modification to promote desired reaction pathways and thus to develop new heterogeneous catalysts for selective sugar conversion in liq. media...|$|R
40|$|Highly cryst. {{samples of}} the chabazite-related aluminophosphate AlPO 4 18 (AEI) were prepd. and {{characterized}} by adsorption measurements {{as well as by}} 27 Al double rotation (DOR) NMR studies. While the heat curves and isotherms of n-paraffins on AEI show the common feature for adsorption on nonpolar <b>mol.</b> <b>sieves</b> with a given pore dimension, MeOH gives an unusual heat curve with a deep min. for a loading 2 ̆ 6 gt; 4 mols. per cavity. This corresponds to the extended low-pressure hysteresis loop of the isotherm which is absent in SAPO 34. In accord with the structure detn. and Rietveld refinement of the as-synthesized AEI, 3 crystallog. inequivalent Al positions including one pentacoordinated Al can be detected and assigned by 27 Al DOR NMR. Calcination as well as the adsorption of polar mols. results in a structure change. While H 2 O and NH 3 generate octahedrally coordinated Al, MeOH gives only AlV as was found for the template-contg. sample. The MeOH adsorption was studied in more detail. The formation of the AlV requires 2 ̆ 6 gt; 1 MeOH mol. per Al 1 site. This process occurs for a loading between 1 and 4 mols. per cavity; it is isobaric and compares to a hydration process. Two addnl. mols. can be accommodated in the AEI cavity which seems {{to be related to the}} 2 nd step of the MeOH isotherm and the extended low-pressure hysteresis loop which is absent in the isotherm of H 2 O.

40|$|Calcined {{dehydrated}} AlPO 4 - 5 was {{studied by}} x-ray powder diffraction, 31 P MAS, and 27 Al double-resonance (DOR) NMR. Three crystallog. different sites {{can be distinguished}} {{in the structure of}} dehydrated AlPO 4 - 5 in the ratio 1 : 1 : 1. The obsd. splitting of the NMR spectra is correlated to the line width of the XRD peaks between 2 q = 19 Deg and 2 q = 23 Deg. Simulations of 27 Al DOR (4. 7, 9. 4, and 11. 7 T) and MAS spectra (7. 0 and 9. 4 T) yield the isotropic chem. shifts (diso), quadrupolar coupling consts. (CQ), and the asymmetry parameters (h) of the different sites. The interaction of H 2 O, MeOH, NH 3, and MeCN with AlPO 4 - 5 and AlPO 4 - 11 is studied by XRD and 27 Al DOR and MASNMR. Both H 2 O and NH 3 are able to coordinate to part of the framework Al, leading to 5 - and/or 6 -coordinated Al. The relative amts. of 5 - and 6 -coordinated Al depend on the crystal structure and the interacting sorbate. Whereas H 2 O in AlPO 4 - 11 is interacting with 1 specific Al site (Al 2), the interaction of H 2 O with AlPO 4 - 5 occurs randomly. This leads to a broadening of the tetrahedral signal at higher H 2 O loading (above 10 - 12 %). At low MAS frequencies some dipolar broadening occurs, whereas at high spinning frequencies or 850 - 1000 Hz DOR the broadening is caused by site distribution. MeOH and MeCN do not interact with framework atoms. These mols. are too big to coordinate to framework Al in AFI and AEL type <b>mol.</b> <b>sieves.</b> The broadening of the spectra features obsd. after MeOH adsorption is apparently due an increase in chem. shift dispersion brought about by nonspecific interactions of MeOH with the framework, thereby causing a larger spread in Al-O-P angles.

The yield of p-HBA is 70 - 75 % at approx. 95 % conversion, byproducts being p-hydroxybenzyl alc.

Using CoCl 2 a selectivity for p-HBA of 80 % {{can be obtained}} with p-HBME (10 %) and p-HBAlc (5 %) as byproducts. Some oligomers/polymers are formed (however, these could not be detd. by HPLC anal.). Oxidn. of p-HBAlc to p-HBA is obsd. for all three catalyst systems at these low reaction temps. The oxygen selectivity, defined as the moles of p-cresol converted per mol of oxygen consumed, is remarkably low (maximally 60 %). This {{is due to the}} oxidn. of the solvent (methanol) to formic acid. The use of sodium hydroxide is undesirable from an environmental point of view, but cannot be avoided. Below a NaOH/p-cresol ratio of 1 no reaction occurs. A max. reaction rate is obsd. at a NaOH over p-cresol ratio of 3 - 4. A max. reaction rate is obsd. at a cobalt/p-cresol ratio of 0. 6 - 0. 7 mg/g, independent of the catalyst source. Not only the reaction rate but also the oxygen selectivity and selectivity to p-HBA show the same dependence upon the cobalt/p-cresol ratio. This indicates a comparable reaction mechanism in the homogeneous (CoCl 2) and the supposedly heterogeneous CoAPO systems. Recycling of the catalysts at sufficiently low cobalt over p-cresol ratios indicates that the CoAPO catalysts are not stable under reaction conditions; cobalt is released from the partially dissolved CoAPO <b>mol.</b> <b>sieve.</b> The obsd. catalytic activity mainly stems from this dissolved cobalt.
