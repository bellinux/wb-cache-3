5|$|Purvis {{was born}} on July 4, 1857, into a family of Scottish descent. His parents were Robert Raaf Purvis and Annie Silburn Marshall. His {{paternal}} grandfather, William Purvis, {{who worked as a}} trader and ship captain, had settled in the Dutch East Indies in the 1810s while it was still part of the British Empire. The family lived in many places including Dutch East Indies, Brussels, and London. Educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Edward William Purvis served as a sub-lieutenant of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot in Bengal, where he learned Hindi, and later as a sub-lieutenant for the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot in Chatham, Kent. Around 1879 he resigned his British Army post and traveled to the Hawaiian Islands, where his father and older brother Robert William Theodore Purvis had already settled, having arrived on December13, 1877; his brother Theodore had started a sugar plantation business on the island of Kauai. A distant cousin of theirs was William Herbert Purvis, known for introducing <b>macadamia</b> <b>nuts</b> to Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} amount of the farm land is set aside for student plots. Part of practical agriculture lessons involves students growing and maintaining their own crops, and a practical mark worth 10% of their yearly mark is awarded {{at the end of}} term. Mature crops in the students' assigned plots of land are then the students' to take home. In addition to its use for educational purposes, the farm also supplies a wide variety of agricultural produce including: Cattle - Angus stud, paraded annually at the Castle Hill Show by the Cattle Group, and sold at Camden Sales yard; Sheep - First-cross Ewes & Prime Lambs; Eggs - Free-range eggs; Poultry Meat - Broilers raised and sold onsite, Oranges - Washington Navel; Peaches - Flordagold and Sherman's Red varieties; Sweet Corn - Shimmer variety; James Ruse Gold Rose - A privately crossbred rose variety the rights were donated to the school in 1999 in celebration of its 40 years of teaching; Apiary - Honey sold on-site in jars; and <b>Macadamia</b> <b>Nuts.</b> Various groups of students have been set up to look after these, such as the Poultry Squad and a Weather Watcher group to maintain farm records. In the past, the farm also housed Merino and Border Leicester sheep, named the Sharlea Sheep. It was replaced by the Aquaculture venture, silver perch and a crayfish growing system. Now some students also participate in making peach jam and sorbet after the peach harvest.|$|E

500|$|Iselle brought {{damaging}} surf {{along the}} east coast of the island. Strong winds unroofed homes near Hilo and downed trees. These winds also felled power lines, causing widespread outages impacting roughly 23,000electricity customers. A geothermal plant in Puna released toxic hydrogen sulfide gases upon losing its power sources, prompting officials to urge an exodus of the immediate area, although a number of nearby residents reported health impacts. A water treatment plant in Kula on Maui also shut down due to power failure, prompting the conservation of water supplies in that area. Iselle's winds also damaged about 1,000 coffee trees and over 2,000 macadamia trees. Damage was heaviest to the papaya crop, with about 60% of the statewide crop destroyed, accounting for $55million in losses (2014USD). Other crops, including coffee, <b>macadamia</b> <b>nuts,</b> and flowers, were also damaged, and overall crop losses in the state were estimated at $66million (2014USD). Only one known death took place {{as a direct result of}} the storm [...] a 19-year-old woman who was swept away by flood waters while hiking in a closed state park. Over 250property owners reported damage, with at least 11houses destroyed, and 28 with major damage. Public damage and the cost to remove debris was estimated at $13.2million. Overall damage in the state is unknown, but estimated by a Hawaiian economist between $148325million (2014USD).|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} Hawaii's economy {{can be traced}} through a {{succession}} of dominant industries; sandalwood, whaling, sugarcane, pineapple, the military, tourism and education. Since statehood in 1959, tourism has been the largest industry, contributing 24.3% of the gross state product (GSP) in 1997, despite efforts to diversify. The state's gross output for 2003 was billion; per capita income for Hawaii residents in 2014 was [...] Hawaiian exports include food and clothing. These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, due to the shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state's food exports include coffee, <b>macadamia</b> <b>nuts,</b> pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{macadamia}} tree {{is known}} for producing fruit high in fats, enclosed in very hard woody shells. <b>Macadamia</b> <b>nut</b> shell, considered as a by-product from <b>macadamia</b> <b>nut</b> processing, may be a suitable option for pyrolysis. These residues are constituted of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and extractives. The Independent Parallel Reaction (IPR) Model has been applied in this work to study the pyrolysis of <b>macadamia</b> <b>nut</b> shell from thermogravimetric experiments. The kinetic parameters and mass fraction of each component were estimated using the Differential Evolution Algorithm. The influence of the model parameters was also analyzed by means of sensitivity studies. The {{results showed that the}} decomposition of the <b>macadamia</b> <b>nut</b> shell is more sensitive to the parameters related to the decomposition of lignin. The results of sensitivity analysis also showed that the activation energy affects the total biomass conversion more strongly than the other parameters and the contribution of extractives in the IPR model {{is as important as the}} hemicellulose...|$|R
