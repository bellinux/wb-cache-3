They did not wander madly about the world--like the Tamerlanes, or the Chengiz Khans, or the present barbarian Ravager of Europe--under a <b>mock</b> <b>title</b> of Delegates of the Almighty, acting upon self-assumed authority. Their commission had been thrust upon them. They had been trampled upon, tormented, wronged--bitterly, wantonly wronged, if ever a people on the earth was wronged. And this it was which legitimately incorporated their law with the supreme conscience, and gave to them the deep faith which they have expressed--that their power was favoured and assisted by the Almighty.--These words are not uttered without a due sense of their awful import: but the Spirit of evil is strong: and the subject requires the highest mode of thinking and feeling of which human nature is capable.--Nor in this can they be deceived; for, whatever be the immediate issue for themselves, the final issue for their Country and Mankind must be good;--they are instruments of benefit and glory for the human race; and the Deity therefore is with them.|$|E

5000|$|The curse began {{during the}} final of the Mexican League winter tournament in 1997, contested between Cruz Azul and Club León in a two-legged match. At the time they were the 3rd and 4th teams with the most league {{champion}}ships in Mexico respectively. Both teams were tied until the last moments of the second leg when Leon's goalkeeper Ángel Comizzo kicked Carlos Hermosillo in the face causing Hermosillo to bleed profusely inside the penalty area, leading to a foul and a penalty kick in Cruz Azul's favor. As the penalty was given the referee asked Hermosillo to clean the blood from his face, but Hermosillo ignored him and took the penalty kick, scoring a late winner. Cruz Azul became champion for the 8th time in club history, but fans believed that both teams were cursed by the blood. Leon was then relegated to an inferior league in 2002 but since then was promoted back to the now-renamed Liga MX (formerly Primera División) and are currently the recent Mexican league champions after defeating Club América in the 2013 Apertura playoffs, breaking their part of the curse. On the other hand, Cruz Azul has lost several finals in the Mexican league, the CONCACAF Champions League, and the Copa Libertadores, many of them at the last minute, which has their part in the curse hold true. Although Cruz Azul won the 2013 Clausura edition of the Copa MX the club has yet to win their first league championship since 1997.

2500|$|Blackface {{soon found}} {{a home in the}} taverns of New York's less respectable precincts of Lower Broadway, the Bowery, and Chatham Street.

Upper-class houses at first limited the number of such acts they would show, but beginning in 1841, blackface performers frequently took to the stage at even the classy Park Theatre, much to the dismay of some patrons. Theater was a participatory activity, and the lower classes came to dominate the playhouse. They threw things at actors or orchestras who performed unpopular material, and rowdy audiences eventually prevented the Bowery Theatre from staging high drama at all. Typical blackface acts of the period were short burlesques, often with <b>mock</b> Shakespearean <b>titles</b> like [...] "Hamlet the Dainty", [...] "Bad Breath, the Crane of Chowder", [...] "Julius Sneezer" [...] or [...] "Dars-de-Money".|$|R

[...] As a beautiful Swedish blonde, Söderbaum had the baby-doll looks that epitomized the model Aryan woman.

Although the primary {{focus will be on}} the creative and technical process for producing and moving the imagery, audio editing and obtaining rights to music, along with video compression for efficient playback will also be addressed.

40|$|We {{present a}} fast method of {{producing}} mock galaxy catalogues {{that can be}} used to compute covariance matrices of large-scale clustering measurements and test the methods of analysis. Our method populates a 2 nd-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (2 LPT) matter field, where we calibrate masses of dark matter halos by detailed comparisons with N-body simulations. We demonstrate the clustering of halos is recovered at ~ 10 per cent accuracy. We populate halos with mock galaxies using a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) prescription, which has been calibrated to reproduce the clustering measurements on scales between 30 and 80 Mpc/h. We compare the sample covariance matrix from our mocks with analytic estimates, and discuss differences. We have used this method to make catalogues corresponding to Data Release 9 of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS),producing 600 mock catalogues of the "CMASS" galaxy sample. These mocks enabled detailed tests of methods and errors that formed an integral part of companion analyses of these galaxy data. Comment: 21 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables.

500|$|Contemporary {{critic and}} editor Margaret Fuller wrote, [...] "his verse is stereotyped; his thought sounds no depth, and posterity will not {{remember}} him." [...] Duyckinck thought Lowell was too {{similar to other}} poets like William Shakespeare and John Milton. Ralph Waldo Emerson noted that, though Lowell had significant technical skill, his poetry [...] "rather expresses his wish, his ambition, than the uncontrollable interior impulse which is the authentic mark of a new poem... and which is felt in the pervading tone, rather than in brilliant parts or lines." [...] Even his friend Richard Henry Dana Jr. questioned Lowell's abilities, calling him [...] "very clever, entertaining & good humored... but he is rather a trifler, after all." [...] In the twentieth century, poet Richard Armour dismissed Lowell, writing: [...] "As a Harvard graduate and an editor for the Atlantic Monthly, {{it must have been}} difficult for Lowell to write like an illiterate oaf, but he succeeded." [...] The poet Amy Lowell featured her relative James Russell Lowell in her poem A Critical Fable (1922), the <b>title</b> <b>mocking</b> A Fable for Critics. Here, a fictional version of Lowell says he does not believe that women will ever be equal to men in the arts and [...] "the two sexes cannot be ranked counterparts". Modern literary critic Van Wyck Brooks wrote that Lowell's poetry was forgettable: [...] "one read them five times over and still forgot them, as if this excellent verse had been written in water." [...] Nonetheless, in 1969 the Modern Language Association established a prize named after Lowell, awarded annually for [...] "an outstanding literary or linguistic study, a critical edition of an important work, or a critical biography." ...|$|R
