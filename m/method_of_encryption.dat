Many <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>encryption</b> are also subject to [...] "man in the middle" [...] attack whereby a third party who can 'see' {{the establishment of the}} secure communication is made privy to the encryption method, this would apply for example to interception of computer use at an ISP.

5000|$|Since aerial {{telegraphy}} {{was sometimes}} conducted within the clear {{sight of the}} enemy, security was a major problem. The Signal Corps introduced a cipher disc, a simple device that allowed the encryption of text. Two concentric discs were inscribed with letters and their numerical equivalents.

To encipher a message, the signal officer selected an [...] "adjustment letter" [...] on the inner disc and then made this letter correspond with a preselected numerical code or [...] "key number" [...] on the outer disc. The signal officer would typically give the key numbers to the flagmen without revealing the plain text version of the message. Although this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>encryption</b> was primitive by modern standards, there is no record that the Confederates ever deciphered a Union message that had been processed in this manner.
