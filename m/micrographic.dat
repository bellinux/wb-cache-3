25|$|The {{survival}} rate {{for people with}} melanoma depends upon when they start treatment. The cure rate is very high when melanoma is detected in early stages, when it can easily be removed surgically. The prognosis is less favorable if the melanoma has spread {{to other parts of}} the body. As of 2003 the overall five year cure rate with Mohs' <b>micrographic</b> surgery was around 95 percent for recurrent basal cell carcinoma.|$|E
2500|$|Mohs' <b>micrographic</b> surgery (Mohs surgery) is a {{technique}} used to remove the cancer with {{the least amount of}} surrounding tissue and the edges are checked immediately to see if tumor is found. This provides the opportunity to remove the least amount of tissue and provide the best cosmetically favorable results. This is especially important for areas where excess skin is limited, such as the face. Cure rates are equivalent to wide excision. Special training is required to perform this technique. [...] An alternative method is CCPDMA and can be performed by a pathologist not familiar with Mohs surgery.|$|E
