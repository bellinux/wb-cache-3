5|$|Chocolate {{has been}} made in Switzerland since the 18th century but it gained its {{reputation}} {{at the end of the}} 19th century with the invention of modern techniques such as conching and tempering which enabled its production on a high quality level.

5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate.</b> The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{proceeds}} from the 1900 sale of the Lancaster Caramel Company, Hershey initially acquired farm land roughly 30 miles northwest of Lancaster, near his birthplace of Derry Township, PA. There, he could obtain the large supplies of fresh milk needed to perfect and produce fine <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate.</b> Excited by the potential of <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate,</b> which {{at that time was}} a luxury product, Hershey was determined to develop a formula for <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate</b> and market and sell it to the American public. Through trial and error, he created his own formula for <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate.</b> The first Hershey bar was produced in 1900. Hershey's Kisses were developed in 1907, and the Hershey's Bar with almonds was introduced in 1908.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a unique perspective}} to the milk market relative to previous studies. While there is rich literature on the various sectors of the milk market, a contribution to this literature was made by providing a specific econometric analysis of the Promised Land brand. Previous work conducted by Capps and Salin (2010) provided the foundation for this thesis. The purpose of this thesis was threefold: 1. Estimate household demand functions for Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> using Nielsen homescan data. The demand functions were estimated using a tobit model to estimate the conditional and unconditional own-price and cross-price effects of Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> 2. Assess the impacts of household demographic drivers of demand for Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> 3. Use the empirical results derived from the tobit model to identify substitutes and complements of Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> and provide a profile of households that purchase Promised Land white and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> The study concluded that households who purchased Promised Land white were insensitive {{to changes in the}} price of Promised Land white milk. The price of private label milk was the only cross-price that was significant in the quantity of Promised Land white milk purchased. The estimated elasticities showed that Promised Land white milk and private label white milk were substitutes. From the estimated elasticities, it was found that households that purchased Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> were largely insensitive to changes in the price of Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> It was also found that the prices of Nesquick, Oak Farms, and private label <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> had a significant effect on the quantity of Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> purchased. Of these significant prices, private label and Oak Farms <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> were substitutes for Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk.</b> The price of Nesquick <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk</b> demonstrated a complementary relationship with Promised Land <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1899, Rowntree {{introduced}} its first <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate</b> block, {{but the company}} failed to match the quality of Swiss competitors such as Lindt.|$|E
25|$|Rowntree had {{struggled}} to make a <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate</b> product of comparable quality or value to Cadbury's Dairy Milk. Joseph Rowntree even described the growing market for <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate</b> as a fad. Rowntree's poor performance in the category became a major problem from 1914 onwards, as British public preference continued to move towards <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate,</b> {{and away from the}} more bitter cocoa essence products. Rowntree's two major rivals, Cadbury and Fry, merged in 1918, and although Rowntree was invited to partake in the merger, the company declined to do so. Meanwhile, the Rowntree board was torn as to whether it should become a low-turnover, high-quality product company or a mass producer of cheaper lines. Seebohm Rowntree inherited a struggling company when he succeeded his father as chairman in 1923. By 1930, as a result of all its problems, Rowntree was approaching bankruptcy.|$|E
