25|$|Like all {{flash memory}} devices, flash drives can sustain {{only a limited}} number of write and erase cycles before the drive fails. This should be a {{consideration}} when using a flash drive to run application software or an operating system. To address this, as well as space limitations, some developers have produced special versions of operating systems (such as Linux in Live USB) or commonplace applications (such as Mozilla Firefox) designed to run from flash drives. These are typically optimized for size and configured to place temporary or intermediate files in the computer's <b>main</b> <b>RAM</b> rather than store them temporarily on the flash drive.|$|E
500|$|Programming was {{assigned}} to Tod Frye, who was not provided with any arcade design specifications to work from, and {{had to figure out}} how the game worked by playing it. The game uses a 4KB ROM cartridge, chosen for its lower manufacturing costs compared to 8KB cartridges, which had just become available at the time. After Atari acquired the rights to produce the game, Frye began work on a prototype version. The company wanted to release the prototype to capitalize on the 1981 holiday season. As with any contemporary arcade port, the simple Atari 2600 hardware was a considerable limitation. [...] The arcade PAC-MAN system board contained 2KB of <b>main</b> <b>RAM</b> (random-access memory) in which to run the program, 2KB of video RAM to store the screen state, and 16KB of ROM (read-only memory) to store the game code, whereas the Atari 2600 featured only 128 bytes of RAM memory and none dedicated to video: effectively 32 times less RAM. The Zilog Z80 CPU microprocessor used by the Namco Pac-Man arcade system is clocked at three times the speed of the MOS 6507 CPU in the Atari 2600, but the instruction sets and architecture for each processor are very different, and a 6507 can do more operations per clock cycle (effectively 2 to 1), making 1 to 1 comparisons more difficult than simply comparing clock speed.|$|E
500|$|Physically, the Dreamcast {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] [...] The Dreamcast's main CPU is a two-way 360MIPS superscalar Hitachi SH-4 32-bit RISC clocked at 200MHz with an 8 Kbyte instruction cache and 16 Kbyte data cache and a 128-bit graphics-oriented floating-point unit delivering 1.4GFLOPS. Its 100MHz NEC PowerVR2 rendering engine, {{integrated with the}} system's ASIC, is capable of drawing more than 3 million polygons per second and of deferred shading. Sega estimated that the Dreamcast was theoretically capable of rendering 7 million raw polygons per second, or 6 million with textures and lighting, but noted that [...] "game logic and physics reduce peak graphic performance." [...] Graphics hardware effects include trilinear filtering, gouraud shading, z-buffering, spatial anti-aliasing, per-pixel translucency sorting and bump mapping. The system can output approximately 16.77 million colors simultaneously and displays interlaced or progressive scan video at 640Ã—480 video resolution. Its 67MHz Yamaha AICA sound processor, with a 32-bit ARM7 RISC CPU core, can generate 64 voices with PCM or ADPCM, providing ten times {{the performance of the}} Saturn's sound system. [...] The Dreamcast has 16 MB <b>main</b> <b>RAM,</b> along with an additional 8 MB of RAM for graphic textures and 2 MB of RAM for sound. [...] The system reads media using a 12x speed Yamaha GD-ROM Drive. In addition to Windows CE, the Dreamcast supports several Sega and middleware application programming interfaces. In most regions, the Dreamcast included a removable modem for online connectivity, which was modular for future upgrades. The original Japanese model and all PAL models had a transfer rate of 33.6kbit/s, while consoles sold in the US and in Japan after September 9, 1999 featured a 56 kbit/s dial-up modem.|$|E

No evidence of a TLB has been found. The co-processor that normally manages the TLB-based MMU {{seems to be a}} custom effort by Sony and has no integrated memory. Both CPUs contain 16 KiB of two-way set associative instruction cache and data cache respectively.

50|$|Auburn was {{designed}} specifically {{to take advantage of}} (and promote) the use of AGP interface, during the time when many competing 3D accelerators (notably, 3dfx Voodoo Graphics) still used the PCI connection. A unique characteristic, which set the AGP version of the card apart from other similar devices on the market, was the use of on-board memory exclusively for the display frame buffer, with all textures being kept in the computer system's <b>main</b> <b>RAM.</b> At the time, most accelerators used the CPU for triangle setup and geometry calculations, then handed the data off to the card to apply texture mapping and bilinear filtering. By leaving this data in main memory, and giving the graphics card a high-speed channel to the data, performance could be improved while also reducing the total amount of memory in the system.|$|E
50|$|The ColecoVision, SG-1000, CreatiVision, and first-generation MSX {{computers}} use the TMS9918A Video Display processor (VDP), {{which has}} its own 16 KiB of video memory that was not shared with main memory. Compared to the unified system and video memory used by other 8-bit computers of the time, such as the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64, separate memory has the advantage of freeing up of the Z80 processor's 64 KiB address space for <b>main</b> <b>RAM,</b> and the VDP doesn't need to steal CPU cycles to access video memory. The disadvantage is that the program has to use the CPU's dedicated I/O instructions to command the VDP to manipulate the contents of the video RAM. This not only slows down video access but also makes the porting of games from unified-memory platforms more difficult. Attempts of porting ZX Spectrum games (in the UK, the system most similar to the MSX) were often thwarted by this difference. Also, programmers had to learn to optimally use the more advanced capabilities of the VDP.|$|E

50|$|Readahead is {{a system}} call of the Linux kernel that loads a file's {{contents}} into the page cache.

50|$|The Macintosh LC 580 {{was sold}} in 1995 and 1996. Like its {{immediate}} predecessor, the LC 575, it used the Motorola 68LC040 processor at 33 MHz. However, instead of using the same sized, SCSI only, logic boards based on the LC 475/Quadra 605 like the 575 series was, the 580s use the larger logic boards of the Performa 630 series. This meant a few changes, most of them leading to lower prices, but also lower performance: Most notably, the hard drives of the 580 were IDE drives instead of SCSI drives. Also, the video RAM was no longer mounted on a SIMM, but used 1 MB of the 4 MB of <b>main</b> <b>RAM</b> soldered to the motherboard. Lastly, the Trinitron display of the 575 was replaced with a cheaper shadow mask screen, causing a slight change in the plastic case surrounding the CRT. One benefit of this change was the ability to accommodate the same video capture and TV tuner cards designed for the Performa 630. This allowed LC 580 users to watch and record video, essentially performing the function of a television {{as well as a}} computer.|$|E

5000|$|The Apple II Plus shipped with 16 KB, 32 KB or 48 KB of <b>main</b> <b>RAM,</b> {{expandable}} to 64 KB {{by means}} of the Language Card, an expansion card that could be installed in the computer's slot 0. The Apple's 6502 microprocessor could support a maximum of 64 KB of address space, and a machine with 48KB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 12 KB of read-only memory and 4 KB of I/O addresses. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The Language Card was also required to use LOGO, Apple Pascal, and FORTRAN 77. Apple Pascal and FORTRAN ran under a non-DOS operating system based on UCSD P-System, which had its own disk format and included a [...] "virtual machine" [...] that allowed it to run on many different types of hardware.|$|E
