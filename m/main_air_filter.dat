50|$|The modern {{automobile}} {{air intake}} system has three <b>main</b> parts, an <b>air</b> <b>filter,</b> mass flow sensor, and throttle body. Some modern intake systems can be highly complex, and often include specially-designed intake manifolds to optimally distribute air and air/fuel mixture to each cylinder. Many cars today now include a silencer to minimize the noise entering the cabin. Silencers impede air flow and create turbulence which reduce total power, so performance enthusiasts often remove them.|$|R

It is shown that the concentration density maxima of the small dispersive coal dust particles appear in the granular filtering medium with the cylindrical coal absorbent granules in the horizontal iodine <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> at an action by the air dust aerosol blow. The comparison of the measured aerodynamic resistances of the horizontal and vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> is conducted. The main conclusion is that {{the magnitude of the}} aerodynamic resistance of the horizontal iodine <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> is much smaller in comparison with the magnitude of the aerodynamic resistance of the vertical iodine <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> at the same loads of the air dust aerosol volumes.

40|$|An <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> is a {{significant}} element of any mechanical ventilation system. However, the importance and performance evaluation of <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> have not been well publicized and related scientific reports are scarce. In this study, a transportable, off-line, air filter-testing unit (the Unit) was designed and utilized to simulate the filter housing of a mechanical ventilation system. The Unit was designed, assembled, and operated in a laboratory. To demonstrate the applications of the Unit, a series of <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> handling and installation scenarios was performed to determine the characteristic curve and capture efficiencies of a selected set of HEPA filters. The research project produced a transportable, closed system <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> testing unit.

An <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> testing unit, similar to the Unit presented here, can readily be designed, fabricated, and assembled to simulate the filter-housing of mechanical ventilation systems.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>filter</b> {{manufacturers}} have recently begun marketing premium <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> that provide very high particle capture efficiencies with very low initial static pressure drops. This is accomplished with proprietary filter designs incorporating {{at least twice}} the media surface area of traditional filters. 1 The increased media reduces the initial pressure drop of <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> while dramatically increasing their dust holding capacity. In addition, their useful lives are extended and prefilter use may be eliminated. Physical principals governing airflow in fan systems predict available energy savings from using premium <b>air</b> <b>filters.</b> This energy savings may offset the additional cost of the premium filters. In fact, premium filter investments can payback in six months to three years depending on airflow and number of hours of fan operation. Additional benefits of using premium <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> include longer filter life, lower installation and disposal costs, elimination of prefilters {{and the ability to}} increase effective filter efficiency in buildings without reducing ventilation effectiveness. A case study was conducted in an office building with two nearly identical VAV systems to determine if premium <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> are good investments for building owners and managers.
