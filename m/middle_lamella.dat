Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex, which is proposed to be made of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for each of the six units. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength.

Since enzymes are too large to penetrate inside of wood cell walls without erosion, degradation of lignin by C. subvermispora must be catalyzed by low molecular mass agents 2). In the wood decay by C. subvermispora extensive damage of <b>middle</b> <b>lamellae</b> has been observed even in {{an early stage of}} wood decayl), suggesting that the lignin-degradation of this fungus is catalyzed by low molecular mass oxidants generated near the substrate.

When the tissue was penetrated by a circu l ar punch { 1. 5 mm diameter), cells in soft tissue tore along the middle l arne ll ae rather than across cell walls, as did cells in firm tissue.

40|$|Preheating {{potatoes}} at 50 to 80 °C has a firming {{effect on}} the cooked potato tissue. This effect is particularly pronounced at a preheating temperature of 60 to 70 °C followed by cooling. Several theories have been presented in the literature to explain this firming effect: retrogradation of starch, leaching of amylose, stabilization of the <b>middle</b> <b>lamellae</b> and cell walls by the activation of the pectin methylesterase (PME) enzyme, and by the release of calcium from gelatinized starch {{and the formation of}} calcium bridges between pectin molecules. Most probably, none of these theories alone can explain the phenomenon and more than one mechanism seems to be involved. Some of these mechanisms seem to be interdependent. As an example, calcium could be considered as a link all the way through release after starch gelatinization to cross-linking pectin substances in the cell wall and the <b>middle</b> <b>lamellae,</b> which has been demethylated by the PME enzyme. More research and “clear cut” experiments are needed in order to elucidate the role of each mechanism, especially which of them is the main contributor to the process of firming. Most probably, the calcium-pectin-PME mechanism plays a secondary role, that is, it only retards the collapse of the tissue structure that would otherwise occur during the final heating without preheating, and it is not the main factor of firmness...|$|R

50|$|This step {{can occur}} {{in a variety of}} ways {{depending}} on the species but always occurs at the abscission zone. Detachment can occur when layers of parenchyma cells secrete cell wall enzymes to self-digest the <b>middle</b> <b>lamella,</b> which holds the cell walls together at the abscission zone. This causes the cells of the abscission zone to break apart and the leaf or other plant part to fall off.Another way detachment occurs is through imbibition of water.

The enzymes that hydrolyze pectic substances are broadly classified as pectinases or pectinolytic enzymes. These include two main groups: methyl esterases, which catalyze the removal of the methoxyl group from pectin to form pectate, and depolymerases (hydrolases and lyases), which split the backbone of both pectin and pectate by hydrolytic cleavage (polymethyl galacturonases and polygalacturonases) or trans-eliminative cleavage (pectin lyases and pectate lyases) (Yuan et al. 2011).|$|R
