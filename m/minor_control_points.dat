40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} "Design and Development of the Network of Points of the Detailed Minor Horizontal Control using Geodetic and GPS Methods" in the {{cadastral}} territory Jenín and Horní Kaliště. Using the map basis I conducted the reconnaissance {{and analysis of}} the current level of the <b>minor</b> <b>control</b> <b>points</b> in the target territory. Next I stabilized 14 new points of the DMHC, however, this thesis uses only 7 of these 14 points. The work aims to analyze the current level of the minor control and if needed to increase the field density for detailed large-scale mapping. For this purpose I used total station Leica TCR 407 power for the geodetic method and Trimble 4600 LS device for the GPS method. Consequently I analyzed the accuracy of both methods...|$|E
40|$|There are {{now many}} {{different}} digital sensor systems available for photogrammetry, remote sensing and digital image analysis. Cramer (2005) provides {{a summary of}} the systems available in 2005 and these include; single and multi-cone/lens systems as well as high resolution push broom scanners. Before any imagery can be used for high precision measurement purposes in photogrammetry {{there is a need to}} determine the geometric model of the sensing system. In the case of frame cameras there is a need to establish the sensor model and determine the relationship of this model in comparison to the standard normally (and traditionally) used in photogrammetry which is perspective geometry. The process of measuring the relationship of a ‘real ’ frame camera geometry in comparison to perspective geometry is known as camera calibration. Camera calibration is normally undertaken by the manufacturer before supplying a camera for photogrammetry then periodically, and when necessary, during the life of the camera. The technology of GPS and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) integrated with an aerial camera, either analogue or digital, is regularly being used for production purposes. The importance of GPS and IMU measurements is increasing as there is greater and greater interest to work without ground control and strive towards direct georeferencing of imagery. Arguably, direct georeferencing can be considered with and without aerial triangulation as the use of automatically measured <b>minor</b> <b>control</b> <b>points</b> (tie and pass points) can be easily and efficiently undertaken by modern aerial triangulation software. Critical to the success of direct georeferencing, particularly without aerial triangulation, are the IMU measurements and therefore the determination of the geometric relationship between the IMU and the camera geometry. As experience is gained from undertaking misalignment (boresight) calibrations a number of interesting results are being produced. 1...|$|E

The <b>control</b> <b>points</b> have been established in the eighties of twentieth century during cadastrial mapping (large scale base map). Until now, those points were recorded in the 4 th accuracy class. The geodetic control was remeasured with RTK technique, then deviations were calculated. These results were reviewed and evaluated whether the points match with the 4 th accuracy class or even the 3 rd accuracy class.

50|$|A common {{misconception}} is {{that each}} knot is paired with a <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> This is true only for degree 1 NURBS (polylines). In general, the knots break the domain up into knot spans, but each <b>control</b> <b>point</b> corresponds to one basis function which spans a range of (degree+1) knot spans. For example, suppose we have a degree-3 NURBS with 7 <b>control</b> <b>points</b> and knots 0,0,0,1,2,5,8,8,8. The first four <b>control</b> <b>points</b> are grouped with the first six knots. The second through fifth <b>control</b> <b>points</b> are grouped with the knots 0,0,1,2,5,8. The third through sixth <b>control</b> <b>points</b> are grouped with the knots 0,1,2,5,8,8.

40|$|A key {{component}} of some volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) optimization algorithms is the progressive addition of <b>control</b> <b>points</b> to the optimization. This idea was introduced in Otto's seminal VMAT paper, in which a coarse sampling of <b>control</b> <b>points</b> was used {{at the beginning of}} the optimization and new <b>control</b> <b>points</b> were progressively added one at a time. A different form of the methodology is also present in the RapidArc optimizer, which adds new <b>control</b> <b>points</b> in groups called 'multiresolution levels', each doubling the number of <b>control</b> <b>points</b> in the optimization. This progressive sampling accelerates convergence, improving the results obtained, and has similarities with the ordered subset algorithm used to accelerate iterative image reconstruction. In this work we have used a VMAT optimizer developed in-house to study the performance of optimization algorithms which use different <b>control</b> <b>point</b> sampling sequences, most of which fall into three different classes: doubling sequences, which add new <b>control</b> <b>points</b> in groups such that the number of <b>control</b> <b>points</b> in the optimization is (roughly) doubled; Otto-like progressive sampling which adds one <b>control</b> <b>point</b> at a time, and equi-length sequences which contain several multiresolution levels each with the same number of <b>control</b> <b>points.</b> Results are presented in this study for two clinical geometries, prostate and head-and-neck treatments. A dependence of the quality of the final solution on the number of starting <b>control</b> <b>points</b> has been observed, in agreement with previous works. We have found that some sequences, especially E 20 and E 30 (equi-length sequences with 20 and 30 multiresolution levels, respectively), generate better results than a 5 multiresolution level RapidArc-like sequence. The final value of the cost function is reduced up to 20 %, such reductions leading to small improvements in dosimetric parameters characterizing the treatments-slightly more homogeneous target doses and better sparing of the organs at risk...|$|R
