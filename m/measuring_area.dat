50|$|During the {{ski jumping}} {{individual}} normal hill {{event at the}} Hakuba Ski Jumping Stadium, the final two jumpers on the second jump were delayed from their jumps to high winds. Finland's Jani Soininen jumped 89 meters to advance one point ahead of Japan's Kazuyoshi Funaki. Funaki's teammate Masahiko Harada, who led after the first jump, needed a jump of 88 meters to win gold, but only jumped 84.5 meters {{and ended up in}} fifth place. Soininen would later complain bitterly about the officials' decision despite his gold medal win. In the individual large hill event, Funaki jumped so far that he landed beyond the video <b>measuring</b> <b>area</b> which resulted in the distance being measured manually. Funaki's jump was recorded as 132.5 meters and it also garnered perfect style points. The Japanese ski jumper would win gold in the event.|$|E
50|$|Scholarly {{debate has}} taken place over the exact {{definition}} of a bastide. They are now generally described as any town planned and built as a single unit, by a single founder. The majority of bastides were developed with a grid layout of intersecting streets, with wide thoroughfares that divide the town plan into insulae, or blocks, through which a narrow lane often runs. They included a central market square surrounded by arcades (couverts) through which the axes of thoroughfares pass, with a covered weighing and <b>measuring</b> <b>area.</b> The market square often provides the module into which the bastide is subdivided. The Roman model, the castrum with its grid plan and central forum, was inescapable {{in a region where}} Roman planning precedents survived in medieval cities such as Béziers, Narbonne, Toulouse, Orange and Arles. The region of the bastides {{had been one of the}} last outposts of Late Antiquity in the West.|$|E

40|$|A special impact {{generator}} {{was constructed}} {{in order to produce}} water impacts with velocities which are not available in scale models with waves. The water impact was generated by a jet suddenly striking upon a <b>measuring</b> <b>area.</b> Even under same conditions of impact, stochastic scattering of the peak pressures was observed; but for all test series the distribution of frequencies of the pressures was found to be normal-logarithmic. The generated shock pressures by an impact velocity v came higher than 10 times the maximum pressure of steady flow of equal velocity v; but they were lower than 10 % of the water hammerpressure rho. v. c. Even by a thin sheet of water on the <b>measuring</b> <b>area</b> the shock pressures were damped nearly completely. Considerations about the effect of air content in connection with the effects of expansion show that shock pressures can be explained by a damping of water hammer pressure by a small air content. Some evaluations of the test material are Given to this point...|$|E

A study of physical factors (heat, noise and lighting) is important to determine the level of comfort during working. This study was carried out to study those physical factors upon comfort level during working among Casting Shop workers in a car manufacturing factory. Methods : Instruments for the physical monitoring including Questemp° 36 Thermal Environment Monitor, Sound Level Meter and Lux Meter were used at seven <b>measured</b> <b>areas.</b> The information {{about the level of}} comfort during working was collected using questionnaires among 65 respondents by random sampling method. Results : Measured data showed there were four <b>measured</b> <b>areas</b> which Wet Bulb Globe Temperature indoor (WBGTi) value are above the standard limit recommended by ACGIH, three <b>measured</b> <b>areas</b> recorded noise level above the standard limit recommended by Factories and Machineries (Noise Exposure) 1989, while there was no <b>measured</b> <b>area</b> recorded lighting reading below the standard limit recommended by MS ISO 8995 : 2005.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between ablation parameters of myopic laser surgery and measurement area of wavefront aberration (WA) with Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor. 58 subjects undergone myopic laser surgeries and 74 uncorrected myopic subjects were enrolled in this experiment. The laser ablation parameters were obtained from surgical records, which included spherical error (Rx), depth, and optical zone (OZ) of ablation. The <b>measured</b> <b>area</b> of WA was tested by the WASCA, and the real pupil size was tested by Pentacam. The corneal eccentricity (E value) and curvature was also measured with the Pentacam. All the measurements were performed under mydriatic condition. For uncorrected myopic eyes, the <b>measured</b> <b>area</b> of WA was similar with the real pupil size. But for the corrected eyes, the <b>measured</b> <b>area</b> of WA was smaller than the real pupil size with a mean difference of 0. 66 ± 0. 54 mm for moderate myopia (t = 6. 45, p < 0. 0001) and 1. 76 ± 0. 55 mm for high myopia (t = 18. 92, p < 0. 0001), but not for mild myopia. The Rx (t = - 3. 20, p = 0. 0017), OZ (t = 64. 4, p < 0. 0001) and postoperative corneal E value (t = 2. 52, p = 0. 017) were the independent factors of <b>measured</b> <b>area</b> of WA. <b>Measured</b> <b>area</b> of WA = - 0. 81 *Rx + 1. 13 *OZ + 0. 49 *postoperative corneal E value (r 2 = 0. 997). The WASCA has a limitation in measuring wavefront aberration over the whole pupil area when it's used for patients received myopic laser surgery.
