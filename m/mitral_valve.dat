5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: To {{understand}} {{papillary muscle}} malformations, {{such as in}} parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> or parachute-like asymmetric <b>mitral</b> <b>valves,</b> we studied the development of papillary muscles. Methods: Normal human hearts at between 5 and 19 weeks of development were studied with immunohistochemistry, three-dimensional reconstructions, and gross inspection. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study human and rat hearts. Results: In embryonic hearts a prominent horseshoe-shaped myocardial ridge runs from the anterior wall through the apex to the posterior wall of the left ventricle. In the atrioventricular region this ridge is continuous with atrial myocardium and covered with cushion tissue. The anterior and posterior parts of the trabecular ridge enlarge and loosen their connections with the atrial myocardium. Their lateral sides gradually delaminate from the left ventricular wall, and the continuity between the two parts is incorporated in the apical trabecular network. In this way the anterior and posterior parts of the ridge transform into the anterolateral and the posteromedial papillary muscles, respectively. Simultaneously, the cushions remodel into valve leaflets and chordae. Only the chordal part of the cushions remains attached to the developing papillary muscles. Conclusions: Disturbed delamination of the anterior or posterior part of the trabecular ridge from the ventricular wall, combined with underdevelopment of chordae, {{seems to be the}} cause of asymmetric <b>mitral</b> <b>valves.</b> Parachute valves, however, develop when the connection between the posterior and anterior part of the ridge condenses to form one single papillary muscle. Thus parachute valves and parachute-like asymmetric <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> originate in different ways. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998; 116 : 36 - 46...|$|R
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} {{related to}} the King Charles Spaniel include <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> disease, in which the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers {{of the heart and}} eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.|$|E
5|$|The left atrium {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the left}} heart, oxygenated blood is {{returned}} to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E
50|$|Prolapsed <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> are {{classified}} into several subtypes, based on leaflet thickness, {{type of connection}} to the mitral annulus, and concavity. Subtypes {{can be described as}} classic, nonclassic, symmetric, asymmetric, flail, or non-flail.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{radiographic}} appearances include skeletal demineralization, expanded {{shafts of}} the metacarpals and phalanges with widenend medullary cavities, cardiomegaly, and intramural calcification of the proximal aorta with occasional extension into the aortic or <b>mitral</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
40|$|Audible cardiac murmurs are {{uncommon}} and {{may indicate}} severe native valve dysfunction. In six patients with bioprosthetic <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> audible honking systolic murmurs suddenly developed. Doppler echocardiography showed characteristic striated regurgitant signals. At operation each prosthesis had torn cusps. New audible murmurs and striated Doppler signals originating from <b>mitral</b> bioprosthetic <b>valves</b> are indicators of cusp tears. Recognition {{of this is}} important because early detection of prosthetic valve dysfunction may improve subsequent surgical outcome...|$|R
5|$|The valves {{between the}} atria and ventricles {{are called the}} {{atrioventricular}} valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three papillary muscles named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions. The <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. It {{is also known as}} the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.|$|E
25|$|Degenerative (myxomatous) <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> disease* is {{a common}} cause of {{congestive}} heart failure in dogs, especially small, older dogs. The leaflets of the valve become thickened and nodular, leading to <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation and volume overload of {{the left side of the}} heart. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Dachshunds have an inherited form of this disease.|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{determining}} the pathogenic role of transforming growth factor- 1 (TGF- 1) in the mechanism of chronic rheumatic heart disease, we evaluated the expression of TGF- 1, proliferation of myofibroblasts, and changes in extracellular matrix components including collagen and proteoglycan in 30 rheumatic <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> and in 15 control valves. High TGF- 1 expression was identified in 21 cases (70 %) of rheumatic <b>mitral</b> <b>valves,</b> whereas only 3 cases (20 %) of the control group showed high TGF- 1 expression (p< 0. 001). Additionally, increased proliferation of myofibroblasts was observed in the rheumatic valves. High TGF- 1 expression positively correlated {{with the proliferation of}} myofibroblasts (p= 0. 004), valvular fibrosis (p< 0. 001), inflammatory cell infiltration (p= 0. 004), neovascularization (p= 0. 007), and calcification (p< 0. 001) in the valvular leaflets. The ratio of proteoglycan to collagen deposition inversely correlated with TGF- 1 expression in <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> (p= 0. 040). In conclusion, an ongoing inflammatory process, the expression of TGF- 1, and proliferation of myofibroblasts within the valves have a potential role in the valvular fibrosis, calcification, and changes in the extracellular matrix that lead to the scarring sequelae of rheumatic heart disease...|$|R
25|$|Intravenous {{drug users}} {{tend to get}} their right-sided heart valves {{infected}} because the veins that are injected drain into {{the right side of}} the heart.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{biochemical}} study {{compared the}} extracellular matrix of normal <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> and myxomatous <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> with either unileaflet prolapse (ULP) or bileaflet prolapse (BLP). BackgroundMyxomatous <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> are weaker and more extensible than normal valves, and myxomatous chordae are more mechanically compromised than leaflets. Despite histological evidence that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) accumulate in myxomatous valves, previous biochemical analyses have not adequately examined the different GAG classes. MethodsLeaflets and chordae from myxomatous valves (n = 41 ULP, 31 BLP) and normal valves (n = 27) were dried, dissolved, and assayed for deoxyribonucleic acid, collagen, and total GAGs. Specific GAG classes were analyzed with selective enzyme digestions and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis. ResultsBiochemical changes were {{more pronounced in}} chordae than in leaflets. Myxomatous leaflets and chordae had 3 % to 9 % more water content and 30 % to 150 % higher GAG concentrations than normal. Collagen concentration was slightly elevated in the myxomatous valves. Chordae from ULP had 62 % more GAGs than those from BLP, primarily from elevated levels of hyaluronan and chondroitin- 6 -sulfate. ConclusionsThe GAG classes elevated in the myxomatous chordae are associated with matrix microstructure and elastic fiber deficiencies and may influence the hydration-related “floppy” nature of these tissues. These abnormalities {{may be related to}} the reported mechanical weakness of myxomatous chordae. The biochemical differences between ULP and BLP confirm previous mechanical and echocardiographic distinctions...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: The primary aim was {{to study}} the {{expression}} of CD 44 protein in the heart valves removed surgically for either stenosis or regurgitation and to study the morphology of valves using histochemical staining. Approach: We studied 107 valves which were collected from the International Centre for Cardio Thoracic and Vascular Diseases. Results: Aortic and <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> {{were obtained from the}} centre and processed in research pathology lab. CD 44 protein is a receptor for the ligand hyaluronic acid which causes inflammation in the heart valves. A total of 107 valves were studied. Of the 61 <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> studied 38 (62. 2 %) showed CD 44 positivity as brownish granules within the cytoplasm. Of the 46 aortic valves studied 19 (41. 3 %) showed CD 44 positivity as brownish granules within the cytoplasm. The valves showed evidence of past inflammation showing thick and thin walled blood vessels and lymphocytes. CD 44 protein increased in 62. 2 % of <b>mitral</b> <b>valves,</b> of which 60. 5 % were from patients presenting when they were less than 40 years old. CD 44 protein increased in 41. 3 % of aortic valves, of which 63. 15 % were from patients presenting when they were less than 40 years old. CD 44 positivity was seen in 57 valves as brownish granules within the cytoplasm of the cell. CD 44 protein increased in 53. 27 % of <b>mitral</b> and aortic <b>valves,</b> of which 63. 15 % were from the males patients. CD 44 protein increased in 53. 27 % of <b>mitral</b> and aortic <b>valves,</b> of which 36. 84 % were from the females patients. Conclusion/Recommendations: The results showed CD 44 is over expressed in the heart valves removed surgically for stenosis or regurgitation where the hyaluronic acid content is high...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundKnowledge {{of heart}} valve vascularity is an {{important}} factor for understanding the valvular pathology and to develop tissue-engineered valves for repair procedures. Some investigators believe that blood vessels may exist in normal human heart valves whereas some recent publications have proposed that the presence of blood vessels in the valves is secondary to inflammation. MethodsTissues from 60 normal formalin-fixed human hearts were examined microscopically for type, location, and number of vessels in atrioventricular valves. The age of the patient ranged from 10 to 70  years, and an attempt was made to study the age-related morphologic changes in atrioventricular valves. ResultsOf the 60 tricuspid and 60 <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> examined, 12 tricuspid (20 %) and 14 mitral (23. 33 %) valves were found to have vessels without the presence of an inflammatory process. In tricuspid valves the vessels were observed mainly in the fibrosa layer with a range of 1 to 4 vessels, whereas in <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> the vessels were situated mainly in the spongiosa layer with a range of 1 to 2 vessels. The maximum vascularity was seen in the fourth decade of life, in which the vessels were found in 40 % of both tricuspid and <b>mitral</b> <b>valves.</b> The mean transverse diameter of these vessels was 0. 23  ±  0. 18  mm, with a range of 0. 06 to 0. 79  mm in tricuspid valves, whereas it was 0. 15  ±  0. 08  mm, with a range of 0. 04 to 0. 4  mm in <b>mitral</b> <b>valves.</b> The capillaries (3 - 11 capillaries) were found scattered in the fibrosa and spongiosa with an average lumen area of 0. 39  ±  0. 18  mm 2. ConclusionsThe blood vessels in atrioventricular valves also {{can be seen in the}} absence of inflammation and are likely to be a necessary component of valve leaflets. Thus, when performing procedures involving in situ tissue engineering and valve repair the physician needs to be aware of the presence of these vessels in human heart valves...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{assessment}} of different profiles for prosthetic <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> {{can result in}} {{better understanding of the}} physics of transmitral flow for each design. It has been postulated that decreasing the profile height of the <b>mitral</b> bioprosthetic <b>valve</b> has potential clinical benefit. In the present study, we compared the atrial and ventricular flow characteristics in different conditions using Carpentier-Edwards Perimount <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> with various profile heights. Each valve was placed at the intersection of the left ventricle, made of transparent silicone rubber, and the left atrium in Caltech's left heart pulsed flow simulator system. Digital particle image velocimetry has been used as the quantitative flow visualization technique. With the intention of studying the blood wash out around each valve, circulation and particle residence time were computed based on the vorticity and velocity fields around each valve, respectively. Results show that by increasing the profile's height at the atrial side of the valve, the magnitude of circulation near the atrial side of the valve decreases while particle residence time increases. However, extreme reduction of profile height in the ventricular side may increase the magnitude of circulation around the valve and decrease the particle residence time. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{present study}} investigates {{outcomes}} {{one month after}} implanting pigs with a novel <b>mitral</b> <b>valved</b> stent. METHODS: A novel nitinol stent custom designed for this study included a bovine pericardial valve. Six pigs received a valved stent into the mitral position {{by means of the}} transapical implantation technique. Afterwards, haemodynamic stability and valve function were assessed, immediately after implantation (n = 6), 4 weeks (n = 4) and 8 weeks (n = 1) thereafter using transoesophageal echocardi-ography (TEE), ventriculography and cardiac computed tomography (CT). Four of 6 surviving pigs were sacrificed at 4 weeks after implantation and one at 8 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: Optimal deployment and positioning were obtained in all but one animal. This animal died of unrecognized imperfect valved stent positioning after 4 days. The average mean gradient across the new valves and the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) were small. Mild regurgitation developed after valved stent deployment in one of six animals just after 1 h, and in none thereafter. All animals exhibited normal haemodynamics after <b>mitral</b> <b>valved</b> stent implantation, and stability was maintained throughout the monitor-ing period. Migration, embolization and paravalvular leakage were not evident in the remaining animals after 4 and 8 weeks. Gross evaluation revealed that 50 – 70 % of the atrial element was covered by tissue growth at 4 weeks/ 8 weeks.
