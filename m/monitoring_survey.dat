5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia. He quoted that “Population is our most valuable resource and we can only take stock of it through an activity like the census. We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Survey</b> (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E

Out of the disabled, 90.2 per cent were employed and the literacy rate of the disabled population remained at 58.6 per cent compared to the general literacy rate of 70.2 per cent. Albinism is a condition where people have little or no pigment in their eyes, skin or hair. As per the census, there were 25,324 albino people in the country with 12,532 males (49.48%) and 12,792 females (50.52%). The literacy rate of albino population was 66.1 per cent.|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{subsurface}} can be imaged {{by subtracting}} seismic reflection data at two different states, one {{serving as the}} initial survey or base, and the second as the <b>monitor</b> <b>survey.</b> Conventionally, the reflection data are acquired by placing active seismic sources at the acquisition surface. Alternatively, these data can be acquired from passive sources in the subsurface, using seismic interferometry. Unfortunately, the reflection responses as retrieved by seismic interferometry inherit an imprint of the passive source distribution. Therefore, monitoring with seismic interferometry requires high passive source repeatability, which is often not achievable in practice. We propose an alternative, by using active seismic data for the base survey and a single passive source for the <b>monitor</b> <b>survey.</b> By constraining the radiation pattern of the (active) base survey according to {{the characteristics of the}} (passive) <b>monitor</b> <b>survey,</b> we succeed to extract time-lapse response in the image domain.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} {{associated with}} time-lapse surveys is ensuring the repeatability between the baseline and <b>monitor</b> <b>surveys.</b> Non-repeatability between the surveys is caused by varying environmental conditions {{over the course of}} different surveys. To overcome this challenge, we propose the use of interferometric full waveform inversion (IFWI) for inverting the velocity model from data recorded by baseline and <b>monitor</b> <b>surveys.</b> A known reflector is used as the reference reflector for IFWI, and the data are naturally redatumed to this reference reflector using natural reflections as the redatuming operator.

40|$|Analysis of {{deformations}} of {{any type}} of a deformable body includes geometrical analysis and physical interpretation. The ultimate goal of the geometrical analysis is to determine in the whole deformable object the displacement and strain fields in the space and time domains. The latter may be obtained by deterministic modelling of deformations using, for example, finite element method (FEM). Physical interpretation is to establish {{the relationship between the}} causative factors (loads) and the deformations. By comparing the geometrical and deterministic model of deformations, one can verify the designed behaviour of the deformable object. In addition, with properly designed <b>monitoring</b> <b>surveys,</b> one may also determine the actual deformation mechanism and explain causes of deformation in a case of unexpected behaviour of the investigated object. Thus, the role of deformation <b>monitoring</b> <b>surveys</b> becomes much broader than just the conventional determination of the geometrical status of the deformable object. In this presentation two examples are given on the use of geodetic <b>monitoring</b> <b>surveys</b> in (a) determination of effects of hydrological changes on ground subsidence in a potash mine in Canada and (b) verification of geomechanical parameters of a large earth dam in California during filling up the water reservoir. 1...|$|R
