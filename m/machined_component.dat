30|$|Surface {{integrity}} of a <b>machined</b> <b>component</b> significantly affects its performance such as fatigue life, creep and corrosion. Surface {{integrity of}} a <b>machined</b> <b>component</b> may include residual stresses, recast layer, heat-affected zone and microcracks (Klink et al. 2011). In past, several investigations {{have been carried}} out for machining performance of nickel-based alloys except Monel, with conventional and non-conventional machining processes. Due to high heat-resisting capacity, nickel-based alloys are very difficult to machine with conventional machining processes such as milling, turning and drilling (Wei 2002; Sharman et al. 2006; Krain et al. 2007; Soo et al. 2011; Hood et al. 2011; Antar et al. 2011). Machining of nickel alloys using conventional cutting tools results in the formation of built-up edge on tool face and high tendency of welding to the tool, resulting in large crater wear and poor surface integrity involving several surface defects such as surface drag, material pull-out/cracking and tearing surface. (Ulutan and Ozel 2011; Kortabarria et al. 2011; Herbert et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|The surface {{integrity}} of a <b>machined</b> <b>component</b> {{that meets the}} demands of a specific application requirement is defined by several characteristics. The residual stress profile into the component is often considered as the critical characteristics as it carries a direct effect on the fatigue life of a <b>machined</b> <b>component.</b> A significant amount of effort has been dedicated by researchers to predict post process stress in a workpiece using analytical, experimental, and numerical modeling methods. Nonetheless, no methodology is available that can express the cutting process parameters and tool geometry parameters as functions of machined residual stress profile to allow process planning in achieving desired residual stress profile. This research seeks to fill that void by developing a novel approach to enable the extraction of cutting process and tool geometry parameters from a desired or required residual stress profile. More specifically, the model consists in determining the depth of cut, the tool edge radius and the cutting forces needed to obtain a prescribed residual stress profile for an orthogonal machining operation. The model is based on the inverse solution of a physics-based modeling approach of the orthogonal machining operation and the inverse solution of the residual stress prediction from Hertzian stresses. Experimental and modeling data are used to validate the developed model. The work constitutes a novel approach in engineering residual stress in a <b>machined</b> <b>component.</b> Ph. D.

40|$|Metal cutting is {{a widely}} used {{manufacturing}} technique in the industry and {{has been the focus}} of many research and studies in both academic and industrial fields. Prediction of induced residual stresses in a <b>machined</b> <b>component</b> is essential in a component’s fatigue life and surface integrity approximation. Furthermore, it plays a significant role in optimizing cutting process conditions as well as cutting tool geometries. Research has found that using experimental techniques in measuring residual stresses in a <b>machined</b> <b>component</b> is both time consuming and expensive as a method. In the attempt of eliminating the post process measuring drawbacks, the finite element modeling and simulation has proven its efficiency, as a tool, in predicting mechanical and thermal variables, hence, providing a pre-process prediction of variables which may prevent future component failures. This thesis uses the finite element method to study, model and simulate orthogonal metal cutting using the commercial software DEFORM. Orthogonal cutting simulations of 20 NiCrMo 5 steel are performed and simulation results are validated against experimental data. The influence of the feed rate, cutting speed and rake angle variations on the induced residual stress are investigated and analyzed. Simulation results offer an insight into cutting parameters and tool geometry influence on the induced residual stresses. Based on the simulation results, cutting speed and rake angle showed a trend when varying the parameters on the induced residual stress; however more investigation is needed in determining a trend for the feed rate influence...|$|E
