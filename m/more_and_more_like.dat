25|$|Gurdjieff {{argued that}} many of the {{existing}} forms of religious and spiritual tradition on Earth had lost connection with their original meaning and vitality and so could no longer serve humanity in the way that had been intended at their inception. As a result, humans were failing to realize the truths of ancient teachings and were instead becoming <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> automatons, susceptible to control from outside and increasingly capable of otherwise unthinkable acts of mass psychosis such as World War I. At best, the various surviving sects and schools could provide only a one-sided development, which did not result in a fully integrated human being.|$|E

500|$|King was {{a middle}} child, between an older sister, Willie Christine King, {{and a younger}} brother, Alfred Daniel Williams King. King sang with his church choir at the 1939 Atlanta premiere of the movie Gone with the Wind. King liked singing and music. His mother was an {{accomplished}} organist and choir leader, and she took him to various churches to sing. He received attention for singing [...] "I Want to Be <b>More</b> <b>and</b> <b>More</b> <b>Like</b> Jesus." [...] King later {{became a member of}} the junior choir in his church.|$|E
500|$|The multitudinous {{allusions to}} {{well-known}} and lesser-known books, movies and sayings cause contradicting receptions. While Heinz Gerstinger and Ingrid Reichel explicitly highlight the comical {{effect of the}} insinuations, the German critic Steffen Roye regards them as sometimes [...] "exaggerated" [...] and says, [...] "As the story develops, it becomes <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a revue." [...] The numerous expressions in foreign languages, especially in Latin, remain untranslated in the first edition. In her review, Ingrid Reichel invites the publisher to add a glossary to a new edition. The author subsequently released such a glossary on his own website.|$|E

500|$|On 27 September 1939, Himmler {{ordered the}} {{creation}} of the Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA); the new organisation encompassed the intelligence service, security services, secret state and criminal police. The RSHA was divided into main departments, including the Kripo, which became Department V of the RSHA. Department V was also known as the Reich Criminal Police Office (Reichskriminalpolizeiamt, or RKPA). Kripo's stated mission, which Nebe embraced, was to [...] "exterminate criminality". Under his leadership, equipped with arbitrary powers of arrest and detention, the Kripo acted <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Gestapo, including the liberal use of so-called protective custody and large-scale roundups of [...] "asocials".|$|E
500|$|McDiarmid's {{performance}} as Palpatine was generally well received by critics. Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "Entertaining {{from start to}} finish and even enthralling at times, 'Sith' has some acting worth writing home about, specifically McDiarmid's dominant turn as the mastermind of the evil empire." [...] A reviewer for The Village Voice wrote that [...] "Ian McDiarmid's unctuous Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts to draw Anakin into the Sith fold with promises of eternal life." [...] Still, his performance was not without detractors; David Edelstein of Slate critiqued, [...] "McDiarmid isn't the subtlest of satanic tempters. With his lisp and his clammy little leer, he looks like an old queen keen on trading an aging butt-boy (Count Dooku) for fresh meat [...] which leaves Anakin looking <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a 15-watt bulb." [...] McDiarmid had expressed interest in reprising the role of Palpatine in the planned [...] TV series, which remains unproduced.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, at {{the second}} UAHC convention, Witt had {{asserted}} that America [...] "by its very pleasantness and friendliness lures us away from our ancient loyalties. Its secularism is so delightful, its mutuality so penetrative, its universalism so delightful, that by a sort of sheer spiritual osmosis it incorporates us into itself and makes us look and become <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> itself". Witt argued that Jews had to resist this pull. Ten years later, however, in a 1939 article in The Christian Century, he argued that Jews should celebrate Christmas. In his view, Christians were now more liberal and celebrated [...] "the inherent humanness and universalism" [...] of Christmas, rather than any specifically Christian doctrine. Stating that his children had been deprived of the holiday's pleasures, Witt asserted that Judaism was already a syncretic religion, and that celebrating the holiday was an ecumenical act which did not indicate that he was [...] "thereby drawn even by the breadth of a hair nearer to the worship of an ecclesiastical Christ". He concluded by asking [...] "Is it neither treason of Jew nor triumph of Christian but partnership of Jew and Christian {{in the making of}} a better world in which the Christ can have part only by energizing and perpetuating and hallowing the partnership?" ...|$|E

500|$|Carl Swanson of New York {{magazine}} was {{amazed by the}} ArtRave, from the Volantis display to the actual party area, and added that [...] " [...] event, mostly staged for Gaga's cameras {{as well as those}} of the feverishly Instagramming guests, was surprisingly well organized for something so manifestly difficult. The idea was clearly to be in control of it." [...] However, he noticed a bit of [...] "vulnerability" [...] in Gaga as she performed onstage. Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as [...] "borderline gibberish", adding that: [...] "It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to something bigger than herself, something less evanescent than pop, or maybe just something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a hashtag in the wind." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that [...] "nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness." [...] Nick Murray of Spin magazine criticized the [...] "underwhelming display" [...] of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about [...] "changing the world" [...] with the album and the technology were [...] "both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when the whole thing was beginning to seem <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a farce, [...] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thieu {{was criticized}} by many opponents and historians, and {{appreciated}} by others. The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, Ellsworth Bunker, told former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird about Thieu: [...] "He {{is an individual}} of very considerable intellectual capacity. He made the decision in the beginning to follow the constitutional road, not to rule with a clique of generals, which many of them expected he would do. He has been acting <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a politician, getting out into the country, following up on pacification, talking to people, seeing what they want." [...] The military historian Lewis Sorley suggests that South Vietnamâs President Nguyen Van Thieu âwas arguably a more honest and decent man than Lyndon Johnson, and â given the differences in their respective circumstances â quite likely a more effective president of his country.â ...|$|E

5000|$|In addiction, the [...] "liking" [...] (pleasure or hedonic value) {{of a drug}} {{or other}} {{stimulus}} becomes dissociated from [...] "wanting" [...] (i.e., desire or craving) due to the sensitization of incentive salience.

2500|$|He was a {{convinced}} protectionist, {{wishing to}} shelter French industry against {{free trade and}} foreign competition. On this issue {{he was in a}} minority; the Assembly voted 367 to 297 to reduce tariffs on imported goods. Thiers offered his resignation, which was rejected by the Assembly; with only eight dissenting voices, they insisted that he remain as President. Thiers was an advocate of obligatory long military service; he pushed through a law requiring obligatory service of five years for French men. To the monarchists, he seemed <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a republican. He told them, [...] "I found the Republic already made. A monarchy is impossible because there are three dynasties for a single throne."

2500|$|Watts {{sought to}} resolve his {{feelings}} of alienation from {{the institutions of}} marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in [...] "Divine Madness" [...] and on perception of the organism-environment in [...] "The Philosophy of Nature". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures. He also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament; writing, for example, in the early 1960s: [...] "Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruinâespecially when the things we make and build are beginning to look <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> rubbish even before they are thrown away?" [...] These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for NET (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which {{he noted that the}} single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.|$|E
2500|$|Kinnock and Hattersley {{attempted}} to rehabilitate Labour after 1983. After the Miners' Strike they resumed expelling {{members of the}} entryist Militant group whose activities, organisation and politics had earlier been found to contravene the Labour Party's constitution. In 1988 they fought off a leadership challenge by Tony Benn, Eric Heffer, and John Prescott. Defeat in 1987 was expected; by 1992 {{it was much more}} even. Labour had regularly topped opinion polls since 1989 and at one stage had a lead of up to 15 points over the Tories, though this was cut back and more than once overhauled by the Tories after the resignation of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister to make way for John Major in November 1990. In the run-up to the 1992 election, Hattersley was present at the Labour Party rally in his native Sheffield and backed up Kinnock with the claim that [...] "with every day that passes, Neil looks <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the real tenant of number 10 Downing Street".|$|E

2500|$|Out of high school, Anderson was {{considered}} capable of playing any of four {{positions on the}} court, from point guard to power forward, drawing comparisons to basketball legends Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Anderson's high school coach Bob Hurley said, [...] "I think he's a modern-day Magic Johnson. I think that let him play the point. He gets everybody shots. You donât have him back defensively balancing the floor, youâre wasting him. But you let him {{do a lot of}} what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you donât bother guarding him on the little guy. Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if heâs a step-out player. And now you have a guy like Larry Bird who anticipates. He gets a lot of deflections and steals. Heâs long, he blocks shots. And then when he gets a defensive rebound, you got a fast-break started already." [...] During his sophomore year in UCLA, CBSSports.com wrote that Anderson was [...] "starting to look <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Magic Johnson of the 2013â14 season in college basketball." [...] ESPN analyst Dick Vitale warned against calling him the next Magic Johnson, but stated that [...] "he has the mini-version of that kind of skill.â USA Today commented that he was [...] "kind of a poor man's Magic Johnson".|$|E
