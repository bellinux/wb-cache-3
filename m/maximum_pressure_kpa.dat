40|$|Background: The foot posture {{index is}} a static {{measurement}} that splits up the foot posture into neutral, pronatus and supinatus. However, {{the relation between}} the foot posture and the plantar pressure standards is not well known. For this, the objective of this research is to check the relationship between the foot posture and plantar pressure standard. Subjects and Material: 144 participants (101 women and 43 men), mean age 25. 4 +/- 6. 3 years, were measured for the FPI. The pedobarometric measurement was made with the plantar pressure platform, we measured total surface (cm(2)), mean pressure (kPa) and <b>maximum</b> <b>pressure</b> (<b>kPa),</b> these measurements were correlated with the FPI measurements. Results: 288 feet were analysed with regard to the correlation between point 5 of FPI (medial arch height) and the plantar surface total area (p = 0. 038) : lower arch height and supinated foot are related to the maximum pressure points with p = 0. 029. The total contact surface can be determined with the final score of the FPI, the scores of FPI 3, 5 and 6 FPI (r(2) = 0. 059, p < 0. 001) with a 5. 9 % prediction. Conclusion: The supinatus foot is correlated statistically significantly through the maximum pressure and the plantar surface with the pronatus foot...|$|E
40|$|Impaired endothelial {{function}} in isolated human uremic resistance arteries. BackgroundPatients with {{chronic renal failure}} (CRF) face a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular death. CRF is frequently complicated by hypertension and changes in both the heart (left ventricular hypertrophy) and the vasculature (endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis). The mechanisms underlying changes in vascular function and specifically endothelial dysfunction are unclear. This present study therefore examined subcutaneous resistance artery {{function in}} vitro, comparing adult uremic patients and controls using wire myography. MethodsSubcutaneous fat biopsies were obtained from 12 patients with CRF (median serum creatinine 735 μmol/L) {{at the time of}} renal transplantation or peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion, and from eight controls without renal disease at the time of abdominal surgery. Resistance arteries were mounted on a wire myograph. Their contractile ability was tested with high potassium depolarization, and endothelial integrity was tested by relaxation to acetylcholine. Cumulative concentration-response curves were then constructed for norepinephrine, endothelin- 1, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). ResultsFollowing preconstriction with norepinephrine, vessels from uremic patients vasodilated less well to acetylcholine compared with vessels from controls [maximum % relaxation 77 % (range 41, 97) vs. 98 % (78, 100), P < 0. 001]. The vasodilation to SNP was similar [95 % (63, 100) vs. 94 % (71, 100), P = 0. 751]. There was a trend toward increased <b>maximum</b> <b>pressure</b> (<b>kPa)</b> achieved with both norepinephrine and endothelin- 1 in vessels from uremic patients, and the contractions to both of these agents were more prolonged in the uremic vessels. ConclusionsThe pattern of normal vasodilation to SNP but reduced vasodilation to acetylcholine is consistent with endothelial dysfunction due to impaired nitric oxide (NO) production in uremic vessels. Similar results have been demonstrated in vivo in uremia, one suggested mechanism being accumulation of endogenous inhibitors of NO synthase such as asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). This in vitro study suggests that a short-lived circulating factor is not entirely responsible and that there may be an inherent abnormality in endothelial function in uremia, although the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. Endothelial dysfunction may predispose the patient to accelerated atherosclerosis and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in end-stage renal failure...|$|E

40|$|When {{transferring}} propellant in space, it is {{most efficient}} to transfer single phase liquid from a propellant tank to an engine. In earth s gravity field or under acceleration, propellant transfer is fairly simple. However, in low gravity, withdrawing single-phase fluid becomes a challenge. A variety of propellant management devices (PMD) are used to ensure single-phase flow. One type of PMD, a liquid acquisition device (LAD) takes advantage of capillary flow and surface tension to acquire liquid. The present work reports on testing with liquid oxygen (LOX) at elevated pressures (and thus temperatures) (<b>maximum</b> <b>pressure</b> 1724 <b>kPa</b> and <b>maximum</b> temperature 122 K) as part of NASA s continuing cryogenic LAD development program. These tests evaluate LAD performance for LOX stored in higher pressure vessels {{that may be used}} in propellant systems using pressure fed engines. Test data shows a significant drop in LAD bubble point values at higher liquid temperatures, consistent with lower liquid surface tension at those temperatures. Test data also indicates that there are no first order effects of helium solubility in LOX on LAD bubble point prediction. Test results here extend the range of data for LOX fluid conditions, and provide insight into factors affecting predicting LAD bubble point pressures...|$|R

Four hinge-type electromagnetic actuators arranged serially in one line pinch a flexible tube and generate peristaltic motion on the tube.

40|$|On {{purpose to}} realize a novel {{flexible}} micro-hand for biological and medical applications, {{this paper presents}} {{a major step forward}} in this direction by directly integrating micropumps into eccentric tube type micro-fingers driven by the ECF (Electro-Conjugate Fluid) jet. ECF is a functional fluid which can generate the strong jet by applying high DC voltage between the electrodes. The ECF eccentric tube type micro-hand (ECF-ETMH) comprises three elastic PDMS micro-fingers with eccentric void and their corresponding MEMS-fabricated ECF micropumps. Because of the geometrical asymmetry created by an eccentric void in a cylindrical elastic body, this micro-finger acts bending motion upon the pressurization of the eccentric void by the ECF jet. Each ECF micropump has 41 pairs of a triangular prism and slit electrodes (TPSEs) that are designed to generate <b>maximum</b> <b>pressures</b> of 300 <b>kPa</b> at the applied voltage of 3. 5 kV. We successfully fabricated eccentric tube type micro-fingers (ETMF) by high aspect ratio micromolding.

30|$|Strap {{pressure}} exerted on {{the shoulders}} (bra strap-shoulder interface) was measured while the participants stood stationary and upright prior to running (static condition) and then while they ran on the treadmill (dynamic condition) during each strap condition.

The sensors were secured with micropore surgical tape (3 M™ Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia) and zeroed prior to the 10 -s of static pressure data collection, the six 10 -s samples during the steady state treadmill running and the 10 -s static pressure recording once the running was completed.

40|$|Biological tissues are {{subjected}} to complex loading states in vivo {{and in order to}} define constitutive equations that effectively simulate their mechanical behaviour under these loads, it is necessary to obtain data on the tissue's response to multiaxial loading. Single axis and shear testing of biological tissues is often carried out, but biaxial testing is less common. We sought to design and commission a biaxial compression testing device, capable of obtaining repeatable data for biological samples. The apparatus comprised a sealed stainless steel pressure vessel specifically designed such that a state of hydrostatic compression could be created on the test specimen while simultaneously unloading the sample along one axis with an equilibrating tensile pressure. Thus a state of equibiaxial compression was created perpendicular to the long axis of a rectangular sample. For the purpose of calibration and commissioning of the vessel, rectangular samples of closed cell ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) foam were tested. Each sample was subjected to repeated loading, and nine separate biaxial experiments were carried out to a <b>maximum</b> <b>pressure</b> of 204 <b>kPa</b> (30 psi), with a relaxation time of two hours between them. Calibration testing demonstrated the force applied to the samples had a maximum error of 0. 026 N (0. 423 % of maximum applied force). Under repeated loading, the foam sample demonstrated lower stiffness during the first load cycle. Following this cycle, an increased stiffness, repeatable response was observed with successive loading. While the experimental protocol was developed for EVA foam, preliminary results on this material suggest that this device may be capable of providing test data for biological tissue samples. The load response of the foam was characteristic of closed cell foams, with consolidation during the early loading cycles, then a repeatable load-displacement response upon repeated loading. The repeatability of the test results demonstrated the ability of the test device to provide reproducible test data and the low experimental error in the force demonstrated the reliability of the test data...|$|R
