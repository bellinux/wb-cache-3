5|$|In late 1969, Zappa {{broke up}} the band. He often cited the {{financial}} strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some {{took it as a}} sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on Weasels Ripped <b>My</b> <b>Flesh</b> and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).|$|E

500|$|The sixth {{movement}} is an alto recitative. The lengthy text begins [...] "" [...] (How might then I, O Lord, sufficiently repay thee {{for all that}} thou hast done, <b>my</b> <b>flesh</b> and soul to feed?). It is a further supplication to God, giving thanks for His gifts, recognizing the duty to help the needy and praying to be rewarded in the hereafter. Like the first recitative, it is declamatory without arioso sections; but in this case, instead of a bare bass line, it is accompanied by sustained chords in the string section, marked piano, which help create the prayer-like mood.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] Jesus states that: [...] "he who eats <b>my</b> <b>flesh</b> {{and drinks}} my blood has eternal life, and I will raise {{him up at}} the last day." [...] This has been transposed, not only into a {{relationship}} with Jesus in common with Christian Theology but also into the Eucharist as an element of obtaining eternal life.

2500|$|In addition, {{his work}} with jazz and rock {{producer}} Alan Douglas allowed Dolphy's style to posthumously spread to musicians in the jazz fusion and rock environments, most notably with artists John McLaughlin and Jimi Hendrix. Frank Zappa, who drew his inspiration {{from a variety of}} musical styles and idioms, paid tribute to Dolphy in the instrumental [...] "The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue" [...] (on the 1970 album Weasels Ripped <b>My</b> <b>Flesh)</b> and listed Dolphy as an influence on the liner notes for the Mothers' first LP, Freak Out!.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting [...] Rabbi Levi {{taught that}} [...] "{{violence}}" [...] ( [...] , chamas) connotes idolatry, sexual immorality, and murder, {{as well as}} robbery.

2500|$|Akbar {{had started}} a {{religion}} called Din-i-Ilahi, which acknowledged him as God's representative on earth and had a combination of Hindu and Muslim beliefs. In the Ain-i-Akbari (The Institutes of Akbar), it is mentioned that Birbal {{was one of the}} few people other than Akbar who were its followers, besides being the only Hindu. He had a close association with Akbar, despite being fourteen years elder than him; of the nine ratnas, Birbal was often called the brightest jewel. Badaoni referred to this in sarcasm, as [...] "a case of 'thy flesh is <b>my</b> <b>flesh</b> and thy blood my blood'". Akbar is reported to have saved Birbal's life in two instances.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{priests and}} {{former members of}} {{religious}} orders had already married, including Andreas Karlstadt and Justus Jonas, but Luther's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage.

Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524, [...] "I shall never take a wife, as I feel at present. Not that I am insensible to <b>my</b> <b>flesh</b> or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect {{the death of a}} heretic." ...|$|E
