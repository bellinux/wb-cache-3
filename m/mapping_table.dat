50|$|Some {{implementations}} {{do not use}} a <b>mapping</b> <b>table,</b> {{and instead}} calculate locations using an algorithm. These implementations utilize dynamic methods to calculate the location on access, rather than storing the information in a <b>mapping</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{address space}} {{may be limited}} by the {{capacity}} needed to maintain the <b>mapping</b> <b>table.</b> The level of granularity, and the total addressable space both directly impact {{the size of the}} meta-data, and hence the <b>mapping</b> <b>table.</b> For this reason, it is common to have trade-offs, between the amount of addressable capacity and the granularity or access granularity.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} mapping data in peer-topeer data-sharing systems. Such systems often rely {{on the use of}} <b>mapping</b> <b>tables</b> listing pairs of corresponding values to search for data residing in different peers. In this paper, we address semantic and algorithmic issues related to the use of <b>mapping</b> <b>tables.</b> We begin by arguing why <b>mapping</b> <b>tables</b> are appropriate for data mapping in a peer-to-peer environment. We discuss alternative semantics for these tables and we present a language that allows the user to specify <b>mapping</b> <b>tables</b> under different semantics. Then, we show that by treating <b>mapping</b> <b>tables</b> as constraints (called mapping constraints) on the exchange of information between peers it is possible to reason about them. We motivate why reasoning capabilities are needed to manage <b>mapping</b> <b>tables</b> and show the importance of inferring new <b>mapping</b> <b>tables</b> from existing ones. We study the complexity of this problem and we propose an efficient algorithm for its solution. Finally, we present an implementation along with experimental results that show that <b>mapping</b> <b>tables</b> may be managed efficiently in practice. 1...|$|R

Labels or serial numbers stored in a logical unit's storage volume often serve to identify the logical unit. However, the LUN is the only way for an initiator to address a command to a particular logical unit, so initiators often create, via a discovery process, a <b>mapping</b> <b>table</b> of LUN to other identifiers.|$|E
50|$|DS-Lite (Dual-Stack Light) uses tunnels {{from the}} {{customer}} premises equipment to a network address translator at the ISP. The consumer premises equipment encapsulates the IPv4 packets in an IPv6 wrapper and sends them to a host known as the AFTR element. The AFTR element de-encapsulates the packets and performs network address translation before sending them to the public Internet. The NAT in the AFTR uses the IPv6 address of the client in its NAT <b>mapping</b> <b>table.</b> This means that different clients can use the same private IPv4 addresses, therefore avoiding the need for allocating private IPv4 IP addresses to customers or using multiple NATs.|$|E

Like HFS, HFS Plus uses B-trees to store most volume metadata, but unlike most other file systems, HFS Plus supports hard links to directories. HFS Plus permits filenames up to 255 characters in length, and n-forked files similar to NTFS, though until 2005 almost no system software took advantage of forks other than the data fork and resource fork. HFS Plus also uses a full 32-bit allocation <b>mapping</b> <b>table</b> rather than HFS's 16 bits, significantly improving space utilization with large disks.|$|E
5000|$|To address this, Accent {{made the}} port ID's {{internal}} to the kernel only. Instances {{of a program}} opening ports were handed back different IDs, stored in a mapping in the kernel. Whenever a message {{was sent to the}} kernel for delivery, it would first check that the program had access to the port in question by comparing with the <b>mapping</b> <b>table</b> for that program. Guessing port numbers no longer worked, the program's port IDs gave no clue of the [...] "real" [...] IDs in the kernel, and any attempt to talk on one not explicitly handed out by the kernel was an error. Thus Accent's ports represented capabilities, granting rights to use resources as the result of being handed a valid port ID. This kind of capability system, using subject-specific identifiers for capabilities, is called a C-list system.|$|E

However, different peers may use different values to identify or describe the same data.

We illustrate how such tables are used in the Genomics community by expert curators.
