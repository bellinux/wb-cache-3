40|$|Traffic signal <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> {{baseplate}} {{connections are}} particularly susceptible to fatigue. The top of traffic signal <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> welds experience fluctuating tensile stresses when wind and traffic gust loads cause the <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> to oscillate. It has been postulated that UIT application to <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> weld toes during the fabrication process will delay fatigue crack initiation. Successful UIT application during the fabrication process will extend fatigue lives of traffic signal <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> welds in the field. Since <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> welds are the weakest {{spot in the}} traffic signal structure, increased weld life translates into increased traffic signal life. Previous research claims that UIT is light, quiet, and easy to learn. Critical areas under scrutiny during UIT application at the fabrication plant are: time lost due to training workers, time lost during the UIT application, and efficiency of the treated poles. This report investigates the first two issues by documenting the application of UIT to fabricated mast arms at the TransAmerican Power Products facility...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{damage in}} the {{connections}} of single <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> signal support structures {{is one of the}} primary safety concerns because collapse could result from fatigue induced cracking. This type of cantilever signal support structures typically has very light damping and excessively large wind-induced vibration have been observed. Major changes related to fatigue design were made in the 2001 AASHTO LRFD Specification for Structural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaries, and Traffic Signals and supplemental damping devices {{have been shown to be}} promising in reducing the vibration response and thus fatigue load demand on <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> signal support structures. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and optimal use of one type of damping devices termed tuned mass damper (TMD) in vibration response mitigation. Three prototype single <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> signal support structures with 50 -ft, 60 -ft, and 70 -ft respectively are selected for this numerical simulation study. In order to validate the finite element models for subsequent simulation study, analytical modeling of static deflection response of <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> of the signal support structures was performed and found to be close to the numerical simulation results from beam element based finite element model. A 3 -DOF dynamic model was then built using analytically derived stiffness matrix for modal analysis and time history analysis. The free vibration response and forced (harmonic) vibration response of the <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> structures from the finite element model are observed to be in good agreement with the finite element analysis results. Furthermore, experimental test result from recent free vibration test of a full-scale 50 -ft <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> specimen in the lab is used to verify the prototype structure’s fundamental frequency and viscous damping ratio. After validating the finite element models, a series of parametric study were conducted to examine the trend and determine optimal use of tuned mass damper on the prototype single <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> signal support structures by varying the following parameters: mass, frequency, viscous damping ratio, and location of TMD. The numerical simulation study results reveal that two parameters that influence most the vibration mitigation effectiveness of TMD on the single <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> signal pole structures are the TMD frequency and its viscous damping ratio...|$|E

40|$|This project {{evaluates the}} {{physical}} and economic feasibility of using existing traffic infrastructure to mount wind power generators. Some possible places to mount a light weight wind generator and solar panel hybrid system are: i) Traffic signal pole and ii) Street Light pole.

This project assesses the structural impacts of the hybrid system on different poles listed above. Lincoln standard plans will be used for identifying the pole and foundation design. Structural analysis involves a first principal for wind load analysis and an explicit finite element analysis using LS-Dyna for evaluating fatigue.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is {{to provide}} {{navigation}} to support automatic shipboard landings in zero visibility conditions. The accuracy, integrity and availability requirements for this system are extremely stringent. In order to meet such demanding navigation performance, a dual-frequency carrier phase differential GPS solution is being pursued. In addition, both the shipboard reference station and the airborne user {{may be subject to}} multiple hostile jamming sources. The system must be able to continuously provide service with little or no drop in integrity and availability. In order to achieve such stringent performance goals in the difficult operating environment of JPALS, advanced technology will likely be required. One likely element will be the use of an antenna array with digital beam/null steering capabilities to help mitigate jamming and multi-path errors. This paper will present an initial feasibility study for the use of controlled reception pattern antennas (CRPAs) in the JPALS environment. It will present the benefits and the potential difficulties in the implementation of CRPA algorithms for JPALS use. Due to the motion of the ship and the flexure in the antenna <b>mast</b> <b>arm,</b> there may be some uncertainty in the knowledge of the orientation of the shipboard reference antenna array. This uncertainty leads to errors in the carrier phase output of the CRPA. A simple beam-forming algorithm is presented, and its potential effectiveness for use in JPALS will be presented.

40|$|Traffic signal {{conspicuity}} {{is likely}} to be a factor behind difficulties in detecting traffic signals. There is increasing interest in South Australia in providing <b>mast</b> <b>arm</b> mounted traffic signals at intersections to increase traffic signal conspicuity and reduce specific crash types. This report aims to review best practice principles in the conspicuity of traffic signals and determine the extent to which poor conspicuity of traffic signals contributes to crashes at signalised intersections. Without any recent Australian studies, it is difficult to determine the extent to which crashes result from a failure to detect traffic signals. According to best practice principles, the installation of additional traffic signals on mast arms at intersections has potential to improve traffic signal conspicuity. The second aim of this report is to attempt to quantify any road safety benefits in terms of crash reductions for installing additional signals, specifically traffic signals on mast arms at intersections. Research evidence from a number of evaluations shows that the installation of mast arms at intersections is associated with effects ranging from an estimated 89 per cent reduction in the total number of crashes to a 21 per cent increase in crashes. The greatest crash reductions were reported for right angle crashes (15 - 100 %) while left turn crashes (equivalent to right turn in Australia) were associated with small crash reductions. Although this review shows that mast arms were associated with some crash reductions, it is important to note that these findings are not conclusive as many of the evaluations suffered from poor methodological design.

5000|$|A typical {{alternating}} current furnace {{is powered by}} a three-phase electrical supply and therefore has three electrodes. Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electric arc temperature reaches around 3000 °C (5000 °F), thus causing the lower sections of the electrodes glow incandescently when in operation. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric winch hoists or hydraulic cylinders. The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The <b>mast</b> <b>arms</b> holding the electrodes can either carry heavy busbars (which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the electrode clamps) or be [...] "hot arms", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency. Hot arms can be made from copper-clad steel or aluminium. Large water-cooled cables connect the bus tubes or arms with the transformer located adjacent to the furnace. The transformer is installed in a vault and is water-cooled.|$|R

50|$|The Greek War of Independence {{shifted the}} balance of sea power in the Mediterranean Sea against the Ottoman Empire.

40|$|Traffic signal {{structures}} undergo wind-induced vibrations {{that result}} in fatigue damage accumulation and reduced service life. <b>Mast</b> <b>arms</b> have failed and required removal while in service. A dual experimental and analytical modeling approach is taken to mitigate fatigue and fracture in steel traffic supporting structures. A full-scale prototype structure is instrumented to study natural wind response. Excitation mechanisms are identified, and response is characterized statistically by a lognormal distribution. Helical strakes are found to reduce the vortex-induced vibration of cantilevered traffic signal structures, however are not a panacea for fatigue mitigation as marginal service life gains occur in severe wind environments. A probabilistic framework is extended to assess the risk of wind-induced fatigue and estimate service life while considering uncertainties in fatigue demand and capacity. The framework is successfully demonstrated against compiled inspection records. Locations with higher prevailing winds are susceptible to wind-induced fatigue, but the prevalence of low-speed vortex-induced response is primarily responsible for the early fatigue failures in more mild environments. A low-cost damage avoidance system is proposed to mitigate fatigue and fracture in steel traffic supporting structures. Applied prestress introduces a fail-safe, supplementary load path to balance dead load moment, eradicating the detrimental tensile mean stress found in traffic signal structure connections. Field observations are made without and with the proposed system installed. The benefit of applied prestress is quantified by determining service life without and with the system based on changes in response and fatigue resistance using: (i) a code-based technique; and (ii) the proposed probabilistic framework. Fatigue performance is modeled as mean stress-dependent by modifying nominal stress-life relationships. Service life is shown to increase by an order of magnitude, regardless of wind environment. The concept shows potential to reduce the detrimental effects of non-redundancy {{for a variety of}} similar, fatigue-critical infrastructure components. The validity of simplified mean stress-dependent connection modeling is explored. A fracture mechanics-based, total life (initiation-propagation) model is used to demonstrate the detrimental effect mean stress has on tube-to-transverse base plate fatigue resistance. Using fatigue strength curves derived from total life analyses, probabilistic analyses are repeated to justify the use of simplified models...|$|R

40|$|Prediction of {{the dynamic}} {{behaviour}} of the <b>mast</b> / <b>arm</b> / electrode system of an AC Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) is a rather complex issue because of several phenomena occurring during the melting process. Experience shows that significant vibrations can be observed during EAF operations whose amplitude are dependent on the coupling between mast movement and electromagnetic forces. Control strategy, based on impedance or current, is performed {{by means of an}} hydraulic actuator, which sets the vertical position of the mast column, supporting the electrodes. Magnetic fields, produced by each phase, apply some electromechanical actions among electrodes and arms that produce additional vibrations. A fully coupled model of the EAF system was therefore developed in order to get insights of such phenomena and to provide support to an optimal design of structures. Structures were interpreted as flexible bodies and introduced into a Multi-body dynamics code as well as models of currents and electromechanical actions. Several loading conditions and layouts were compared to detect critical issues of the EAF design and suitably set the related parameters. Some experimental confirmations were found, although a complete validation looks rather difficult because of some severe limitations in accessibility of the system during the melting proces...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{maintaining}} radio communication despite {{the emergence of}} unpredictable fades and nulls in the radiation pattern of an antenna has been proposed. The method was originally intended to be applied {{in the design and}} operation of a radio antenna aboard a robotic exploratory vehicle on a remote planet during communication with a spacecraft in orbit around the planet. The method could also be applied in similar terrestrial situations for example, radio communication between two ground vehicles or between a ground vehicle and an aircraft or spacecraft. The method is conceptually simple, is readily adaptable to diverse situations, and can be implemented without adding greatly to the weight, cost, power demand, or complexity of a system to which it may be applied. The unpredictable fades and nulls in an antenna radiation pattern arise because of electromagnetic interactions between the antenna and other objects within the near field of the antenna (basically, objects within a distance of a few wavelengths). These objects can include general vehicle components, <b>masts,</b> robotic <b>arms,</b> other antennas, the ground, and nearby terrain features. Figure 1 presents representative plots of signal strength versus time during a typical pass of a spacecraft or aircraft through the far field of such an antenna, showing typical nulls and fades caused by nearby objects. The traditional approach to ensuring reliability of communication in the presence of deep fades calls for increasing the effective transmitter power and/or reducing the receiver noise figure at the affected ground vehicle, possibly in combination with appropriate redesign of the equipment at the spacecraft or aircraft end of the communication link. These solutions can be expensive and/or risky and, depending on the application, can add significantly to weight, cost, and power demand. The proposed method entails none of these disadvantages...|$|R
