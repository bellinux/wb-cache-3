5|$|The second {{amendment}} to the articles of agreement was signed in 1978. It legally formalized the free-floating acceptance and gold demonetization achieved by the Jamaica Agreement, and required members to support stable exchange rates through <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>policy.</b> The post-Bretton Woods system was decentralized in that member states retained autonomy in selecting an exchange rate regime. The amendment also expanded the institution's capacity for oversight and charged members with supporting monetary sustainability by cooperating with the Fund on regime implementation. This role is called IMF surveillance and is recognized as a pivotal point {{in the evolution of}} the Fund's mandate, which was extended beyond balance of payments issues to broader concern with internal and external stresses on countries' overall economic policies.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>policy</b> coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E

25|$|Whereas a {{national}} recession is identified by two quarters of decline, defining a global recession is more difficult, because a Developing country {{is expected to}} have a higher GDP growth than a Developed country. According to the IMF, the real GDP growth of the emerging and developing countries is on an uptrend and that of advanced economies is on a downtrend since late 1980s. The world growth is projected to slow from 5% in 2007 to 3.75% in 2008 and to just over 2% in 2009. Downward revisions in GDP growth vary across regions. Among the most affected are commodity exporters, and countries with acute external financing and liquidity problems. Countries in East Asia (including China) have suffered smaller declines because their financial situations are more robust. They have benefited from falling commodity prices and they have initiated a shift toward <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>policy</b> easing.|$|E

In addition tensions have grown in the agricultural sector when implementing land reforms. The lay-offs in the manufacturing sector have led people to seek livelihoods in the informal sector or in agriculture which has led to migration of populations to rural areas. This has placed a heavier burden on the fragile ecosystems and the already scarce natural resources in communal areas. There is therefore need to implement sound microeconomic policies together with complimentary measures in order to address difficulties in the forestry sector...|$|R

500|$|Elements {{of modern}} {{macroeconomic}} consensus were criticized following the financial crisis. Robert Solow {{testified before the}} U.S. Congress that DSGE modeling [...] "has nothing useful to say about anti-recession policy because it has built into its essentially implausible assumptions the 'conclusion' {{that there is nothing}} for <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>policy</b> to do." [...] Solow also criticized DSGE models for frequently assuming that a single, [...] "representative agent" [...] can represent the complex interaction of the many diverse agents that make up the real world. Robert Gordon criticized much of macroeconomics after 1978. Gordon called for a renewal of disequilibrium theorizing and disequilibrium modeling. He disparaged both new classical and new Keynesian economists who assumed that markets clear; he called for a renewal of economic models that could included both market clearing and sticky-priced goods, such as oil and housing respectively. While criticizing DSGE models, Ricardo J. Caballero argues that recent work in finance shows progress and suggests that modern macroeconomics needed to be re-centered but not scrapped {{in the wake of the}} financial crisis.|$|E

This paper assesses the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>policies</b> adopted in Nigeria and the effect of these policies on agricultural output growth overtime. The results show that the country’s exchange rate regime has not encouraged agricultural export lately. Although credit to the sector had no significant effect on agricultural output growth, its availability greatly depends on how high the nominal interest rates are. On the whole, <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>policies</b> that reduce inflation, increase foreign private investment in agriculture, introduce favorable exchange rates, make agricultural credit to have significant effect on agricultural output growth would be invaluable in fortifying government expenditure in the sector and ensure agricultural output growth in Nigeria...|$|R
