40|$|AbstractThe fast-growing {{demand of}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) application for computing resources stimulates the development of high performance computing (HPC) and meanwhile raises new requirements for the technology of parallel application performance <b>monitor</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis.</b> In response to large-scale and long-time running {{for the application of}} CFD, online <b>and</b> scalable performance <b>analysis</b> technology is required to optimize the parallel programs as well as to improve their operational efficiency. As a result, this research implements a scalable infrastructure for online performance analysis on CFD application with homogeneous or heterogeneous system. The infrastructure is part of the parallel application performance <b>monitor</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> system (PAPMAS) <b>and</b> is composed of two modules which are scalable data transmission module and data storage module. The paper analyzes and elaborates this infrastructure in detail with respect to its design and implementation. Furthermore, some experiments are carried out to verify the rationality and high efficiency of this infrastructure that could be adopted to meet the practical needs...|$|R

25|$|The ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) {{will serve}} as the {{independent}} regional surveillance unit of the CMIM. The establishment of AMRO will ensure timely <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> of the ASEAN+3 economies, which will in turn aid in the early detection of risks, swift implementation of remedial actions, and effective decision-making of the CMIM. In particular, the AMRO will, during peace time, conduct annual consultations with individual member economies and, on this basis, prepare quarterly consolidated reports on the macroeconomic assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and individual member countries. On the other hand, the AMRO will, during crisis time, prepare recommendations on any swap request based on its macroeconomic analysis of the swap requesting member and monitor the use and impact of funds once any swap request is approved. AMRO was officially incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in Singapore on 20 April 2011 and its office is at the Monetary Authority of Singapore complex in Singapore. Governance of AMRO is being exercised by the Executive Committee (EC) and its operational direction by the Advisory Panel (AP). AMRO is currently headed by Dr Yoichi Nemoto of Japan, who is serving his second 2-year term until 26 May 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are {{candidates}} for extraterrestrial communication. These high-energy bursts are observed about once {{per day and}} originate throughout the observable universe. SETI currently omits gamma ray frequencies in their <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> because they are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and difficult to detect with ground-based receivers. In addition, the wide burst bandwidths pose a serious analysis challenge for modern digital signal processing systems. Still, the continued mysteries surrounding gamma-ray bursts have encouraged hypotheses invoking extraterrestrials. John A.

[...] In 2015, the Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act (PARA) was passed with two components: requirement of drug companies to provide evidence that antibiotics that are approved for use in poultry, and that meat production does not add to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in humans.
