40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{qualifications}} instructors should have {{by using the}} pair-wise comparison method. The data collection tool included 8 (eight) qualifications regarding students’ demographic data for pair-wise comparison method. Study {{data were collected from}} 1241 students from several faculties and departments in 9 Turkish universities. According to the students’ views, <b>motivating</b> <b>to</b> learn is the leading qualification required of instructors. The first qualification on the list was found to differ by gender. Accordingly, female students rated <b>motivating</b> <b>to</b> learn the most, while male students rated being inquisitive. By grade level, first-year students prefer having content knowledge by instructors, whereas second, third and fourth-year students opt for <b>motivating</b> <b>to</b> learn on instructors’ side. As for distribution by faculties; the students from Education Faculty want instructors <b>to</b> <b>motivate</b> <b>to</b> learn, students from Faculty of Science and Letters require beinginquisitive, Faculty of Pharmacy <b>motivating</b> <b>to</b> learn, Faculty of Law prefer democratic instructors, Economic and Administrative Sciences require having world knowledge, Faculty of Aquaculture <b>motivating</b> <b>to</b> learn, and Faculty of Engineering prefer inquisitive instructors. Distribution of the study results by field shows that <b>motivating</b> <b>to</b> learn is the most wanted qualification by students in applied and social sciences, while having good content knowledge by health students. Lastly, a difference was found between newly founded universities and others. The students studying in newly established students mainly require having good content knowledge, whereas others opt for being inquisitive as required qualifications of instructors...|$|R

30|$|Theoretically, it is {{possible}} to say that admiration <b>motivates</b> <b>to</b> grow by putting oneself in the place of the person who upholds an ideal (Schindler et al. [2013]).

This characterization provides a direct link to the PWB dimensions personal growth and purpose in life. Specifically, dispositional admiration should show a positive relation with personal growth and adoration should be linked to having purpose in life.|$|R

Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals are <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E

5|$|Most {{orthodox}} Christian theologians {{agree with}} the first three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and {{agree with the}} proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4).

The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.|$|E
