40|$|Structural {{materials}} damages {{are always}} {{in the form of}} micro-defects or cracks. Traditional or conventional methods such as micro and <b>macro</b> <b>examination,</b> tensile, bend, impact and hardness tests can be used to detect the micro damage or defects. However, these tests are destructive in nature and not in real-time, thus a non-destructive and real-time monitoring and characterization of the material damage is needed. This study is focused on the application of a non-destructive and real-time acoustic emission (AE) method to study material performance degradation of a high-strength aluminum alloy of high-speed train gearbox shell. By applying data relative analysis and interpretation of AE signals, the characteristic parameters of materials performance were achieved and the failure criteria of the characteristic parameters for the material tensile damage process were established. The results show that the AE method and signal analysis can be used to accomplish the non-destructive and real-time detection of the material performance degradation process of the high-strength aluminum alloy. This technique can be extended to other engineering materials...|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the increased incidence of collaborative arrangements between firms, the competitive environment characterising many industries has undergone profound change. It is suggested that rivalry is not necessarily enacted by individual firms according to the traditional mechanisms of direct confrontation in factor and product markets, but rather as collaborative orchestration between a number of participants or network members. Strategic networks are recognised as sets of firms within an industry that exhibit denser strategic linkages among themselves than other firms within the same industry. Based on this, strategic networks are determined according to evidence of strategic alliances between firms comprising the industry. As a result, a single strategic network represents a group of firms closely linked according to collaborative ties. Arguably, the collective outcome of these strategic relationships engineered between firms suggest that the collaborative benefits attributed to interorganisational relationships require closer examination in respect to their propensity to influence rivalry in intraindustry environments. Derived in large from the social sciences, network theory allows for the micro and <b>macro</b> <b>examination</b> of the opportunities and constraints inherent in the structure of relationships in strategic networks, establishing a relational approach upon which the conduct and performance of firms can be more fully understood. Research to date has yet to empirically investigate the relationship between strategic networks and rivalry. The limited research that has been completed utilising a network rationale to investigate competitive patterns in contemporary industry environments has been characterised by a failure to directly measure rivalry. Further, this prior research has typically embedded investigation in industry settings dominated by technological or regulatory imperatives, such as the microprocessor and airline industries. These industries, due to the presence of such imperatives, are arguably more inclined to support the realisation of network rivalry, through subscription to prescribed technological standards (eg., microprocessor industry) or by being bound by regulatory constraints dictating operation within particular market segments (airline industry). In order to counter these weaknesses, the proposition guiding research - Are patterns of rivalry predicted by strategic network membership? – is embedded in the United States Light Vehicles Industry, an industry not dominated by technological or regulatory imperatives. Further, rivalry is directly measured and utilised in research, thus distinguishing this investigation from prior research efforts. The timeframe of investigation is 1993 – 1999, with all research data derived from secondary sources. Strategic networks were defined within the United States Light Vehicles Industry based on evidence of horizontal strategic relationships between firms comprising the industry. The measure of rivalry used to directly ascertain the competitive patterns of industry participants was derived from the traditional Herfindahl Index, modified to account for patterns of rivalry observed at the market segment level. Statistical analyses of the strategic network and rivalry constructs found little evidence to support the contention of network rivalry; indeed, greater levels of rivalry were observed between firms comprising the same strategic network than between firms participating in opposing network structures. Based on these results, patterns of rivalry evidenced in the United States Light Vehicle Industry over the period 1993 – 1999 were not found to be predicted by strategic network membership. The findings generated by this research are in contrast to current theorising in the strategic network – rivalry realm. In this respect, these findings are surprising. The relevance of industry type, in conjunction with prevailing network methodology, provides the basis upon which these findings are contemplated. Overall, this study raises some important questions in relation to the relevancy of the network rivalry rationale, establishing a fruitful avenue for further research...|$|E

In this paper our approach is to consider the entire parasite community as a biological indicator of the fish environmental conditions. Seven fish species belonging to the Apogonidae, Apogon bandanensis, A. cookii, A. doderleini, A. norfolkensis, A. trimaculatus, Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus and Fowleria variegata, were sampled on six stations in two bays (Grand-Rade and Sainte-Marie) around Noume´a (New-Caledonia).

A total of 592 fish were dissected for <b>macro</b> parasite <b>examination.</b> Parasites were grouped according to their taxonomical rank and development stage for the analysis. We found an inconsistent effect of the confinement between the two bays, revealing that the parasite community is not the same in the two bays. Moreover, the encysted metacercariae found in the pericardic cavity were found to be significant indicators of the specific anthropogenically impacted environmental conditions prevailing in the inner parts of the two bays.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{dehydration}} of 5 -nitrouracil (5 NU) have resulted in it being classified as a ‘‘channel hydrate’’ in which dehydration proceeds principally by the exit of the water molecules along channels in the structure. We have re-examined this proposal and found that in fact there are no continuous channels in the 5 NU structure that would contribute to such a mechanism. Product water molecules would be immediately trapped in unlinked voids in the crystal structure and would require some additional mechanism to break loose from the crystal.

40|$|Pregnancy {{during the}} teen years {{presents}} sociocultural and biological challenges to mother and baby. Teen mothers {{tend to be}} less physically and psychologically prepared for child bearing and often give birth to underweight babies for social, cultural, and physical reasons. Teen mothers in adverse environments marked by poverty are simultaneously constrained by a lack of access to resources necessary to healthy fetal and maternal development and exposed to risks which can indirectly or directly harm mother and child. Social support mediates the relationship between gravida and environment and contributes to better health outcomes by operating directly to channel resources and indirectly to regulate risk exposure. This study examines how social support contributes to dietary intake during pregnancy by analyzing meal patterning, quality of nutrition and use of prenatal services in relation to social support and mother and child outcomes. Results indicate a strong relationship between social support and higher intakes of nutrients important to pregnancy including folate, magnesium, potassium, calcium and other micro and <b>macro</b> nutrients. <b>Examination</b> of the relationships between dietary behavior and social support demonstrates significant positive relationships between medium to high social support and intakes of folate, magnesium, thiamin, potassium, phosphorus and fat, compliance with prenatal iron prescriptions and overall prenatal iron intakes and significant negative relationships with takeout meals, snacks and sexually-transmitted infections during pregnancy. Meal provisioning by adults is positively associated with higher intakes of Vitamins A, C, riboflavin and fiber and negatively associated with takeout meals, snacks and excessive maternal weight gain. Meal sharing with adults is positively associated with higher intakes of Vitamins A, B 12, C and fiber and negatively correlated with snacking, cervical abnormalities and maternal days in the hospital post-birth. In this study, social support functions as a biocultural process to promote dietary behaviors which may encourage healthy birth outcomes among teen mothers and provides an example of how social support in pregnancy can be visualized as an adaptive strategy in a modern urban setting. ...|$|R
40|$|Humans' {{relationship}} with {{food is a}} much-explored frontier in philosophical, sociological and anthropological research. Micro and <b>macro</b> level <b>examinations</b> of domestic eating habits, cultural attitudes toward food consumption, and contemporary global foodways reveal striking aspects of social organization. Through the dominant research paradigms in these domains {{have been influenced by}} structural linguistics, far less {{attention has been paid to}} humans' {{relationship with}} food from the perspective of linguistics proper. While anthropological linguists have considered taxonomies of food sources and terms describing methods of food preparation, still more provocative insight resides in the examination of taste description across human languages. The lexical field of taste is a unique consideration in light of the perception taxonomies pioneered by Berlin and Kay (1969), and proves to be dissimilar from other perception taxonomies for still more interesting reasons-on one hand due to the physiological complexity of the gustatory system, and on the other due to the culturally situated relevance of dietary habits to taste description across languages. The present study is a general exploration of the universals and variables that bear on any cross linguistic account of taste description, and an overview of the various means by which taste experiences are reported in natural language. It will be shown why the taste lexicon is itself incomplete, and demonstrated through basic corpora that taste description relies heavily on items from lexical domains other than that of taste. Based on this phenomenon, culturally variable patterns in the use of descriptive metaphor will be revealed across languages. Finally, the description of taste will be contextualized with respect to its pragmatic significance in a variety of discourse environments. These taste descriptions reveal that linguistic communities communicate through shared conceptualizations, which make sense of abstract perceptions in terms of things relevant to the community itself. Taste descriptions thus signify dually, according to the "dual" meaning of taste: on one hand as the report of a physiological experience, and on the other as a reflection of shared judgments, values and desires...|$|R

Most model projections of the future path of U. S. external balance show the recent improvement petering out by the end 1989 or so. Key structural factors leading to the expected future worsening of U. S. external balance are two asymmetries [...] the "income asymmetry" and the "pass-through asymmetry". That is, asymmetries in the pricing behavior of U. S. exporters and foreign suppliers and asymmetries in the elasticities of U. S. demand for imports and foreign demand for U. S. exports with respect to economic activity.; However, could projections based on historical relationships be misleading? Have these models ignored important changes in the international environment? Changes in trading partners and composition of trade, in income responsiveness, exchange rate movements and price competitiveness, the net debt position, trade protection, long-term supply response, and model uncertainty are considered.; Plausible (or sometimes implausible) changes in the historical relationships do not materially change the medium-term outlook for a future deterioration in U.

40|$|The {{experimental}} work {{discussed in this}} thesis examines the effect of voltammetry of nanoparticle arrays with a specific focus {{on the effect of}} nanoparticle size and surface coverage on the substrate electrode. These effects are investigated in relation to the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, 4 -nitrophenol and the hydrogen evolution reaction. In each case, the experimental data obtained is subsequently fitted using numerical simulations to extract quantitative kinetic data. Distinct differences are noted between macro – and nano – scale. The reduction of H₂O₂ reveals the absence of autocatalysis at the nano – scale. Furthermore, peak potential shifts positively with surface coverage under Case 3 diffusion conditions. On the other hand, at essentially isolated particles (Case 1) E p varies logarithmically with nanoparticle radius. By decreasing nanoparticle size, we promote convergent diffusion and enhance irreversibility of the process. The shift in E p with surface coverage can be accounted for as the diffusion layers begin to overlap heavily, tending towards more macro – disk type behaviour. We also study the hydrogen evolution reaction at an array of AgNPs. By fitting of the experimental data with numerical simulations we demonstrate altered kinetics between the macro – and nano – scale. Voltammetry at AgNP – arrays also display dependence between surface coverage and current. We attribute this to increased electro – active surface area and decrease in irreversibility of the process, with increasing surface coverage. Numerical simulations are also used to fit experimental data obtained for the reduction of 4 – nitrophenol in acidic media. The AgNP – arrays exhibit significantly different electrode kinetics compared to a <b>macro</b> – disk. <b>Examination</b> of the data obtained for AgNP – arrays at two different acid concentrations implies the rate - determining step is likely the electron transfer process. We therefore infer a change in α the mechanism of the rate – determining step between macro – and nano – scale. An unusually low value of α at the NP – array may indicate that adsorption plays some role in the process. Furthermore, we discuss the size – dependent adsorption behaviour exhibited by silver nanoparticle arrays, such that small particles with diameters below ~ 50 nm do not display the typical underpotential deposition characteristics of corresponding bulk materials or larger nanoparticles. This phenomenon is reported for the deposition of heavy metals (thallium, lead and cadmium) at silver nanoparticle arrays. The stripping voltammetry of arrays of silver nanoparticles has also been investigated. The stripping peak potential is dependent on the degree of surface coverage. Modelling of this system has shown that a one – dimensional diffusion model is appropriate for high surface coverage; essentially it is experiencing planar diffusion. However, for an array of widely dispersed particles, the individual nanoparticle size and convergent diffusion begin to dominate behaviour. A detailed overview of the literature is first discussed, relating to the synthesis {{of a wide variety of}} metallic nanoparticles and their practical applications, such as the determination of pH using platinum nanoparticles as covered in Chapter 7. We also discuss the fundamental principles governing the voltammetric behaviour of nanoparticles. </p...|$|R
