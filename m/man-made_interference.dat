In recent years, concerns have risen among certain users of the HF spectrum over [...] "broadband over power lines" [...] (BPL) Internet access, which has an almost destructive effect on HF communications. This is due to the frequencies on which BPL operates (typically corresponding with the HF band) and the tendency for the BPL signal to leak from power lines. Some BPL providers have installed notch filters to block out certain portions of the spectrum (namely the amateur radio bands), but a great amount of controversy over the deployment of this access method remains.

40|$|The {{contribution}} was a timely notice that acoustic Doppler velocimeters have intrinsic weaknesses {{and that their}} signal outputs are not always "true" turbulence measurements. Herein it is demonstrated that, in steady open channel flows, the sampling record must be larger than 5, 000 samples to yield minimum errors on first and second statistical moments of the velocity components. Significantly longer records (more than 50, 000 samples) are required for accurate determination of higher statistical moments (e. g. skewness, kurtosis), Reynolds stresses and triple correlations. Further ADV signal outputs are adversely affected by the proximity of solid boundaries, particularly when the sampling volume is located less than 30 to 45 mm from the wall. Recent field observations in a small estuary showed also that ADV records may be affected by various disturbances including wildlife and <b>man-made</b> <b>interferences.</b> Comparative analyses of long duration, high-frequency data sets highlighted the needs for advanced post-processing techniques.

While an important factor of the destabilization of the ecological balance is the “climate change”, the role of “climatic cycles” is not negligible. Dams and reservoirs retain vast masses of water and sediments, thus adversely affecting water resources, the seasonal hydrological and hydrogeological regimes, while this disruption of water flow and sediment transport is able to generate changes on the supply of groundwater aquifers, on the emerging coastal erosion phenomena and consequently impacts on delta evolution and coastal ecosystems.
