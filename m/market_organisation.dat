40|$|A new Common <b>Market</b> <b>Organisation</b> (CMO) for {{fruit and}} {{vegetables}} is in place from 1 January 2008. First debate about reform was lunched in 2004 by European Commission and its publication about simplification of the Fruit and Vegetable Common <b>Market</b> <b>Organisation.</b> The last extensive reform in 1996 introduced modifications like {{a plan for the}} progressive reduction of support for short-term market intervention and the strengthening of structural aid to improve competitiveness in order to help producers to develop their capacity and to adapt to market demand. The most important reasons for the new reform of CMO for {{fruit and vegetables}} are imbalance in the supply and distributions chain, limited influence of the producers’ organisations, coherence with rural development aid and the questions of standards. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the regulatory framework of the European Common <b>market</b> <b>organisation</b> for fruit and vegetables, reasons and aims of the reform and to compare the Croatian legislation regarding fruit and vegetables sector with the EU CMO for fruit and vegetables. The qualitative research strategy which emphasizes words rather than quantification in the collection and analysis of data and has an inductive approach to the relationship between theory and research is used to make conclusions in this paper. The conclusions about the objectives are made by studying the reference literature related to the topic of the EU Fruit and Vegetables Common <b>market</b> <b>organisation,</b> assumptions derived from the research and professional knowledge related to the topic...|$|E

40|$|With {{respect to}} the new Common <b>Market</b> <b>Organisation</b> (CMO) for fruit and vegetables, the present paper focuses on {{societal}} developments that influence the demand for fruits and vegetables, provides some basic information on fruit and vegetable production in Austria and, finally, describes the roles of Producer Organisations (PO) and retailers in Austria. The study {{is based on a}} literature review as well as on interviews with representatives of the POs. The results reveal that six Austrian POs face an increasing concentration process in the Austrian retail industry, which is important since roughly 90 % of all fruits and vegetables are distributed in retail and discount outlets. Furthermore, during the last ten years the overall consumption of fruits and vegetables per capita has increased to 94 kg and 106 kg, respectively, whereas regional and organic produce have gained increasing importance.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} electro energy <b>market</b> <b>organisation</b> in the European Union and the United States of America. Liberalisation tendencies {{occurred in}} both areas during the 90 's. The liberalisation {{is supposed to}} increase quality and reliability of electricity supplies as well as decrease electricity price. Electro energy industry belongs to the so called network industries, whose specifics prevent smooth liberalisation process. The vertically integrated companies or utilities in the US behave monopolistically on the market making the industry work inefficiently. Consequently, prices paid by customers are too high. The liberalisation should enable new participants to enter the market more easily as result of competition introduction and thereby also lead to pricing based on supply and demand interaction. The thesis also deals with price development in European and American areas liberalised to different extent. You can see number of similar tendencies and problems despite different way of electro energy <b>market</b> <b>organisation</b> in the EU and the US...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between risks and <b>market</b> <b>organisation</b> by means of two case studies. After defining the two concepts, it analyses how risks influence the functioning of markets, {{by means of the}} theory elaborated by Knight (1921). The Knightian focus on the role of judgments in risks analysis implies that the concept of rationality has to be enlarged beyond the rational choice theory. Similarly, markets cannot be defined anymore as simply an equilibrium between supply and demand: they are a special type of institution. Therefore, the analysis centres on how people make decisions and apprehend risks in relation to market structures. In the rest of the paper, two of the most prominent food safety crises in recent years are analysed based on this conceptual framework: the milk powder crisis in China (2008) and the sanitary crisis following the Fukushima nuclear accident (2011). It is shown that they represent two types of market risks, one generated by the food <b>market</b> <b>organisation</b> and the other one related to the definition of the product quality.

40|$|Within {{the last}} twenty years the link between <b>market</b> <b>organisation</b> and {{development}} has come under increased scrutiny in response to the implementation of World Bank liberalisation policies across many of sub-Saharan Africa's agriculture markets. Under the neoliberal teachings of the Washington Consensus, liberalised markets have replaced systems of government control, with disappointing results. Recognising the challenges created by the universal implementation of liberalisation policies, the attention of development economists, including the World Bank, has now turned to alternative modes of <b>market</b> <b>organisation.</b> In light of this, the following study aims to contribute to the post Washington Consensus understanding of market development through a detailed exploration of the Ghanaian cocoa market as an alternative model for <b>market</b> <b>organisation</b> within sub-Saharan agriculture. The Ghanaian cocoa market has been selected because, in contrast with its fully liberalised cocoa producing neighbours, Ghana has only undergone partial liberalisation. The Ghanaian Cocoa Board [Cocobod] maintains control over several functions across both the domestic and international dimensions of the Ghanaian cocoa chain. Given the span of the Cocobod's influence along the Ghanaian cocoa chain, it has been necessary to develop a cross disciplinary theoretical framework, using New Institutional Economics for a microanalysis of the domestic cocoa chain, and Global Value Chain analysis for a macro-analysis of the international cocoa chain. Building on a critique of the universalism inherent within the Washington Consensus, methodologically this study has attempted to achieve an in-depth understanding of the Ghanaian cocoa market. In line with the ontological approach of critical realism, this has involved the use of semi-structured qualitative interviews, throughout two independent rounds of research in Ghana. Interview data has been systematically organised and interpreted using the approach of template analysis. Based on the construction of six final templates it has been possible to deduce that direct government intervention in the areas of quality control, enforcement and a monopoly over cocoa exports appear to be having a positive impact upon market development in Ghana. Equally, it has been observed that the Cocobod may be failing to leverage the potential of private sector investment, as it struggles to adapt to partial liberalisation. In closing it is recommended that future research into models of partial liberalisation should be pursued {{based on the results of}} this study. ...|$|E

Destination <b>Marketing</b> <b>Organisations</b> is essential reading for anyone considering a career in tourism.
