40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{microbial}} community composition in the biofilms grown {{on two different}} support media in fixed biofilm reactors for aerobic wastewater treatment, using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The chemical composition of the new type of support medium (TDR) {{was found to be}} quite different from the conventionally used support <b>medium</b> (<b>stone).</b> The analysis of 16 S rRNA gene fragments recovered from the laboratory scale biofilm system show that biofilm support media and temperature conditions influence bacterial community structure and composition. Greater bacterial diversity was observed under each condition, primarily due to the large number of sequences available and sustenance of rare species. There were 6 phyla found, with the highest relative abundance shown by the phylum Proteobacteria (52. 71 %) followed by Bacteroidetes (33. 33 %), Actinobacteria (4. 65 %), Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia (3. 1 %) and Chloroflex (> 1 %). The dataset showed 17 genera of bacterial populations to be commonly shared under all conditions, suggesting the presence of a core microbial community in the biofilms for wastewater treatment. However, some genera in the biofilms on TDR were observed in high proportions, which may be attributed to its chemical composition, explaining the improved level of wastewater treatment. The findings show that the structure of microbial communities in biofilm systems for wastewater treatment is affected by the properties of support matrix...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the effectiveness of sialoendoscopy, rate of salivary fistula or natural ostium stenosis in parotid sialolithiasis treatment. The endpoint was to analyse the efficiency of a combined transcutaneous and endoscopic approach in the removal of refractory and impacted stones in most difficult cases. Study Design: prospective study, tertiary university centre, between XII 2008 and XI 2011, 185 sialendoscopies (SE) were performed in 162 patients. Within the group of 29 patients with parotid sialolithiasis endoscopy was the definite treatment in 15 cases (53 %), in 9 cases lithotripsy (ESWL) was necessary and in 5 patients who failed SE and lithotripsy, a combined approach was performed. This approach comprised both SE and open surgery. We observed no salivary fistula formation after the incision of the duct. Stenosis of the natural ostium thanks to the insertion of stent was observed only in one case. Sialoendoscopy is the method of choice with a high rate of success and gland preservation in small and <b>medium</b> <b>stones.</b> The combined transcutaneous and endoscopic approach is indicated for large stones, for complications after and contraindications in using minimally invasive procedures.

Art for me is a transformative process that increases awareness of self. Art transcends many boundaries making it a unique form of communication with an audience where words can often fall short. Building on my history of work with the <b>medium</b> of <b>stone,</b> my artistic investigations have led me to examine how process, scale, material, craft and form can be effectively employed to create an immersive experience with the art object. My artistic creations have taken the form of sculpture and painting. Relevant to my practice are the artists Mark Rothko, Isamu Noguchi and Rachel Whiteread and theorists Clement Greenberg and Martin Heidegger. My research explores the effects of an immediate experience with the art object as a technique to absorb the viewer. Precision of craft is employed as a method to elevate the significance of materials and form. Materials are understood in terms of their density, weight and psychological impact. Perspective distortions and defying the expectations of the viewer can serve to destabilize and lead them to re-establish their ground. Different processes are explored as a way to give living qualities to a static object. Personal, noncommercial use of this item is permitted...|$|R

50|$|During the mid-eighteenth century {{there was}} an {{expansion}} of jade mining {{and an increase in}} exports to China. This was a result of increased Chinese influence over the region, the discovery of new jade deposits, and growing demand for the gem among wealthy Chinese. With the support of the Burmese Government, regular trade routes were established as early as 1798 between Burma and China traveling north into Yunnan. Because of Kachin hostility this route was later replaced by overland trade along the Irrawaddy river as part of already established cotton trading routes under the official sanction of the Burmese Crown. Mogaung was established as the center for trade and taxation of Burmese jade production. The Kachins were granted ownership of the jade they mined in return for payment of fees for the transport of their goods beyond the Mogaung.In 1861, as a result of loosening restrictions on coastal trade to China, a Cantonese merchant made an expedition to Mandalay and brought back jade for trade, beginning the new practice of importing Jade into China via maritime routes. From this point on, the majority of the high-quality jade stone mined in Burma made its way into China through cities like Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Shanghai whereas much of the <b>medium</b> quality <b>stone</b> continued to be transported overland. During this period, there was increased friction between Yunnanese gemstone miners and the Burmese crown over taxation and ownership of the gems. Thus lead to several periods of passive resistance by the jade miners including the practice of limiting production.

40|$|Some {{two centuries}} before the quantum revolution, Newton (1) {{suggested}} that corpuscles of light generate waves in an aethereal <b>medium</b> like skipping <b>stones</b> generate waves in water, with their motion then being affected by these aether waves. Times have changed. Light corpuscles are {{now known as}} photons, {{and the majority of}} physicists have dispensed with the notion of aether.

According to pilot wave theory, first proposed by de Broglie (2) and later developed by Bohm (3) with Einstein's encouragement, microscopic elements such as photons and electrons consist of both particle and wave, the former being guided by the latter. Although this physical picture has not been widely accepted, it has had some notable proponents, including Bell (4). Its principal appeal is that it restores realism and determinism to quantum mechanics, its weakness that the physical nature of the guiding wave field remains unclear.

40|$|The {{book is a}} {{collection}} of essays of studies on medieval inscriptions by twenty-one authors. These inscriptions were written texts that existed outside the world of books and documents and were often publicly displayed before a broad audience in a durable <b>medium</b> such as <b>stone</b> or metal. Inscriptions are a rich and under-used source for the understanding of the diverse literate cultures of the Middle Ages, although they have stimulated much interesting research in recent years. Celticists, Anglo-Saxonists, oghamists, runologists, experts on medieval Latin epigraphy (the science of the study of inscriptions), students of brasses and other specialists have often worked on inscriptions in isolation from each other. This book is new in bringing together recent work on inscriptions in Ireland, Celtic Britain, Anglo-Saxon and medieval England and the Scandinavian or Viking world; and on the continent of Europe. Individual chapters exemplify a range of different approaches to the investigation of inscriptions, drawing on the evidence of archaeological context, of texts, of palaeography, and of linguistic analysis. Some explore methodological questions, including the use of computers. Others throw light on such subjects as the status of women, Insular influence on the Continent, medieval prayers for the dead, or the use of inscriptions to bolster the authority of the powerful.
