5|$|The goblin shark feeds {{mainly on}} teleost fishes such as {{rattails}} and dragonfishes. It also consumes cephalopods and crustaceans, including decapods and isopods. Garbage {{has been recorded}} from the stomachs of some specimens. Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the blackbelly rosefish (Helicolenus dactylopterus), and <b>midwater</b> species such as the squid Teuthowenia pellucida and the ostracod Macrocypridina castanea rotunda. Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.|$|E
50|$|Both {{species are}} small fish, {{no more than}} 15 cm in length, and are black in colour. They live in the <b>midwaters</b> of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, well away from coasts.|$|R
50|$|Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary is a {{protected}} {{area in the}} Philippines declared by the former President Fidel V. Ramos. The marshland acts like a sponge, as it is nestled in the <b>midwaters</b> of the Agusan River drainage basin. Within its lakes, several floating communities can be found. The sanctuary was home to the 20.24 feet (6.17 meter) saltwater crocodile Lolong, the world's largest captive crocodile.|$|R
50|$|Vertically {{migrating}} zooplankton {{can also}} actively transport nutrients to different zones {{of the water}} column. Zooplankton feed in the surface waters at night, and then by day release fecal pellets to the <b>midwaters,</b> which can transport C, N, and P to the deeper waters. In the NPSG the zooplankton community is not static but fluctuates seasonally and is dominated by copepods, euphausiids, and chaetognaths.|$|R
5|$|The harm {{inflicted by}} cookiecutter sharks on fishing nets and {{economically}} important species {{may have a}} minor negative effect on commercial fisheries. The shark itself {{is too small to}} be of value, and is only infrequently taken, as bycatch, on pelagic longlines and in <b>midwater</b> trawls and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination means {{producing}} {{light to}} match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it {{is a form}} of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the firefly squid and the <b>midwater</b> squid. The latter has light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|Small {{numbers of}} frill sharks are caught {{incidentally}} by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using trawls, gillnets, and longlines. In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for sea bream and gnomefish, and in <b>midwater</b> trawls {{meant for the}} shrimp Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen regard it as a nuisance, as it damages the nets. This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.|$|E
50|$|This fish, {{which can}} grow to 30 cm TL, {{is found in}} the Western Pacific, near Japan, in the Taiwan Strait and in the East China Sea. The Japanese {{butterfish}} prefers tropical waters: around 42°N - 19°N. It has been found in the waters near Hong Kong. Japanese butterfish live and feed near the bottom as well as in <b>midwaters</b> or near the surface. Generally they inhabit the epipelagic layer to 370 m. Adults are mainly bottom-dwelling but migrate upward at night in search of food.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{collection}} of a Selar crumenophthalmus (Bloch, 1793), the bigeye scad. The fish was captured in the <b>midwaters</b> of a kelp bed (bottom depth 8 m) off northern Rancho Palos Verdes (33 ° 482 ̆ 7 N, 118 ° 242 ̆ 7 W), southern California. This {{is the first time}} this species has been reported from off California.

5|$|The Australian blacktip shark {{is known}} to form large groups, {{segregated}} by size and sex. It preys mainly on teleost fishes, including ponyfishes, grunters, tunas, and herring. Cephalopods are a secondary food source, which are particularly important around April. This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks, including snaggletooth sharks (Hemipristis pristis), spottail sharks (C. sorrah), and sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon). Their diets shift with age: smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom-dwelling fish, while larger individuals feed on proportionately more <b>midwater</b> fish and cephalopods. Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms Fossobothrium perplexum and Platybothrium sp., and the copepod Perissopus dentatus.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the <b>midwater</b> squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below.

5|$|The diet of the short-tail {{stingray}} {{consists of}} invertebrates and bony fishes, including burrowing and <b>midwater</b> species. It tends to remain within a relatively limited area throughout the year, preferring deeper waters during the winter, {{and is not}} known to perform long migrations. Large aggregations of rays form seasonally at certain locations, {{such as in the}} summer at the Poor Knight Islands off New Zealand. Both birthing and mating have been documented within the aggregations at Poor Knights. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother; the litter size is 6–10. The short-tail stingray is not aggressive but is capable of inflicting a potentially lethal wound with its long, venomous sting. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range, usually surviving to be released. Because its population does not appear threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
40|$|The bathypelagic realm (<b>midwaters</b> {{deeper than}} 1000 m) {{constitutes}} approximately 78 % {{of the entire}} World Ocean’s volume, making this the largest living space on the planet. Due to the expense and difficulty of accessing this environment, the bathypelagic zone remains a largely unexplored frontier. Current and future anthropogenic threats accentuate {{the need for additional}} data and improved knowledge of this habitat. Characteristic fauna and environmental conditions are described from the surface layers to the great depths of the World Ocean. Sampling programs emphasizing the bathypelagic realm are reviewed beginning with the Challenger Expedition of the late 19 th century to current sampling programs in the Gulf of Mexico pursuant to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Disaster of 2010...|$|R
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of Teuthowenia megalops has not been {{extensively}} observed. From the recorded depths of captured adult specimens, {{it is assumed that}} mating and spawning happens in the deep <b>midwaters,</b> at depths greater than 1000 m. At these depths, the waters are quite dark. The bioluminescent photophores as well as pheromones released into the water may help the squid find mates. Once the males find the females, they harpoon them with spermatophores directly on the mantles. The spermatophores penetrate into the mantle cavity of the female where they discharge sperm. The females spawn only once before dying. No eggs of the species have ever been collected from the wild, but examination of collected specimens of gravid females puts the estimated fecundity at 70,000 to 80,000 eggs per individual.|$|R
5000|$|The central stoneroller is {{widespread}} in freshwater streams throughout {{a large portion}} of the eastern, central, and midwestern United States. It is present in the Atlantic Ocean, Great Lakes, Mississippi River, and Hudson Bay basins in the US, from New York west to North Dakota and Wyoming and south to South Carolina and Texas. Isolated populations are also found in Canada and Mexico. [...] The central stoneroller is benthopelagic, inhabiting either the <b>midwaters</b> or bottom of freshwater streams and rivers. It requires some current and is most commonly found in riffles and pools of moderate to high gradient streams with a gravel substrate bottom. However, it is a very tolerant species and can be found in almost any stream system with adequate food, leading to it widespread distribution.|$|R
25|$|<b>Midwater</b> {{trawling}} is {{also known}} as pelagic trawling. <b>Midwater</b> trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, shrimp, tuna and mackerel, whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish such as cod, squid, halibut and rockfish.|$|E
25|$|Bottom {{trawling}} can be {{contrasted with}} <b>midwater</b> trawling (also known as pelagic trawling), where a net is towed {{higher in the}} water column. <b>Midwater</b> trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, and mackerel, whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish.|$|E
25|$|Trawling can {{be divided}} into bottom {{trawling}} and <b>midwater</b> trawling, depending on how high the trawl (net) is in the water column. Bottom trawling is towing the trawl along (benthic trawling) or close to (demersal trawling) the sea floor. <b>Midwater</b> trawling is towing the trawl through free water above {{the bottom of the ocean}} or benthic zone.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The endemic Antarctic teleosts of the {{suborder}} Notothenioidei are bottom dwellers. They lack swim bladders, are {{heavier than}} seawater, and feed {{on or near}} the bottom. The <b>midwaters</b> surrounding the Antarctic continent are productive and underutilized by fishes. There is an evolutionary trend toward pelagism in some notothenioids. We discovered that the largest Antarctic fish, Dissostichus mawsoni, was neutrally buoyant. Attainment of neutral buoy-ancy was associated with specializations of the skeletal, integumentary, mus-cular, and digestive systems. The skeleton had a low mineral content and contained considerable cartilage. Scales were also incompletely mineralized. Static lift was obtained from extensive lipid (mostly triglyceride) deposits. A 2 - 8 mm subcutaneous lipid layer accounted for 4. 7 % of the body weight. White muscle also contained much lipid- 23 % on a dry weight basis, or 4. 8 % of the body weight. Microscopic examination suggested that the liver was active in lipid metabolism, although it was not an organ of buoyancy. Stellate (perisinu-soidal) cells with many lipid droplets were a very prominent cytological compo...|$|R
40|$|Aspects of the time, place, and {{mechanism}} of occurrence of milkfish (Chanos chanos) fry, {{defined as the}} postlarvae 10 - 17 mm in total length and 3 weeks of age are considered. Fry occurrence shows seasonal patterns that differ by latitude. In the Philippines (15 - 21 degree N), fry appear earlier in the south (December-January) {{and later in the}} north (March-April); they disappear earlier in the north (July-August) than in the south (December-January). Greater numbers of fry occur in shore waters during the full moon and new moon periods, largely {{as a consequence of the}} greater spawning activity during the quarter moon periods. Fry catch by various active and passive filtering gear is greater at floods and high tide than at low and ebb tide. Milkfish fry occur in and are collected mostly from sandy beaches, particularly the surf zone and in and around river mouths. They appear to be distributed mostly near the surface, with greater numbers nearer shore. It appears that larvae smaller than 9 - 10 mm are distributed in <b>midwaters,</b> but once they reach this size they come up and are carried inshore by tidal and wind-driven currents...|$|R
40|$|The World Ocean 2 ̆ 7 s <b>midwaters</b> {{contain the}} vast {{majority}} of Earth 2 ̆ 7 s vertebrates in the form of mesoand bathypelagic (2 ̆ 7 deep-pelagic, 2 ̆ 7 in the combined sense) fishes. Understanding the ecology and variability of deep-pelagic ecosystems has increased substantially {{in the past few decades}} due to advances in sampling/observation technology. Researchers have discovered that the deep sea hosts a complex assemblage of organisms adapted to a “harsh” environment by terrestrial standards (i. e., dark, cold, high pressure). We have learned that despite the lack of physical barriers, the deep-sea realm is not a homogeneous ecosystem, but is spatially and temporally variable on multiple scales. While there is a well-documented reduction of biomass as a function of depth (and thus distance from the sun, ergo primary production) in the open ocean, recent surveys have shown that pelagic fish abundance and biomass can 2 ̆ 7 peak 2 ̆ 7 deep in the water column in association with abrupt topographic features such as seamounts and mid-ocean ridges. We review the current knowledge on deep-pelagic fish interactions with these features, as well as effects of these interactions on ecosystem functioning.

25|$|A fishing trawler, {{also known}} as a dragger, is a {{commercial}} fishing vessel designed to operate fishing trawls. Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers. Trawls are fishing nets that are pulled along {{the bottom of the sea}} or in <b>midwater</b> at a specified depth. A trawler may also operate two or more trawl nets simultaneously (double-rig and multi-rig).|$|E
25|$|In counter-illumination {{camouflage}} {{an animal}} produces light that causes it {{to blend in}} against a lit background. In water, light comes down from the surface, so when animals are seen from below, they appear darker than the background. Some species of cephalopod, such as the <b>midwater</b> squid and the sparkling enope squid, produce light in photophores on their undersides to match the background. Bioluminescence is common among marine animals, so counter-illumination camouflage may be a widespread mode of deception.|$|E
25|$|<b>Midwater</b> {{longliners}} – {{are usually}} medium-sized vessels which operate worldwide, purpose built to catch large pelagics. The line hauler is usually forward starboard, where {{the fish are}} hauled through a gate in the rail. The lines are set from the stern where a baiting table and chute are located. These boats need adequate speed to reach distant fishing grounds, enough endurance for continued fishing, adequate freezing storage, suitable mechanisms for shooting and hauling longlines quickly, and proper storage for fishing gears and accessories.|$|E

25|$|To dive safely, divers must {{control their}} {{rate of descent}} and ascent {{in the water and}} be able to {{maintain}} a constant depth in <b>midwater.</b> Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver's overall buoyancy determines whether they ascend or descend. Equipment such as diving weighting systems, diving suits (wet, dry or semi-dry suits are used depending on the water temperature) and buoyancy compensators can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers want to remain at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimises the effort of swimming to maintain depth and therefore reduces gas consumption.|$|E
