25|$|The {{internal}} {{evidence of}} religion in the text is meager. The phrase divina misericordia in the preface appears also in St. Augustine’s De civitate Dei, where the reference to divine mercy follows immediately after a passage on barbarian incursions. Marcellus and Augustine are contemporaries, {{and the use of the}} phrase is less a question of influence than of the currency of a shared Christian concept. Elsewhere, passages sometimes cited as evidence of Christianity on closer inspection only display the syncretism of the Hellenistic magico-religious tradition, as Stannard noted. Christ, for instance, is invoked in an herb-gathering incantation, but the ritual makes use of magico-medical practices of pre-Christian antiquity. A Judaeo-Christian reference — nomine domini Iacob, in nomine domini Sabaoth — appears as part of a magic charm that the practitioner is instructed to inscribe on a lamella, or <b>metal</b> <b>leaf.</b> Such “magic words” often include nonsense syllables and more-or-less corrupt phrases from “exotic” languages such as Celtic, Aramaic, Coptic, and Hebrew, and are not indications of formal adherence to a religion.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the PG-2 was {{considerably}} different than the PG-1 of the RPG-1. The rear section of the PG-1 consisted of a central tube holding the propelling charge, and a second tube around this carrying the fins. When the round was inserted in the launcher, the second tube was outside the launcher tube, requiring {{the front of the}} launcher to be free of any fittings. The PG-2 replaced the fins with small <b>metal</b> <b>leafs</b> attached to the inner tube, and eliminated the outer tube found on the PG-1. This allowed the entire propellant section to be inserted in the launcher, which in turn allowed the sights and trigger assembly to be mounted right {{at the front of the}} launcher. This slightly reduced the length compared to the RPG-1, made the entire assembly more robust, and allowed the use of conventional fore-and-aft sights.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{variety of}} {{industrial}} use of brazing solders is associated {{in one way}} with plastic properties (more plastic materials are producing {{in the form of}} wires, sheets, bands, <b>metal</b> <b>leafs,</b> meshes etc, low plastic materials in the form: pig sows, bars, powders) and in another way with the kind of joining and use soldering or brazing method. Hard solders, which include analyzed solder BAg 7, have a very wide range of melting points (from 400 to 2000 ºC) and are applied in those cases when very high values of strength are required for soldered joint. The research was carried out for the silver-based solder designated as Bag 7 according to American Standard ANSI/AWSA 5. 8 - 92. This solder has a typical application for the brazing process of food handling equipment requiring low melting values and for brazing aluminium alloys. In the literature, except for chemical composition and temperature of brazing, we cannot find the details concerned with the method of plastic working of BAg 7. In the reported research work the metallographic analysis of rolling process was performed and optimal parameters of rolling process for the considered solder were determined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigated}} the extent of heavy <b>metal</b> accumulation in <b>leaf</b> vegetables and associated potential health risks in agricultural areas of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. Total concentrations of mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr) and arsenic (As) were determined in 92 pairs of soil and leaf vegetable (flowering Chinese cabbage, lettuce, pakchoi, Chinese cabbage, loose-leaf lettuce, and Chi-nese leaf mustard) samples collected from seven agricul-tural areas (cities). The bioconcentration factors (BCF) of heavy metals from soil to vegetables were estimated, and the potential health risks of heavy metal exposure to the PRD residents through consumption of local leaf vegeta-bles were assessed. Results showed that among the six leaf vegetables, pakchoi had the lowest capacity for heavy metal enrichment, whereas among the five heavy metals, Cd had the highest capacity for transferring from soil into vegetables, with BCF values 30 -fold those of Hg and 50 -fold those of Cr, Pb and As. Sewage irrigation and fertilization were likely the main sources of heavy <b>metals</b> accumulated in <b>leaf</b> vegetables grown in agricultural areas of the PRD region. Different from previous find-ings, soil pH had no clear effect on <b>metal</b> accumulation in <b>leaf</b> vegetables. Despite {{a certain degree of}} metal enrich-ment from soil to leaf vegetables, the PRD residents were not exposed to significant health risks associated with consumption of local leaf vegetables. Nevertheless, more attention should be paid to children due to their sensitivity to metal pollutants...|$|R

40|$|Altarpieces and polychrome carved {{wood from}} {{the fifteenth century}} AD usually exhibit golden and silvery areas by the {{application}} of a very thin foil of metal. The metal foils were normally protected from the atmosphere by a varnish or resin which maybe either preserved or absent. Moreover, they were glued to the background surface by adhesive substances (egg yolk, drying oil or animal glue). The high proportion of the glueing substances often renders the development of reaction compounds. With time, silver alters blacken or simply disappear completely. In this paper, we study the alterations to metal foils from a selection of fifteenth century artworks showing different glueing agents, organic coatings and several degrees of conservation of the organic coatings and <b>metal</b> <b>leafs.</b> The submillimetric layered structure and the high variability and low amount of most of the compounds present in the different layers, as well as their differing nature (organic and inorganic) make the use of micron-sensitive highresolution techniques essential for their study. In particular, the high resolution, high brilliance and small footprint renders synchrotron radiation most adequate for their study. SR-XRD was performed to identify the reaction compounds formed in the different layers; μFTIR was used at to identify the silver protecting organic coatings, the metal foil glueing layers and the corresponding reaction compounds. The results obtained suggest that atmospheric corrosion is the dominant mechanism, and therefore that the degree of corrosion of the metal foils is mainly related to the conservation state of the protecting coatings.

40|$|The {{representation}} of rich brocade fabrics {{was one of}} the main and most striking features of European medieval paintings. What we see today is the impressive result of the artist's skills and the commissioner's preferences. To achieve this effect, medieval artists developed a large variety of materials and techniques. This paper presents the results of an integrated approach to the investigation of the techniques used by the painting workshops in Transylvania for the imitation of brocade fabrics. The investigation is carried out on a group of 12 largely unstudied Late Gothic Early Renaissance altarpieces built between 1450 1540 in German and Hungarian communities, these being some of the oldest panel paintings preserved in Romania. Over the period 2005 - 2010 these paintings were, for the first time subjected to an extensive technical investigation by complementary analytical methods. The in situ investigation combines visual examination and extensive non invasive point measurements by portable X-ray fluorescence. Due to their present location in various churches in Transylvania, a minimal sampling only was allowed for further elemental analysis carried out in laboratories. The laboratory investigations included light microscopy (in both visible and UV light), histochemical tests on cross-sections, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDX spectrochemical microanalysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The study reveals the use of at least five different types of brocade imitation, including the sophisticated technique of applied relief brocades (Pressbrokat). Most of these five types are using a combination of techniques of decorative treatment of the ground layer with paint layers, coloured glazes and application of <b>metal</b> <b>leafs...</b>|$|R
