50|$|Multiple strands can {{be created}} using either the simple {{stringing}} or the knotting technique. Here, depending on the overall design, more planning may be called for. If the bead pattern is random, the only concern is that one strand be sized shorter than the next, so they will all lie flat and not interfere with each other when worn or displayed. However, if a specific repeating pattern is planned, then careful planning will be required so that the placement of matching portions of the pattern between the strands is aligned properly. A beading board, generally a flat panel with measured curved indentations in several staggered lengths, is {{a useful tool for}} spacing the beads to work out the desired pattern. Once the design has been worked out, joining the strands together might require special <b>multiple-strand</b> clasp fixtures unless there is a single knotting point or specific design element that will accommodate it.|$|E

50|$|High-frequency {{transformers}} {{operating in}} the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided Litz wire to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses. Large power transformers use <b>multiple-stranded</b> conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings. Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.|$|R

Cataclastic rocks and sheared, strongly cemented breccias form low-permeability ( 3 % and permeabilities > 1, 000 mD form high-permeability domains. With respect to fault-zone architecture and rock content, which is demonstrated to be different for dolostone and limestone, four types of faults are presented. Faults with single-stranded minor fault cores, faults with single-stranded permeable fault cores, and faults with <b>multiple-stranded</b> fault cores are seen as conduits. Faults with single-stranded impermeable fault cores are seen as conduit-barrier systems. Karstic carbonate dissolution occurs along fault cores in limestones and, to a lesser degree, dolostones and creates superposed high-permeability conduits. On a regional scale, faults of a particular deformation event have {{to be viewed as}} forming a network of flow conduits directing recharge more or less rapidly towards the water table and the springs. Sections of impermeable fault cores only very locally have the potential to create barriers...|$|R

40|$|Karl Popper {{identified}} Xenophanes of Colophon (570 − 478 BCE) as the originator of {{the method}} of conjectures and refutations. This essay explores this claim, and the methods of both philosophers (section 1). Disparagement (ancient and modern) of Xenophanes has been misguided (section 2). Xenophanes, a critical rationalist and realist, pioneered philosophy of religion (section 3) and epistemology (section 4), but his method was not confined to falsificationism, and appears compatible with inductivism and abductionism (section 5). The method employed by Popper in interpreting Herodotus {{in support of his}} conjectures about Xenophanes is typical of the <b>multiple-strand</b> reasoning characteristic of the humanities, and is as much inductivist or abductionist as refutationist (section 6). Popper’s theories about Xenophanes are convincing; but even if Popperians would claim that Popper’s refutationism largely fits the natural sciences, his application of it to history is implausible, and conflicts with own practice (section 7). An appendix reflects on Popper’s interest in cultured refugees...|$|E
40|$|Repair of interstrand {{crosslinks}} (ICLs) requires <b>multiple-strand</b> incisions {{to separate}} the two covalently attached strands of DNA. It is unclear how these incisions are generated. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{have been identified as}} intermediates in ICL repair, but enzymes responsible for producing these intermediates are unknown. Here we show that Mus 81, a component of the Mus 81 -Eme 1 structure-specific endonuclease, is involved in generating the ICL-induced DSBs in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in S phase. Given the DNA junction cleavage specificity of Mus 81 -Eme 1 in vitro, DNA damage-stalled replication forks are suitable in vivo substrates. Interestingly, generation of DSBs from replication forks stalled due to DNA damage that affects only one of the two DNA strands did not require Mus 81. Furthermore, in addition to a physical interaction between Mus 81 and the homologous recombination protein Rad 54, we show that Mus 81 -/- Rad 54 -/- ES cells were as hypersensitive to ICL agents as Mus 81 -/- cells. We propose that Mus 81 -Eme 1 - and Rad 54 -mediated homologous recombination are involved in the same DNA replication-dependent ICL repair pathway...|$|E

The treatment group consisted of 127 students from algebra classes at a highly diverse school in central Texas taught by two relatively new teachers using a network-supported function-based algebra (NFBA) approach as integrated with the ongoing use of an existing school-wide algebra curriculum. The control group was comprised of 99 students taught by two more-senior teachers in the same school using only the school-wide algebra curriculum. The intervention consisted of implementing 20 - 25 class days worth of NFBA materials over an eleven-week period {{in the spring of}} 2005. Because the students were not randomly assigned to the classes, the study is a quasi-experimental design. Using a two sample paired t-Test for means, statistically significant results for the treatment group (p-value one tail = 0. 000335 > α = 0. 05) were obtained. We can conclude the NFBA intervention was effective in improving outcomes related to learning the algebra objectives assessed on the 9 th Grade TAKS.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, focused {{interest}} in aluminum has been heightened by recent studies regarding its health effects. Its possible relation with chronic diseases makes it convenient to address more in depth the reactivity of aluminum with biologically relevant molecules. The present work investigates {{the interaction of the}} aluminum ion with two synthetic RNAs, poly(rA) and poly(rU), through a detailed thermodynamic and kinetic study. The trivalent aluminum ion was kept in solution by complexation with the cacodylate anion, even at neutral pH, thus making the study with biological molecules feasible. The results obtained by spectrophotometry, circular dichroism, viscometry and thermal stability measurements indicate that aluminium strongly interacts with single and duplex RNA structures. The kinetic experiments point out that, even though cacodylate is required to keep the metal in solution, it actually inhibits the reaction of aluminum with RNA as it converts the metal into an unreactive dimer species. Notably, further interaction occurred in an excess of the aluminum/cacodylate complex, inducing aggregation of single-stranded RNAs. An analysis of the kinetic data has shown that the modes of aggregation of the two RNAs differ and such a difference can be ascribed to the diverse polynucleotide secondary structures. The observed stabilization of <b>multiple-stranded</b> systems by aluminum can {{serve as a model for}} future studies due to the interest aroused by this metal in the study of non-canonical nucleic acid structures...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{methods for}} extracting {{detailed}} functional and technological information from Middle Stone Age stone tools were refined and developed. This was achieved within {{a theoretical framework}} that insists on <b>multiple-stranded</b> evidence for behavioural interpretation. The methods include micro-residue analysis, macrofracture analysis and usewear analysis. Stone tool assemblages – spanning the period between about 100 000 and 50 000 years ago – from Sibudu Cave, Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter, Klasies River Cave 2 and Blombos Cave were analysed. Results derived from macrofracture analyses, that are often conducted as an initial study to assess whether tool classes {{could have been used}} in hunting weapons, are used to formulate the following working hypotheses for Stone Age hunting technologies in South Africa: a) some pre-Howiesons Poort pointed tools were used as hafted butchery knives, while others could have been used to tip hunting weapons; b) Howiesons Poort backed tools were probably used as interchangeable pieces in hafted hunting weapons; c) post-Howiesons Poort points were used to tip hunting weapons; d) Later Stone Age hunting technologies were different from those practiced during the Middle Stone Age. The macrofracture results also provided interesting comparable data showing distinct time-related clustering of the results. Although more tools that could have functioned as hunting weapons must be analysed to evaluate the authenticity of these observations, the results suggest that macrofracture studies are important for the study of change in Stone Age hunting behaviours. The main methodological contribution of this thesis is micro-residue analysis. Advances in this method developed from blind tests on replicated flakes with residues derived from the processing of plant and animal products. Lessons learned from previous blind tests shaped the new research reported here and lead to improved methodology and interpretative skills. The last test in the series of four resulted in the most accurate interpretations because, prior to Test 4, iv identification difficulties experienced during the first three blind tests were addressed through replication. The new work reported here highlights some of the difficulties that can be experienced in the morphological identification of microscopic organic residues, particularly the distinction between animal and plant residues. It is specifically recommended that multi-stranded evidence be used for the identification of animal and plant residues. Micro-residue analysis of archaeological samples provided direct evidence for functional and hafting interpretations. These can be used to evaluate the hypotheses {{based on the results of}} macrofracture analyses and to provide data for further detailed interpretations. For example, it is shown that: a) retouched points from the Still Bay were used as knives hafted to wooden handles; b) segments from the Howiesons Poort were probably hafted in bone and wood shafts in different hafting configurations that varied during the span of the technocomplex; c) Howiesons Poort segments were mostly used on animal material; d) ochre was mixed into the adhesive recipes during the post-Howiesons Poort, the Howiesons Poort and possibly during the Still Bay technocomplexes at Sibudu Cave. Thus, the multi-analytical approach followed throughout the study contributes evidence for the early development of sophisticated and variable hunting and hafting technologies used by anatomically modern humans in South Africa. Our current knowledge of behavioural trends during the Middle Stone Age has been expanded, allowing rare glimpses into the everyday activities of people living in the deep past. Perceptions of a static, pre-modern technology and unvaried faunal exploitation during the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa are unfounded...|$|R

The {{mechanical}} behavior of four carbon nanotube (CNT) wires, comprised of 1 -yarn, 30 -yarn, 60 -yarn, and 100 -yarn, was investigated under constant tension at two loading rates of 0. 02 mm/sec and 2 mm/sec. Tests were conducted with both asfabricated and pre-stressed wires. The ultimate tenacity or apparent ultimate tensile strength of all four wires {{was found to be}} independent of loading rate, with those for the single-yarn wire about twice those of the multiple-yarn wires. Strain at a given stress level and failure strain of the multiple-yarn wires before pre-stressing were almost an order of magnitude larger than those for the single-yarn wire, and this difference was reduced considerably after pre-stressing. The failure mechanisms of 1 -yarn wire or twisted individual yarns in <b>multiple-strand</b> wires involved ductile (necking) deformation and fibrillar breakage. Inner yarns in multiple-yarn wires initially failed at the same location, followed by outer yarns failing at different locations. Additionally, sliding occurred between individual yarns, and twisting of the yarns accompanied by surface wear took place in the multiple-yarn wires, which contributed to their failure at a lower load compared to the single-yarn wire.

40|$|Large-scale {{copy number}} {{variants}} (CNVs) {{have recently been}} recognized {{to play a role}} in human genome variation and disease. Approaches for analysis of CNVs in small samples such as microdissected tissues can be confounded by limited amounts of material. To facilitate analyses of such samples, whole genome amplification (WGA) techniques were developed. In this study, we explored the impact of Phi 29 <b>multiple-strand</b> displacement amplification on detection of CNVs using oligonucleotide arrays. We extracted DNA from fresh frozen lymph node samples and used this for amplification and analysis on the Affymetrix Mapping 500 k SNP array platform. We demonstrated that the WGA procedure introduces hundreds of potentially confounding CNV artifacts that can obscure detection of bona fide variants. Our analysis indicates that many artifacts are reproducible, and may correlate with proximity to chromosome ends and GC content. Pair-wise comparison of amplified products considerably reduced the number of apparent artifacts and partially restored the ability to detect real CNVs. Our results suggest WGA material may be appropriate for copy number analysis when amplified samples are compared to similarly amplified samples and that only the CNVs with the greatest significance values detected by such comparisons are likely to be representative of the unamplified samples...|$|E
40|$|Given {{a finite}} planar graph, a grove is a {{spanning}} forest {{in which every}} component tree contains {{one or more of}} a specified set of vertices (called nodes) on the outer face. For the uniform measure on groves, we compute the probabilities of the different possible node connections in a grove. These probabilities only depend on boundary measurements of the graph and not on the actual graph structure, i. e., the probabilities can be expressed as functions of the pairwise electrical resistances between the nodes, or equivalently, as functions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator (or response matrix) on the nodes. These formulae can be likened to generalizations (for spanning forests) of Cardy’s percolation crossing probabilities, and generalize Kirchhoff’s formula for the electrical resistance. Remarkably, when appropriately normalized, the connection probabilities are in fact integer-coefficient polynomials in the matrix entries, where the coefficients have a natural algebraic interpretation and can be computed combinatorially. A similar phenomenon holds in the so-called double-dimer model: connection probabilities of boundary nodes are polynomial functions of certain boundary measurements, and as formal polynomials, they are specializations of the grove polynomials. Upon taking scaling limits, we show that the double-dimer connection probabilities coincide with those of the contour lines in the Gaussian free field with certain natural boundary conditions. These results have direct application to connection probabilities for <b>multiple-strand</b> SLE 2, SLE 8, and SLE 4...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues {{represent}} the {{largest source of}} archival biological material available for genomic studies of human cancer. Therefore, it is desirable to develop methods that enable whole genome amplification (WGA) using DNA extracted from FFPE tissues. <b>Multiple-strand</b> Displacement Amplification (MDA) is an isothermal method for WGA that uses the large fragment of Bst DNA polymerase. To date, MDA has been feasible only for genomic DNA isolated from fresh or snap-frozen tissue, and yields a representational distortion of less than threefold. Results We amplified genomic DNA of five FFPE samples of normal human lung tissue with the large fragment of Bst DNA polymerase. Using quantitative PCR, the copy number of 7 genes was evaluated in both amplified and original DNA samples. Four neuroblastoma xenograft samples derived from cell lines with known N- myc gene copy number were also evaluated, as were 7 samples of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) tumors with known Skp 2 gene amplification. In addition, we compared the array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) -based genome profiles of two NSCLC samples before and after Bst MDA. A median 990 -fold amplification of DNA was achieved. The DNA amplification products had a very high molecular weight (> 23 Kb). When the gene content of the amplified samples was compared to that of the original samples, the representational distortion was limited to threefold. Array CGH genome profiles of amplified and non-amplified FFPE DNA were similar. Conclusion Large fragment Bst DNA polymerase is suitable for WGA of DNA extracted from FFPE tissues, with an expected maximal representational distortion of threefold. Amplified DNA may be used for the detection of gene copy number changes by quantitative realtime PCR and genome profiling by array CGH. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} somatic mitosis is reflected on a gross {{scale in the}} longitudinal splitting of the chromosome and the separation of its halves into daughter nuclei. More specific information about the time at which each of the component strands originates as a replicated unit has been sought by cytologists in determination {{of the number of}} subsidiary chromonemata at the various phases of mitosis. Some thirty years ago evidence was presented from studies with the ordinary light microscope that the somatic anaphase chromosome contains at least two identifiable chromonemata and the metaphase chromosome four (1). Subsequent observations indicated that under appropriate conditions of treatment four chromonemata could be detected in telophase as well as in metaphase chromosomes (2). Since the structures under consideration approached in size the resolving powers of the best optical systems then available, {{it is not surprising that}} the validity of the <b>multiple-strand</b> as compared with the single-strand pattern of organization of these chromosomes was subjected to extensive debate. The observational and experimental evidence mustered in support of these alternative views has been summarized in various reviews (e. g., 3 - 5), which afford a frame of reference for the information that is now becoming available from studies with the electron microscope. As papers presented in this conference by Gall, Gay, Ris, and others have demonstrated, analysis of the structure of plant and animal chromosomes is now proceeding in many laboratories at the level of resolution afforded by the electron microscope (6 - 10). In our approach to the problems involved, we have focused attention on the plant, Tradescantia, since it figured so prominently in the earlier light microscope analyses of chromonematic patterns (1, 2), although supplementary studies have been made on cells of other plants and of insects (grasshoppers and Drosophila). The results of these investigations have sustained the interpretation that the somatic chromosome is composed of helically disposed chromonemata (1), but have also indicated that the number of corn...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Civil EngineeringRobert J. PetermanResults of an {{extensive}} experimental program {{conducted to determine}} the material, bond characteristics, and time-dependent deformations of a proposed self-consolidating concrete (SCC) mixture for bridge girders are presented. This research program was completed in a three-step process. The first phase consisted of 15 full-scale, pretensioned SCC flexural specimens that were tested to evaluate their transfer and development lengths. These specimens included both single-strand and <b>multiple-strand</b> beams, as well as specimens designed to evaluate the so-called “top-strand" effect. The top-strand specimens, with more than 20 inches of concrete below the strand, were tested to evaluate the current American Association of State Highway Officials requirement of a 30 % increase development length when the concrete below the strand is more than 12 inches. Strand end-slip measurements, used to estimate transfer lengths, indicated the proposed SCC mixture meets ACI and AASHTO requirements. In addition, flexural tests confirmed the proposed SCC mixture also meets current code requirements for development length. The second step was to evaluate the elastic shortening, creep, and shrinkage properties of the proposed SCC mixture for bridge girders. Four bridge girders with an inverted-T profile were used to measure these time-dependent deformations. In two of the specimens, the strands were tensioned to 75 % of ultimate tensile strength (representing a girder that would be put into service). Strands {{of the other two}} specimens were left untensioned to evaluate shrinkage effect of the concrete alone. The shrinkage was then subtracted from the fully tensioned specimens and elastic shortening and creep were isolated after relaxation losses were calculated from code expressions. In addition, the fully tensioned specimens were used to determine transfer lengths of the prestressing strand. The final step in the program was to record strain measurements in actual bridge girders used in the field. Elastic shortening, creep, and shrinkage prestress loss results of the proposed SCC mixture were compared with current design equations. Instrumentation of seven pretensioned girders in a five-span bridge located in Cowley County, Kansas, was used to measure time-dependent deformations. Three of these girders utilized SCC, while the other four were cast with conventional concrete...|$|E
40|$|Pulsed {{inductive}} plasma accelerators are spacecraft propulsion {{devices in}} which energy {{is stored in}} a capacitor and then discharged through an inductive coil. The device is electrodeless, inducing a plasma current sheet in propellant located near {{the face of the}} coil. The propellant is accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity (order of 10 km/s) through the interaction of the plasma current with an induced magnetic field. The Faraday Accelerator with RF-Assisted Discharge (FARAD) thruster [1, 2] is a type of pulsed inductive plasma accelerator in which the plasma is preionized by a mechanism separate from that used to form the current sheet and accelerate the gas. Employing a separate preionization mechanism in this manner allows for the formation of an inductive current sheet at much lower discharge energies and voltages than those found in previous pulsed inductive accelerators like the Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT). In a previous paper [3], the authors presented a basic design for a 100 J/pulse FARAD laboratory-version thruster. The design was based upon guidelines and performance scaling parameters presented in Refs. [4, 5]. In this paper, we expand upon the design presented in Ref. [3] by presenting a fully-assembled and operational FARAD laboratory-model thruster and addressing system and subsystem-integration issues (concerning mass injection, preionization, and acceleration) that arose during assembly. Experimental data quantifying the operation of this thruster, including detailed internal plasma measurements, are presented by the authors in a companion paper [6]. The thruster operates by first injecting neutral gas over the face of a flat, inductive acceleration coil and at some later time preionizing the gas. Once the gas is preionized current is passed through the acceleration coil, inducing a plasma current sheet in the propellant that is accelerated away from the coil through electromagnetic interaction with the time-varying magnetic field. Neutral gas is injected over the face of the acceleration coil through a fast-acting valve that feeds a central distribution manifold. The thruster is designed to preionize the gas using an RF-frequency ringing signal produced by a discharging Vector Inversion Generator (VIG). The acceleration stage consists of a multiple-turn, <b>multiple-strand</b> spiral induction coil (see Fig. 1, left panel) and is designed for operation at discharge energies on the order of 100 J/pulse. Several different pulsed power train modules can be used to drive current through the acceleration coil. One such power train is based upon the Bernardes and Merryman circuit topology, which restricts voltage reversal on the capacitor banks and can be clamped to eliminate current reversal in the coil. A second option is a pulse-compression-ring power train (see Fig. 1, right panel), which takesa temporally broad, low current pulse and transforms it into a short, high current pulse...|$|E
40|$|Confessional memoirs {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular during the few decades, and {{it is interesting to}} note that this phenomenon has also occurred on the stage. This has been spurred through the use of the theatrical monologue, which creates an intimacy with the audience, and one that, during the 1990 s, became increasingly experiential. Eve Ensler’s The Vagina Monologues (1996) was originally staged as an off-off-Broadway show which went on to global success, fuelled by the supposedly liberatory possibilities of the female voice and celebrity endorsement. Based on interviews by Ensler with over 200 women, the monologues celebrate the vagina as a site of female empowerment, whilst contradictorily describing actions of abuse perpetuated by men. The audience is encouraged to purge their feelings about their bodies (and about patriarchy) in a collective cathartic process. Whilst this play has engendered a political campaign to stop violence against women, a number of criticisms have been levelled against it; for example, it has been suggested that Ensler has appropriated the voices of her interviewees for entertainment, and that the play perpetuates the view of women as victims. It is certainly a play that focuses on female violence for a primarily female audience. In contrast, Claire Dowie’s Adult Child/Dead Child (Finborough, London, 1987) and Sarah Kane’s Crave (Traverse, Edinburgh, 1998) and 4. 48 Psychosis (Royal Court, London, 2000) engage with the notion of abuse, but in a more sophisticated and theatrically stimulating way. Dowie’s play utilizes the voice of a mentally disturbed adolescent, who conjures up an imaginary friend, Benji, as a reaction to an abusive childhood. Dowie specifically states that the play had been written without gender in mind, allowing directors to take full opportunity of the elasticity of power dynamics between individuals and within social structures. Here, the language and staging become optimum rather than the subject matter. Sarah Kane takes this even further in her plays, Crave and 4. 48 Psychosis, which went some way to a reconsideration of her work as engaging with language rather than simply, as some critics had originally thought, shock tactics. Both plays experiment with <b>multiple-strand</b> narratives and intertextuality, which adds to the richness of the ‘voices’ being heard. Whilst Crave indicates identity through letters – A, B, C and M – these stand for archetypes (Author/Abuser, Boy, Child, Mother). Whereas the speakers in The Vagina Monologues present their material as biographical or autobiographical, here the speeches connect with issues wider than that of a male/female dichotomy. In 4. 48 Psychosis, it is in fact the mind/body dichotomy that is under interrogation. Viewed by some critics as Kane’s ‘suicide note’, before she killed herself in 1999, its use of four unidentified, and ungendered, voices becomes ‘a way of making language attempt to express the boundaries between reality, fantasy and different mental states’ (Graham Saunders). This is not to suggest that Ensler’s sincere attempt to represent and denounce male violence against women is wrong-headed. However, her play presents a universal female voice, which – if shouted loudly enough – creates a superficial sisterhood amongst audience and performer. Dowie and Kane, on the other hand, strip away gender as an element that is, if not redundant, at least reductive as a means of dissecting issues of abuse...|$|E
