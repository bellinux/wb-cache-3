40|$|AbstractVery often must {{be taken}} into account the gradual {{deterioration}} of goods in inventory management. This fact is not taken into account in multiple management systems. Traditional inventory models at the same time assume that a retailer pays for the goods the moment they are received. Nowadays, however, it is becoming a common practice that a supplier offers a retailer the option to pay for the goods with a certain delay. If the retailer is not able to meet his obligations within the deadline, he is charges an interest. In this study we introduce a newly constructed suitable model which enables a retailer to set an optimal price of deteriorating goods under permissible delay in payments, and to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>repayment</b> <b>term.</b> We considered a deterministic inventory model with time-dependent demand, holding costs variable in time where deterioration is directly proportional to the time. The model is based on the assumption of time-dependent demand and has been developed for deteriorating goods. The paper further analyses a situation in which the retailer sell all the goods in time, and a situation in which the deadline was not met. Further assumption is that the inventory is depleted only by demand. The scientific aim is to verify if such an optimizing problem can be solved. Theoretical results are illustrated with numerical example for the model. Results show that the developer model is capable of solving the theoretical problem illustrated by an example. It helps to the retailer to set the selling price and the replenishment interval in order to maximize profit. The authors of the paper used methods of analysis and synthesis, and the method of mathematical analysis (differential calculus of multivariable functions, solution of ordinary differential equations, Taylor series). The model suggested in the paper can be expanded in the future. One option is generalization of the model, allowing for the lack of goods, bulk discounts, time value of money, inflation etc...|$|R

50|$|This is {{a special}} {{combination}} of a purchase and a loan. The seller gives the buyer the good or item as normal, but the buyer pays the seller using a credit card. In this way, the buyer is paying with a loan from the credit card company, usually a bank. The bank or other financial institution issues credit cards to buyers that allow any number of loans {{up to a certain}} cumulative amount. <b>Repayment</b> <b>terms</b> for credit card loans, or debts vary, but the interest is often extremely high. An example of common <b>repayment</b> <b>terms</b> would be a minimum payment of the greater of $10 or 3% every month and a 15-20% interest charge for any unpaid loan amount.

40|$|Researchers have {{continually}} {{questioned the}} economic {{viability of the}} Central Arizona Project (CAP). The completion of CAP in 1993 triggered the repayment obligation to the federal government. Despite enormous federal subsidies {{and the existence of}} several revenue sources other than from water sales the annual repayment obligation caused CAP's total expenses to exceed total costs for the two years following 1993. Using various combinations of <b>repayment</b> <b>terms</b> this study solves for pricing schedules that generate annual revenues equal to annual costs. Using estimates of water demand and water supply, price schedules are determined by maximizing consumer surplus subject to a revenue constraint. Under the current <b>repayment</b> <b>terms</b> the initial increases in water prices are less than twenty percent. After the first year increase, prices decline in real terms over the 50 year repayment horizon. In some cases future CAP prices actually drop below current water prices in real <b>terms.</b> Using alternative <b>repayment</b> <b>terms</b> that partially remove large federal subsidies results in first year percentage increases of up to fifty-two percent. In summary, the massive federal subsidies inherent in CAP keep the second-best prices from becoming exorbitantly high. The relatively small impact to the individual water user from the initial increase in prices suggests that CAP will likely remain financially viable. Based on the decreasing trends exhibited by the second-best prices it is possible that CAP may someday generate significant excess revenues to be used to further develop, improve and maintain Arizona's water resources...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to empirically {{examine the}} {{influence}} of financial bonds on customer value in commercial banks in Kenya. The financial bonds {{examined in this study}} are special discounts (SD), extension of loan <b>repayment</b> <b>terms</b> (ELRT) and free services (FS). The study sample consists of 384 respondents with a response rate of 78. 1 per cent. Data was analyzed by employing correlation and multiple regression analysis. The findings revealed that financial bonds are positively associated with customer value in commercial banks in Kenya. The generalization of the findings is limited as the study focused only on a single industry in Kenya. Based on the findings, companies employing financial bonds strategies should focus on improving the usefulness of the financial bonds to customers by reducing the cost of services. This study successfully extends the relational marketing strategies in the context of customer value by incorporating special discounts, loan <b>repayment</b> <b>terms</b> and free services constructs. This extended relational marketing model is developed to achieve the greater understanding of customer acceptance of financial bonding strategy in Kenya’s commercial banks.

40|$|International {{financial}} assistance (loans and grants) can potentially raise recipients'' welfare in two ways, by affecting a direct resource transfer and by facilitating efficiency-enhancing reforms. In practice, barriers to reform limit {{the potential of}} assistance to deliver these two dividends. In this paper, we analyze assistance programs designed to ensure that recipient governments voluntarily adopt reforms and overcome barriers associated with: (i) the reaction of special interests to the prospect of reform; (ii) the possibility of default and political instability in the recipient country; and (iii) adverse selection and moral hazard. Reform barriers raise the cost of incentive-compatible assistance and may result either in no assistance being forthcoming or assistance that ensures repayment but not the implementation of reforms. Critical to the choice of assistance programs {{is the size of}} the rent accruing to special interests in the absence of reform and the limited liability rents needed to ensure that <b>repayment</b> <b>terms</b> do not threaten the country''s political stability.
