2500|$|Soon {{after the}} Olympics, Patterson was {{diagnosed}} with several bulging discs in her lower back that had gone unnoticed. She announced her intention {{to take time off}} from the sport to rehabilitate her back, but she officially retired in 2006 without ever participating in another major competition.

For the past ten years I have been given a medicine called mildronate by my family doctor and a few days ago after I received the ITF letter I found out that it also has another name of meldonium which I did not know.

But on January 1st [...] the rules had changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance which I had not known.

2500|$|Michael Hogan of The Telegraph {{noted that}} [...] "Capaldi {{is back to}} his charismatic best" [...] in [...] "The Pilot", stating [...] "devoted Whovian is keen {{to go out with}} a bang", and {{described}} his character as [...] "mercurial, magical and kind". Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in [...] "Thin Ice", noting how she [...] "examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Extremis" [...] received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating [...] "Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak". He also praised the interactions between him and Missy, noting how they recall [...] "a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee’s Doctor and Roger Delgado’s Master had during their many encounters". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi’s performance in [...] "The Lie of the Land" [...] proclaiming [...] "he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He’s world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he’s working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, “Peter only has to think at the screen and you know what he’s thinking,” he said. “He only has to move his face and I know the particular blend of Scottish torment he’s feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has given us the most emotional Doctor.” [...] Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in [...] "The Doctor Falls" [...] with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he [...] "stands tall", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he [...] "simply shines". Flickering Myth stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's [...] "Where I stand is where I fall" [...] speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: [...] "The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he’s going to be missed when he finally departs Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud “I don’t want you to go”". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that [...] "the man’s been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been <b>my</b> <b>Doctor</b> for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that’s wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have been blessed with his talents. I don’t want you to go either, Peter".|$|E
