In a material test, the materials used for the robot are tested in magnetic fields to insure no interference exists between the material and magnetic field. One form of interference would be inducing a current in the robot's wires. This current could inhibit robot control-ability.

40|$|A {{finite element}} (FE) model using a total strain {{material}} {{model has been}} developed to predict the behavior of warehouse reinforced concrete floors on piles. The material model (not the FE model itself) was calibrated to <b>material</b> <b>tests.</b> The FE model for the floor structure was checked with full-scale experiments. For a warehouse, punching load optimization and surface crack control are important design factors. It is concluded that if calibrated material models are used, total strain-based FE models are able to indicate surface crack width and punching strength for several types of reinforcement.

Effects of the crystal orientation on the stress-strain relationship were discussed by the comparison with calculation based on the crystalline plasticity theory.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the project under report, proof was {{furnished}} that the C/C <b>material</b> <b>tests</b> at a stagnation point pressure of 35 mbar are feasible in the PWK 1, permitting a direct comparison to the <b>material</b> <b>tests</b> in NASDA's thermal plasma wind tunnel. However, this required extensive modifications, in particular of the cooling systems of the PWK 1. The installation of a RD 5 plasma source into the PWK 1 permitted transfer of measurement results from the PWK 2. Now {{there was no need to}} investigate the materials in planned tests at a lower stagnation point pressure of 8 mbar within {{the scope of}} the NASDA cooperation. This stagnation point pressure falls within the already well-measured operating range of up to 10 mbar. Here, extensive test experience in both PWKs is available, to which recourse can be made within the scope of fine calibration for <b>material</b> <b>tests.</b> (orig.)

40|$|A new {{constitutive}} material model {{intended for}} thermo plastics, developed at NTNU, was studied in this thesis. The model is implemented as a user-defined {{material in the}} finite element code LS-DYNA. For calibration and validation of the model an extensive battery of material and component tests of HDPE and PVC were conducted and reported. For a material model to gain popularity easy calibration is vital. An easy to use analytical calibration procedure has therefore been developed, {{eliminating the need for}} inverse modelling. The calibration procedure has shown good results in numerical simulations of the <b>material</b> <b>tests</b> of the materials studied here. The procedure is, however, based on a simplification of the constitutive relations of the model. The safe use of the procedure will thus have limitations, which should be investigated further. In order to validate the material model numerical simulations of well defined three-point bending tests, as well as <b>material</b> <b>tests</b> in tension and compression, have been used. The model performs well in material test result reproduction, but does not capture all strain rate effects observed in the <b>material</b> <b>tests.</b> The over all impression is that the model performs well in predicting bending behaviour. A major concern in bending and compression simulations is the plastic potential function used in the model. This predicts dilatation incompression and thus over estimates transverse strains and in turn compressive stresses in bending. </p...|$|E
