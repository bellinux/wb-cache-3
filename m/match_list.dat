6000|$|A queer little maid, {{with a big}} cap, {{admitted}} Kipps {{and took}} him through a bead curtain and a door into a little drawing-room, with a black and gold piano, a glazed bookcase, a Moorish cosy corner and a draped looking glass over-mantel bright with Regent Street ornaments and photographs of various intellectual lights. A number of cards of invitation to meetings and the <b>match</b> <b>list</b> of a Band of Hope cricket club were stuck into the looking glass frame with Coote's name as a Vice-President. There was a bust of Beethoven over the bookcase and the walls were thick with conscientiously executed but carelessly selected [...] "views" [...] in oil and water colours and gilt frames. At {{the end of the}} room facing the light was a portrait that struck Kipps at first as being Coote in spectacles and feminine costume and that he afterwards decided must be Coote's mother. Then the original appeared and he discovered that it was Coote's elder and only sister who kept house for him. She wore her hair in a knob behind, and the sight of the knob suggested to Kipps an explanation for a frequent gesture of Coote's, a patting exploratory movement {{to the back of his}} head. And then it occurred to him that this was quite an absurd idea altogether.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} efficiently computing weighted proximity best-joins over multiple lists, with applications in information retrieval and extraction. We are given a multi-term query, and for each query term, {{a list of all}} its matches with scores, sorted by locations. The problem is to find the overall best matchset, consisting of one <b>match</b> from each <b>list,</b> such that the combined score according to a scoring function is maximized. We study three types of functions that consider both individual match scores and proximity of match locations in scoring a matchset. We present algorithms that exploit the properties of the scoring functions in order to achieve time complexities linear {{in the size of the}} <b>match</b> <b>lists.</b> Experiments show that these algorithms greatly outperform the naive algorithm based on taking the cross product of all <b>match</b> <b>lists.</b> Finally, we extend our algorithms for an alternative problem definition applicable to information extraction, where we need to find all good matchsets in a document...|$|R

50|$|A common {{variation}} {{is to build}} linked lists of tokens where each token holds a single WME. In this case, lists of WMEs for a partial match are represented by the linked list of tokens. This approach may be better because it eliminates the need to copy lists of WMEs from one token to another. Instead, a beta node needs only {{to create a new}} token to hold a WME it wishes to join to the partial <b>match</b> <b>list,</b> and then link the new token to a parent token stored in the input beta memory. The new token now forms the head of the token list, and is stored in the output beta memory.|$|E
5000|$|St. George’s Hospital Medical School RFC {{was founded}} in 1863 for the {{students}} of the St. George’s Hospital Medical School. Despite its founding date, it {{was not one of}} the founding clubs of the rugby football union in 1871. The club saw its <b>match</b> <b>list</b> increase as there was an expansion in the number of clubs, and in 1867 the United Hospitals RFC was formed as a focal point for the London Medical Schools. This body instituted in 1874 the cup competition known as the United Hospitals Challenge Cup (also known as the Inter-Hospital Challenge Cup) and St George's was in the first final played on Wednesday 3 March 1875 at The Oval. The match predated by four years the first Calcutta Cup match and is the oldest cup competition in the game of rugby. The opponents were Guy's Hospital Football Club and was played in front of 400 spectators. Guy's, wore an orange and blue kit, and kicked the game off, whilst St George's wore green jersey, green shorts with brown socks. Guy's won but St George's got their revenge the next season. When this game was played matches were won by goals rather than points. A goal was a converted try, and tries themselves only value {{in the case of a}} draw in which case they would be counted up as the deciding factor. Guy's Hospital won the game by 1 Goal (a converted try) and 1 try to 2 tries. The records say that the three additional 'tries' were all defensive touch downs. The game was also notable for fielding 15 players per side at a time when all international matches, the Varsity Match, County matches and all other top level games were being played with 20 players per side and would continue to do so until 1877.|$|E

40|$|Kernel {{methods are}} {{powerful}} tools in machine learning. They {{have to be}} computationally efficient. In this paper, we present a novel Geometric-based approach to compute efficiently the string subsequence kernel (SSK). Our main {{idea is that the}} SSK computation reduces to range query problem. We started by the construction of a <b>match</b> <b>list</b> L(s,t) ={(i,j) :s_i=t_j} where s and t are the strings to be compared; such <b>match</b> <b>list</b> contains only the required data that contribute to the result. To compute efficiently the SSK, we extended the layered range tree data structure to a layered range sum tree, a range-aggregation data structure. The whole process takes O(p|L||L|) time and O(|L||L|) space, where |L| is the size of the <b>match</b> <b>list</b> and p is the length of the SSK. We present empiric evaluations of our approach against the dynamic and the sparse programming approaches both on synthetically generated data and on newswire article data. Such experiments show the efficiency of our approach for large alphabet size except for very short strings. Moreover, compared to the sparse dynamic approach, the proposed approach outperforms absolutely for long strings. Comment: 24 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to matchmaking in electronic marketplaces of peer entities, which mixes in a formal and principled way Datalog, fuzzy sets and utility theory, {{in order to determine}} the most promising matches between prospective counterparts. The use of Datalog ensures the scalability of our approach to large marketplaces, while Fuzzy Logic provides a neat connection with logical specifications and allows to model soft constraints and how well they could be satisfied by an agreement. Noteworthy is that our approach takes into account in the peer-to-peer matchmaking also preferences of each counterpart and their utilities. This allows to rule out of the <b>match</b> <b>list</b> those counteroffers that, although seemingly appealing for the buyer, would probably lead to failure due to contrasting preferences of the seller, and paves the way to the actual negotiation stage...|$|E
