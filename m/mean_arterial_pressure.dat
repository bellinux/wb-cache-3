25|$|Most {{influences}} on blood pressure {{can be understood}} in terms of their effect on cardiac output and resistance (the determinants of <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure).</b>|$|E
25|$|Aortic {{dissection}} generally presents as a hypertensive emergency, and {{the prime}} consideration of medical management is strict blood pressure control. The target blood pressure should be a <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> (MAP) of 60 to 75 mmHg, or the lowest blood pressure tolerated. Initial decreases should be by about 20%.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{cardiac output}} and low {{systemic}} vascular resistance {{are characteristic of}} ALF. Pulmonary artery catheterization should be considered. Hypotension should be treated preferentially with fluids, but systemic vasopressor support with agents such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine should be used if fluid replacement fails to maintain <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> of 50–60nbsp&mm Hg. Vasoconstrictive agents (especially vasopressin) should be avoided.|$|E
40|$|The {{asymmetry}} of coupling between {{complex systems}} can be studied by conditional probabilities of recurrence, which can be estimated by joint recurrence plots. This approach is applied {{for the first time}} on experimental data: time series of the human cardio-respiratory system in order to investigate the couplings between heart rate, <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure,</b> and respiration. We find that the respiratory system couples towards the heart rate and the heart rate towards the <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure.</b> However, our analysis could not detect a clear coupling direction between the <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure</b> and respiration...|$|R

25|$|Baroreceptor reflex: Baroreceptors in {{the high}} {{pressure}} receptor zones detect changes in arterial pressure. These baroreceptors send signals ultimately to the medulla of the brain stem, specifically to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The medulla, {{by way of the}} autonomic nervous system, adjusts the <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> by altering both the force and speed of the heart's contractions, as well as the systemic vascular resistance. The most important arterial baroreceptors are located in the left and right carotid sinuses and in the aortic arch.|$|E
25|$|Model organisms {{have been}} used in the study of REN function. A {{knockout}} mouse line, called Ren1Ren-1c Enhancer KO was generated. Male and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen {{to determine the effects of}} deletion. Twenty four tests were carried out on mutant mice and two significant abnormalities were observed. Homozygous mutant animals had a decreased heart rate and an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. A more detailed analysis of this line indicated plasma creatinine was also increased and males had lower <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> than controls.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{high-volume}} {{intravenous fluids}} {{were given to}} people who had poor perfusion due to trauma. This is still appropriate in cases with isolated extremity trauma, thermal trauma, or head injuries. In general, however, giving lots of fluids appears to {{increase the risk of}} death. Current evidence supports limiting the use of fluids for penetrating thorax and abdominal injuries, allowing mild hypotension to persist. Targets include a <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> of 60mmHg, a systolic blood pressure of 70–90mmHg, or the re-establishment of peripheral pulses and adequate ability to think. Hypertonic saline has been studied and found to be of little difference from normal saline.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, a Japanese {{research}} group used Hypercholesterolemic rabbits to examine changes due to DOW diet on cardiovascular Hemodynamics (blood flow and pressure). Systolic, diastolic, pulse and <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> and total peripheral resistance {{were significantly lower}} in the DOW group than in the control group.|$|R
30|$|When {{recorded}} values before induction and intubation {{were compared}} to the measurements of the groups, {{it was found that}} 4 and 10 min after intubation, heart rate in group D and systolic, diastolic and <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> in group E, were lower than the other measurements.

25|$|Cerebral {{blood flow}} remains {{unchanged}} {{over a wide}} range of arterial pressures (<b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> of 50–150 mmHg) through a process termed autoregulation of blood flow. Signs and symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy may include severe headache, nausea and vomiting (often of a projectile nature), focal neurologic signs, and alterations in mental status. Untreated, hypertensive encephalopathy may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, and death within hours. For example, signs of retinopathy that reflect the exudative stage, such as retinal hemorrhage or microaneurysm, may be seen in eyes that do not have features of the sclerotic stage, The exudative signs are nonspecific, since they are seen in diabetes and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|He is {{best known}} for {{performing}} the first successful human fetal heart and kidney transplants in immunocompromised rats. Gu was the first to discover a method of lowering the <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> of the blood entering the transplanted fetal organ within the animal host to the appropriate physiological level seen in a fetus, thus allowing the transplants to be successful. The heart and kidneys not only survived but grew larger in size and could function to support the life of the host animal. This may have important implications for the treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, bilateral renal agenesis, and other congenital diseases of the heart and kidney.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of {{blood flow to}} the tissues is variable and subject to a variety of influences. When the flow is locally high, that area is dominated by perfusion, and by diffusion when the flow is low. The {{distribution of}} flow is controlled by the <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> and the local vascular resistance, and the arterial pressure depends on cardiac output and the total vascular resistance. Basic vascular resistance is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, and metabolites, temperature, and local and systemic hormones have secondary and often localised effects, which can vary considerably with circumstances. Peripheral vasoconstriction in cold water decreases overall heat loss without increasing oxygen consumption until shivering begins, at which point oxygen consumption will rise, though the vasoconstriction can persist.|$|E
25|$|Persistent {{hypertension}} {{is one of}} {{the risk}} factors for strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and arterial aneurysms, and {{is the leading cause of}} chronic kidney failure. Even moderate elevation of <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> leads to shortened life expectancy. At severely high <b>pressures,</b> <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> 50% or more above average, a person can expect to live no more than a few years unless appropriately treated.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{arterial}} baroreflex acts {{to maintain}} <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> {{in the face}} of an orthostatic challenge. The high +Gz loads experienced by fighter pilots represent an extreme form of orthostatic challenge. G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) represents a failure of the baroreflex system to maintain the appropriate level of cerebral perfusion. The anecdotal experience of fighter pilots is that their cardiovascular systems adapt to frequent exposure to high +Gz levels. Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the baroreflex-mediated cardiovascular response of a group of 8 fighter pilots to a mild accelerative stimulus differs from that of a group of 12 non-pilots. Methods: <b>Arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> and heart rate responses to rapid head-up tilting to + 75 degrees were compared between the two groups. Five variables were examined: systolic, diastolic, <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> and pulse <b>pressures,</b> and heart rate. Results: The cardiovascular responses of the groups were fundamentally different. In response to tilt, the non-pilots showed little change in systolic and <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures,</b> diastolic pressure increased slightly and pulse pressure decreased significantly. In the pilot group, however, significant increases were observed in systolic, diastolic and <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> (p < 0. 05), whereas pulse pressure did not change. Between groups there were significant differences observed in terms of <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> (p < 0. 05), but not heart rate. Conclusions: The baroreflex of a fighter pilot is capable of adapting to +Gz, becoming a more sensitive and effective BP control system as a result. This adaptation affords the pilot greater protection against G-LOC...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension, {{a common}} complication {{in patients with}} congenital heart defects with left-to-right shunt who present late {{is one of the}} principal determinants of the clinical manifestations, the course and the feasibility of surgical repair. The objective is to study the pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> and the pulmonary histopathological changes in patients having congenital heart defects with left-to-right shunt. A total of 20 consecutive patients having congenital heart defects with left-to- right shunt who underwent surgical correction were studied. Intra-operative <b>mean</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured before and after surgical correction. Lung biopsy was taken to study the histopathological changes of lung parenchyma and vasculature. All patients, irrespective of age at the time of surgical repair and the type and size of the cardiac defect had raised <b>mean</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures</b> that were decreased significantly immediately after surgical correction. Pulmonary parenchymal changes and vascular changes were noted in 18 and 9 patients respectively. The pulmonary vascular changes were significantly correlated with the <b>mean</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures.</b> The pulmonary parenchymal changes though were a consistent finding; not significantly correlated with the <b>mean</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Pressure-sensitive baroreceptors {{are found}} in the vessel walls of nearly all large arteries in the thorax and neck, but are {{particularly}} plentiful in the sinuses of the carotid arteries and in the arch of the aorta. These specialized receptors are sensitive to changes in <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure.</b> An increase in sensed pressure results in an increased rate of firing by the baroreceptors and a negative feedback response, lowering systemic arterial pressure. Aldosterone release causes sodium and water retention, which causes increased blood volume, and a subsequent increase in blood pressure, which is sensed by the baroreceptors. [...] To maintain normal homeostasis these receptors also detect low blood pressure or low blood volume, causing aldosterone to be released. This results in sodium retention in the kidney, leading to water retention and increased blood volume.|$|E
2500|$|Cerebral {{perfusion}} pressure (CPP), {{the pressure}} of blood flowing to the brain, is normally fairly constant due to autoregulation, but for abnormal <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> (MAP) or abnormal ICP the cerebral perfusion pressure is calculated by subtracting the intracranial pressure from the mean arterial pressure:CPP=MAPICP. One of the main dangers of increased ICP {{is that it can}} cause ischemia by decreasing CPP. Once the ICP approaches the level of the mean systemic pressure, cerebral perfusion falls. [...] The body’s response to a fall in CPP is to raise systemic blood pressure and dilate cerebral blood vessels. This results in increased cerebral blood volume, which increases ICP, lowering CPP further and causing a vicious cycle. This results in widespread reduction in cerebral flow and perfusion, eventually leading to ischemia and brain infarction. Increased blood pressure can also make intracranial hemorrhages bleed faster, also increasing ICP.|$|E
40|$|During {{surfactant}} {{treatment of}} respiratory distress syndrome, 23 premature newborns were investigated with continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (cerebral function monitors). Simultaneously, <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure</b> and transcutaneous blood gas values were recorded. A short (less than 10 minutes) but {{significant decrease in}} cerebral activity was seen in almost all neonates immediately after the surfactant instillation, in spite of an improved pulmonary function. In 21 of 23 neonates, a transient fall in <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure</b> of 9. 3 mm Hg (mean) occurred coincidently with the cerebral reaction. Neonates in whom intraventricular hemorrhage developed tended to have lower presurfactant <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure</b> (P greater than. 05), {{but they had a}} significantly lower <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure</b> after surfactant instillation (P less than. 05). No other differences were found between neonates in whom intraventricular hemorrhage developed and those without intraventricular hemorrhage. The present findings demonstrate that an acute cerebral dysfunction may occur after surfactant instillation. In some vulnerable neonates with arterial hypotension and severe pulmonary immaturity, the fall in <b>mean</b> <b>arterial</b> blood <b>pressure</b> may increase the risk of cerebral complications and could be related to an unchanged rate of intraventricular hemorrhage after surfactant treatment...|$|R

MethodRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative study conducted in 30 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension type 2 undergoing cardiac surgery. <b>Mean</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> and dosage of dobutamine and sodium nitroprusside were assessed four times: before intravenous administration of clonidine (2 μg/kg) or placebo (T 0), 30 min after tested treatment and before cardiopulmonary bypass (T 1), immediately after CPB (T 2), 10 min after protamine injection (T 3).

40|$|The trigemino-cardiac reflex is a {{brainstem}} reflex {{known to}} lead to a decrement in heart rate and blood pressure, whereas few data have been collected about its effects on the cerebral hemodynamic.
