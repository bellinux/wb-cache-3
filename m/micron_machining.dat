40|$|The Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) {{instability}} is {{initiated by}} a shock accelerating an interface between two materials. Small perturbations of the interface grow into bubble and spike structures causing mixing {{of the materials}} that lie {{on either side of}} the interface. Recent Los Alamos National Laboratory experiments have focused on RM initiated mix in a compressible, miscible, convergent geometry. Motivated by the lack of a generally accepted model for this physical regime, cylindrical implosion experiments of single-mode, nonlinear RM growth and saturation are undeway at the OMEGA laser facility.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} PROMPT {{project was}} the {{improvement}} of the stamping and embossing technique to produce metallic microparts. Therefore a commercial available laser ablation machine was developed, which allows an easy and flexible production of micro tools made of hard metal or ceramics.

40|$|Purpose: This work models the Ra {{parameter}} as {{a function}} of current intensity (I), the electrode material and the work material. The surface {{is directly related to the}} average intensity (I) during machining. If the intensity is increased to 25 A, the roughness of the room rises dramatically to 15 <b>microns.</b> Design/methodology/approach: <b>Machining</b> with a copper tool produces a better surface than can be achieved by a graphite tool. Copper tool machining has been performed in an efficient way, eliminating the necessity of a large number of experiments. The statistical processing of the results enabled development of a mathematical model to calculate the machined surface quality according to the parameters of the cut used. Findings: The mathematical model, which precisely determines surface roughness, is a tool for cutting parameters and has been obtained by the experimental design method. It enables a high quality range in analysing experiments and achieving optimal exact values. A relatively small number of designed experiments are required to generate useful information and thus develop the predictive equations for surface roughness. Depending on the surface roughness data provided by the experimental design, a first-order predicting equation has been developed. Practical implications: The experimental design was proposed for predicting the relative importance of various factors (composition of the steels and electrical discharge machining (EDM) processing conditions) to obtain efficient pieces. This model gives detailed information on the effect of parameters of cut on the surface roughness. Originality/value: Experimental data was compared with modelling data to verify the adequacy of the model prediction. As shown in this work, the factor of intensity has the most important influence on the surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|Main {{objectives}} of the present work are characterisation of the chip formation mechanisms and tribological process behaviour in grinding at low speeds. The technological area of interest was marked off by cutting speeds of some few meters per second and depths of cut in the magnitude of a <b>micron</b> typical <b>machining</b> parameters {{in a number of}} abrasive gear finishing processes, e. g. gear honing. The chip formation mechanisms have been investigated by single grain scratching tests. It has been shown, that low cutting speeds in combination with small chip thickness enhance micro-ploughing and make the chip formation less efficient. Higher values for cutting speed and larger chip thickness result in increasing micro-cutting. For the most efficient chip formation, the values for cutting speed and chip thickness have to be chosen as high as possible. Investigations of the tribological process behaviour have been carried out in grinding experiments. They were aimed at quantifying the influence of friction and tool specification on the effective material removal. Experimental findings allow to differentiate the friction influence dependent on the chosen cutting speed and (equivalent) chip thickness by application of the Stribeck diagram. The most efficient material removal was achieved at a boundary lubrication condition, when the cutting speed and chip thickness were set at their highest values. This result confirms the single grain tests findings. Applying an abrasive wear map, process behaviour of different tool specifications at constant grinding conditions was found out to correlate with the effective single grain chip thickness. The higher it is, the higher are the process friction, effective material removal and tool wear. At low chip thickness values, due to dominating micro-ploughing, high compressive residual stresses in the workpiece subsurface are induced. A principle transferability of the experimental results to the technology of gear honing has been shown...|$|R
40|$|Detection of {{very fine}} defects in the width {{range of a}} few microns is very {{difficult}} by using conventional radiographic equipment, due to three limiting factors- contrast, definition and image graininess. Variables, such as X-ray energy, scattered radiation, type of film, processing parameters, film density, focal spot size, source to object distance etc, if controlled properly, can lead to radiographic image with improved quality and better flaw detection sensitivity. Image quality can be enhanced further by using microfocus X-ray tube having focal spot size from 1 to 50 <b>micron.</b> Microfocus X-ray <b>machine</b> when employed with projection radiography and real time radiography can result in ease of viewing a magnified image instantaneously. It becomes a very powerful tool for detecting microvoids and fine cracks in different materials and components having simple as well as complex geometry. However, due to high capital cost and requirement of dynamic vacuum for X-ray tube, microfocus equipments are used only in R&D sector and are rather less popular among common users. Considering {{the basic principles of}} image quality enhancement, potential of conventional X-ray machine was explored to detect the air gap of 30 to 50 micron width in...|$|R
40|$|Gallium nitride and {{sapphire}} {{are important}} materials for fabricating novel photonic {{devices such as}} high brightness light emitting diodes (LEDs), photo detectors and laser diodes. These materials are strongly resistant to wet chemical etching and also, low etch rates and limited etch selectivity restrict the use of dry etching. Thus, to develop alternative high resolution processing and machining techniques for these materials {{is important to the}} further development of the photonic devices. In this work, a repetitively pulsed UV copper vapour laser (255 nm) has been used to machine and dice gallium nitride, sapphire and micro LED devices. Machining parameters were optimised so as to achieve controllable machining and high resolution. For sapphire, well-defined grooves 30 micron wide and 450 <b>micron</b> deep were <b>machined.</b> For gallium nitride, precision features such as holes on a tens of micron length scale have been fabricated. By using this technique, compact micro LED array chips with a small die space (100 micron) and 450 micron thick sapphire substrate have been successfully diced. Measurements show that the performances of LED devices are not influenced by the UV laser machining. Our results demonstrate that the pulsed UV copper vapour laser is a powerful tool for micromachining and fabrication of photonic materials and devices...|$|R
40|$|A high-speed, high-precision chip formation-based micro-groove {{cutting process}} has been {{developed}} for cutting grooves in metals with nearly arbitrarily shaped cross-sections, which have widths and depths {{of a few hundred}} nanometers to a few microns, and lengths of tens of millimeters. A flexible tool, consisting of a single-point cutting geometry mounted {{on the end of a}} small cantilever, is moved along a workpiece surface while a constant cantilever deflection is maintained to apply a cutting load. Depth of cut for a given tool shape is determined by cutting load and workpiece material properties. A major advantage of the flexible tool concept is increased depth of cut precision. Furthermore, the use of a flexible tool enables the process to be robust against machine tool registration error, guide misalignment, and component inertial deflections. The process was implemented by fitting a 5 -axis micro-scale machine tool with a specially constructed micro-groove cutting assembly. Early, experiments using diamond-coated AFM probes as tools demonstrated process viability up to cutting speeds of 25 mm/min and chip formation at the sub-micron scale. However, AFM probe geometries proved too fragile for this demanding application. High quality tools with improved cutting geometries were designed and fabricated via focused ion beam machining of single-crystal diamond tool blanks, and tool edge radii of 50 - 64 nm were achieved. The improved tools enabled well-formed rectangular grooves to be cut in aluminum at up to 400 mm/min with widths of 300 nm to 1. 05 microns and depths up to 2 microns. Complex compound v-shaped grooves were also produced. Virtually no tool wear (less than 20 nm) was observed over a cutting distance of 122. 4 mm. Small amounts of side burr formation occurred during steady-state cutting, and exit burr formation occurred when a tool exited from a workpiece. Parallel 1. 05 micron wide grooves were controllably cut as close as 1. 0 <b>micron</b> apart, and <b>machining</b> of intersecting grooves was successfully demonstrated. 	 To better understand process mechanics including chip formation, side burr formation, and exit burr formation at the small size scale involved, a 3 D finite element model of the process was developed. Validation with experimental results showed that on average the model predicted side burr height to within 2. 8 %, chip curl to within 4. 1 %, and chip thickness to within 25. 4 %. An important finding is that side burr formation is primarily caused ahead of a tool by expansion of material compressed after starting to flow around a tool rather than becoming part of a chip. Also, three exit burrs, two on the sides of a groove and one on the bottom of a groove, are formed when a thin membrane of material forms ahead of a tool and then ruptures as the tool exits a workpiece. Finally, conclusions about the process are drawn and recommendations for future work are presented...|$|R
