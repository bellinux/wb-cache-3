25|$|For the 12th {{time since}} July 1, and sixth for August, a Cardinals' player {{is headed to}} the DL. Reliever Seth Maness on August 16 came aboard the DL train {{for the second time}} in 2016 (May 14-June 19), missing 31 games. He will undergo season-ending Tommy John surgery on August 18, missing the {{remaining}} 44 games in 2016, and <b>maybe</b> <b>all</b> of the 2017 season. Reliever Sam Tuivailala was recalled. Matt Holliday will have surgery August 17 on his fractured right thumb. His prognosis for returning before the end of the season is unknown. After a medical review of his injury, Maness had surgery to fix his Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint instead of Tommy John surgery ligament replacement, drastically reducing his recovery time from 12–15 months to 6–8 months, which would make him available for Spring Training in 2017.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to her feelings for Nate, Blair is sometimes said to feel competitive with Serena in other areas, including matters of beauty and popularity. This also leads to an occasional envy on Blair's part. It is unclear how much of Blair's perception of Serena {{is in line with}} reality; the narrative describes both characters as [...] "hands down the two hottest girls on the Upper East Side, and <b>maybe</b> <b>all</b> of Manhattan, or even the whole world." ...|$|E
500|$|The last {{lines of}} [...] "Yertle the Turtle" [...] read: [...] "And turtles, of course... all the turtles are free / As turtles, and <b>maybe,</b> <b>all</b> creatures should be." [...] When {{questioned}} {{about why he}} wrote [...] "maybe" [...] rather than [...] "surely", Seuss replied that he didn't want to sound [...] "didactic or like a preacher on a platform", and that he wanted the reader [...] "to say 'surely' in their minds instead of my having to say it." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's story {{originated}} from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind {{over a period}} of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only [...] "a feeling" [...] and the title Blue Velvet, Lynch told Cineaste in 1987. The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. [...] "I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect," [...] Lynch remarked in an interview. The third idea was Bobby Vinton's classic rendition of the song Blue Velvet and [...] "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time." [...] Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that [...] "there was <b>maybe</b> <b>all</b> the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Governor Pawlenty {{signed the}} Next Generation Energy Act of 2007 into law and, along with six other Midwestern governors, the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord. [...] These {{directed}} state agencies {{to develop a}} plan to reduce greenhouse gases, and [...] "develop a market-based and multi-sector cap-and-trade mechanism". [...] However, by 2009 Pawlenty had reversed his position and called cap-and-trade [...] "overly bureaucratic" [...] and a potential [...] "disaster". [...] By 2011, Pawlenty's position had changed sufficiently to state [...] "the weight of the evidence is that most of it, <b>maybe</b> <b>all</b> of it, is because of natural causes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) <b>Maybe</b> <b>all</b> those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

6000|$|Later: Big {{reception}}, {{felt like}} an awful nut, so shy I didn't hardly dare look up off the ground.

I thought they were produced by angels' kisses, but there was not an angel about the place, that I could see. Perhaps I have also been deceived as regards their goodness. <b>Maybe</b> <b>all</b> women are not so perfect as in the popular short story they appear to be.
