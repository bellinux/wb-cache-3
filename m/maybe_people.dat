[...] "When I heard Christian Bale flip out I had to remix the track.... It's good to hear that clubs have already started playing it as it is very funny," [...] said Piane. In an interview with LA Weekly, Piane commented that he wants his remix remembered, instead of Bale's outburst: [...] "We're all people in this world. So I figured, [...] remembering that one time Christian Bale went crazy on set, <b>maybe</b> <b>people</b> will remember the remix." ...|$|E
500|$|The poor {{reception}} prompt Hadfield {{to release}} an apology to Minogue, blaming himself {{for not being}} {{in control of the}} promotion; [...] "I loved her voice, got on with her and I am embarrassed that I failed her." [...] Tom Parker, who wrote the liner notes for the 2003-release of Impossible Princess, had observed that critics slated [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] due to Minogue's approach to [...] "obtain lyrical and production credibility, which was overshadowed in whole". Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath [...] "I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start." [...] She went on to say [...] "I've told not to be frustrated, but I was frustrated because the album should be out [...] The point of it is to get it out and <b>maybe</b> <b>people</b> will like it, they may love it or they might hate it, but it was in my hands." [...] She also felt guilt for parting with Stock Aitken Waterman after her production team with Deconstruction was not in good terms; she later commented that she departed on [...] "good terms".|$|E

5000|$|Andriano doesn't go into {{details as}} to the {{inspiration}} for the lyrics of this song; he simply says: [...] "It's definitely one of my favorites on the album, though, because the sentiment is real. Most of us don't need anything; we're lucky in that regard. But {{a lot of us are}} missing a lot of things — <b>maybe</b> it's <b>people,</b> <b>maybe</b> it's answers, or hope, love, trust, whatever. If you're looking, I really do hope you find it".|$|R

I think always people will be reading them {{but it will be a}} small group of <b>people.</b> <b>Maybe</b> more <b>people</b> than now read Latin poetry, but somewhere in that range... To read a novel {{requires}} a certain amount of concentration, focus, devotion to the reading. If you read a novel in more than two weeks you dont read the novel really. So I think that kind of concentration and focus and attentiveness is hard to come by—its hard to find huge numbers of people, large numbers of people, significant numbers of people, who have those qualities.|$|R
500|$|The {{final two}} {{performances}} {{were held in}} Tempe, Arizona on 19 and 20 December 1987 and were filmed for the 1988 film Rattle and Hum. U2 sang the refrain [...] "el pueblo vencerá", which means [...] "the people will overcome" [...] in Spanish, {{at the conclusion of}} the song. Bono noted that the Madres use the phrase for motivation. The Edge said [...] "we're so close to a Spanish speaking part of the world, we felt that <b>maybe</b> <b>people</b> at the concert might pick up on this lyric." [...] Bono added that they had closed every concert since 1983 with the song [...] "40", and so they were looking to replace it with [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] from that point on. He explained, [...] "If the people of Arizona sing this, and if it goes into the film and onto the record, wherever we go in a way for the next few years, that will be taken up again. It'll be an interesting experiment ...". The footage was considered for the closing sequence of the film, but the band eventually decided against including it. [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] was used as the final live song, and [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] was chosen to play over the credits.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again". In an {{interview}} with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album [...] "sound more personal than {{they might have been}} a few years ago", and she responded by saying [...] "Some of that could be just chance! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. <b>Maybe</b> <b>people</b> know me better now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right". The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, [...] "Chocolate" [...] is [...] "packed with saccharine innuendo". [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing. Ballads like [...] "Obsession" [...] deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, <b>maybe</b> <b>people</b> don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house." [...] Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.|$|E

2500|$|The show, {{scheduled}} in a graveyard slot on Tuesday nights at 8:00p.m., {{was not expected}} to challenge the ratings giants Milton Berle and Frank Sinatra, but did surprisingly well. Berle, known to many early television viewers as [...] "Uncle Miltie" [...] and for using ancient vaudeville material, joked about Sheen, [...] "He uses old material, too", and observed that [...] "f I'm going to be eased off the top by anyone, it's better that I lose to the One for whom Bishop Sheen is speaking." [...] Sheen responded in jest that <b>maybe</b> <b>people</b> should start calling him [...] "Uncle Fultie". Life and Time magazine ran feature stories on Bishop Sheen. The number of stations carrying Life Is Worth Living jumped from three to fifteen {{in less than two}} months. There was fan mail that flowed in at a rate of 8,500 letters per week. There were four times as many requests for tickets as could be fulfilled. Admiral, the sponsor, paid the production costs in return for a one-minute commercial {{at the opening of the}} show and another minute at the close. In 1952 Sheen won an Emmy Award for his efforts, accepting the acknowledgment by saying, [...] "I feel it is time I pay tribute to my four writers—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John." [...] When Sheen won the Emmy, Berle quipped, [...] "We both work for 'Sky Chief'", a reference to Berle's sponsor Texaco. Time called him [...] "the first 'televangelist'", and the Archdiocese of New York could not meet the demand for tickets.|$|E

5000|$|Part of {{the reason}} I love educating the masses as how to deceive is from my experience, because I got into magic before I took this pseudoscience and paranormal course, so I had these tools on how to fool people and I just had this vague {{understanding}} that people are really easy to fool, and it's not that we are broken, or dumb, or bad, or whatever. It's that the brain is built a certain way and magicians take advantage of that. And, {{it was only after}} taking the pseudoscience class that it crystallized everything and I realized that that's exactly what scam artists do as well. So, if I can get more people familiar with the tools and familiar with {{how easy it is to}} deceive other <b>people,</b> <b>maybe</b> more <b>people</b> will begin to question their own experiences.|$|R
