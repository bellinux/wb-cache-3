500|$|Burgess shale type {{preservation}} {{is defined}} as the fossilization of non-biomineralized organisms as flattened carbonaceous films in marine shales. When the animals started to decompose, their tissues collapsed {{under the weight of the}} sediment that buried them. The typical flattened fossils are outlines of tougher parts such as cuticles and jaws, which resisted decomposition for long enough to be fossilized. Soft elements, such as muscles and gut contents, were sometimes squeezed out of the decomposing organism to produce dark stains on the fossils. Organisms that lack tougher structures, such as flatworms, nemerteans and shell-less molluscs, were not preserved by this process. Very soft but chemically active tissues may be preserved by different processes. For instance during decomposition, bacteria modify the chemically unusual mid-gut glands of some organisms into the durable <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate.</b> This change happens extremely quickly, before the corpse is compressed, and leaves a three-dimensional mold of the tissues. Gills can also be preserved in something close to their original three-dimensional shape by this process. Both preservation mechanisms can appear in the same fossil. In Burgess-like shales, organisms and parts that are only quite soft, such as muscles, are generally lost, while those that are extremely soft and those that are fairly tough are preserved. The preservation of different body parts in different ways may sometimes help palaeontologists, by suggesting whether a body part was fairly tough like an arthropod limb (preserved as flat film) or very soft and chemically active, like a part of the gut (preserved as a solid piece of mineral). These differences may also help to identify fossils, by excluding from consideration organisms whose body parts do not match the combination of types of preservation found in a particular fossil bed.|$|E

50|$|Phosphate solubilizing {{bacteria}} (PSB) are {{beneficial bacteria}} capable of solubilizing inorganic phosphorus from insoluble compounds. P-solubilization ability of rhizosphere microorganisms {{is considered to}} be one of the most important traits associated with plant phosphate nutrition. It is generally accepted that the mechanism of <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> solubilization by PSB strains is associated with the release of low molecular weight organic acids, through which their hydroxyl and carboxyl groups chelate the cations bound to phosphate, thereby converting it into soluble forms. PSB have been introduced to the Agricultural community as phosphate Biofertilizer. Phosphorus (P) is one of the major essential macronutrients for plants and is applied to soil in the form of phosphate fertilizers. However, a large portion of soluble inorganic phosphate which is applied to the soil as chemical fertilizer is immobilized rapidly and becomes unavailable to plants. Currently, the main purpose in managing soil phosphorus is to optimize crop production and minimize P loss from soils. PSB have attracted the attention of agriculturists as soil inoculums to improve the plant growth and yield. When PSB is used with rock phosphate, it can save about 50% of the crop requirement of phosphatic fertilizer. The use of PSB as inoculants increases P uptake by plants. Simple inoculation of seeds with PSB gives crop yield responses equivalent to 30 kg P2O5 /ha or 50 percent of the need for phosphatic fertilizers. Alternatively, PSB can be applied through fertigation or in hydroponic operations. Many different strains of these bacteria have been identified as PSB, including Pantoea agglomerans (P5), Microbacterium laevaniformans (P7) and Pseudomonas putida (P13) strains are highly efficient insoluble phosphate solubilizers. Recently, researchers at Colorado State University demonstrated that a consortia of four bacteria (sold commercially as Mammoth P and Bio-Fizz), synergistically solubilize phosphorus at a much faster rate than any single strain alone.|$|E

40|$|The mode of succinate {{mediated}} {{repression of}} <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> solubilization {{and the role}} of repressor in suppressing phosphate solubilization phenotype of two free-living nitrogen fixing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains was studied. Organic acid mediated <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> solubilization phenotype of oxalic acid producing Klebsiella pneumoniae SM 6 and SM 11 were transcriptionally repressed by IclR in presence of succinate as carbon source. Oxalic acid production and expression of genes of the glyoxylate shunt (aceBAK) was found only in glucose but not in succinate- and glucose+succinate-grown cells. IclR, repressor of aceBAK operon, was inactivated using an allelic exchange system resulting in derepressed <b>mineral</b> <b>phosphate</b> solubilization phenotype through constitutive expression of the glyoxylate shunt. Insertional inactivation of iclR resulted in increased activity of the glyoxylate shunt enzymes even in succinate-grown cells. An augmented phosphate solubilization up to 54 and 59 % soluble phosphate release was attained in glucose+succinate-grown SM 6 Δ and SM 11 Δ strains respectively, compared to glucose-grown cells, whereas phosphate solubilization was absent or negligible in wildtype cells grown in glucose+succinate. Both wildtype and iclR deletion strains showed similar indole- 3 -acetic acid production. Wheat seeds inoculated with wildtype SM 6 and SM 11 improved both root and shoot length by 1. 2 fold. However, iclR deletion SM 6 Δ and SM 11 Δ strains increased root and shoot length by 1. 5 and 1. 4 folds, respectively, compared to uninoculated controls.

Four of these mutants have been mapped on the E. coli chromosome via Hfr matings and are located at two distinct portions of the chromosome; between 23 and 50 minutes and between 60 and 90 minutes. One mutant in each region has phosphate starvation inducible (Psi) promoter activity. One of these mutants (DB 1047) was mapped to between 69 and 75 minutes via F' matings, and fine structure mapped to 75 minutes by hybridization with λ clones from a genomic library of Escherichia coli. DB 1047 was characterized more closely and found to exhibit pleiotropy with regard to several membrane related traits. Evidence {{that this is a}} single insertional event comes from the simultaneous loss of all traits tested in spontaneous revertants. Additionally, a Tn 5 mutant was identified that was identical for these traits. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that the mutation carried by DB 1047 is in the ompB locus.

This locus is involved in regulation of transcription of the ompC and ompF genes for outer membrane porin proteins, and is located at 75 minutes on the chromosome as is the DB 1047 mutation. DB 1047 lacks the outer membrane porin OmpF, a phenotype previously attributed to envZ mutants. However, the ompR 321 mutant resembles DB 1047 in reduced ability to solubilize phosphate.
