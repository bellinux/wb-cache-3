5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{search for}} Burgess Shale fossils {{since the mid-1970s}} {{has led to the}} description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, which looked like a slug with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges. Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named. They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but the discovery of a further 189 formed the basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006. Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and has led to the reconstruction of the large <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> Hurdia in 2009.|$|E

A common processing technique is the preservation of jellyfish, which may utilize salt curing to accomplish this, creating a dried finished product.

25|$|Living Coasts, {{a coastal}} zoo owned by Paignton Zoo, {{is built on}} Beacon Quay which has existed since 1680. In 1857 the Bath's Saloons complex {{was built on the}} {{promontory}} overlooking Beacon Cove. This included a ballroom, concert hall and sunlit conservatory and private bathing facilities with, underneath, a large public swimming bath open to the sea. The stone arches of this public bath have been incorporated into the shop at Living Coasts. Development of the site as a <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> exhibit was first proposed in early 1999 in response to a call from Torbay Council for submissions from interested parties. The project, developed by Kay Elliott architects, included an exhibit to house marine birds, rather than fish, due to the need to avoid duplicating the exhibits at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth. The project was subsequently taken on by Paignton Zoo Environmental Park and named Living Coasts.|$|E
25|$|A 183m (600ft) {{cargo ship}} called the MV Pacific Adventurer was {{carrying}} 60 containers of ammonium nitrate when it encountered rough seas produced by Hamish, while located about 13km (8mi) east of Cape Moreton. The incident occurred near to a <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> park, which {{is home to}} endangered species. Around 3:15a.m. EST on 11 March, 31 of the containers spilled into the sea along with {{a large amount of}} heavy fuel, causing {{the surface of the water}} to become slick. Officials attempted to contain the oil spill, but the rough seas prevented easy containment. Environmentalist warned that the oil could have a significant impact on the local wildlife. One of the containers damaged the hull as it fell off the ship. After divers inspected the ship for the source of the spill, two holes were found. One, located just above the waterline, was 10mm (0.4in) long 15mm (0.6in) wide. The second and larger hole was located underneath the ship. The length of it was about 1m (1.3ft) and the width was 300mm (11.8in).|$|E

25|$|This problem however was {{resolved}} {{with the use}} of so-called self-polishing paints, in which the biocide was released at a slower rate as the seawater reacted with the surface layer of the paint. More recently, copper-based anti-fouling paints have been used because they are less toxic than TBT in aquatic environment, but are only effective against <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> life, and not so much weed growth. Non-stick coatings contain no biocide, but have extremely slippery surfaces which prevents most fouling and makes it easier to clean the little fouling that does occur. Natural biocides are found on marine organisms such as coral and sponges and also prevent fouling if applied to a vessel. Creating a difference in electrical charge between the hull and sea water is a common practice in the prevention of fouling. This technology has proven to be effective, but is easily damaged and can be expensive. Finally, microscopic prickles can be added to a coating, and depending on length and distribution have shown the ability to prevent the attachment of most biofouling.|$|E

500|$|Dinocephalosaurus (meaning [...] "terrible-headed reptile") is a genus of long necked, aquatic protorosaur that {{inhabited}} the Triassic seas of China. The genus contains {{the type and}} only known species, D. orientalis, which was named by Li in 2003. Unlike other long-necked protorosaurs (which form a group known as the tanystropheids), Dinocephalosaurus convergently evolved a long neck not through elongation of individual cervical vertebrae, but through the addition of cervical vertebrae that each have a moderate length. Like other tanystropheids, however, Dinocephalosaurus probably used its long neck to hunt for prey, utilizing a combination of suction, created by {{the expansion of the}} throat, and the fang-like teeth of the jaws to ensnare prey. It was probably a <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> by necessity, as suggested by the poorly-ossified and paddle-like limbs which would have prevented it from going ashore.|$|E
40|$|Abstract As {{some species}} of marine yeasts can colo-nize {{intestine}} of <b>marine</b> <b>animals,</b> {{they can be}} used as probiotics. It has been reported that β-glucans from marine yeast cells can be utilized as immuno-stimulants in <b>marine</b> <b>animals.</b> Some siderophores or killer toxins produced by marine yeasts have ability to inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria or kill pathogenic yeasts in <b>marine</b> <b>animals.</b> The virulent factors from marine pathogens can be genetically displayed on marine yeast cells, and the yeast cells displaying the virulent factors can stimulate <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> to produce specific antibody against the pathogens. Some marine yeast cells are rich in proteins and essential amino acids and can be used in nutrition for <b>marine</b> <b>animals.</b> The <b>marine</b> yeast cells rich in lipid can be used for biodiesel production. Recently, {{it has been reported that}} some strains of Yarrowia lipolytica isolated from marine environments can produce nanoparticles. Because many marine yeasts can remove organic pollutants and heavy metals, they can be applied to remediation of marine environments. It has been shown that the enzymes produced by some marine yeasts have many unique properties and many potential applications...|$|R

500|$|Pacific loggerheads live in {{temperate}} to tropical regions. They forage in the East China Sea, {{the southwestern}} Pacific, {{and along the}} Baja California Peninsula. Eastern Australia and Japan are the major nesting areas, with the Great Barrier Reef deemed an important nesting area. Pacific loggerheads occasionally nest in Vanuatu and Tokelau. Yakushima Island {{is the most important}} site, with three nesting grounds visited by 40% of all nearby loggerheads. After nesting, females often find homes in the East China Sea, while the [...] Kuroshio Current Extension's Bifurcation region provides important juvenile foraging areas. Eastern Pacific populations are concentrated off the coast of Baja California, where upwelling provides rich feeding grounds for juvenile turtles and subadults. Nesting sites along the eastern Pacific Basin are rare. mtDNA sequence polymorphism analysis and tracking studies suggest 95% of the population along the coast of the Americas hatch on the Japanese Islands in the western Pacific. The turtles are transported by the prevailing currents across the full length of the northern Pacific, one of the longest migration routes of any <b>marine</b> <b>animal.</b> The return journey to the natal beaches in Japan has been long suspected, although the trip would cross unproductive clear water with few feeding opportunities. Evidence of a return journey came from an adult female loggerhead named Adelita, which in 1996, equipped with a satellite tracking device, made the 14,500 km (9,000 mi) trip from Mexico across the Pacific. Adelita was the first animal of any kind ever tracked across an ocean basin.|$|E
