40|$|International audienceA laccase-catalyzed {{process was}} {{developed}} to prepare, selectively, in high yield, dimers of lignin based phenolic compounds without any purification. The influence of experimental parameters such as laccase loading, nature of solvent {{and the presence of}} oxygen on the conversion of vanillin was investigated. After the dimerization, the product obtained as a precipitate is filtered off and the solution containing the enzyme can be re-used several times, which improves the process economics. A phenolic-substrate screening reveals that such process enables to dimerize regioselectively, six orthomethoxy-para-substituted phenols (vanillin, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzonitrile, acetovanillon, <b>methyl</b> <b>vanillate,</b> 2 -methoxy- 4 -methylphenol, and eugenol) with yields ranging from 87 % to 96 % and one orthodisubstituted phenol (2, 6 -dimethoxyphenol) with 80 % yield...|$|E

40|$|The Wnt/b-catenin pathway is a {{potential}} target for development of anabolic agents to treat osteoporosis because of its role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. However, there is no clinically available anti-osteoporosis drug that targets this Wnt/b-catenin pathway. In this study, we screened a library of aqueous extracts of 350 plants and identified Hovenia dulcis Thunb (HDT) extract as a Wnt/b-catenin pathway activator. HDT extract induced osteogenic differentiation of calvarial osteoblasts without cytotoxicity. In addition, HDT extract increased femoral bone mass without inducing significant weight changes in normal mice. In addition, thickness and area of femoral cortical bone were also significantly increased by the HDT extract. <b>Methyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> (MV), one of the ingredients in HDT, also activated the Wnt/b-catenin pathway and induced osteoblast differentiation in vitro.

40|$|One kraft lignin and two {{lignosulfonates}} were oxidized in aqueous acidic solutions {{containing a}} polyoxometalate (POM). The degradations {{were carried out}} in H 2 O or MeOH/H 2 O mixtures {{in the presence of}} oxygen. The treatment with aqueous H 3 PMo 12 O 40 led to the dissolution of the studied lignins in the acidic medium (pH 1 - 2) and to the formation of up to 6. 5 wt% vanillin and 6. 2 wt% <b>methyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> based on the weight of dry lignin. The lignin oxidation products were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). For this purpose, a SEC method was developed, which allows the analysis of kraft lignin, lignosulfonates, and reaction products thereof without the need to remove the homogeneous catalyst. This method allows the direct observation of depolymerization and repolymerization reactions and hence the provision of a tool for studying the underlying chemistry. It has been demonstrated that the depolymerization of kraft lignin in water is accompanied by counterproductive condensation reactions. These repolymerization reactions were effectively prevented by addition of methanol, which couples competitively with lignin intermediate...|$|E
40|$|Glycosidases, {{produced}} by Oenococcus oeni strain Lalvin EQ 54 during malolactic fermentation (MLF) {{performed in a}} chemically defined wine (CDW) medium, contributed {{to the release of}} volatile aglycons from their glycosylated precursors, present in a Chardonnay wine glycosidic extract. The liberation of wine volatiles during MLF was limited by the low activity of these enzymes in this strain. Six different aglycons examined were 3 -hydroxydamascone, alpha-terpineol, vanillin, <b>methyl</b> <b>vanillate,</b> 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid and tyrosol. Using p-nitrophenyl synthetic substrates, it was shown that O. oeni Lalvin EQ 54 has b-glucosidase, and limited a-l-rhamnopyranosidase and a-l-arabinofuranosidase activities. Release of aglycons from the Chardonnay wine glycosidic extract was increased when purified a-l-rhamnopyranosidase and a-l-arabinofuranosidase were added to the CDW medium together with the malolactic bacteria culture. The results obtained confirmed that O. oeni has the necessary glycosidases for the sequential liberation of the disaccharide sugars from wine glycosides. The rate of MLF proceeded much faster in the CDW supplemented with the Chardonnay wine glycoside extract (8 days compared to 20 days), even though the bacterial growth was unaffected...|$|E

In 1991 microplot tests, treatment with V. lecanii, vanillic acid, syringic acid plus V. lecanii, or vanillic acid plus V. lecanii lowered midseason cyst numbers compared with the untreated susceptible cultivar control, autoclaved V. lecanii treatment, or aldicarb treatment, At-harvest cyst numbers were lowest with V. lecanii and with vanillic acid treatments. Aldicarb treatment reduced midseason cyst numbers in 1992. There were no differences among seed yields either year. In the field trials, numbers of cysts were reduced one or both years with aldicarb, ferulic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, or 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzonitfile treatments, or with a resistant cultivar, compared to an untreated susceptible cultivar. Highest yields were recorded after treatment with 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzonitrile (1991), <b>methyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> (1992), and aldicarb (1992).

40|$|Póster presentado en la XVI Reunión Científica de la Sociedad Española de Cromatografía y Técnicas Afines (SECyTA 2016), celebrada en Sevilla del 2 al 4 de noviembre de 2016. This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of two groups of molecules in wine, enolones and vanillines. Both types of molecules present a common characteristic, their great polarity. Sotolon, maltol, furaneol and homofuraneol belong to the first group. Their chemical structures present certain similarity among them, which leads to similar physicochemical and olfactory properties. This group of compounds is described with the terms “burnt sugar, candy sugar, caramel and maple”. Sotolon and furaneol are the most powerful aromatic molecules within them, being their odor thresholds estimated in water‐ethanol matrix around 5 μg/L [1, 2]. The other group of molecules, vanillines, contributes to the oak related notes of alcoholic beverages. This work presents an automatized strategy to quantify the following aromatic compounds in wine: maltol, furaneol, homofuraneol, sotolon, vanillin, <b>methyl</b> <b>vanillate,</b> ethyl vanillate and acetovanillone. The development of this strategy implied the use of Gilson system (GX‐ 274 liquid handler). The proposed method {{is based on a}} solid phase extraction (SPE) using LiChrolut EN resins (50 mg). Three mL of wine were passed through a LiChrolut EN cartridge. After this, two consecutive washing up steps were applied.

40|$|As one of {{the three}} main {{components}} in woody biomass, lignin is an abundant but underused renewable raw material and carbon source. Owing to its aromatic structure and large availability as a by-product of pulping, its conversion into chemicals is highly attractive. In the present work, the oxidation of a softwood kraft lignin in acidic media was investigated {{in the presence of a}} homogeneous catalyst. The objective was to find a cheap but efficient catalyst for the depolymerization of kraft lignin into aromatic monomers. Different transition metal salts were screened and compared to phosphomolybdic acid, which was investigated in previous studies, and to experiments in sulfuric acid without additional catalyst. Vanillin and <b>methyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> were the main monomeric products detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry but their formation was only slightly increased by using transition metal salts (up to 6. 28 wt% yield). However, the presence of iron or copper chloride resulted in fast formation kinetics and significant amounts of other monomeric products. In addition, an efficient fragmentation of the lignin molecule from a weight-average molecular weight of 3500 g mol- 1 down to 500 g mol- 1 was observed by size-exclusion chromatography. The enhanced incorporation of oxygen into the reaction products in the presence of those catalysts was proven by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the influence of the catalyst concentration was studie...|$|E
40|$|Iodine is a {{well known}} {{antimicrobial}} compound. Laccase, an oxidoreductase which couples the one electron oxidation of diverse phenolic and non-phenolic substrates to the reduction of oxygen to water, is capable of oxidizing unreactive iodide to reactive iodine. We have shown previously that laccase-iodide treatment of spruce wood results in a wash-out resistant antimicrobial surface. In this study, we investigated whether phenolic compounds such as vanillin, which resembles sub-structures of softwood lignin, can be directly iodinated by reacting with laccase and iodide, resulting in compounds with antifungal activity. HPLC-MS analysis showed that vanillin was converted to iodovanillin by laccase catalysis at an excess of potassium iodide. No conversion of vanillin occurred {{in the absence of}} enzyme. The addition of redox mediators in catalytic concentrations increased the rate of iodide oxidation ten-fold and the yield of iodovanillin by 50 %. Iodinated phenolic products were also detected when o-vanillin, ethyl vanillin, acetovanillone and <b>methyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> were incubated with laccase and iodide. At an increased educt concentration of 0. 1 M an almost one to one molar ratio of iodide to vanillin could be used without compromising conversion rate, and the insoluble iodovanillin product could be recovered by simple centrifugation. The novel enzymatic synthesis procedure fulfills key criteria of green chemistry. Biocatalytically produced iodovanillin and iodo-ethyl vanillin had significant growth inhibitory effects on several wood degrading fungal species. For Trametes versicolor, a species causing white rot of wood, almost complete growth inhibition and a partial biocidal effect wa...|$|E
40|$|Activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway {{has emerged}} as a {{potential}} therapeutic target in androgenetic alopecia (AGA). <b>Methyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> (MV) - a safe plant-derived ingredient - has been recently shown to activate the WNT/β-catenin signaling. Objectives Two distinct substudies were conducted. First, we designed a 6 -month, uncontrolled, open-label clinical study to investigate whether topically applied MV may increase hair count and hair mass index (HMI) in female AGA. Second, we conducted a molecular study on the effect of MV on WNT 10 B mRNA expression in scalp biopsies of women with AGA. A total of 20 Caucasian women (age range: 25 - 57 years) with AGA (Sinclair grade 1 - 2) were included. The research product was an alcohol-free formulation supplied {{in the form of a}} spray containing 0. 2 % MV as the active ingredient. In the clinical study, hair count and HMI were found to increase at 6 months by 6 % (P < 0. 01) and 12 % (P < 0. 001), respectively, compared with baseline. No participant discontinued treatment due to adverse effects, and the overall patient satisfaction was good. At the molecular level, the topical application of the research product resulted in a 32 % increase in WNT 10 B mRNA expression levels in the temporal scalp area (P < 0. 001). Our pilot data suggest that topical MV can increase hair count and HMI by inducing WNT 10 B expression in the scalp, potentially serving as a novel treatment strategy for female AGA.

40|$|Ten phenols were {{selected}} as natural laccase mediators after screening 44 different compounds with a recalcitrant dye (Reactive Black 5) as a substrate. Their performances were evaluated at different mediator/dye ratios and incubation times (up to 6 h) {{by the use}} of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Trametes villosa laccases and were compared with those of eight known synthetic mediators (including -NOH- compounds). Among the six types of dyes assayed, only Reactive Blue 38 (phthalocyanine) was resistant to laccase-mediator treatment under the conditions used. Acid Blue 74 (indigoid dye), Reactive Blue 19 (anthraquinoid dye), and Aniline Blue (triarylmethane-type dye) were partially decolorized by the laccases alone, although decolorization was much more efficient and rapid with mediators, whereas Reactive Black 5 (diazo dye) and Azure B (heterocyclic dye) could be decolorized only in the presence of mediators. The efficiency of each natural mediator depended on the type of dye to be treated but, with the only exception being Azure B (< 50 % decolorization), nearly complete decolorization (80 to 100 %) was attained in all cases. Similar rates were attained with the best synthetic mediators, but the reactions were significantly slower. Phenolic aldehydes, ketones, acids, and esters related to the three lignin units were among the best mediators, including p-coumaric acid, vanillin, acetovanillone, <b>methyl</b> <b>vanillate,</b> and above all, syringaldehyde and acetosyringone. The last two compounds are especially promising as ecofriendly (and potentially cheap) mediators for industrial applications since they provided the highest decolorization rates in only 5 to 30 min, {{depending on the type of}} dye to be treated.

40|$|Lignin {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{constituents}} of wood together with cellulose and hemicellulose and can be used as a renewable feedstock for the production of chemicals. Lignin is an amorphous polymer which is separated from cellulose during the pulping processes in the paper industry. The Kraft process is the most extended pulping process and the so called Kraft lignin {{is one of the}} most promising sources for the obtaining of value-added products from its degradation. The catalytic oxidation of Kraft lignin under acidic conditions in the presence of oxygen for the production of value-added products has been under study during several years in the Institute of Process Engineering of the ETH Zürich (Laboratory of Transport and Reaction Processes, Prof. Dr. P. Rudolf von Rohr). The use of a polyoxometalate (POM) as a catalyst and methanol as a co-solvent were used to increase the monomeric product yield. Vanillin and <b>methyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> were the main products obtained. The increase of the product yields and the study of the influence of different parameters on the reaction are essential for the comprehension of the depolymerization reaction mechanism and for the developing of a process to obtain chemicals from a renewable feedstock. In this thesis, the reaction performance under the influence of different catalysts is studied. Different mineral acids, polyoxometalates (POMs) and conventional metal salts have been tested. The influence of the variation of some reaction parameters as pH, catalyst concentration and solvent composition have been studied as well. Different samples were taken at different time steps to monitor the progression of the reaction. The experiments were carried out in a Batch 400 mL autoclave at 170 °C and 10 bar of O 2 pressure. A heat exchanger was coupled to the reactor allowing the sampling during the reaction. The reaction products were extracted with chloroform and analyzed by gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for their quantification and identification. Molecular weight distributions of the samples were measured by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Transition metal salts have been proven to be appropriate catalysts to increase the amount of products obtained and the depolymerization degree of the original lignin in comparison with the results obtained in the experiments without catalysts.
