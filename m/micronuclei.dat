50|$|The ciliated {{protozoan}} Tetrahymena is {{a useful}} research model for studying nuclear dimorphism; it maintains two distinct nuclear genomes, the <b>micronucleus</b> and the macronucleus. The <b>micronucleus</b> genome contains five chromosomes that undergo mitosis during micronuclear division and meiosis during conjugation, which is the sexual division of the <b>micronucleus.</b> The macronuclear genome is broken down and catabolized once per life cycle during conjugation, allowing it to be site-specific, and a new macronucleus differentiates from a mitotic descendant of the conjugated <b>micronucleus.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the occurrence of}} spontaneous chromosome damage in cultured peripheral lymphocytes of subjects with idiopathic and prescleroderma Raynaud's phenomenon, by means of molecular cytogenetic analysis. Using the <b>micronucleus</b> assay as a marker of chromosome alteration, we studied 30 patients with pre-scleroderma Raynaud's phenomenon, 30 patients with idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon and 30 healthy subjects. All subjects were classified as ANA-, ACA+ or Scl 70 +. To identify the mechanism of <b>micronucleus</b> formation, fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis was also performed. Pre-scleroderma Raynaud's phenomenon subjects showed significantly higher <b>micronucleus</b> frequencies than idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon subjects and controls (37. 0 +/- 11. 5 vs. 11. 1 +/- 3. 2 and 10. 7 +/- 2. 7 respectively p < 0. 0001). Interestingly, subjects with idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon displayed <b>micronucleus</b> frequency {{comparable to that of}} healthy controls. Furthermore, ACA+ subjects showed the highest <b>micronucleus</b> frequencies (41. 0 +/- 7. 6) as compared to subjects with Scl 70 + antibody (25. 0 +/- 3. 5). Our results show that circulating lymphocytes of only pre-scleroderma Raynaud's phenomenon subjects undergo chromosomal damage, as detected by the <b>micronucleus</b> assay, at a higher rate than expected. No prevalence of aneuploidogenic or clastogenic events in <b>micronucleus</b> formation is revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis...|$|R
25|$|These <b>micronuclei</b> undergo {{defective}} DNA replication, {{which is}} slower than DNA replication {{in the main}} nucleus and causes a proximal DNA damage response (DDR) to be initiated. However, DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint activation fail to follow. Consequently, chromosomes that are not correctly replicated in <b>micronuclei</b> become fragmented. The method by which the pulverization of these chromosomes occur is not fully understood, but it {{is thought to be}} caused either by aberrant DNA replication or by premature chromosome condensation, which entails semi-replicated chromosomes being compacted by cyclin-dependent kinase activity. The resulting fragmented chromosome segments can be joined together to give rise to a rearranged chromosome, which can subsequently be reincorporated into the main nucleus of a daughter cell. The new chromosome can persist for several generations of cell cycle divisions and {{contribute to the development of}} a cancer cell.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To 60 Co-γ radiation-induced <b>micronucleus</b> {{in human}} {{peripheral}} blood lymphocyte was the model, and then the protective effects of Liquiritin were evaluated. Method: Venous blood was drawn from healthy adults who met the inclusion criteria for the experiment, and {{peripheral blood lymphocyte}}s and mutant <b>micronucleus</b> cells were cultured according to literature methods. The experiment was divided into control group, irradiated group and Liquiritin-treated group (treated with 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 μg/mL of Liquiritin 1 h before and after irradiation). The lymphocytic <b>micronucleus</b> rate of three groups were measured and compared. Results: After the irradiation with the dose of 2 Gy, compared with the control group, lymphocytic <b>micronucleus</b> rate of irradiated group significantly increased; there were no statistical differences between irradiated group and the groups treated with 25 or 50 μg/mL Liquiritin; but <b>micronucleus</b> rate was significantly decreased in the groups treated with 100, 200 and 400 μg/mL Liquiritin.

The results showed that the <b>micronucleus</b> frequency decreased, and that the mitotic index and chromosomal aberration frequency showed linear dose responses to CrO 3, in treatment of microwave for 5 s. In microwave of 25 s, the mitotic index decreased, the <b>micronucleus</b> frequency and chromosomal aberration frequency increased with increase of CrO 3 concentration.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{publications}} on {{the automated}} in vitro <b>micronucleus</b> assay show predictive values higher than 85 % for {{the classification of}} in vitro aneugens, clastogens and non-genotoxic compounds. In the present work, the CHO-k 1 <b>micronucleus</b> assay in combination with cellular imaging was further evaluated. Firstly, {{the effect of a}} range of S 9 concentrations on <b>micronucleus</b> formation and cytotoxicity was investigated. Subsequently, the reproducibility and predictivity of the <b>micronucleus</b> assay on CHO-k 1 cells was investigated with a set of four compounds. Then, a larger set of compounds (n= 44) was tested on CHO-k 1 cells and inter-laboratory correlation was calculated. Finally, cellular imaging was compared with flow cytometry for in vivo assessment of <b>micronucleus</b> formation. The concentration of S 9 {{had a significant impact on}} <b>micronucleus</b> formation and cytotoxicity. In addition, calculations of relative cell count (RCC) and cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) showed to be complementary to cytotoxicity assessment. The CHO-k 1 <b>micronucleus</b> assay correctly classified the four reference compounds, with a dose-response relationship and low variability. Based on a larger set of compounds, the assay proved to be reliable with a sensitivity of 94 % (n = 31) and a specificity of 85 % (n = 13). A correlation coefficient of 97 % was obtained when the lowest observable adverse effect levels (LOAELs) from our study were compared with those published by Diaz et al. (2007) [10]. In conclusion, the in vitro CHO-k 1 <b>micronucleus</b> assay combined with cellular imaging is a predictive assay appropriate for genotoxicity screening at early stages of drug development. In addition, for in vivo assessment of <b>micronucleus</b> formation, we preferred to use flow cytometry rather than cell imaging. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Somehow, hairdresser are constantly exposed to chemical substances such as aromatic amines, hydrogen peroxide, thioglycolic acid, formaldehyde in hair products which can cause damage to human’s genome. <b>Micronucleus</b> {{is one of the}} effective biomarker for processes associated with the induction of DNA damage. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the <b>micronucleus</b> frequencies in buccal mucosa epithelial cells of hairdresser who were exposed to chemical of hair products. Method: This study was conducted on twenty female subjects, who were divided into 2 groups: exposed and non-exposed (control) group. All subjects recruited were working in the same beauty salon. Buccal cells were obtained from each individual by using cytobrush. The cells were stained with modified Feulgen-Ronssenback method and counting of <b>micronucleus</b> per 1000 cell was done under light microscope.

2500|$|Arsenic is {{reported}} to cause DNA modifications such as aneuploidy, <b>micronuclei</b> formation, chromosome abnormality, deletion mutations, sister chromatid exchange and crosslinking of DNA with proteins. It has been demonstrated that arsenic does not directly interact with DNA and it is considered a poor mutagen, but instead, it helps mutagenicity of other carcinogens. For instance, a synergistic increase in the mutagenic activity of arsenic with UV light has been observed in human and other mammalian cells after exposing the UV-treated cells to arsenic. A series of experimental observations suggest that the arsenic genotoxicity is primarily linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during its biotransformation. The ROS production is able to generate DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks, crosslinks and chromosomal aberrations. The oxidative damage is caused by modification of DNA nucleobases, in particular 8-oxoguanine (8-OHdG) which leads to G:C to T:A [...] mutations. Inorganic arsenic can also cause DNA strand break even at low concentrations.|$|E
