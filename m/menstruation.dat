5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} {{during the first}} few days of <b>menstruation.</b> Severe uterine pain during <b>menstruation</b> is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When <b>menstruation</b> begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their <b>menstruation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular <b>menstruation</b> {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but {{anywhere}} from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during <b>menstruation</b> is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience Menorrhagia are more susceptible to iron deficiency than the average person. An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E
5|$|Very little flow (less than 10 ml) {{is called}} hypomenorrhea. Regular cycles with {{intervals}} of 21 days or fewer are polymenorrhea; frequent but irregular <b>menstruation</b> {{is known as}} metrorrhagia. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed menorrhagia. Heavy <b>menstruation</b> that occurs frequently and irregularly is menometrorrhagia. The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is oligomenorrhea. Amenorrhea refers to more than {{three to six months}} without menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman's reproductive years.|$|E
5|$|Among {{women living}} closely together, {{it was once}} thought that the onsets of <b>menstruation</b> tend to synchronize. This effect was first {{described}} in 1971, and possibly explained {{by the action of}} pheromones in 1998. Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of <b>menstruation</b> at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of <b>menstruation</b> at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|Some yoga {{practitioners}} do {{not recommend}} certain yoga exercises for women during <b>menstruation,</b> for pregnant women, or for nursing mothers. However, meditation, breathing exercises, and certain postures which {{are safe and}} beneficial for women in these categories are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms in PID {{range from}} none to severe. If there are symptoms, then fever, {{cervical}} motion tenderness, lower abdominal pain, new or different discharge, painful intercourse, uterine tenderness, adnexal tenderness, or irregular <b>menstruation</b> may be noted.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, <b>menstruation</b> stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After <b>menstruation</b> returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|After <b>menstruation</b> and {{directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and <b>menstruation</b> is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of <b>menstruation</b> and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E
5|$|Men wear tzitzit {{on their}} African print shirts, women follow the niddah (biblical laws {{concerning}} <b>menstruation),</b> and newborn boys are circumcised. In {{accordance with their}} interpretation of the Bible, the Black Hebrews follow a strictly vegan diet and only wear natural fabrics. Most men {{have more than one}} wife, and birth control is not permitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful <b>menstruation</b> cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the ovarian cycle and it {{corresponds}} to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies. Falling levels of progesterone trigger <b>menstruation</b> {{and the beginning of the}} next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused <b>menstruation</b> to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes {{that occur in the}} follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of <b>menstruation,</b> proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended. Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during <b>menstruation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular <b>menstruation.</b> Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for the}} production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to <b>menstruation.</b> Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E
5|$|While copper IUDs may {{increase}} menstrual bleeding {{and result in}} more painful cramps hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop <b>menstruation</b> altogether. Cramping can be treated with NSAIDs. Other potential complications include expulsion (2–5%) and rarely perforation of the uterus (less than 0.7%). A previous model of the intrauterine device (the Dalkon shield) was {{associated with an increased}} risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, <b>menstruation,</b> pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, <b>menstruation</b> occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which <b>menstruation</b> began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, <b>menstruation,</b> and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – {{are more likely to have}} low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers are more likely to have low back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E
5|$|Major Shakta temple festivals are Meenakshi Kalyanam and Ambubachi Mela. The Meenakshi Kalyanam {{is a part}} of the Chithirai Thiruvizha {{festival in}} Madurai around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of goddess Meenakshi (Parvati) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva {{communities}} join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister Meenakshi in marriage to Shiva. Ambubachi Mela or Ameti is a celebration of the <b>menstruation</b> of the goddess, by hundreds of thousands of devotees, in a festival held in June/July (during the monsoon season) at Kamakhya Temple, Guwahati, Assam. Here the Devi is worshiped in the form of a yoni-like stone, and the site is one of Shakta Pitha or pilgrimage sites in Shaktism.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{perceptions}} of the Hinomaru exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in Okinawa. In one notable example of this, on October 26, 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the Hinomaru {{before the start of}} the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the Hinomaru not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of Kimigayo. In the capital city of Naha, Okinawa, the Hinomaru was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city's 80th anniversary in 2001. In the People's Republic of China and South Korea, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 formal adoption of the Hinomaru was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the Yasukuni Shrine, US-Japan military cooperation and the creation of a missile defense program. In other nations that Japan occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, the older generation still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views. The Philippines government not only believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state has a right to create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the Hinomaru, but foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan. Some people have humorously drawn an analogy between the Japanese flag and the appearance of a <b>menstruation</b> stain on a white bedsheet.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their <b>menstruation</b> and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E
25|$|In Ethiopia, Beta Jewish {{women were}} {{separated}} from male society {{and sent to}} <b>menstruation</b> huts during menarche and every <b>menstruation</b> following as the blood associated with <b>menstruation</b> in the Beta Jewish culture {{was believed to be}} impure. The Beta Jews built their villages surrounding and near bodies of water specifically for their women to have a place to clean themselves. The <b>menstruation</b> huts were built close to these bodies of water.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{public schools}} have a sex {{education}} program that teaches girls about <b>menstruation</b> and what to expect {{at the onset of}} menarche (often this takes place during the 4th grade). Historically <b>menstruation</b> has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and <b>menstruation</b> by their mothers or a female role model. Then, and to an extent now, <b>menstruation</b> was a private matter and a girl's menarche was not a community phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of South Asia, women are {{isolated}} during <b>menstruation.</b> In 2005, in Nepal, the Supreme Court abolished the practice of chhaupadi, keeping women in cow-sheds during <b>menstruation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} regulations also forbid {{sexual relations}} {{on the day}} that a woman expects to start menstruating; there are three days that fall under this regulation, known as the veset, namely the same day of the month as her previous <b>menstruation</b> began; the day exactly 30 days after the previous <b>menstruation</b> started; and the day that is the usual interval from the end of her previous <b>menstruation.</b> If the woman is not actually menstruating during a veset day, then there are certain circumstances wherein sexual activity is permitted according to most authorities, for example, if a woman's husband is about to travel, and will return only after <b>menstruation</b> has begun.|$|E
25|$|Finally, calendar-based methods {{assume that}} all {{bleeding}} is true <b>menstruation.</b> However, mid-cycle or anovulatory bleeding {{can be caused by}} a number of factors. Incorrectly identifying bleeding as <b>menstruation</b> will cause the method's calculations to be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Dysmenorrhea, {{also known}} as painful periods, or menstrual cramps, is pain during <b>menstruation.</b> Its usual onset occurs around the time that <b>menstruation</b> begins. Symptoms {{typically}} last less than three days. The pain is usually in the pelvis or lower abdomen. Other symptoms may include back pain, diarrhea, or nausea.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{different}} Biblical regulations for normal <b>menstruation</b> - niddah, and abnormal <b>menstruation</b> - zavah, these became conflated during the classical era. The Talmud relates that menstruating women always followed the requirements imposed by both; {{the reasons for this}} were the subject of debate between some medieval Jewish commentators.|$|E
25|$|If {{fertility}} is not {{the primary}} aim, then <b>menstruation</b> can usually be regulated with a contraceptive pill. The purpose of regulating <b>menstruation,</b> in essence, is for the woman's convenience, and perhaps her sense of well-being; there is no medical requirement for regular periods, {{as long as they}} occur sufficiently often.|$|E
25|$|<b>Menstruation</b> {{is managed}} by menstruating women {{to avoid damage}} to {{clothing}} or to accord with norms of public life. Menstrual management practices range from medical suppression of <b>menstruation,</b> through wearing special garments or other items, washing or avoidance of washing, disposal and laundry of stained materials, to separation of menstruators to particular places or activities.|$|E
25|$|Hormone shifts such {{as those}} that precede <b>menstruation</b> and those during menopause.|$|E
25|$|Hunters' {{prohibitions}} on sex and <b>menstruation</b> {{are expected}} to operate within a lunar/menstrual cosmology.|$|E
