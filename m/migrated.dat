40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{willingness}} to <b>migrate</b> in the Czech Republic. We find that variables measuring regional labour market conditions and amenities contribute little to explaining {{the willingness to}} <b>migrate,</b> but that personal and household characteristics are more important. Persons owning family houses are substantially less willing to <b>migrate</b> {{and the relationship between}} the willingness to <b>migrate</b> and income is U shaped, persons experiencing longer unemployment spells are not less willing to <b>migrate</b> and commuting may at least partially compensate for low willingness to <b>migrate.</b> Finally, {{with the exception of the}} less educated, the willingness to <b>migrate</b> of all groups analysed reacts only weakly to regional labour market conditions and amenities. ...|$|R

To <b>migrate</b> abroad for education and definitely return <b>migrate</b> (respectively to <b>migrate</b> abroad for education, return <b>migrate</b> when adult, and <b>migrate</b> again when old) is possible if the life-cycle indirect utility is higher than the life-cycle indirect utilities of each other cases, including those in M_∅. The major difficulty in studying the convergence of the dynamics of these two cases is that prices will change over time with migration flows so that an individual must anticipate all possible movements prior to make the decision to <b>migrate</b> and return <b>migrate.</b> Nothing indicates that in an overlapping generations model with three periods, each economy reaches a post-migration steady-state equilibrium.|$|R

5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} {{independent}} environmental consulting group FishBio {{showed that the}} artificial spring pulse flows from New Melones Dam do fairly little to support salmon and steelhead out-migration in the Stanislaus River.

In the spring of 2016 about 12,500 juvenile salmon <b>migrated</b> downriver to the sea during April and May, but less than 1percent <b>migrated</b> during the pulse flow. In years of drought when the lake level is low, releasing water during the spring creates consequences {{later in the year}} – because there is not enough cold water left for the autumn spawning run.|$|E

5|$|As Jupiter <b>migrated</b> inward {{following}} its formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have {{swept across the}} asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative action of the resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have <b>migrated</b> to the inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets.
