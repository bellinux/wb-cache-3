40|$|Diploma thesis aims on {{mechanical}} design of new concept of Zetor UŘ III engine with displacement increase and solves calculations of <b>main</b> <b>and</b> <b>pin</b> hydrodynamic bearings of crankshaft. Creo 2 CAD software {{is used for}} preparing {{mechanical design}} of this new concept. For computation and analysis of hydrodynamic bearings multibody model of crankshaft mechanism is used with flexible FEM model of crankshaft for solving dynamics of mechanism and performing hydrodynamic analysis of bearings in FEV Virtual Engine. Results of this diploma thesis demonstrate the feasibility of new concept of engine {{and serve as a}} basis for next engineering tasks before realization of concept...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis. {{deals with}} a {{crankshaft}} analysis of the VW 6, 0 W 12 engine. The first {{goal is to create}} a CAD model from the real part, then to create a FEM model for computer simulations. With respect to a dynamic character of the loading, the crankshaft is then reduced into a MNF file for the purpose of dynamic simulations in the MBS ADAMS/Engine. The full range of working RPMs is simulated in it. Beside the crankshaft the <b>main</b> <b>and</b> <b>pin</b> bearings are studied too. At the last part of this thesis the durability of the crankshaft is solved...|$|E
40|$|Many of today's engines require {{extremely}} smooth crankshaft <b>main</b> <b>and</b> <b>pin</b> finishes due to increasingly tighter bearing clearances {{and the use}} of thinner viscosity motor oils. If the polishing of the crankshaft mains and pins are not adequate, microscopic surface peaks {{can cause}} premature bearing failure. A new method has been developed to inspect surface finish using a blue light source and a camera. Our team was tasked to take this new method and build an automated machine to prove its capabilities. With this new method, it is proven that a crankshaft can be inspected accurately for a polished or non-polished analysis in under 36 seconds. It is also proven that this new inspection method is a more efficient method since it is able to inspect each crankshaft off the manufacturing line as opposed to the current method of inspecting only one in every 50. Specifications The most important specification is that the entire inspection process must take less than 36 seconds. Second, each surface must be positioned with respect to the camera within a tolerance of millimeters. Lastly, due to the speed at which the crankshaft will rotate, a crankshaft weight constraint of 100 to 300 N was established. Concepts and Selection Several concepts were generated using a design matrix as seen in Appendix A. This was used to evaluate each concept in order to narrow down the best solution for each function, consisting of the mechanism’s movement and sensing position. Each concept was evaluated against several parameters. These involved first and foremost meeting the customer requirements, then minimizing the footprint, cost, and weight of the mechanism. The ease of manufacturing, feasibility of assembly, and the precision of the solution are other parameters we used for our evaluation. Using each of these parameters we assigned each concept a value. The concepts with the highest values were then designed further to create the Final Design...|$|E

40|$|A double-retention {{redundant}} {{pull pin}} release system is disclosed. The system responds {{to a single}} pull during an intentional release operation. A spiral-threaded main pin is seated in a mating bore in a housing, which main pin has a flange fastened thereon at {{the part of the}} main pin which is exterior to the housing. Accidental release tends to rotate the main pin. A secondary pin passes through a slightly oversized opening in the flange and is seated in a second bore in the housing. The pins counteract against one another to prevent accidental release. A frictional lock is shared between the <b>main</b> <b>and</b> secondary <b>pins</b> to enhance further locking of the system. The secondary pin, in response to a first pull, is fully retracted from its bore and flange hole. Thereafter the pull causes the main pin to rotate free of the housing to release, for example, a parachute mechanism...|$|R
40|$|As the {{key part}} of {{internal}} combustion engines, crankshaft with high efficiency and accuracy processing {{has always been the}} target of the engine manufacturer’s pursuit. Grinding is used to obtain the ultimate dimensional accuracy and surface finish in the crankshaft machining. Grinding of the <b>main</b> journals <b>and</b> the <b>pin</b> journals can be accomplished in a single clamping operation by CNC Tangential Point Tracing grinding technology. However, the chatter in the grinding process is harmful to the precision and surface quality. In this paper, stability lobe diagram is developed to predict the grinding chatter. First the dynamic model of Tangential Point Tracing grinding system is established. Then the limit formula of the critical grinding depth is calculated and the stability lobe diagram of the grinding system is presented. Finally, the validation experiments are carried out on the crankshaft grinding machine and the results are consistent with the calculation...|$|R

These were largely based on their gasoline engines but with heavier duty cast blocks, re-designed heads, fast glow plugs, and on the 5.7L, oversized cranks, <b>main</b> bearings, <b>and</b> wrist <b>pins.</b> There were several problems with these engines, including water and corrosion in the injectors (no water separator in the fuel line), paraffin clogging of fuel lines and filters in cold weather, reduced lubrication in the heads due to undersized oil galleys, head bolt failures, {{and the use of}} aluminum rockers and stanchions in the 4.3L V8 engines. While the 5.7L was also offered on various Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Pontiac models, it was eventually discontinued by all divisions in 1985. [...] 4.3L V6 diesels were also offered between 1982 and 1985.|$|R
