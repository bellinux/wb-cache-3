5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring <b>merit</b> to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the <b>merit</b> of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The <b>merit</b> transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the <b>merit,</b> the act of transferring <b>merit</b> will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of <b>merit</b> is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives <b>merit,</b> if he approves of the <b>merit</b> done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of <b>merit</b> to occur. The purposes for <b>merit</b> transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring <b>merit</b> is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The <b>merit</b> that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring <b>merit,</b> apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Merit</b> is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, <b>merit</b> was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. <b>Merit</b> is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of <b>merit</b> is demerit (papa), and it is believed that <b>merit</b> is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, <b>merit</b> has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of <b>merit.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Merit</b> can {{be gained}} {{in a number}} of ways, such as giving, virtue and mental development. In addition, there are many forms of merit-making {{described}} in ancient Buddhist texts. A similar concept of kusala (Sanskrit: kusala) is also known, which is different from <b>merit</b> in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, his teachings, the Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma), and the Sangha. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. <b>Merit</b> has become part of rituals, daily and weekly practice, and festivals. In addition, there is a widespread custom of transferring <b>merit</b> to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. <b>Merit</b> has been that important in Buddhist societies, that kingship was often legitimated through it, and still is.|$|E
5|$|<b>Merit</b> system: The {{earliest}} {{example of}} a <b>merit</b> system {{dates back to the}} Qin and Han dynasties. In order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials. Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by <b>merit,</b> through the civil service examinations, and education became the key for social mobility. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established during the Three Kingdoms period. The concept of a <b>merit</b> system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.|$|E

40|$|As {{the debate}} rages {{about the power}} and wisdom of Congress to “strip” federal courts of {{jurisdiction}} to adjudicate particular controversial federal issues, the discussion either ignores another means of constricting the power and influence of the courts. That is the distinct act of “merits stripping. ” <b>Merits</b> stripping eliminates, limits, or diminishes enforceable substantive rights and the <b>merits</b> of claims brought to enforce those rights. <b>Merits</b> strips diminish the amount of real-world actors and conduct subject to legal duties and protected by legal rights. <b>Merits</b> striping limits who can sue whom over what conduct. <b>Merits</b> strips can target statutory or constitutional rights and can {{be affected by the}} legislative, executive, or judicial departments, acting individually or in concert. A “strip” occurs whenever the scope of legal rights (and the legal duties those rights impose on others) falls below some baseline of preexisting law or normative preference. Unfortunately, courts and commentators often conflate <b>merits</b> stripping with true jurisdiction stripping. But they are necessarily distinct concepts and such conflation confounds our ability to understand both. Three differences loom. First, while jurisdiction strips shift litigation out of federal court and into another forum (presumably state courts), <b>merits</b> strips eliminate enforceable rights altogether, in any forum. Second, the manner of litigating and resolving legal and factual issues will be different, depending on whether the “stripping enactment” being applied in court targets <b>merits</b> or jurisdiction; this distinction between <b>merits</b> stripping and jurisdiction stripping is a sub-category of the broader differences between judicial jurisdiction and substantive <b>merits.</b> Third, and most importantly, the structural and constitutional controversy surrounding the power to jurisdiction strip does not apply to <b>merits</b> stripping. Congress clearly has the power to redefine statutory rights, including narrowing those rights; courts clearly have the power to define constitutional rights, including narrowing those rights. One might disagree with the resulting scope of federal rights. But one cannot question the basic power to define those rights. This article defines and examines multiple examples of <b>merits</b> stripping of federal statutory and constitutional rights. It then considers the differences between <b>merits</b> stripping and jurisdiction stripping and how those differences play out in court. Ultimately, distinguishing these concepts is essential to understanding the operation of federal law in the federal courts...|$|R

5|$|Two {{practices}} {{mentioned in}} the list of meritorious acts have been studied quite extensively by scholars: dedicating (or transferring) <b>merit</b> to others, and rejoicing in others' merits. Transferring <b>merit</b> is a widespread custom in all Buddhist countries, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna and Theravāda. In the Pāli tradition, the word pattidāna is used, meaning 'giving of the acquired'. And in the Sanskrit tradition, the word pariṇāmanā is used for transferring <b>merit,</b> meaning 'bending round or towards, transfer, dedication'. Of these translations, 'transfer of merit' has become commonplace, though objected to by some scholars.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{governor}} controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 {{according to a}} 1992 estimate—the office has been historically {{considered one of the}} most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, {{the governor}} is given wide discretion in awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor's appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an executive order creating a <b>merit</b> system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert T. Combs, pushed a new <b>merit</b> system through the legislature, protecting it from abolition by executive order. Despite the presence of the <b>merit</b> system, many governors have been criticized for abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration were indicted for violating the <b>merit</b> system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part of an agreement with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.|$|E

40|$|Government {{intervention}} in the financial and social affairs of citizens has increased dramatically in the last fifty years. As a result, government administrative decisions continually affect the everyday lives of people. Many of these decisions are discretionary. Modern administrative law has grown to meet the need for governments, rather than the courts, to supervise the exercise of administrative power so that injustice resulting from misuse of power can be avoided. The <b>merits</b> review system {{is an integral part}} of this administrative law. The effectiveness of the <b>merits</b> review system is dependent upon how Parliament makes provision for <b>merits</b> review in the legislative process. The object of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the scope of the Commonwealth administrative law <b>merits</b> review system. An evaluation of the availability of rights of review of the <b>merits</b> of Commonwealth administrative decisions will determine the extent to which Commonwealth law provides for <b>merits</b> review of administrative decisions. This thesis makes such an evaluation by undertaking an empirical study of the <b>merits</b> review provisions in Commonwealth legislation. The empirical study analyses 1, 070 Commonwealth statutes and establishes that there are 340 statutes that confer power to make a reviewable decision or decisions. However, only 30 percent of these statutes provide for <b>merits</b> review of all reviewable decisions, while 44 percent provide for <b>merits</b> review of some decisions and 26 percent do not provide for <b>merits</b> review of any decisions. Consequently, the empirical study identifies inconsistencies in the provision of <b>merits</b> review of Commonwealth administrative decisions. The Australian parliamentary executive system of government has permitted a breakdown in the legislative drafting process that has allowed these inconsistencies to develop. Moreover, the executive arm of the Commonwealth government has diminished its accountability to Parliament for some of the administrative decisions made by it. A person affected by an unreviewable administrative decision may be treated unjustly as a result...|$|R
