30|$|Due to the {{outstanding}} properties, high surface area, ordered alignment, and morphology adjustability of TiO 2 nanotubes, it shows great potential in gas detection. However, the pure TiO 2 nanotubes {{are hard to}} meet the high detection requirement because of its limitation in gas response, detection range, response time, and operational temperature. In this regard, great efforts {{have been made to}} extend the gas detection properties. Currently, a few modification methods: <b>metal</b> <b>decoration,</b> doping, semiconductor composites are introduced to improve the gas sensing properties [38, 39]. Comparing the different modification methods, <b>metal</b> <b>decoration</b> {{is one of the most}} effectively method to significantly enhance the gas response of TiO 2.|$|E
40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>decoration</b> on hollow {{metal oxide}} {{nanostructures}} {{is an attractive}} route to enhance gas sensing properties. Herein, we present a facile method for the utilization of <b>metal</b> <b>decoration</b> on both {{the inner and outer}} surfaces of hollow metal oxide nanostructure for the first time. Close-packed SnO 2 nanodome arrays decorated with Au nanoparticles are fabricated by soft-template method and self-agglomeration of an Au film. The position of Au decoration for SnO 2 nanodome arrays is controlled by changing the deposition sequence of Au and SnO 2 films. While inside, outside, and both-side Au-decorated SnO 2 nanodome arrays show much higher responses to various gases than a bare SnO 2 nanodome, it is shown that the response of both-side Au-decorated SnO 2 nanodome arrays to C 2 H 5 OH at 300 °C is 18 times higher than that of the bare SnO 2 nanodome arrays and the theoretical detection limit is below 1 ppb. These are attributed to the catalytic effect of Au nanoparticles on the modulation of barrier potentials in links between the individual SnO 2 nanodomes. Our results demonstrate that the utilization of both-side <b>metal</b> <b>decoration</b> is an effective strategy for enhancing the gas sensing performance of hollow metal oxide nanostructures. &# 169; 2015 Elsevier B.

30|$|In gas sensing field, the {{conductivity}} {{response is}} determined by the efficiency of catalytic reactions of sensing materials with detected gas taken place at the surface of gas sensing materials. The control of catalytic activity of gas sensor material {{is one of the most}} commonly used methods to enhance the performance, especially in detection of low reducing gases, such as ethanol vapor, H 2 and CO. Therefore, the pure ZnO thin film exhibits a very poor sensitivity and selectivity [64, 65]. Usually, noble metals are high-effective catalysts, which can be used to enhance the reactions on gas sensor surfaces. Thus, if the noble <b>metal</b> <b>decoration</b> can be introduced into self-powered active gas sensing, then higher-performance gas sensor can probably be realized.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{materials}} {{consisting of}} oxygen plasma-treated multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with metal nanoparticles (e. g. Rh, Pd, Au or Ni) can be tailored for {{the recognition of}} benzene vapors with high sensitivity and selectivity. Metal nanoparticles donate or accept {{a significant amount of}} charge upon adsorption of a target molecule, so as to affect electron transport in the nanotube. The plasma treatment enables the cleaning, activation, functionalization and <b>metal</b> <b>decoration</b> of carbon nanotubes in a single step, which offers enormous flexibility for tuning the interfacial properties of the resulting hybrid materials. When combined in a microsensor array operating at room temperature, the use of benzene-sensitive and benzene-insensitive metal-decorated multiwalled carbon nanotubes can provide selective detection of benzene at trace levels with a detection limit below 50 ppb. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The measurement shows the strongly different recombination activities of the three grain boundaries and reveals micron-sized denuded zones around the left grain boundary. The linescan across this grain boundary highlights the spatial resolution of micro-photoluminescence lifetime mapping. Micron-sized denuded zones could not be detected prior to the application of μPLS and μRS. The origin could be slowly diffusing impurities, which are internally gettered at the grain boundary during the block casting, which cleans {{the area around the}} grain boundary from these impurities. The lower right grain boundaries are highly recombination active, which is probably caused by a high <b>metal</b> <b>decoration.</b> Metal precipitates are also the most likely origin of the round structures along this grain boundary.|$|E
