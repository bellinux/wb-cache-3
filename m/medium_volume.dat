Adult plants are different from other genus members in this ecosystem due to their size, and efforts to locate the plants may lead to their extraction from the savannah and, frequently, plant death.

The MS (50 and 25 %) media and WPM (100 and 50 %) media were the most effective for plantlet regeneration. The best responses were observed in 15 - and 25 -mL volumes of the MS (50 %) medium.

The results of the study show that the SPUI provides a significant improvement in the efficiency of the interchange over a TDI in medium and heavy traffic loadings, due to the use of a single signal and free flowing right turn movements. It was also found that either configuration provide comparable results under light traffic volumes.

40|$|Abstract Background Primary keratinocytes {{derived from}} epidermis, oral mucosa, and urothelium {{are used in}} {{construction}} of cell based wound healing devices and in regenerative medicine. This study presents in vitro technology that rapidly expands keratinocytes in culture by growing monolayers under large volumes of serum-free, essential fatty acid free, low calcium medium that is replaced every 24 [*]hrs. Methods Primary cell cultures were produced from epidermal skin, oral mucosa and ureter by trypsinization of tissue. Cells were grown using Epilife medium with growth factors under high <b>medium</b> <b>volumes.</b> Once densely confluent, the keratinocyte monolayer produced cells in suspension in the overlying medium that can be harvested every 24 [*]hrs. over a 7 – 10 [*]day period. The cell suspension (approximately 8 X 10 5 cells/ml) is poured into a new flask to form another confluent monolayer over 2 – 4 [*]days. This new culture, in turn produced additional cell suspensions that when serially passed expand the cell strain over 2 – 3 [*]months, {{without the use of}} enzymes to split the cultures. The cell suspension, called e pithelial P op U p K eratinocytes (ePUKs) were analyzed for culture expansion, cell size and glucose utilization, attachment to carrier beads, micro-spheroid formation, induction of keratinocyte differentiation, and characterized by immunohistochemistry. Results The ePUKs expanded greatly in culture, attached to carrier beads, did not form micro-spheroids, used approximately 50 % of medium glucose over 24 [*]hrs., contained a greater portion of smaller diameter cells (8 – 10 microns), reverted to classical appearing cultures when returned to routine feeding schedules (48 [*]hrs. and 15 [*]ml/T- 75 flask) and can be differentiated by either adding 1. 2 [*]mM medium calcium, or essential fatty acids. The ePUK cells are identified as cycling (Ki 67 expressing) basal cells (p 63, K 14 expressing). Conclusions Using this primary culture technique, large quantities of epithelial cells can be generated without the use of the enzyme trypsin to split the cultures. The cells are small in diameter and have basal cell progenitor/”stem” (P/SC) cell characteristics induced by daily feeding with larger than normal <b>medium</b> <b>volumes.</b> The ePUK epithelial cells have the potential to be used in regenerative medicine and for basic studies of epithelia P/SC phenotype. </p...|$|R

However, for thinly surfaced pavements subjected to low to <b>medium</b> <b>volumes</b> of traffics, the importance of non-linear stress-strain behavior of unbound granular materials (UGM) {{requires the use of}} more sophisticated numerical models for structural design and performance of such pavements. In the present work, nonlinear unbound aggregates constitutive model is implemented within an axi-symmetric finite element code developed to simulate the nonlinear behavior of pavement structures including two local aggregates of different mineralogical nature, typically used in Algerian pavements. The performance of the mechanical model is examined about its capability of representing adequately, under various conditions, the granular material non-linearity in pavement analysis. In addition, deflection data collected by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) are incorporated into the analysis in order to assess the sensitivity of critical pavement design criteria and pavement design life to the constitutive model.
