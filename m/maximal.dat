5|$|A being has <b>maximal</b> greatness {{if it has}} <b>maximal</b> {{excellence}} in every possible world.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>maximal</b> clique listing problem, {{the input}} is an undirected graph, and the output {{is a list}} of all its <b>maximal</b> cliques. The maximum clique problem may be solved using as a {{subroutine}} an algorithm for the <b>maximal</b> clique listing problem, because the maximum clique must be included among all the <b>maximal</b> cliques.|$|E
5|$|This {{follows from}} the fact that finding Hamiltonian cycles in <b>maximal</b> planar graphs is NP-complete. In a <b>maximal</b> planar graph, the book {{thickness}} is two if and only if a Hamiltonian cycle exists. Therefore, it is also NP-complete to test whether the book thickness of a given <b>maximal</b> planar graph is two.|$|E
5000|$|The Autobot race {{eventually}} {{evolve in}} to the <b>Maximals,</b> who, like their predecessors, are generally depicted as respecting all life and following a path of peace before war. They follow the tenets of the Pax Cybertronia. The <b>Maximals</b> are opposed by the Predacons. The <b>Maximals</b> are descendants of the Autobots. The <b>Maximals</b> and Predacons are much smaller than their Autobot and Decepticon ancestors, standing at roughly human size, rather than twenty or more feet tall (7 m). The storyline reason for the change in size was that their smaller forms were more energy-efficient. In the series, the <b>maximals</b> use the activation code [...] "maximize" [...] to transform, and have forms of seemingly peaceful creatures.|$|R
50|$|In Beast Wars Neo, the Predacons {{were led}} by Magmatron after Galvatron's death. Again {{it is unclear whether}} Magmatron had gone rogue at this time, {{although}} if the events of The Gathering are set in continuity with Beast Wars Neo it is likely. Magmatron had a rivalry with Big Convoy and engaged in open warfare with his <b>Maximals.</b> However, after Unicron was reborn Magmatron joined with the <b>Maximals.</b> After the Chaos-Bringer's defeat the Predacons and <b>Maximals</b> joined together to rebuild Cybertron.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the season}} one finale, he joined Megatron and Terrorsaur at the alien structure, where the <b>Maximals</b> Rattrap and Optimus Primal {{were trying to}} get inside of it to rescue Airazor. But due to the truce, and their hopes of the <b>Maximals</b> {{possible}} destruction within the structure, the Predacons decided to help them. They used Scorponok's toxic sting so that they could enter the forcefield in an attempt to retrieve Airazor. Scorponok announced to Megatron that he had one mega missile to shoot at the <b>Maximals</b> while they were inside, to which Megatron replied, [...] "Excellent!" [...] With their plan to destroy the <b>Maximals</b> thwarted, Megatron, Terrorsaur, and Scorponok returned to their base which proved to play {{a significant part of the}} demise of Terrorsaur and Scorponok when their base was hit by the Quantum Surge.|$|R
5|$|Directed pseudoforests and endo{{function}}s are in {{some sense}} mathematically equivalent. Any function ƒ from a set X to itself (that is, an endomorphism of X) {{can be interpreted as}} defining a directed pseudoforest which has an edge from x to y whenever ƒ(x) = y. The resulting directed pseudoforest is <b>maximal,</b> and may include self-loops whenever some value x has ƒ(x) = x. Alternatively, omitting the self-loops produces a non-maximal pseudoforest. In the other direction, any <b>maximal</b> directed pseudoforest determines a function ƒ such that ƒ(x) is the target of the edge that goes out from x, and any non-maximal directed pseudoforest can be made <b>maximal</b> by adding self-loops and then converted into a function in the same way. For this reason, <b>maximal</b> directed pseudoforests are sometimes called functional graphs. Viewing a function as a functional graph provides a convenient language for describing properties that are not as easily described from the function-theoretic point of view; this technique is especially applicable to problems involving iterated functions, which correspond to paths in functional graphs.|$|E
5|$|However, other graphs have <b>maximal</b> cliques {{that are}} not maximum.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{research}} in parallel algorithms {{has studied the}} problem of finding a <b>maximal</b> clique. In particular, the problem of finding the lexicographically first <b>maximal</b> clique (the one found by the algorithm above) {{has been shown to}} be complete for the class of polynomial-time functions. This result implies that the problem is unlikely to be solvable within the parallel complexity class NC.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two main}} factions of [...] "Transformers" [...] in Beast Wars are {{descendants}} of the two main factions in the original cartoon: the <b>Maximals</b> are the {{descendants of the}} Autobots and the Predacons are {{the descendants of the}} Decepticons. (In the sequel series Beast Machines, the process during which Autobots and Decepticons became <b>Maximals</b> and Predacons is referred to as [...] "The Great Upgrade.") ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Maximals</b> {{are back}} on Cybertron, but have lost their {{memories}} of the Beast Wars saga. In addition, they are infected by a virus that prevents them from transforming back to their robot forms; it also reverted trans-metals Optimus, Cheetor, Rattrap and Black Arachnia back to their original forms. They are also being hunted by the mindless Vehicon drones. Finding the Oracle underneath the city, the <b>Maximals</b> are turned into techno-organics to survive the virus; now they must master their emotions in order to transform again. The <b>Maximals</b> soon learn that Megatron got free mid-flight during their time travel back to the future, ending up there long before they showed up; he conquered the planet.|$|R
50|$|He appears {{among the}} <b>Maximals</b> {{on the cover}} of the first issue of the sequel story Beast Wars: The Ascending. In the {{beginning}} of Beast Wars The Ascending Razorbeast speaks to Prowl and Wolfang about how he feels there is no rescue mission coming for them from Cybertron as Grimlock hunts in the nearby woods. In Beast Wars: The Ascending #4 Grimlock was among the <b>Maximals</b> and Predacons returned to Cybertron to battle Shokaract.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} <b>maximal</b> {{directed}} pseudoforests on n vertices, allowing self-loops, is nn, because for each vertex there are n possible endpoints for the outgoing edge. André Joyal used this fact {{to provide a}} bijective proof of Cayley's formula, {{that the number of}} undirected trees on n nodes is n'n2, by finding a bijection between <b>maximal</b> directed pseudoforests and undirected trees with two distinguished nodes. If self-loops are not allowed, the number of <b>maximal</b> directed pseudoforests is instead (n1)n.|$|E
5|$|There {{also exist}} {{algorithms}} for finding two satisfying assignments {{that have the}} <b>maximal</b> Hamming distance from each other.|$|E
5|$|A {{planar graph}} with {{four or more}} {{vertices}} is <b>maximal</b> (no more edges can be added while preserving planarity) {{if and only if}} its dual graph is both 3-vertex-connected and 3-regular.|$|E
50|$|When Kid doesn’t {{respond to}} medical {{treatment}} the other <b>Maximals</b> blame Lio Junior for his condition and he becomes mad {{at them as}} they have the ship and the control unit, and is frustrated of not having any respect. Lio Convoy though agrees with his troops and scolds Lio Junior’s actions calling him reckless, impatient and {{is more concerned with}} destroying Predacons, not protecting innocent lives as per the <b>Maximals</b> code. Lio Junior though snaps and runs off vowing to kill the Predacons himself but forgetting to return the control unit first. As the <b>Maximals</b> return to their ship to tend to Kid’s wounds Dirgegun informs Galvatron how the machine works and seeking advantage of Lio Junior’s feud with his father, seeks him out and deceives him. He tells Lio Junior that the Predacons accidentally activated the teleport gate and it will self-destruct in under an hour and destroy the whole planet unless the control unit is returned. A barely functioning Tasmania Kid however arrives and begs Lio Junior not to trust him but Galvatron knocks him out and despite his hatred for Galvatron, Lio Junior accompanies him back to the Galvaburg to shut down the machine, and to prove his worth to the <b>Maximals,</b> but once Galvatron has the control unit he drops the facade and has Lio Junior imprisoned in the ship. Galvatron announces his intention to the Predacons, and Lio Junior, to summon the Predacon Megatron from the Beast Wars on pre-historic Earth, set during Beast Wars, to assist him destroying the <b>Maximals.</b>|$|R
50|$|After Kid awakens {{and returns}} to the <b>Maximal’s</b> ship he informs Lio Convoy of his son’s {{defection}} and Galvatron having possession of the control unit so Lio Convoy orders the <b>Maximals</b> to rescue his son and stop Galvatron from activating the teleport gate. Before doing so Lio Convoy expresses a deep resentment for his son’s actions but Kid begs him not to treat him so harshly as he is just young, and Lio Convoy eases up. Elsewhere Gigastorm activates the teleport gate to summon Megatron but miscalculates and instead summons the colossal Decepticon giant Majin Zarak but due to his immense strength and arsenal of weapons Galvatron is even more pleased. Galvatron assumes command of the seemingly mindless giant and transforms him into aircraft carrier mode and takes Hellscream, Max-B and the Autorollers to face down the <b>Maximals</b> while Dirgegun and Thrustor guard Lio Junior.|$|R
50|$|In {{a canyon}} Lio Convoy leads the other <b>Maximals</b> against the Predacons, using Majin Zarak as their new base.The <b>Maximals</b> {{are able to}} force Hellscream, Max-B and the Autorollers into {{retreating}} but Galvatron and Gigastorm continue to have Zarak attack them and though Lio Convoy is able to defeat Gigastorm, Galvatron eventually unveils Zarak’s robot mode to deliver a massive energy burst to vaporise the area and believing all the present <b>Maximals</b> to be destroyed but receives {{a call from a}} “Convoy” challenging him to another fight in “Point B-2” and Galvatron accepts and takes Majin Zarak to the point. Underground however a barely conscious Lio Convoy is contacted by a familiar voice who informs him that his son nearly killed himself to summon him to the present time and praises Lio Convoy’s abilities as a commander and asks to team up, one commander to another.|$|R
5|$|Due to the matroid {{structure}} of pseudoforests, minimum-weight <b>maximal</b> pseudoforests {{may be found}} by greedy algorithms similar to those for the minimum spanning tree problem. However, Gabow and Tarjan found a more efficient linear-time approach in this case.|$|E
5|$|If n > m, and if {{the rank}} of the Jacobi matrix attains its <b>maximal</b> value m, f is locally {{invertible}} at that point, by the implicit function theorem.|$|E
5|$|In {{pressurized}} water reactors a variable concentration of boronic acid in the cooling water {{is used to}} compensate the variable reactivity of the fuel: when new rods are inserted the concentration of boronic acid is <b>maximal,</b> and then reduced during the lifetime.|$|E
50|$|Dinobot appears {{along the}} rest of the <b>Maximals</b> in the series Beast Wars: The Gathering, which takes place during season 3 of the {{animated}} Beast Wars series.|$|R
50|$|Beast Machines: This series {{introduces}} a large timeskip between {{the events of}} the end of Beast Wars and the assault the <b>Maximals</b> are seen fighting against in the very first episode of the series. Ironically, the events in the timeskip are actually very important to the series, and the full scope of events that occur between the end of Beast Wars and the desperate battle that the <b>Maximals</b> find themselves waging to reclaim Cybertron are not fully revealed until roughly mid-way through the first season of the show.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of Generation 1, Ravage later made an appearance in the sequel series Beast Wars, having been reprogrammed and rebuilt into a Predacon. Here he became a covert agent loyal to the Tripredacus Council who was dispatched to prehistoric Earth to eliminate Megatron and insure that word of his survival never reached the <b>Maximals.</b> He was aided in this endeavor by Tarantulas, who was revealed {{to be a member}} of the Predacon secret police. Employing an advanced prototype ship that shared his capacity for Active camouflage, he briefly aided Optimus Primal's crew of <b>Maximals</b> in capturing Megatron. However, after learning that the original Megatron had left a message on the Voyager Golden Record that Predacon Megatron had discovered and decoded, Ravage freed Megatron and threw in his lot with his fellow Predacons. However, he soon met his demise at the hands of the <b>Maximals,</b> with his discarded head being the last trace of him seen on screen.|$|R
5|$|Most {{versions}} of the clique problem are hard. The clique decision problem is NP-complete (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems). The problem of finding the maximum clique is both fixed-parameter intractable and hard to approximate. And, listing all <b>maximal</b> cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with exponentially many <b>maximal</b> cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the clique problem is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general problem in various models of computation.|$|E
25|$|A <b>maximal</b> {{matching}} can {{be found}} with a simple greedy algorithm. A maximum matching is also a <b>maximal</b> matching, and hence {{it is possible to}} find a largest <b>maximal</b> matching in polynomial time. However, no polynomial-time algorithm is known for finding a minimum <b>maximal</b> matching, that is, a <b>maximal</b> matching that contains the smallest possible number of edges.|$|E
25|$|K-trees are chordal graphs {{in which}} all <b>maximal</b> cliques and all <b>maximal</b> clique {{separators}} have the same size. Apollonian networks are chordal <b>maximal</b> planar graphs, or equivalently planar 3-trees. <b>Maximal</b> outerplanar graphs are a subclass of 2-trees, and therefore are also chordal.|$|E
50|$|In Gaea’s {{atmosphere}} the Jointrons and the Seacons battle {{each other}} but both factions are interrupted {{by the arrival of}} a large space ship which rams into them and sends them all flying into space before crash landing on the planet, and the <b>Maximals</b> and Predacons are immediately alerted. On the Galvaburg II, Gigastorm recommends destroying the ship but Galvatron is interested and believes it may hold good fortune for the Predacons. On the Yukikaze Lio Convoy orders a unit sent to investigate the ship but Lio Junior, Lio Convoy’s son, wishes to go but the other <b>Maximals</b> shoot him down, but Tasmania Kid stands up for him and asks if both can go and Lio Convoy approves and has Stanton and Skywarp accompany also. The 4 <b>Maximals</b> arrive at the ship and discover a “teleport gate”, an ancient device capable of opening a doorway into the past and transporting any living creature into the present, Transformers included but it requires a control unit to function. When Lio Junior finds it the Predacon Combaticons Hellscream, Dirgegun, Thrustor and Max-B swoop in and steals it but Lio Junior dives off after it alone and the Predacons overpower and nearly kill him, but before Hellscream can fire a finishing blow Kid takes the hit as the other <b>Maximals</b> arrive and scare off the Predacons and secure the control unit.|$|R
50|$|A being {{known as}} Majin Zarak was {{subsequently}} {{summoned to the}} planet Gaea by accident by the Predacon forces under Galvatron, who had intended to recover the Beast Wars version of Megatron to join him. Galvatron is immensely pleased by this development and begins using Majin Zarak as a new base, easily overpowering Lio Convoy's <b>Maximals.</b> However, Majin Zarak is eventually revealed to be entirely sentient, and attacks the <b>Maximals</b> only to be thwarted by the combined efforts of Lio and Optimus Primal, both of whom assume super-powered forms and combine their powers to destroy him.|$|R
5000|$|Waspinator {{appears in}} the TFcon 2012 live script reading prelude comic. In this story Blackarachnia, Quickstrike and Waspinator {{discover}} three Constructicons on prehistoric Earth and are confronted by the <b>Maximals</b> and Wreckers [...]|$|R
25|$|Unlike rings with unity however, {{a module}} does not {{necessarily}} have <b>maximal</b> submodules. However, as noted above, finitely generated nonzero modules have <b>maximal</b> submodules, and also projective modules have <b>maximal</b> submodules.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, <b>maximal</b> ideals can be {{generalized}} by defining a <b>maximal</b> sub-bimodule M of a bimodule B to be a proper sub-bimodule of M which is contained by no other proper sub-bimodule of M. So, the <b>maximal</b> ideals of R {{are exactly the}} <b>maximal</b> sub-bimodules of the bimodule R'R'R.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for a ring to have a unique <b>maximal</b> ideal and yet lack unique <b>maximal</b> one sided ideals: for example, in the ring of 2 by 2 square matrices over a field, the zero ideal is a <b>maximal</b> ideal, {{but there are many}} <b>maximal</b> right ideals.|$|E
50|$|Transformers: Beast Wars Transmetals borrows plot {{elements}} {{from the second}} season of the series, following {{the introduction to the}} Transmetals and Fuzors. The game continues the war between the <b>Maximals</b> and the Predacons on Earth.|$|R
5000|$|Transformers: Beast Wars The Predacons {{capture the}} Decepticon {{flagship}} Nemesis and use its tractor beam {{to attempt to}} destroy the <b>Maximals</b> and the Ark. It appeared to be powered by spinning grinders, gears blades, etc.|$|R
50|$|A set of <b>Maximals,</b> all recolors {{of older}} toys from the Beast Wars, Beast Wars Neo lines. Commanded by Magmatron and T-Wrecks, members {{included}} Airraptor and others. Like the Deployers, they {{appeared in the}} 3H Beast Machines comics.|$|R
