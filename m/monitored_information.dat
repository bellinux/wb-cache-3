40|$|Using {{condition}} monitoring to track machine health and trigger maintenance actions is a proven best practice. By monitoring machinery health, costly failures are avoided and downtime due to outages is reduced, which finally {{results in an}} increase of operational efficiency and productivity of the equipment. Many papers discuss the implementation of {{condition monitoring}} to prevent failures and optimize maintenance actions. However, much less {{attention is paid to}} the use of condition <b>monitoring</b> <b>information</b> in order to optimize production capacity of a machine or a plant. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} establish the link between condition <b>monitoring</b> <b>information</b> and production capacity optimization by continuously adjusting production parameters (e. g. production speed) according to the measured condition <b>monitoring</b> <b>information.</b> In this paper condition monitoring of steel production machines using cost-effective temperature sensors is applied to monitor possible overheating of the machine and used to optimize the machine’s speed. Without optimization, the machine is simply stopped when overheating is detected. This results on lost production capacity. Therefore, the condition <b>monitoring</b> <b>information</b> is used as an input to the machine’s controller in order to optimize the production speed. The speed of the production machine is namely directly related to the corresponding temperature increase or decrease. Optimization of the production speed results in maximal production capacity and minimal machine downtime by prevention of overheating. The paper clearly illustrates how temperature condition <b>monitoring</b> <b>information</b> can be used to maximize industrial production capacity. This approach extends the use of condition <b>monitoring</b> <b>information</b> from purely avoiding unexpected failures to productivity optimization of an entire system. status: accepte...|$|R

Based on the dynamic <b>monitored</b> <b>information</b> from various sensors on a bridge, the status of its structural health can be monitored. One of the major issues in this monitoring process is to handle a huge amount of data-both real time and accumulated historical data. The traditional data processes and management methods cannot fully meet the requirements on data process and management for bridge structural health monitoring. Besides the attribute information, the <b>monitored</b> <b>information</b> of a bridge structural health status is highly related to geospatial location. That is, the <b>monitored</b> <b>information</b> can be referenced to a spatial location, for examples, geospatial locations of bridges, geospatial layouts of various sensors on bridges, three-dimensional models of bridges, and fault points of sensors on maps. GIS technology is therefore applied to manage the information in bridge structural health monitoring. The general framework of BSHM&IMS, which is based on an integration of several information technologies, including GIS, database management system, network and others, will be introduced firstly in this paper. For the implementation of the general design, a prototype of BSHM&IMS has been developed and the major solutions will then be described in details. These functions include design of geospatial database structure for bridges, information processing from various sensors, management of a huge amount of monitored data, visualization of bridge information, illustration of warning information of fault points of sensors on three-dimensional models of bridges, and backup and output of important data according to users" querying conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the BSHM&IMS is capable to manage huge amounts of monitored data of bridge structural health, including real time and accumulated historical data, effectively.

The commercial scenario {{searches for}} water wells and springs within an area {{to estimate the}} cost to complete a new nearby water supply well, and involves water wells, related measurements, and hydrogeological units such as aquifers. The policy scenario is aligned with European INSPIRE needs [16] to enable reporting {{on the state of}} groundwater in administrative districts, and involves management areas, related hydrogeological units and <b>monitored</b> <b>information.</b> The environmental scenario enables environmental managers, water managers, and legislators to assess threats to groundwater dependent ecosystems, and involves depth to water table, <b>monitored</b> <b>information</b> on groundwater chemistry and biology, and flow between groundwater and surface water. The scientific scenario focusses on the delivery of data for use in groundwater flow modelling and soil-water balance modelling, and involves the hydrogeological and geophysical properties of aquifers and related measurements, as well as the characteristics of water wells, water bodies, and water use. The technologic scenario determines compatibility with other hydrogeological data representations, such as database schemas and exchange formats, via conversion to and from GWML 2. This is particularly important to enable data interoperability of all entities from the previous scenarios (i) within a groundwater data network, by converting between local databases and GWML 2, and (ii) between different data networks, by converting between GWML 2 and local data formats, such as the European-wide INSPIRE hydrogeology standard [15, 16] or the North American GWML 1 [2].
