25|$|A {{collection}} of <b>mature</b> <b>technologies</b> called seasonal {{thermal energy storage}} (STES) is capable of storing heat {{for months at a}} time, so solar heat collected primarily in Summer can be used for all-year heating. Solar-supplied STES technology has been advanced primarily in Denmark, Germany, and Canada, and applications include individual buildings and district heating networks. Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta, Canada has a small district system and in 2012 achieved a world record of providing 97% of the community's all-year space heating needs from the sun. STES thermal storage mediums include deep aquifers; native rock surrounding clusters of small-diameter, heat exchanger equipped boreholes; large, shallow, lined pits that are filled with gravel and top-insulated; and large, insulated and buried surface water tanks.|$|E

50|$|This {{interconnect}} bottleneck can {{be solved}} by utilizing optical interconnects to replace the long metallic interconnects. Such hybrid optical/electronic interconnects promises better performance even with larger designs. Optics has widespread use in long-distance communications; still {{it has not yet}} been widely used in chip-to-chip or on-chip interconnections because they (in centimeter or micrometer range) are not yet industry-manufacturable owing to costlier technology and lack of fully <b>mature</b> <b>technologies.</b> As optical interconnections move from computer network applications to chip level interconnections, new requirements for high connection density and alignment reliability have become as critical for the effective utilization of these links.

Those entities had a substantial investment in not only tube cameras, {{but also in the}} ancillary equipment needed to correctly process tube-derived video. A switchover to solid-state image sensors would render much of that equipment (and the investments behind it) obsolete and would require new equipment optimized to work well with solid-state sensors, just as the old equipment was optimized for tube-sourced video. It's difficult to justify junking a perfectly good camera along with corresponding rack of outboard gear, especially if one is the accountant.|$|E

5000|$|Second, Compositional Competition - {{the firm}} {{combines}} and integrates different means of competition (e.g., quick responsiveness, low cost, new functions and features, customer-focused design, and extended warranty) to win competition. Compositional competition combines low cost, speed and quality means, providing customers with quick market responses and high price-value ratio. Compositional competitors deliver suitable technology {{at a low}} cost by leveraging <b>mature</b> <b>technologies</b> or R&D resources and by using open architecture or platforms that can significantly reduce production costs. These firms are astute in business intelligence involving both markets and technologies. [...] Third, Compositional Capability - the firm’s ability to bundle different resources and competitive attributes to create a certain competitive advantage. It shifts a focus from developing new resources to bundling existing resources, including those accessible from domestic or global open markets, as well as bundling competitive attributes such as quality, features, price, speed, innovation, design, and services. Entrepreneurial vision, market intelligence, absorptive capacity, and combinative capability are essential to accomplishing compositional capability.|$|E

50|$|Israel Aerospace Industries {{announced}} in June 2009, that the Arrow 3 patented exoatmospheric interception method includes a two-stage interceptor, like the Arrow 2, but purely based on hit-to-kill technology. Unlike most kill vehicles, which use liquid or gas propulsion, the new Israeli kill vehicle will be propelled by an ordinary rocket motor {{equipped with a}} thrust-vectoring nozzle. It will also be fitted with a gimbaled seeker for hemispheric coverage. By measuring the seeker's line-of-sight propagation relative to the vehicle's motion, the kill vehicle will use proportional navigation to divert its course and line up exactly with the target's flight path. Joseph Hasson, chief missile designer at IAI, who patented the new kill vehicle with his colleague Galya Goldner, says that the concept is relatively simple, reliable and inexpensive, {{and is based on}} <b>mature</b> <b>technologies.</b> Furthermore, the kill vehicle's divert capability and agility reduce the need for detection and tracking systems, which usually accompany remote sensor-assisted exoatmospheric kills. IAI displayed a full-sized model of the Arrow 3 missile and its kill vehicle at the June 2009 Paris Air Show.|$|E

50|$|Failure, or fear of failure, {{is another}} reason for organisations not {{becoming}} more entrepreneurial. Wladawsky-Berger (2010) found that firms act to protect resources by avoiding risk and penalizing failure. This resonates with the framework proposed by Ahuja and Lampert (2001) that explains why companies fail to develop breakthrough inventions. According to the framework, {{there is a tendency}} in large firms to favour familiar and <b>mature</b> <b>technologies,</b> and also search for new ideas that are similar to existing solutions. The authors propose investing in developing novel and emerging technologies, because this will increase the likelihood of breakthrough inventions. However their model lacks how to build upon the ideas. On the contrary, Ireland et al. (2009) present a model that conceptualises the CE strategy. Their model considers three main elements: entrepreneurial vision, organisational structure and behaviour, all of which influence and complement each other. The authors claim that these factors have to be adapted at three levels: at the organisational level, at the level of top-managers and at the level of other employees. It means that an effective CE strategy cannot be dictated by top-managers, only instigated by them. In doing so, they have to create CE strategy from interactions between entrepreneurial vision, pro-entrepreneurial architecture and entrepreneurial behaviour.|$|E
