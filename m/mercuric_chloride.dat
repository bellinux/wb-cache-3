40|$|Abstract Background Increasing {{evidence}} exists that heavy metals modulate T helper cell (Th) responses and thereby elicit various pathological manifestation. Interleukin (IL) - 12, a crucial innate cytokine, {{was found to}} be regulated by such xenobiotic agents. This study aimed at testing whether IL- 12 profiles may be indicative of heavy metals-induced immunomodulation. Methods Human immunocompetent cells, activated either by monoclonal antibodies or heat-killed Salmonella enterica, were cultured in the absence or presence of cadmium (Cd) acetate or <b>mercuric</b> (Hg) <b>chloride.</b> In vivo experiments were set up where BALB/c mice were exposed to sub-lethal doses of Cd or Hg salts for 3 or 5 weeks. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT-reduction assay. Modulation of cytokine profiles was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cytometric bead-based array (CBA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the relevance of these methods of cytokine quantification was explored. Results Modulation of IL- 12 profiles in Cd- or Hg-exposed human PBMC was dose-dependent and significantly related to IFN-γ levels {{as well as to the}} Th 1 - or Th 2 -polarized responses. Similarly, skewing the Th 1 /Th 2 ratios in vivo correlated significantly with up- or down-regulation of IL- 12 levels in both cases of investigated metals. Conclusion It can be inferred that: (i) IL- 12 profiles alone may represent a relevant indicator of heavy metal-induced immune modulation; (ii) evaluating cytokine profiles by CBA is relevant and can adequately replace other methods such as ELISA and RT-PCR in basic research as well as in immune diagnostics; and (iii) targeting IL- 12 in therapeutic approaches may be promising to modify Th 1 /Th 2 -associated immune disorders. </p...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{satisfactory}} technique known for simultaneous remediation of materials contaminated with mercury and other metals. In the case of mercury-polluted tailings from Brazilian gold-mining areas, there {{is the opportunity to}} extract mercury and traces of gold hydrometallurgically, thus making the remediation process cost-effective. Hydrometallurgical techniques are widely used in ore treatment, whereas solid remediation applications are rare. This chapter outlines two variants of an electroleaching process and gives an overview of its thermodynamic fundamentals. Model calculations are presented as well as results from laboratory experiments. The leaching agent, hypochlorous acid, can be produced by electrolytic oxidation of a sodium chloride solution. After leaching, the leachate is treated electrolytically to deposit the metals in the elemental form and to regenerate the leaching agent for recirculation. The leaching mechanism is a mercury oxidation and a complexation of <b>mercuric</b> ions by <b>chloride</b> ions, forming, for example, a tetra-chloro-mercurate-complex. The main process parameters, such as pH, Eh and element concentrations, control the speciation of mercury. It is illustrated how leaching efficiency and electrolytical mercury deposition are both dominated by the mercury species in solution. The electroleaching could be conducted in two different reaction systems: (1) as a 1 -reaction process with an in-suspension production of the leaching agent (EL-IS) and (2) as a 2 -reactor process with an in-line production (EL-IL). While the more costly EL-IL is capable of recovering mercury sufficiently (> 99 % removal rate) even from highly contaminated German industrial samples, the EL-IS is the best solution for less contaminated Brazilian gold-mining residues. After treatment, the mercury concentration is lower than 1 mg/kg and more than 82 % of the residual gold can be recovered. (orig.)

40|$|In {{response}} to the worldwide mercury contamination contributed by both natural and anthropogenic sources, two different domains of aqueous mercury (II), Hg(II) complexation {{have been carried out}} using homogeneous complexing agent, Rhodamine B and heterogeneous complexing agent, Covellite (CuS). The studies of Rhodamine B was conducted using UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV-Vis) where it revealed the instability of Rhodamine B-Hg(II) -Iodide complex in acidic media and it has been resolved either by extraction with benzene or stabilization in water using polyvinyalcohol (PVAl). The studies on Rhodamine B-Hg(II) -Iodide complex were further developed as a non-destructive spectrophotometric method for trace Hg(II) detection. The investigations of CuS in heterogeneous aqueous Hg(II) complexation were conducted using two analytical approach: (i) solution phase analysis i. e. atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS); (ii) solid characterization analysis i. e. powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From solution phase analysis, the trends of Hg(II) uptake observed were found to dependent on the sorption rate of Hg(II) onto CuS at acidic and alkaline pH. The relatively fast sorption rate of Hg(II) onto CuS at acidic pH can be viewed as the formation of both cubic phase mercury sulfide (Metacinnabar, β-HgS) and monoclinic phase <b>mercuric</b> sulfide <b>chloride</b> (m-Hg 3 S 2 Cl 2) from PXRD analysis. The relatively slow sorption rate of Hg(II) onto CuS at alkaline pH can be viewed by the sole formation of β-HgS from PXRD analysis. The formation of m-Hg 3 S 2 Cl 2 was associated with the growth of nanosize ranged needle like architecture namely nano-needle crystallite on the edges of the initial CuS hexagonal plates from FESEM-EDX analysis. The formation of β-HgS was also observed {{at the edges of the}} CuS hexagonal plates but its formation was only preferred along the { 101 } and { 100 } plane of CuS hexagonal plates from HRTEM-EDX analysis. Furthermore, the uptake of Hg(II) onto CuS at different Hg(II) concentration has been modeled using sorption isotherm models. The equilibrium data suggested that the sorption behavior of Hg(II) onto CuS obeys well to the Langmuir isotherm with the maximum sorption capacity of CuS for Hg(II), Qmax reaching 434. 78 mg Hg(II) / g of sorbent at 25 °C. Apart from the Hg(II) uptake studies, a consecutive decrease of CuS dissolution and decrease on final solution pH were also detected when initial solution pH is raised. These results showed that an in-situ re-adsorption of Cu(II) and OH- onto CuS has taken place at increasing pH in addition to the ion-exchange of Hg(II) onto CuS. The re-adsorption of Cu(II) and OH- can be viewed as the formation of Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6 and its hydrate Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6 (H 2 O) from PXRD analysis. Whilst, the re-adsorption of Cu(II) and OH- can be also discussed in term of the formation of Cu(OH) 2 and CuO from XPS studies. Moreover, the precipitation of Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6 and Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6 (H 2 O) has actually led to the growth of additional platelet crystallite in which it has been identified from FESEM-EDX analysis...|$|R
