5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense meant that Split {{could only have}} a single funnel to allow the guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which dictated that the boiler rooms were adjacent to the engine room. This meant that a single torpedo hit in the <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces</b> could immobilize the ship.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Schoemann was {{undamaged}} by British aircraft, but {{was repeatedly}} {{struck in the}} stern by 20mm cannon shells from the defending German fighters. Later that afternoon, Vice Admiral (Vizeadmiral) Otto Ciliax, commander of the battleship flotilla, {{was transferred to the}} ship after his temporary flagship, the destroyer , was disabled by a premature detonation in one of her guns that sent shrapnel into the <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|E

The <b>machinery</b> <b>space</b> (dark blue in the picture) was located at {{the middle of the}} ship. The single propeller was driven through a long propeller shaft that ran through a tunnel (lower green area in the picture) under the aft cargo holds. The propeller rotated at 76 rpm, giving a speed of about [...] There were two decks running the full length of the ship, with seven watertight bulkheads dividing the <b>machinery</b> <b>space</b> and five cargo holds (light blue in the picture), three ahead of the <b>machinery</b> <b>space</b> and two aft. [...] Crew accommodations were provided in a large three-deck structure located {{in the middle of the}} ship (medium blue in the picture) directly above the <b>machinery</b> <b>space,</b> and in a small structure (medium blue in the picture) located at the stern. The bridge, radio room and Captain's quarters were located on the top deck (yellow in the picture) of the three-deck structure. The fuel for the boiler was carried in several tanks (red in the picture) located throughout the ship. Ship's storage (light green in the picture) was located at the bow and above the <b>machinery</b> <b>space.</b> Gun crew quarters and the ship's hospital were located in the stern structure.

5|$|Trieste {{returned}} to action in August 1942 for {{an operation that}} was cancelled following the torpedoing of another Italian cruiser by a British submarine. Trieste was moved to La Maddalena, Sardinia, where she was later sunk by United States heavy bombers on 10 April 1943. Salvage work on Trieste began in 1950. Her superstructure was cut away and she was refloated and towed to La Spezia; an inspection revealed that fuel oil had leaked into the <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces,</b> protecting them while the ship had been submerged. The Spanish Navy purchased the hull in 1952 and had her towed to Ferrol, with plans to convert the vessel into a light aircraft carrier. The project ultimately came to nothing due to the growing costs of the project, forcing its cancellation in 1956. She was ultimately broken up by 1959.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{construct}} new capital ships until 1931, Japan resorted to upgrading battleships and battlecruisers. In July 1926, Haruna {{became the first}} of Japan's vessels to undergo extensive modernization and modification, in drydock at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Over the next two years, her horizontal armor near her ammunition magazines was strengthened, and the <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces</b> within the hull were increased. Anti-torpedo bulges were added along the waterline, as permitted by the Washington Treaty. She was refitted to accommodate three Type90 Model0 floatplanes. To increase her speed and power capacities, all 36 Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with 16 newer boilers, and Brown-Curtis direct-drive turbines were installed. Harunas forward funnel was removed, and her second funnel was enlarged and lengthened. The modifications to her hull increased her armor weight from 6,502 to 10,313long tons, directly violating {{the terms of the}} Washington Treaty. In July 1928, Haruna—now capable of speeds of —was reclassified as a battleship.|$|E

5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more room than geared turbines to allow for better underwater protection that wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their optimum speed, without regard to propeller speed, which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that the motors could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Also, the ship could go astern at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy to reverse this decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces</b> and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E
25|$|The SPS void-liquid-void layer was {{generally}} about 13 feet wide, and the auxiliary <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces</b> added approximately another 8 {{feet of space}} from the outer hull plating to the major <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces.</b> The only exception to this was abreast A and B Engine Rooms, where the auxiliary <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces</b> were omitted, but another void space, about three feet wide was substituted in its place.|$|E

25|$|The {{design was}} {{conservative}} in nature, especially {{when compared to}} the contemporary Nelson-class battleships built to satisfy the same treaty. The long (630 feet overall) hull was flush decked and with a high freeboard, and was strongly built. This afforded high initial stability, which contributed to the protection scheme. The <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces</b> followed the traditional layout of boiler rooms ahead of engine rooms, separated by an amidships magazine. The two boiler rooms exhausted into four uptakes, the central pair being combined to form a thickened central funnel. The three-funnel design was handsome, but somewhat impractical in terms of utilisation of internal space.|$|E
25|$|A unforecast typhoon struck on 9 October {{and after}} various early {{manoeuvres}} the ship lay a-hull {{in the hope}} of drifting down the centre of the Taiwan Strait until the storm - which the captain thought would cross the strait and land near Xiamen - had passed. Unluckily the storm was recurving and passing up the west coast of Taiwan. The expected drift in a generally south west direction was actually between south and south south west straight towards the Penghu Islands. The winds worsened on the 10th and as the ship rolled violently the ships boats were smashed and the deckhouse damaged. At ten o'clock {{on the night of the}} 10 October three huge waves boarded the ship, smashed the engine and boiler room skylights and, folding below, doused the boilers, filling the <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces</b> with steam.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} one of three Modified Leander-class light cruisers {{constructed}} for the Royal Navy. The main difference to the previous five Leanders was that the newer ships had their machinery and propulsion equipment organised in two self-contained units (separated fore and aft), allowing the ship to continue operating if one set was damaged. The two exhaust funnels, one for each machinery space, gave the modified ships a different profile from the early Leanders, which had a single funnel. To cover the separate <b>machinery</b> <b>spaces,</b> the side armour was extended from , negating the weight reduction created by the separation. During design, it was planned to modify the forward-most and aft-most 6-inch turrets to be fitted with three guns instead of two, but the plan was cancelled when it was determined that the required alterations would cause several negative side effects, including reducing the ship's top speed and causing problems with effective fire control.|$|E

5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{constructed}} with fire-resistant materials and also had enhanced fire-detecting and fire-extinguishing equipment installed for the time. A [...] "smoke-pipe" [...] fire-detecting system {{was installed in}} all cargo spaces, the paint locker, carpenter shop, dry storeroom and bosun's storerooms. A CO2 fire suppression system protected the cargo spaces, service <b>spaces</b> and <b>machinery</b> <b>space</b> in addition to standard fire fighting equipment.|$|R
