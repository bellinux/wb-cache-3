40|$|This paper {{compares the}} cost and {{effectiveness}} of several potential options {{that may be used}} to monitor silo-based ballistic missiles. Silo <b>door</b> <b>monitoring</b> can be used to verify that warheads removed to deactivate or download silo-based ballistic missiles have not been replaced. A precedent for monitoring warhead replacement using reentry vehicle on site inspections (RV-OSIs) and using satellites has been established by START-I and START-II. However, other monitoring options have the potential to be less expensive and more effective. Three options are the most promising if high verification confidence is desired: random <b>monitoring</b> using <b>door</b> sensors; random <b>monitoring</b> using manned or unmanned aircraft; and continuous remote <b>monitoring</b> using unattended <b>door</b> sensors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a joint industry/university collaboration {{to develop a}} prototype system to provide real time monitoring of an airport ground transportation vehicle with the objectives of improving availability and minimizing field failures by estimating the proper timing for condition-based maintenance. Hardware for the vehicle was designed, developed and tested to <b>monitor</b> <b>door</b> characteristics (voltage and current through the motor that opens and closes the doors and door movement time and position), to quickly predict degraded performance, and to anticipate failures. A combined statistical and neural network approach was implemented. The neural network “learns ” the differences among door sets and can be tuned quite easily through this learning. Signals are processed in real time and combined with previous monitoring data to estimate, using the neural network, {{the condition of the}} door set relative to maintenance needs. The prototype system was installed on several vehicle door sets at the Pittsburgh International Airport and successfully tested for several months under simulated and actual operating conditions. Preliminary results indicate that improved operational reliability and availability can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} the modalities and the safety aspects for operation of a tabletop monochro-matic (2. 45 MeV) neutron generator from the company NSD-Fusion in our laboratory 15 R- 018. The generator is designed to run at an intensity of up to 107 n/s and serves as the replacement for an existing AmBe source (370 MBq, 2 · 104 n/s). The system does not contain significant amounts of radioactive material and the reaction rate is fully controlled by the applied DC high voltage (max. 120 kV, 15 mA). It is guaranteed to run stable down to 104 n/s. We envisage operation at 106 n/s with an average duty time of 100 hours per month. Unshielded operation at 107 n/s would create an equivalent radiation dose of 120 µSv/h in 1 m distance. A massive but still movable cylindrical radiation shield (diam. 1 m) and a lockable enclosure (3. 5 x 3. 5 m 2) brings the radiation level down to well below 0. 6 µSv/h at places of human access during operation. Operational interlocks are provided by a neutron dose <b>monitor,</b> <b>door</b> switches and the global slow control (temperatures, voltages, currents). ...|$|R

The electronic access control system grants access based on the credential presented. When access is granted, the door is unlocked for a predetermined time and the transaction is recorded. When access is refused, the door remains locked and the attempted access is recorded. The system will also <b>monitor</b> the <b>door</b> and alarm if the door is forced open or held open too long after being unlocked.|$|R
50|$|Generally, OEM alarms <b>monitor</b> the <b>doors</b> and trunk/hatch for {{unauthorized}} entry. On some vehicles this is {{done through}} pin switches, mercury switches, or microswitches integrated into the latch. On others, the doorlock mechanisms have switches built into them. Some OEM alarms additionally will trigger if the hood is opened, or if the ignition is turned on. A few systems have a shock sensor which will trigger upon a significant impact to the vehicle's body, such as window glass being broken. Motion sensors monitoring the vehicle's interior are installed in some higher end models.|$|R

40|$|Public {{means of}} {{transport}} have been the object of numerous terrorist attacks, {{mainly because of the}} high concentration of passengers, the criticality of mobility in modern society and the difficulties in applying effective screening or other protection measures. Video surveillance {{is one of the major}} instruments to increase security. However, in the case of managing emergencies following major accidents or security events, classical CCTV based surveillance is of little use, apart from forensic investigations. The main issues are related to: • The time and resources needed to process the huge amounts of information accumulated during the 24 / 7 CCTV operations. • The cost of maintaining such centralised infrastructures. • The threat (or perception of threat) to personal data and privacy from the continuous acquisition, transmission and storage of video streams. ASPIS is a novel smart surveillance system that was conceived soon after the London bombing events in order to answer the above issues. It is a scalable, modular, surveillance / alarm system designed to provide prompt, complete, pertinent information for the management of emergency situations in public {{means of transport}} without compromising citizen’s right to privacy. In fact, it records and transmits information only on the occurrence of an emergency event. Three operational scenarios have been developed and tested: 1. Underground metro / suburban rail: on-board surveillance, on-board explosion / gunshots 2. Ferry or cruise vessel: monitoring cabin occupancy under vessel evacuation conditions 3. Ferry or cruise vessel: <b>monitoring</b> <b>doors</b> / accesses to sensitive rooms / spaces The ASPIS project, financed from the EC under the FP 7 -SST scheme, started on June 2008 and concluded on March 2012.

A contingent of up to 75 City of Buffalo police and exposition security guards <b>monitored</b> the <b>doors</b> to the Hall of Music and patrolled the queue waiting to see the president. Persons who made it far enough to approach McKinley finally had to pass through a cordon of U.S. Army soldiers who had been instructed to quickly surround anyone who appeared suspicious.

5000|$|The {{second most}} common risk is from levering a door open. This is {{relatively}} difficult on properly secured doors with strikes or high holding force magnetic locks. Fully implemented access control systems include forced <b>door</b> <b>monitoring</b> alarms.

Most newer access control systems incorporate some type of door prop alarm to inform system administrators of a door left open longer than a specified length of time.|$|R
