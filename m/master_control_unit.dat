This style, unlike the traditional linear jail style, places correction officers directly within the inmate living units and provides the officers with immediate visual observation and continual interaction with the inmates. It also places the officer in a more vulnerable position, as the inmates are allowed nearly unrestricted access to the officer. All officers are issued pepper spray to carry on their person while in the housing unit. They are also issued a Personal Duress Alarm, which immediately sounds an alarm in the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> A call is then made via radio to all available units to assist the officer in distress.

This was accomplished by on-board vibration data processing comprising a sensor system (transducer/ low noise cable/charge amplifier) and a multichannel digital Vibration Data Processor (VDP). The processor is a 1 / 3 octave frequency band analyzer, employing digital filter circuitry covering 22 bands over a frequency range from 14 Hz to 2245 Hz, providing an output that represents the energy(G²) per band/time interval. A <b>Master</b> Data <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> (MU) <b>controls</b> the VDP operation via a full duplex data bus.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{details the}} design and {{development}} of a low-cost control rig to intuitively manipulate an anthropomor-phic robotic arm using a bilateral master-slave control methodology. Special emphasis {{has been given to}} the ease of operation and some form of force sensation. The control rig is fitted to the user’s arm and the forces exerted by the robotic arm’s various joints are fed back to the user. Of special significance is the force feedback from the slave when its gripper is in contact with a real object. Several methods of force sensing have been explored and detailed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by experiments on a commercially available robotic arm which is controlled by a prototype 3 -axis master unit.
