40|$|Geodesign entails complex {{processes}} involving multidisciplinary {{teams of}} professionals supporting stakeholders and communities in devising and choosing sustainable future development scenarios for their territories. The roles and {{the relationships among}} the actors may {{vary according to the}} underlying planning paradigm or style which the local normative and socio-cultural factors shape in the actual practices. Methods and tools {{to be used in the}} process phases may vary accordingly. A Geodesign study is characterised by the integrated usage of Geographic Information Science methods and tools to transform spatial data into relevant knowledge for informed design and decision-making. Thus, central to Geodesign are such issues as how to design and manage such complex processes, and how to orchestrate digital methods and tools in Geodesign support systems architectures. To address these challenges, the concept of <b>metaplanning</b> is proposed as an aid to the design of Geodesign processes. Expected benefits of the <b>metaplanning</b> exercise include better process understanding by the participants, improvements in management, and enhanced process transparency and accountability. Moreover, <b>metaplanning</b> may drive the integration of digital information technologies to support the Geodesign workflows. After the formalization of the concept, a Business Process Management (BPM) approach to <b>metaplanning</b> is proposed for its operationalization, aiming at both improving the Geodesign process and easing the creation of process-oriented 2 nd generation Planning Support Systems. After a critical discussion on the possible advantages of the <b>metaplanning</b> approach to the design of process-oriented Geodesign workflows and support systems, issues setting the future research agenda in this domain are outlined...|$|E

40|$|As {{competitive}} environments {{become more}} complex, demands for flexible strategic management increase and responses become {{more dependent on}} information technology. Computer Supported Meeting Environments (CSMEs) {{have been successful in}} reducing the time needed for meetings and supporting strategic management processes. Because of its toolkit structure, a CSME is an information technology that allows for process flexibility. <b>Metaplanning</b> expert systems can support the decision to use a specific string of tools for each different client in each different meeting, particularly in strategic management. To develop an appropriate <b>metaplanning</b> expert system and to improve effectiveness and efficiency of using CSME for strategic planning, it is critical to assess both the user competence assumptions and the effectiveness of such system. The purpose of this dissertation is to assess the impact the user's interpretive competence (context sensitivity) and inductive competence (analog awareness) have on the selection of GroupSystems tools and to validate an expert system prototype developed to support the selection of GroupSystems tools in relation to types of user and use. Given the novelty and the interdisciplinary nature of this effort, the initial study is developed to test for differences in relation to interpretive and inductive effects, evaluate individual characteristics, and increase our understanding of the variables at play. The subjects were students in a capstone MBA business policy class. No significant differences were found in relation to context sensitivity. Analog awareness was found to {{have a significant impact on}} the decision of choosing a divergent tool and a people oriented convergent tool. The second study defines, develops, and validates a <b>metaplanning</b> expert system prototype. The prototype can be adapted to other process/stages focused domains that could use a string of GroupSystems tools. The main module of the prototype captures a group profile based on divergence/convergence factors associated with the group and the documentation produced by the CSME.

40|$|Abstract — When {{problems}} {{are present in}} production, equipment or the process which are critical for organizations, many management personnel and experts have to meet to propose a solution. Often, the solutions proposed don’t have the best results because of management influence on {{the opinions of the}} people at the meeting; the experts withhold and don’t use their valuable information, product of years of work. This model presents a way to obtain solutions for these kinds of problems in any organization. First, it is necessary to build an organizational memory where the experts register good problem solutions in a specific domain. In this way, when a new problem is presented, the model searches the desired goals in the organizational memory data base and compares them to the past actions registered as good solutions based on experience. If an action has been registered by the majority of the experts then this action {{will be part of the}} solution. This point of view is equivalent to a vote in a meeting to obtain agreement for a consensual solution. The <b>metaplanning</b> model was implemented with Visual FoxPro Software in a simple domain, to facilitate the understanding of the proposed solution. We did this because in an organization we don’t have the availability of confidential information from enterprises. However, it is easy to extrapolate the model behavior to any domain.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper addresses the problem of providing an explicit, declarative representation of the process of producing plans in order to model the behavior of an agent. We describe a plan-based agent model where an explicit level of <b>metaplans,</b> the agent-modeling plans, describes how an agent commits to the satisfaction of a goal. These plans describe how the intentions of an agent change while he is acting and, possibly, communicating and cooperating with other agents at a certain domain task. The plan-based representation of actions makes it possible to use the knowledge about actions both for interpreting the behavior of an observed agent (in order to recognize his intentions) and to generate agent behavior. 1 Introduction Agents move in the world by doing three different kinds of activities: observation, planning and action execution.

The approach implements a form of <b>metaplanning</b> that enables a planner to reason about properties of multiple plans in a single plan network.

40|$|Purpose This report {{presents}} the approach and {{results of a}} case study at the Information Technology (IT) department of Office Depot Europe, where brainstorming is {{used to create a}} plan for growing in process maturity. First an IT Process Maturity Model is selected that is most applicable for a European IT organization that is currently at an early stage of maturity and is aiming to move towards a service oriented organization. The criteria for maturity level zero to three that are needed to move to the next level of maturity and priority indications are included in this model. The maturity model describes {{what needs to be done}} to move to the next level in maturity. The next step is to determine how to achieve this. A brainstorming method is selected that can result in planning actions to move to the next level of maturity and support cross-silo communication. Furthermore, the risks of the selected brainstorming method and possible alleviations are described. Taken approach The selection of the IT Process Maturity Model and the brainstorm method were done by performing a literature study on relevant subject matter articles. After the literature study a brainstorming pilot project was executed and closed by a survey filled out by the participants. Furthermore experts have been asked to share their opinion by filling out a survey as well. The combination of results of the literature study, the participant's feedback and external opinions resulted in recommendations regarding the creation of an action plan through brainstorming in order to move to the next level in the selected IT Process Maturity Model. Findings IT Process Maturity Model A process model is best suited as the organizational reference model to ensure anticipation on the cross-departmental approach of the model. The Process Classification Framework of The American Productivity and Quality Council (APQC) consists of a list of business areas and processes, including Information Technology. The maturity levels that are used in the Gartner IT management process maturity model, the Capability Maturity Model integrated and the IT Service Capability Maturity Model are analyzed, combined and added to the APQC IT Process Framework resulting in the IT Process Maturity Model. The most important criteria for each maturity level have been described and extended with an additional split in three sub criteria, to simplify the required process change steps. The process areas have also received a priority number and all processes that have obvious direct customer contact have been marked to provide extra support to management. Findings <b>MetaPlan</b> brainstorming Two change strategies have been combined. Creative tension, where the desired future is described in the maturity model, and green-print-thinking, where the change of behavior will be achieved through participation. For the participation element of this research the <b>MetaPlan</b> brainstorming method has been selected. <b>MetaPlan</b> brainstorming is suitable for creating a cross-departmental, shared mindset and can result in the creation of an action plan. The most important risks with this approach are incorrect group size, no variation or new input during the session, groupthink or groupshift, unequal speaker time, lack of trust or involvement and cultural differences and an inexperienced moderator. Anticipations for these risks have been addressed in this research. 7 MSc. Business Process Management & IT Gwenda Frijns Maturing by Learning: Abstract 30 May 2008 Conclusions and practical implications The presented IT Process Maturity Model is not a traditional maturity model. The basis of the model is a scorecard for benchmarking the maturity of any given process. Priority numbers indicate in which maturity level each process should be executed. For using the IT Process Maturity Model it is necessary to understand the basic concepts of maturity models and process modeling. In order to get the model embedded in an organization it is important that it is recognizable for the users. <b>MetaPlan</b> brainstorming can lead to an action plan with limited or extra effort to move to the next level of maturity, as defined in the IT Process Maturity Model. The model needs to be pre-discussed with the brainstorming participants before the actual brainstorm session. However, before being able to discuss about growing in the level of maturity it is a requirement to have a view on the current situation. Limitations and suggestions for further research The results of this research are based on one case study and two expert opinions. Future case studies on the presented subject could emphasize the outcome presented in this report and with that either increase or decrease the significance of this research. Originality and value No or limited research is available regarding to the approach how to achieve what has been described as being the next step in a maturity model.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{focuses on}} the efforts of some Saudi public {{organizations}} to implement Total Quality Management (TQM). It mainly aims at exploring the approaches these organizations used to introduce TQM into the public sector, and to identify the factors that help or hinder successful implementation of TQM programs in the organizations under study. The importance of the present research springs from its practical significance which provides us with first hand experience of implementing TQM programs in the Saudi public sector using snowballing method to identify organizations that implement TQM and <b>metaplan</b> method to interview managers and employees involved in implementing such TQM programs. Research findings indicate differences among organizations under research in terms of main reasons for applications, level of implementation, units of application, type of TQM program adopted, training on TQM, employees understanding of TQM, leadership commitment, and statutes of TQM application. In general, the efforts of adopting TQM philosophy in the Saudi public sector faces some difficulties which mostly relate to organizational and social factors, {{and it seems that}} there is a long way for TQM to prevail its benefits to Saudi managers and employees.

40|$|Coexistence is an {{approach}} allowing farmers {{to choose between}} conventional and genetically modified (GM) crops and allowing consumers to choose between different food products subject to obligations regarding labelling and purity (European Commission, 2003). Some research have already been carried out to assess the risks of cross-pollination between GM and non-GM crops at field level, {{and the effect of}} individual measures to reduce those risks (Beckie and Hall 2008). Nonetheless, the feasibility of such measures has not been addressed. Within the framework of the SIGMEA 1 project, we aimed at designing scenarios of coexistence between GM and non-GM crops in regional case studies (Beauce/oilseed rape and Alsace/maize), involving stakeholders. First, we used spatially-explicit gene flow models (MAPOD® 2 and Genesys® 2) in order to assess the effects of regional structural variables on cross-pollination rates between GM and non-GM fields (Sausse et al., 2007; Le Bail et al. submitted). Second, surveys of farmers and collecting firms, and working groups bringing together stakeholders of the production chain (<b>Metaplan</b> methodology) were carried out in order to prioritize the critical points of coexistence and to assess the feasibility of coexistence measures (report 7. 3 SIGMEA 1, Le Bail et al. 2007).

40|$|Statement of purpose: During the {{socio-economic}} {{crisis in}} Spain, immigrants {{have been one}} of the most affected groups by the general worsening of the social determinants of health with direct implications in their wellbeing (Colectivo-Ioé, 2013). This study focuses on immigrant women from Latin America, living in Spain, which have been in vulnerable situations during the crisis, from 2008 to present. The commitment to facilitating societal transformation and reducing inequities undertaken by Occupational Science (Whiteford 2 ̆ 6 Hocking, 2012) has expanded on an international level. Despite the increase of the scientific production on post-migration occupations there is still a paucity of literature that approaches the daily life of these immigrant women, from an occupational critical perspective. This study was aimed at advancing understanding of immigrant women’s experiences of daily participation in occupations to collaboratively envision actions to promote health and wellbeing. Description of methods: A Participatory Health Research study was carried out, informed by Boaventura de Sousa Santos critical theory, the Epistemologies of the South (Santos, 2014). Different recruitment strategies (briefings, snowball, janitors, etc.) were used. Six women from Latin America, between 36 and 42 years old participated in the study. Data were generated through group discussion, interviews, diaries and <b>Metaplan.</b> A critical narrative analysis was used to analyze the data generated by group discussion, interviews and diaries. Participants performed a thematic analysis for the <b>Metaplan.</b> Approval of the University of A Coruña Ethics Committee was obtained. Report of results: 1) the occupational story of each participant; 2) the cross-sectional themes: occupational struggles in daily life and; 3) an Agenda for change set by the participants. This presentation will approach the two latest. Implications: The findings show singular contributions to Occupational Science, illustrating the impact of structural violence in everyday occupations (racism, gender violence, health and social care professionals oppression, work opportunities linked to sex trade, among others) and how immigrant women negotiate it through daily occupations to survive (participating in occupation with other immigrant women or performing restorative occupations). Therefore, findings challenge the linear understanding of occupational transition and integration after migration by clarifying how a peripheral and volatile area of participation in occupations can be generated in society; the occupational struggles show how participating in occupations can be oppressive but also can work as a strategy for resistance and, similarly, illuminate how participating in occupations can simultaneously challenge and promote wellbeing. Discussion questions to further occupational science concepts and ideas How gender based categorization of occupations could contribute to oppressive contexts in daily life in other realities? Could occupational struggle work as an articulating concept around the complexities of negotiating occupations in peripheral places of contemporary global societies? Precarious migration enacts occupational struggles: what other situations of the global context can enact occupational struggles? What kind of OS knowledge can contribute to shed light to the complexity of occupational struggles experienced by vulnerable groups...|$|R

Results Most GPs agree with the guideline content but believe that guideline stipulations are not congruent with patient wishes. Non-adherence to the guideline and contradictory information for patients by other professionals (e. g., GPs, orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists) are important barriers to guideline adherence. Almost half of the GPs have no access to recommended multimodal pain programs for patients with chronic LBP. Conclusion Promoting adherence to the LBP guideline requires more than enhancing knowledge about evidence-based management of LBP. Public education and an interdisciplinary consensus are important requirements for successful guideline implementation into daily practice. Guideline recommendations need to be adapted to the infrastructure of the health care system. Trial registration BMBF Grant Nr. 01 EM 0113.
