50|$|Crocosphaera watsonii, which {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} oceanic nitrogen fixation, {{is limited by}} iron as {{is also the case}} for other marine diazotrophs.

To overcome the challenge of iron scarcity, Crocosphaera watsonii has come up with a unique mechanism that involves reduction of <b>metalloenzyme</b> inventories. In this mechanism, the <b>metalloenzyme</b> will be synthesized only when needed and will be degraded as soon as they are no longer needed, and in the process the associated iron is recycled. In this way, less iron is taken up unnecessarily by the <b>metalloenzyme</b> when it is inactive, and the iron can be used in other processes such as nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. This mechanism reduces the iron requirement of Crocosphaera watsonii by up to 75%, but it costs energy.

40|$|Artificial <b>metalloenzymes</b> {{are created}} by {{incorporating}} an organometallic catalyst within a host protein. The resulting hybrid can thus provide access to the best features of two distinct, and often complementary, systems: homogeneous and enzymatic catalysts. The coenzyme may be positioned with covalent, dative, or supramolecular anchoring strategies. Although initial reports date to the late 1970 s, artificial <b>metalloenzymes</b> for enantioselective catalysis have gained significant momentum {{only in the past}} decade, with the aim of complementing homogeneous, enzymatic, heterogeneous, and organic catalysts. Inspired by a visionary report by Wilson and Whitesides in 1978, we have exploited the potential of biotin−avidin technology in creating artificial <b>metalloenzymes.</b> Owing to the remarkable affinity of biotin for either avidin or streptavidin, covalent linking of a biotin anchor to a catalyst precursor ensures that, upon stoichiometric addition of (strept) avidin, the metal moiety is quantitatively incorporated within the host protein.

These artificial <b>metalloenzymes</b> can be optimized by both chemical (variation of the biotin−spacer−ligand moiety) and genetic (mutation of avidin or streptavidin) means.
