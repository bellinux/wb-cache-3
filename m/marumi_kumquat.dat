The trees flower and may even bear fruit in pot cultivation.|$|E
5000|$|When the kumquats {{are divided}} into {{multiple}} species, the name Fortunella japonica (or Citrus japonica) is retained by this group. The round kumquat also called <b>Marumi</b> <b>kumquat</b> or Morgani kumquat, is an evergreen tree, producing edible golden-yellow fruit. The round Hawaiian varietal, the [...] "Meiwa kumquat", is eaten raw. The fruit is small and usually round but can be oval shaped. The peel has a sweet flavor but the fruit has a sour center. The fruit can be eaten cooked but is mainly used to make marmalades and jellies. It is grown as an ornamental plant {{and can be used}} in bonsai. The plant symbolizes good luck in China and other Asian countries, where it is kept as a houseplant and given as a gift during the Lunar New Year. Round kumquats are more commonly cultivated than other species due to their cold tolerance.|$|E

40|$|Tristeza disease, {{caused by}} the Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV), {{is the most important}} viral disease for almost all the citrus species. Main syndromes are quick decline, stem pitting, vein clearing and seedlings yellows but expression and intensity of symptomatology depends on the interactions of the factors involved in the pathosystem such as host-strain-rootstock-climate-vector. Several isolates of CTV have been studied all over the world. Two Corsican isolates have been previously characterized, the K strain from <b>Marumi</b> <b>kumquat,</b> known to be symptomless on Mexican lime, and the CaL - 1 from calamondin inducing stem pitting, but no sequences of p 20 gene are published or available in GenBank. Two additional CTV strains were recently found in Corsica. The isolates LA 5 and CO 3 were detected in two different orchards of 40 year old Clementine on sour orange trees that didn't show any specific symptoms ascribable to tristeza. Results of the molecular characterization of these isolates are reported. CTV presence was ascertained in young shoots collected in field by RT-PCR using specific primers for the gene p 20. The amplicons obtained were analyzed by cloning and sequencing. Sequences analysis pointed out high similarity between the two isolates (98 %). Multiple alignment analysis with all the p 20 CTV gene sequences deposited in GenBank evidenced the identity of the virus detected in the two orchards. Respect to the already described mild, severe and atypical groups of CTV isolates, phylogenetic analysis revealed a new cluster including both LA 5 and CO 3...|$|E
40|$|Tolerant citrus {{rootstocks}} {{are defined}} as Cl? excluders. However, {{little is known about}} the salt tolerance of cultivars used as scions, particularly the tolerance of monoembryonic citrus genotypes. To enhance the genetic resources for generating improved hybrid rootstocks, the evaluation of large samples of citrus species, including both monoembryonic and polyembryonic genotypes, is necessary. In this study, 12 citrus genotypes representing the major Citrus species and all the three genera of the Rutaceae family were subjected to moderate salt stress (75 mM) for 12 weeks to characterise their physiological response to salt stress. Various symptoms and physiological parameters were evaluated to characterise their salt sensitivity. These included plant growth (stem diameter), leaf chlorophyll content, leaf flavonoid content, maximum quantum yield of PSII [(Fm ? F 0) / Fm) ], net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and leaf Na+ and Cl? contents. The results clearly demonstrated that the most salt sensitive genotypes accumulated high concentrations of Na+ and Cl? and maintained a fair growth and photosynthetic rate. By contrast, salt-tolerant genotypes accumulated less Na+ and Cl? and decreased their growth and gas exchange. Poncire commun citron and <b>Marumi</b> <b>kumquat</b> were the most sensitive species, while mandarins, pummelo and Australian sour orange were the most tolerant species. Among the genotypes, Engedi pummelo presented a specific trait for salt tolerance that has not been previously reported. Taken together, the results suggest that low leaf chloride content can be used as an indicator of salt stress tolerance in citrus genotypes. Exploitation of this indicator will enable the improved evaluation of citrus genetic resources and should lead to the identification of new sources of tolerance for rootstock breeding.
