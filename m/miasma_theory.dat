5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory,</b> and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1850s the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> {{of disease}} was largely {{superseded}} by the germ theory of disease, creating extensive interest in microorganisms and {{their interactions with}} other forms of life. By the 1880s, bacteriology was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of Robert Koch, who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on agar gels containing specific nutrients in Petri dishes. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (spontaneous generation) was attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory,</b> which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by all, because of the speed with which it could spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Kuhn {{described}} how {{a paradigm shift}} is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from <b>miasma</b> to germ <b>theory</b> {{as a cause of}} disease. Building on this work, Giovanni Dosi developed the concept of ’technical paradigms’ and ‘technological trajectories’. In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory. In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter ( [...] ,)defined the concept of the ‘technological regime’ which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the context and {{theory of the}} ecohealth system approach. It begins with a historical review of the <b>miasma</b> and hygienist <b>theories</b> and the initiatives of the bourgeoisie to create healthy cities and domestic environments, included for the working class. It then brings into focus the social medicine movement in the XIX Century that put the general conditions of production and reproduction {{into the center of}} the health agenda. The article also considers the environmental movement that developed rapidly after the Second World War and influenced the changing paradigms in the health area. This is emphasized in the Lalonde Model (Canada) and for the Ottawa Report of the World Health Organization. These documents introduce a comprehensive approach to the different determinants of the complex production of sanitation and disease patterns. The {{article presents}} the ecosystem approach to human health that has been under development since the 1970 s, based on the Canadian experience. Their principles are: understand the context and complexity of the problems, but act locally; involve all the social actors (people, governors, managers, enterprisers, professionals and technicians) in the solution of the problems; use science and technology as a change strategy; work with social participation and empowerment of the individuals; take into account the different roles of men, women, children and elders in the social construction of the changes needed; adopt an inter- and trans-disciplinary perspective, in which disciplinary fragments are pulled together and deployed in pursuit of quality of life and a healthy environment...|$|R
5|$|Immunology is {{a science}} that {{examines}} the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory.</b> It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, {{for which he was}} awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.|$|E
5|$|London's dead had {{traditionally}} been buried {{in and around}} local churches, and with {{a limited amount of}} space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. In {{the first half of the}} 19thcentury the population of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300acres (0.5sqmi; 1.2km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Graveyards became very congested. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> (the belief that airborne particles were the primary factor in the spread of contagious disease), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 16th century, a doctor from Verona named Girolamo Fracastoro was the first to propose a theory that these very small, unseeable, {{particles}} that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire. In this way he refuted Galen's <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> (poison gas in sick people). In 1543 he wrote a book De contagione et contagiosis morbis, in which {{he was the first to}} promote personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.|$|E
500|$|The name malaria {{derived from}} mal aria ('bad air' in Medieval Italian). This idea {{came from the}} Ancient Romans who thought that this disease came from the horrible fumes in the swamps. The word malaria {{has its roots in}} the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory,</b> as {{described}} by historian and chancellor of Florence Leonardo Bruni in his Historiarum Florentini populi libri XII, which was the first major example of Renaissance historical writing: ...|$|E
500|$|Public {{health policy}} {{at this time}} was shaped by the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> (the belief that {{airborne}} particles released by decaying flesh were the primary factor in the spread of contagious illness), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded {{that it was impossible}} to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. Commissioner and sanitation campaigner Edwin Chadwick testified that each year, 20,000 adults and 30,000 children were being buried in less than [...] of already full burial grounds; the Commission heard that one cemetery, Spa Fields in Clerkenwell, designed to hold 1,000 bodies, contained 80,000 graves, and that gravediggers throughout London were obliged to shred bodies in order to cram the remains into available grave space. In 1848–49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely. Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials.|$|E

2500|$|Historically many {{different}} claimed remedies have existed in folklore. Many {{of the older}} remedies {{were based on the}} <b>miasma</b> <b>theory.</b> Some believed that abdominal chilling made one more susceptible and flannel and cholera belts were routine in army kits. In the 1854–1855 outbreak in Naples homeopathic Camphor was used according to Hahnemann. T. J. Ritter's [...] "Mother's Remedies" [...] book lists tomato syrup as a home remedy from northern America. Elecampane was recommended in the United Kingdom according to William Thomas Fernie ...|$|E
2500|$|Snow was {{a skeptic}} of the then-dominant <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> that stated that {{diseases}} such as cholera and bubonic plague were caused by pollution or a noxious form of [...] "bad air". The germ theory of disease {{had not yet been}} developed, so Snow did not understand the mechanism by which the disease was transmitted. His observation of the evidence led him to discount the theory of foul air. He first publicised his theory in an 1849 essay, On the Mode of Communication of Cholera, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation {{of the role of the}} water supply in the Soho epidemic of 1854.|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{knowledge}} had stagnated {{during the}} Middle Ages. The most authoritative account {{at the time}} came from the medical faculty in Paris in {{a report to the}} king of France that blamed the heavens, {{in the form of a}} conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a [...] "great pestilence in the air". This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory.</b> The word plague had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in the 1840s, surgery {{began to}} change {{dramatically}} in character {{with the discovery of}} effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as ether, first used by the American surgeon Crawford Long (1815–1878), and chloroform, discovered by James Young Simpson (1811–1870) and later pioneered in England by John Snow (1813–1858), physician to Queen Victoria, who in 1853 administered chloroform to her during childbirth, and in 1854 disproved the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> of contagion by tracing a cholera outbreak in London to an infected water pump. In addition to relieving patient suffering, anaesthesia allowed more intricate operations in the internal regions of the human body. [...] In addition, the discovery of muscle relaxants such as curare allowed for safer applications. [...] American surgeon J. Marion Sims (1813–83) received credit for helping found Gynecology, but later was criticized for failing to use anesthesia on African test subjects.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of water treatment soon became mainstream and common, and {{the virtues of}} the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician John Snow during the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> that stated that diseases were caused by noxious [...] "bad airs". Although the germ theory of disease had not yet been developed, Snow's observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay On the Mode of Communication of Cholera conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in Soho, {{with the use of a}} dot distribution map and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{immunity}} has intrigued mankind {{for thousands of}} years. The prehistoric view of disease {{was that it was}} caused by supernatural forces, and that illness was a form of theurgic punishment for [...] "bad deeds" [...] or [...] "evil thoughts" [...] visited upon the soul by the gods or by one's enemies. Between the time of Hippocrates and the 19th century, when the foundations of the scientific methods were laid, diseases were attributed to an alteration or imbalance in one of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile or black bile). Also popular during this time before learning that communicable diseases came from germs/microbes was the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory,</b> which held that diseases such as cholera or the Black Plague were caused by a miasma, a noxious form of [...] "bad air". If someone were exposed to the miasma in a swamp, in evening air, or breathing air in a sickroom or hospital ward, they could get a disease.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the nineteenth}} century public health, {{sanitation}} {{and the influence of}} miasma became the main reasons for the controversial practice of cremation. The <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> stated that infectious diseases were spread by noxious gases emitted from decaying organic matter, which included decaying corpses. This public health argument for cremation faded along with the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
50|$|In India, {{there was}} also a <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> and the Indians take credit for being the first to put this <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> into {{clinical}} practice. The Indians invented paan, a gambir paste, that was believed to help prevent miasma; it was considered as the first antimiasmatic application. This gambir tree is found in Southern India and Sri Lanka.|$|E
50|$|The <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> was {{consistent}} with the observations that disease was associated with poor sanitation (and hence foul odours) and that sanitary improvements reduced disease; it was not consistent with the observations of microbiology however which led to the later germ theory of disease. The introduction of medical bacteriology in the 1870s and 1880s provided a challenge to the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory,</b> though consensus was not reached immediately; concerns over sewer gas, which was a major component of the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> developed by Galen and brought to prominence by the Great Stink, led to continuing proponents of the theory who observed that sewers enclosed the refuse of the human bowel, which medical science had discovered could teem with typhoid, cholera, and other microbes.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1876 that Robert Koch proved that the {{bacterium}} Bacillus anthracis caused anthrax, which brought a definitive end to <b>Miasma</b> <b>Theory.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Political {{intervention}} as {{a consequence}} of the perceived need for a change with regards to how to deal with odorous substances: Up until the end of the nineteenth century the dominant theory on the spread of illness was the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory.</b> This theory stated that everything that smelled had to be gotten rid of because inhaling bad smells was thought to lead to illness. The <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> did contribute to containing disease in urban settlements, but did not allow for a suitable approach to safe excreta reuse to be adopted.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} year, William Farr, {{who was then}} the major {{supporter}} of the <b>Miasma</b> <b>Theory,</b> issued a report to criticize the germ theory. Farr and the Committee wrote that: ...|$|E
50|$|By 1866, {{eight years}} {{after the death of}} John Snow, William Farr {{publicly}} acknowledged that the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> on the transmission of cholera was wrong, by his statistical justification on the death rate.|$|E
5000|$|John Snow in 1854 {{discovered}} that the water pump on Broad Street, Soho was responsible for 616 cholera deaths because it was contaminated by an old cesspit leaking fecal bacteria. Germ theory of disease began to replace <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> that had lingered since the Black Death.|$|E
50|$|Educational {{activities}} {{included the}} presenting of both cases and specimens {{on a variety}} of medical and surgical subjects. Students presented papers on a range of topics including women in medicine, the medicinal benefits of corsets, germ theory and the theories of Lister's anti-sepsis, <b>miasma</b> <b>theory,</b> Spiritualism, galvanism and grammar school education.|$|E
5000|$|According to the 20th-century {{historian}} and philosopher Michel Foucault, the cholera outbreak was first fought {{by what he}} called [...] "social medicine", which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of cemeteries, etc. All of these concerns, born of the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> of disease, were thus concerned with urbanist concerns of the management of populations.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{was a close}} ally {{on public}} health matters with Edwin Chadwick, and like him {{supported}} the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory.</b> From 1848 to 1854 they worked closely together at the Central Board of Health. But the appointment of Lord Seymour made their work very difficult, despite the support of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury.|$|E
50|$|The <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> was {{accepted}} from ancient times in Europe and China. The theory was eventually given up by scientists and physicians after 1880, {{replaced by the}} germ theory of disease: specific germs, not miasma, caused specific diseases. However, cultural beliefs about getting rid of odor made the clean-up of waste {{a high priority for}} cities.|$|E
50|$|The map {{showed that}} {{a high number of}} deaths were {{occurring}} near a water pump on Broad Street at Cambridge Street. Snow petitioned the local authorities to remove the pump's handle, which caused dramatic decreases in cholera cases for the immediate area. The map helped the germ theory of disease transmission supplant <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> as the widely accepted view.|$|E
50|$|Savaresi {{published}} {{several articles}} and treatises on medical, anthropological and other scientific issues. In his writings he framed his empirical observations {{by referring to}} scientific models taken from contemporary medical doctrines. Thereby he combined neo-Hippocratic assumptions about the pathogenic role of environmental factors (<b>miasma</b> <b>theory)</b> with the more recent theories developed by the Scottish physician John Brown (1735-1788), according to which health was basically {{the result of an}} internal balance of human “excitability” and disease a matter of over or under-stimulation. While the Brunonian system of medicine did not enjoy much support among French physicians, it was very popular among many young republican physicians from the Italian peninsula who considered it to be a revolutionary doctrine. Although Brown’s system was opposed to Hippocratic medicine and <b>miasma</b> <b>theory,</b> Savaresi combined them in order {{to make sense of the}} diseases he was trying to understand and to cure.|$|E
5000|$|The germ {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by Girolamo Fracastoro in 1546, and expanded upon by Marcus von Plenciz in 1762. Such views {{were held in}} disdain, however, and Galen's <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> remained dominant among scientists and doctors. The nature of this doctrine prevented them from understanding how diseases actually progressed, with predictable consequences. By the early nineteenth century, smallpox vaccination was commonplace in Europe, though doctors were unaware of how it worked or how to extend the principle to other diseases. Similar treatments had been prevalent in India from just before 1000 A.D. [...] A transitional period {{began in the late}} 1850s as the work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch provided convincing evidence; by 1880, <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> was struggling to compete with the germ theory of disease. Eventually, a [...] "golden era" [...] of bacteriology ensued, in which the theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases. [...] Viruses were discovered in the 1890s.|$|E
5000|$|Considered as {{the science}} of the {{internal}} order of the community, it was a comprehensive term, which included today's public law, administrative science, the early political economy, public health concerns, urbanism and urban planning (important {{in the light of}} the <b>miasma</b> <b>theory</b> of disease), etc. It overlapped with the simultaneously used term of Verwaltungswissenschaft (or [...] "administrative science") and was a university course included in official trainings.|$|E
50|$|In 1854 London {{physician}} John Snow {{discovered that}} people who drank from a particular water pump contracted cholera, and proposed that drinking this water from this pump {{was the cause of}} the illness. At the time people did not readily believe germ theory of disease, instead favoring <b>miasma</b> <b>theory.</b> The discovery of the water pump as a source of infection set a precedent which helped establish epidemiology as a science.|$|E
