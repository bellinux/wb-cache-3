Despite a rough outing against the Tampa Bay Rays on May 27, Rays' manager Joe Maddon took to Twitter soon after watching Fernández pitch, saying, [...] "José Fernández <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> young pitcher I've ever seen, at that age.

When discussing the episode on the official Star Trek website in 2013, Gendel concluded: [...] "If you Google 'Inner Light + song' you’ll get the Beatles tune and an acknowledgment of my TNG homage to it back-to-back … that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> gift my authorship of this episode has given me." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Fey began {{performing}} in sketches, {{and she and}} Jimmy Fallon became co-anchors of SNL's Weekend Update segment. Fey {{said she did not}} ask to audition, but that Michaels approached her. Michaels explained that there was chemistry between Fey and Fallon, though [...] the decision was [...] "kind of risky" [...] at the time. Her role in Weekend Update was well received by critics. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "...Fey delivers such blow darts– poison filled jokes written in long, precisely parsed sentences unprecedented in Update history– with such a bright, sunny countenance makes her all the more devilishly delightful." [...] Dennis Miller, a former cast member of SNL and anchor of Weekend Update, was pleased with Fey as one of the anchors for the segment: [...] "...Fey <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Weekend Update anchor who ever did it. She writes the funniest jokes". Robert Bianco of USA Today, however, commented that he was [...] "not enamored" [...] of the pairing.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} of Moonraker in 1979, the Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, while clearly expressing his {{approval}} of the advanced special effects and Ken Adam's extravagant production sets, criticised the pace in which {{the locations of the}} film evolved, remarking that, [...] "it's so jammed with faraway places and science fiction special effects that Bond has to move at a trot just to make it into all the scenes". Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said of the film: [...] "Most rational observers agree that Moonraker is without a doubt the most absurd James Bond movie, definitely of the Roger Moore era and possibly of all time". However, while he criticised the extravagance of the plot and action sequences, he believed that this added to the enjoyment of the film, and particularly approved of the remark [...] "I think he's attempting re-entry!" [...] by [...] "Q" [...] during Bond and Goodhead's orbiting of the Earth which he described as [...] "featuring what <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> double entendre ever".|$|E
500|$|Myst games had {{typically}} used chroma key to insert footage of actors into digital backgrounds. The models of End of Agess characters were instead computer-generated, but Cyan {{did not want}} to lose the warmth and feeling provided by using a live actor. Instead Cyan developed a device mounted to the actors' faces that captured video of the actors while they spoke their lines. The video was then manipulated and used as a facial texture that was mapped onto the 3D characters, and the facial movement was also tracked and used to animate the faces of the characters in-game. Motion capture of the body was also used to ensure lifelike movement. Cyan staff were worried that the audio synching for animation would not be finished in time for the E3 unveiling of the game, but were happy with the end results. Critical reaction to game previews and impressions at E3 was highly positive. Miller was relieved, stating that when the mostly shooter game-dominated showcase declared that End of Ages <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> game in the series, [...] "That feels good".|$|E
500|$|On January 25, 1987, the Giants met the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI. In {{the biggest}} {{game of his}} life, Simms {{had one of the}} finest {{performances}} in Super Bowl history. He completed 22 of 25 passes (with 2 of his 3 incompletions being drops by receivers) for 268 yards, setting Super Bowl records for consecutive completions (10), accuracy (88%), and passer rating (150.9). In addition, he threw 3 touchdown passes and his passer rating set an NFL postseason record. [...] "This <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> game a quarterback has ever played", Giants coach Bill Parcells later said. Two of the most famous plays from the game were the flea flicker to McConkey, and the touchdown pass caught by McConkey off of the fingertips of Giants tight end, Mark Bavaro. [...] The Giants defeated the Broncos 39-20, and Simms was named MVP of Super Bowl XXI. He is credited for being the first to use the phrase [...] "I'm going to Disney World!"

500|$|The episode {{received}} a somewhat positive reaction from reviewers. IGN Robert Canning was representative of this, {{and gave it}} a [...] "good" [...] rating of 7.5 out of 10: [...] "The episode as a whole was fine for what it was, touching on most of the hallmarks of a decent prom episode", though he [...] "was a bit let down by the final moments of the episode as [...] felt it too quickly tried to pin a happy ending on everything". He also called the drama around Rachel and Jesse and Quinn and Finn [...] "superficial stuff", a view shared by Meghan Brown of The Atlantic who said much of the drama [...] "felt shallow and forced", except for the first Kurt and Karofsky scene, which she described as [...] "painful and poignant". Brown's colleague, Kevin Fallon, stated that [...] "Like prom, this episode was Glee at its best and its worst", and MTV Aly Semigran thought that it [...] "wasn't as strong—or cohesive—as last week's 'Rumours, but said it [...] "certainly had its moments, especially some notably hilarious ones." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but I think that it still <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E
500|$|McAdams {{appeared}} in three other 2015 films. She starred with her Wedding Crashers co-star Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone and John Krasinski in Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy-drama Aloha. She played the ex-girlfriend of Cooper's character, {{who is married}} to Krasinski's character with two children. While the film received a negative reaction and controversy from critics and audiences alike, McAdams was praised. Wesley Morris of Grantland remarked: [...] "Someone who can speak Crowe’s language really helps. McAdams <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> he’s ever had ... puts the perfect amount of air in her lines, giving the words a lightness that conflates optimism, amusement, and resignation. She’s never seemed lovelier, more instinctive, or more present." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times felt she [...] "plays likely the strongest, most rounded female character Crowe has ever written, a woman suddenly {{face to face with the}} life she has and the one she might have had, and the actress brings a grounded, unforced earthiness to the role that is a joy to watch." [...] She co-starred with Jake Gyllenhaal in the boxing drama Southpaw (2015), where she played the wife of Gyllenhaal's character. The film received mixed reviews but A.O. Scott of The New York Times conceded: [...] "It features some pretty appealing players. There are worse things to see at the multiplex than Ms. McAdams playing a tough cookie standing by her man." [...] She co-starred with James Franco, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Marie-Josée Croze in Wim Wenders's drama Every Thing Will Be Fine. The film received an U.S. limited release in December 2015. Guy Lodge of Variety remarked: [...] "Poor McAdams, sporting sensible hair and a truly mystifying cod-Continental accent, continues her thankless run of needy, tossed-aside love interests in big-name auteur projects." ...|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy VI {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of the best titles in the series and one of the best role-playing video games ever created. In 2005, IGN placed Final Fantasy VI 56th on their list of the 100 greatest games, as the second highest ranked Final Fantasy title on the list after Final Fantasy IV. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it as the 13th top 200 game on any Nintendo platform, suggesting that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Final Fantasy ever. That same year, readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu voted it as the 25th best game of all time. In 2008, Final Fantasy VI took the #1 spot on G4 TV's [...] "Top Must Own RPGs" [...] list. That same year, ScrewAttack named Final Fantasy VI the third best SNES game, beaten only by [...] and Super Metroid. In 2009, Final Fantasy VI was inducted into the IGN Videogame Hall of Fame, becoming the second Final Fantasy game to do so (the only other Final Fantasy to do so was the original Final Fantasy). In 2012, also IGN put Final Fantasy VI as number one on their list of the top role-playing video games, stating: [...] "There are too many moments in Final Fantasy VI worthy of celebration to name them all. Biggs and Wedge leading Terra through the snow. The poisoning of Doma. Sandy boots. The destruction of the world. A tragic opera. Ultros! We hold these close to our hearts, and that's not even including Espers and the most poignant character themes in the series to date. So cheers, Final Fantasy VI. May your name follow us as we all tumble towards the future of art, entertainment, narrative, and everything that keeps us gaming." [...] In an updated version of the [...] "Top 100" [...] list in 2007, IGN ranked Final Fantasy VI as the ninth top game of all time, above all other Final Fantasy games in the series. They continued to cite the game's character development, and especially noted Kefka as [...] "one of the most memorable bad guys in RPG history." [...] In 2009, Game Informer put the SNES version of Final Fantasy III eighth on their list of the top games of all time, opining that it [...] "perfected the 2D role-playing game." [...] It fell from its seventh-place ranking the staff gave it in 2001. In 2012, the staff of GamesRadar ranked it as the ninth best SNES game, stating that [...] "for it to remain so effective and so moving for so long after its 1994 release means it is a true work of art, and demands to sit high atop any list, regardless of platform (we did already name it the 14th best game of all time)." [...] In 2017, the staff of IGN ranked it as the second best RPG game of all time, stating that [...] "This willingness to explore heavy themes and unthinkable outcomes — made all the more poignant when set against dramatic set pieces and a soaring score — is one of the biggest reasons why Squaresoft’s 1994 magnum opus is so very special." ...|$|E

Chuyen was subsequently arrested and interrogated for ten days, with polygraph tests indicating that he had compromised security arrangements and was working with the Viet Cong.
