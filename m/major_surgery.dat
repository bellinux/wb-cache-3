5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include <b>major</b> <b>surgery</b> and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityINTRODUCTION: The {{incidence}} of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), which comprises {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) at a population-based level remains unknown in patients undergoing <b>major</b> urologic <b>surgery.</b> Our aim {{was to determine the}} {{incidence of}} VTE in <b>major</b> urologic <b>surgery,</b> identify patients who are at high risk for developing these events, and to examine whether the use of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is associated with a reduction in the incidence of VTE in <b>major</b> urologic <b>surgery.</b> METHODS: We captured all adult patients who underwent <b>major</b> urologic <b>surgery</b> between January 2005 and December 2010 based on 1 CD- 9 -CM codes from the Perspective Database (Premier, Inc, Charlotte, NC), a nationally representative dataset capturing 25 % of US hospital discharges. <b>Major</b> urologic <b>surgery</b> was defined as a radical prostatectomy, radical cystectomy, radical nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy. We used ICD- 9 -CM codes to identify VTE and major bleeding after <b>major</b> urologic <b>surgery</b> within 90 days after the procedure and hospital billing descriptions to identify if patients had received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis beginning the day of surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using STATA 12 (StataCorp LP, CollegeStation, Texas) after adjusting for sample weights. [TRUNCATED...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the incidence of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) in patients undergoing <b>major</b> abdominal <b>surgery</b> and <b>major</b> orthopedic <b>surgery</b> who received VTE prophylaxis. MethodsBetween January of 2010 and September of 2013 all the patients who underwent <b>major</b> abdominal <b>surgery</b> and <b>major</b> orthopedic <b>surgery</b> who received VTE prophylaxis, at King Fahad Hospital Dammam Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, were prospectively evaluated for the incidence of DVT and PE within 30 postoperative days.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relevance of applying the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) approach to patients undergoing <b>major</b> spinal <b>surgery.</b> The history of ERAS, details {{of the components of}} the approach, and the underlying rationale are explained. Evidence on outcomes achieved by using the ERAS approach in other orthopaedic and complex surgical procedures are then outlined. Data on <b>major</b> spinal <b>surgery</b> rates and current practice are reviewed and the rationale for the use of ERAS in <b>major</b> spinal <b>surgery</b> is discussed, and potential challenges to its adoption acknowledged. A thorough literature search is then undertaken to examine the use of ERAS pathways in <b>major</b> spinal <b>surgery,</b> and the results presented. The article then reviews the evidence to support the application of individual ERAS components such as patient education, multimodal pain management, surgical approach, blood loss, nutrition, and physiotherapy in <b>major</b> spinal <b>surgery,</b> and discusses the need for further robust research to be undertaken. The article concludes that given the rising costs of surgery and levels of patient dissatisfaction, an ERAS pathway that focuses on optimizing clinical procedures by adopting evidence-based practice, and improving logistics, should enable <b>major</b> spinal <b>surgery</b> patients to recover more quickly with lower rates of morbidity and improved longer term outcomes...|$|R
