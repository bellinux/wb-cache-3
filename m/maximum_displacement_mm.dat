[...] According to RusHydro, displacements of the dam are both seasonally reversible and irreversible. The movements have been reduced in recent years. The <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> (141.5 <b>mm)</b> was recorded in 2006 at dam central section No 33, which however was below the allowed maximum of 145.5 mm.

Also, according to RusHydro the dam is constructed for forces 2.4 times stronger than the actual forces on it are. The spillway is constructed for maximum output 13,600 m3/s, the maximum real water spill can be 7,000-7,500 m3/s as the higher spill will flood villages below the dam.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Close-range {{photogrammetry}} is a low-cost, {{efficient and}} accurate method {{that can take}} photos in a short distance. It {{has been applied to}} high accuracy 3 D modeling, object recognition, and deformation monitoring. In this study, a consumer grade digital camera, artificial coded targets and permanent nails are adopted to monitor the displacement on a drainage channel, where a significant rupture surface caused by the Chihshang creeping fault can be observed. The coded targets can be automatic detected and perform fully-automatic photo-triangulation, and assist the computation of the permanent nail’s coordinates. To monitor the displacement, we equally fixed 786 stainless nails in 5 rows by 160 columns on the wall surface as permanent targets and measure their coordinates by the close-range photogrammetry every few months. After obtaining the 3 D coordinates of permanent targets in different periods, we can evaluate their relative displacement through the method using seven-parameter transformation (3 D conformal transformation) that transferring the coordinates system of later period to previous one. In order to evaluate the accuracy and the minimum detectable relative displacements, an experimental field is thus established on a building facade by manually move several coded targets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can detect 1 <b>mm</b> <b>displacement</b> proving the proposed scheme can be applied in-situ to monitor the crustal deformation. The results of in-situ data collected within 2 years period shows that the <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> of 20 <b>mm</b> was detected near the rupture surface. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{suspension}} system and socket fitting of artificial limbs have major roles and vital {{effects on the}} comfort, mobility, and satisfaction of amputees. This paper introduces a new pneumatic {{suspension system}} that overcomes the drawbacks of current suspension systems in donning and doffing, change in volume during daily activities, and pressure distribution in the socket-stump interface. An air pneumatic suspension system (APSS) for total-contact sockets was designed and developed. Pistoning and pressure distribution in the socket-stump interface were tested for the new APSS. More than 95 % of the area between each prosthetic socket and liner was measured using a Tekscan F-Scan pressure measurement which has developed matrix-based pressure sensing systems. The variance in pressure around the stump was 8. 76 kPa. APSS exhibits less pressure concentration around the stump, improved pressure distribution, easy donning and doffing, adjustability to remain fitted to the socket during daily activities, and more adaptability to the changes in stump volume. The volume changes were adjusted by utility of air pressure sensor. The vertical displacement point and reliability of suspension were assessed using a photographic method. The optimum pressure in every level of loading weight was 55 kPa, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> was 6 <b>mm</b> when 90 N of weight was loaded...|$|R

40|$|A {{group of}} {{materials}} that have recently gained {{a lot of}} attention in research are shear thickening fluids (STF). A shear thickening fluid (STF) is a material whose viscosity increases significantly when the shear strain rate is at critical value. Most shear thickening fluids are designed by using a colloidal suspension of solid particles in a liquid matrix. This allows solidification of the fluid by congregation of the particles under stress. In this study the experimental findings are focused on assessing the mechanical property of shear thickening fluid (STF) after its transition to a solid phase. On account of determining the shear modulus of STF, bending tests were performed on simply-supported sandwich beam made of double carbon epoxy beams with a STF layer. The stiffness of sandwich beam with STF was evaluated for various midpoint displacements varying from 3 mm to 8 mm at fixed crosshead value of maximum speed 50 mm/s and also at different crosshead values from 10 mm/s to 50 mm/s with a <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> of 8 <b>mm.</b> The numerical value of STF’s shear modulus was calculated by using laminate beam theory.

Eye injuries have been investigated for years; however, the role of the extraocular muscles in relation to eye injuries has yet to be quantified. In this research, Computed Tomography quasi-static tests were conducted to investigate the effect of the presence of the extraocular muscles on the biomechanical response of the human eye in situ. Three matched pairs of human eyes were displaced in 5 mm increments using a large flat cylindrical indenter to a <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> of 30 <b>mm.</b> The loading was similar to what is experienced during a blunt impact, which is believed to cause the most serious eye injuries. In the matched pair, one eye had the extraocular muscles intact and the other had the extraocular muscles transected. Force, pressure, and displacement measurements were collected for each test. A trend was seen where a greater amount of force was created in the eye with the extraocular muscles intact than in the eye with the muscles transected, and a correlation between them was made. The greatest force measured in an eye with the extraocular muscles intact was 92 N, while the greatest force measured in an eye with the extraocular muscles transected was 80 N. An increase i...|$|R

The 1. 7 m long wall, designed according to the current GCRC was constructed and tested under cyclic loading, applied in two phases. Under the first one, the specimen reached a displacement of 38. 5 mm and a load of 710 kN and under the second one, the <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> was 72 <b>mm</b> and the load 675 kN. It was concluded that the load carrying capacity of the wall was 25 % greater than the design value estimated by the GCRC.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to apply a {{reparation}} method, developed by the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, on an adobe structure damaged by earthquake loading. This loading is applied with a shaking table test. Using these tests an ATENA- GiD model is made which is able to simulate the behavior of adobe houses under earthquake loading. A shaking table test is done to damage an adobe structure, after reparation, the structure is tested again and the test data of the original and repaired building is compared. The ATENA-GiD model is compared with the first shaking table test. The adobe model is made similar to earlier tests performed at the PUCP. The masonry is made with adobe blocks and mortar. The model is dried for 28 days and then subjected to an earthquake loading derived from the May, 1970 earthquake recorded in Lima. The tests consisted of 2 phases, the first phase with a <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> of 30 <b>mm</b> and the second phase with a <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> of 60 <b>mm.</b> Due to this loading, cracks became visible in the structure. These cracks are visible after a second phase, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> of 60 <b>mm.</b> To repair these cracks they are opened and cleaned with a drill and a hammer and pin. After opening, the cracks are repaired using two different methods, the “manual method” and the “silicone method”. The “manual method” consists of manually filling the cracks with the reparation mortar. The “silicone method” is a method where cracks are first covered with silicon and after hardening of the silicon, the reparation mortar is injected in the cracks. After 28 days drying, the structure is tested again with the same signal. Cracks are already visible in the first phase. In the second phase the structure partially collapsed. This is underlined by {{the data from the}} two tests. The natural frequency of the walls decreases during the first test. This implies that there is damage in the walls. After repair, the natural frequency goes up, but never reaches the original value. This implies the presence of non-visual damage. In the second test the roof detaches from the walls in an early stage of the test, this due to the non-visible damage that is not repaired and have weakened the structure. The detachment of the roof results in an structure with less stability and strength. Dynamic tests are expensive and time consuming, therefore It is important to find out what finite element software (FEM) can contribute to the research in adobe buildings in earthquake areas. In the recent past, FEM software was used on a very basic scale at the PUCP. With this thesis it is intended to explore the possibilities of using FEM software in the research of adobe buildings. This to further improve the research possibilities on adobe structures with respect to earthquake loading. The model for this thesis is made in ATENA-GiD. Due to the recent development of the scripts for this program, this study {{is one of the first}} trails for the program. Because of this, several bugs were detected. During the course of this thesis improvements have been made to the program due to close contact with the developers and the author. In spite of these improvements, the bugs in the program made it only possible to make a very basic model. This model has a coarse mesh and the material is modeled on a macro scale which means that the blocks, mortar and block-mortar interface are smeared out in the continuum. After repair the structure does not have the same behavior as the original test. Due to non visible damage that is not repaired, the structure loses strength and stability after the first test. Besides this, the repaired part is not as strong as the original masonry. Cracks between the longitudinal and transversal wall are very dangerous. The whole construction looses its stability and strength when these cracks are visible. ATENA-GiD can simulate the behavior in the elastic phase. The inelastic phase does not have similar results as with the PUCP tests. Improvements are made to ATENA-GiD throughout the course of this thesis. Due to lack of these improvements this model has a very coarse mesh, which was needed to reduce calculation time. Several updates in the program can now improve calculation time and therefore more time consuming models can be made, which will calculate the inelastic behavior better.

The device is configured as a sliding plate rheometer with optical flats (polished flat to within / 20, or 30 nm) as the shearing surfaces. White light interferometry and a three-point nanopositioning stage using piezo-stepping motors are used to control the parallelism of the upper and lower surfaces. A compound flexure system is used to hold the fluid sample testing unit between a drive spring and an independent sensor spring. Alignment fidelity, device orthogonality and total error stack-up are all optimized by machining the entire instrument frame from a single monolithic aluminum block using water-jet and EDM technology. The dynamic force range of the instrument can be varied greatly by changing the length and/or thickness of the compound flexures. Displacements in the sensing flexure are detected using an inductive proximity sensor with a resolution of ± 3 nm allowing the detection of loads up to 6 N with an accuracy of 3 mN. Calibrations give a standard deviation from linearity of the sensor spring of less than 2 %. The lower plate is attached to a drive flexure which is moved by an ‘inchworm’ motor with a <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> of 6 <b>mm</b> and a resolution of 0. 1 nm. The rheological properties of fluids such as microgels, emulsions, or self-assembling peptide solutions can be probed as a function of time and plate separation using small amplitude sinusoidal oscillations.
