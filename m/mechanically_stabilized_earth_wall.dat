40|$|Granular piles/stone columns {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} preferred ground engineering systems for improving a variety of weak soils, such as soft clays, loose sands, waste fills, and ash ponds. They are installed using a range of techniques, namely vibro compaction, vibro replacement, composer method, rammed stone columns, and geopiers, based on on-site conditions and availability of machinery. Granular piles improve the ground by densification especially in loose sands, by reinforcement in case of waste fills and ash ponds, by reinforcement and consolidation in case of soft clays, and mitigate damages from liquefaction by functioning as drains. The paper presents a critical review of developments related to granular piles encompassing recent analytical, experimental, numerical studies, and field investigations of their compressive, uplift, and seismic responses.

40|$|AbstractBack-to-back <b>mechanically</b> <b>stabilized</b> <b>earth</b> <b>walls</b> (BBMSEWs) are {{encountered}} in bridge approaches, ramp ways, rockfall protection systems, earth dams, levees and noise barriers. However, available design guidelines for BBMSEWs are limited and not applicable to numerical modeling when back-to-back walls {{interact with each}} other. The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate, using PLAXIS code, the effects of the reduction in the distance between BBMSEW, the reinforcement length, the quality of backfill material and the connection of reinforcements in the middle, when the back-to-back walls are close. The results indicate that each of the BBMSEWs behaves independently if the width of the embankment between <b>mechanically</b> <b>stabilized</b> <b>earth</b> <b>walls</b> is greater than that of the active zone. This is in good agreement with the result of FHWA design guideline. However, the results show that the FHWA design guideline underestimates the lateral earth pressure when back-to-back walls interact with each other. Moreover, for closer BBMSEWs, FHWA design guideline strongly overestimates the maximum tensile force in the reinforcement. The investigation of the quality of backfill material shows that the minor increase in embankment cohesion can lead to significant reductions in both the lateral earth pressure and the maximum tensile force in geosynthetic. When the distance between the two <b>earth</b> <b>walls</b> is close to zero, the connection of reinforcement between back-to-back walls significantly improves the factor of safety...|$|R

The other side, called <b>mechanically</b> <b>stabilized</b> <b>earth</b> <b>wall</b> (MSEW) with vertical segmental concrete facing, was reinforced with metallic reinforcement consisting of metallic strips (MS) and steel wire grids (SWG).
