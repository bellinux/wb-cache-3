5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Coffin to find a replacement to run the company {{so that he could}} return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding {{it would be impossible to}} maintain a profitable business.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 {{was further}} pushed back to October 2008 due to {{manufacturing}} delays on external tanks for future space shuttle missions. Lockheed Martin experienced delays during the production changes {{to make new}} external tanks with all the enhancements recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to produce two tanks for the STS-125 mission–one for Atlantis, and one for Endeavour for an emergency rescue mission, if necessary–in time for the original August launch date.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s and 1990s {{were a very}} unsafe {{time for}} bulk carriers. Many bulkers sank during this time, 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone. Most of these sinkings were sudden and quick, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the crew to escape: more than 650 sailors were lost during this same period. Due partly to the sinking of , a series of {{international}} safety resolutions regarding bulkers were adopted during the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Stone the Crow clearly sets Jacobsz {{aside in}} a league of his own, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> nearly <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> any other SA artist to produce a {{masterpiece}} even remotely similar or with the same magnitude.|$|R
5000|$|Increasing water {{consumption}} {{and use of}} flush toilet: Water flushing greatly increased the volume of sewage, {{at the same time}} diluting the nutrients, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> virtually <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to be recovered and reused as they previously were.|$|R
5|$|The French 7th Army, on the {{northern}} flank of the Belgian line, protected the Bruges–Ghent–Ostend axis and, covering the Channel ports, had advanced into Belgium and into the Netherlands with speed. It reached Breda in the Netherlands, on 11 May. But German parachute forces had seized the Moerdijk bridge on the Hollands Diep river, south of Rotterdam, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the French to link up with the Dutch Army. The Dutch Army withdrew north to Rotterdam and Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure {{of the government to}} thus provide adequate notice that the law would be enforced against such vessels was a violation of their right to due process.|$|E
5|$|On November 11, 2009, Cook was {{diagnosed}} with a parathyroid tumor in his neck. Doctors assessed that the tumor was pressing against his vocal cords <b>making</b> <b>it</b> virtually <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> him to perform. He was treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{overflow}} of the Arecibo River on October7, a neighborhood in Utuado {{was cut off}} from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide lugged a utility pole along the road, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> larger vehicles—including ambulances—to access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage {{and had to be}} evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the collapse of a bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens of families in their homes. Severe flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water {{in the wake of the}} storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.|$|E
5|$|Together with a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking {{that resulted in a}} plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped, and died of smoke inhalation, fell, jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One stairwell in the South Tower, Stairwell A, somehow avoided complete destruction, unlike the rest of the building. When Flight 11 hit, all three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone were destroyed, thus <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died.|$|E
5|$|Troude was wary on {{his arrival}} in the Leeward Islands on 29 March, refusing to {{approach}} Martinique and instead anchoring near the Îles des Saintes until {{the situation in the}} islands could be established. Before he could make contact with nearby Guadeloupe, he was discovered by patrolling British warships and a warning sent to Cochrane, who was on his flagship HMS Neptune off Martinique. Within hours Neptune was cruising off the Saintes, joined by the ships of the line HMS Pompee, HMS York, HMS Belleisle, HMS Captain, HMS Polyphemus and a number of smaller warships that could operate closer inshore. Blockading the Saintes was a difficult task: the French had three channels through which they could escape, too many to be effectively blocked by the forces at Cochrane's disposal. In addition, Troude's force could not be attacked directly, the width of the channels <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the British ships to attack in full strength.|$|E
50|$|Offshore 2 is an 8-metre Noosa Cat, {{popular with}} rescue crews {{such as the}} Water Police around Australia. The hull of the boat is {{separated}} into two sections both filled with foam; <b>making</b> <b>it</b> virtually <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the vessel to sink.|$|R

25|$|The club's relegation {{from the}} Scottish Premiership was {{confirmed}} on 5 April 2014. Hearts won 4–2 away to Partick Thistle, but St Mirren beat Motherwell 3–2, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Hearts to catch up.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{consider}} the Military Commissions Act of 2006 an amnesty law for crimes {{committed in the}} War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act. It abolished habeas corpus for foreign detainees, effectively <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.|$|E
25|$|Panicked {{by these}} arrests {{and the fear}} that it was {{compromised}} by informants, Dennis and other party leaders decided to go underground and to disband many affiliated groups.

25|$|The Military Commissions Act of 2006 {{is seen as}} {{an amnesty}} law for crimes {{committed}} in the War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act and by abolishing habeas corpus, effectively <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.|$|E
25|$|The Virginia Colony {{continued}} to grow and encroach on Powhatan land, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to sustain traditional practices.

50|$|Initially OurColony's general forums {{were set}} up to allow any user to delete any post or thread, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> almost <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> people to have steady and {{meaningful}} communications. This led many players to create forums outside the official site where communication could continue without disruption. The site's general and colony forums were eventually removed.|$|R
50|$|A rootkit is {{a program}} that uses low-level, hard-to-detect methods to subvert control of an {{operating}} system from its legitimate operators. Rootkits usually obscure their installation and attempt to prevent their removal through a subversion of standard system security. They may include replacements for system binaries, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> virtually <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to be detected by checking process tables.|$|R
25|$|The reforms {{would also}} favor {{existing}} unions by barring the board from considering {{more than one}} election petition {{at a time and}} tightening jurisdictional rules defining which labor organization can represent which workers, according to their craft, enterprise and company, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> some independent unions to challenge incumbents.|$|E
25|$|Lt. Cdr.
