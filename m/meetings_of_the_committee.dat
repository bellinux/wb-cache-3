2500|$|By {{the time}} Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, 1775, after his second mission to Great Britain, the American Revolution had begun—with {{fighting}} between colonials and British at Lexington and Concord. The New England militia had trapped the main British army in Boston. The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their {{delegate to the}} Second Continental Congress. In June 1776, he was appointed {{a member of the}} Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence.

2500|$|In 1955, the [...] Jewish Publication Society of America, {{aware that}} the Jewish {{community}} of the United States and English-speaking Jews everywhere needed a translation of the Bible more intelligible and accurate than the 1917 Bible in general use, appointed a committee of seven scholars to prepare a new translation. [...] The {{members of the committee}} were “chosen for scholarly ability, broad outlook, and recognized status in the community at large.” Bamberger, {{as a member of the}} Central Conference of American Rabbis, was asked to represent the Reform perspective. [...] In addition to his work as a translator (he prepared the initial draft of the Book of Jeremiah), he presided over <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee,</b> his objectivity, fair-mindedness, and ability to defuse tensions being important assets in dealing with divergent and sometimes passionate views of the committee members.

2500|$|The {{criteria}} adopted {{for many}} of the mental disorders were taken from the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) and Feighner Criteria, which had just been developed by a group of research-orientated psychiatrists based primarily at Washington University in St. Louis and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Other criteria, and potential new categories of disorder, were established by consensus during <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee,</b> as chaired by Spitzer. A key aim was to base categorization on colloquial English descriptive language (which would be easier to use by federal administrative offices), rather than assumptions of cause, although its categorical approach assumed each particular pattern of symptoms in a category reflected a particular underlying pathology (an approach described as [...] "neo-Kraepelinian"). The psychodynamic or physiologic view was abandoned, in favor of a regulatory or legislative model. A new [...] "multiaxial" [...] system attempted to yield a picture more amenable to a statistical population census, rather than just a simple diagnosis. Spitzer argued that [...] "mental disorders are a subset of medical disorders" [...] but the task force decided on the DSM statement: [...] "Each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome." [...] The personality disorders were placed on axis II along with mental retardation.|$|E
60|$|Herbert, {{enrolled}} in the same section with his employer {{and one or two}} fellow-clerks, had participated in the <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> with the light-heartedness and irresponsibility of youth, regretting only the loss of his usual walk with Cherry and the hours that kept him from her house. He was returning from a protracted meeting one night, when the number of arrests and searching for proscribed and suspected characters had been so large as to induce fears of organized resistance and rescue, and on reaching the foot of the hill found it already so late, that to avoid disturbing the family he resolved to enter his room directly by the door in the side street. On inserting his key in the lock it met with some resisting obstacle, which, however, yielded and apparently dropped on the mat inside. Opening the door and stepping into the perfectly dark apartment, he trod upon this object, which proved to be another key. The family must have procured it for their convenience during his absence, and after locking the door had carelessly left it in the lock. It was lucky that it had yielded so readily.|$|E
