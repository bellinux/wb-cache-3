50|$|Restoring {{native plants}} and {{removing}} invasive plant species helps restore the native habitat. This is important since numerous organisms rely on native plants {{for food and}} protection. Invasive plants upset the ecosystem by crowding out and out-competing native vegetation. The invasive plants are removed by either spraying herbicide or by <b>manual</b> <b>pulling.</b> Native plants are then planted to restore the habitat.|$|E

50|$|At 2:15 AM on Saturday, 23 January 1904, {{the initial}} alarm was {{received}} from a <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> station. Shortly afterwards the fire watchtower observed {{an open fire}} in {{the lower part of}} the Strandgate. Almost simultaneously another <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> station signal alarm was received from the Kråsbys area. Two fire crews were dispatched immediately.|$|R

5000|$|The novel {{has four}} parts: [...] "De zaaidhede" [...] ("the sowing"), [...] "De wiedsters" [...] ("the weed removers"), [...] "Bloei" [...] ("flowering"), and [...] "De slijting" [...] (the <b>manual</b> <b>pulling</b> of the flax without {{removal of the}} roots). It is {{situated}} on a prosperous farm of flax growers. The main focus is {{the conflict between the}} old farmer Vermeulen and his son and successor Louis, culminating in a row where the farmer badly beats his son, eventually resulting in his death.|$|E
50|$|Control {{of white}} bryony usually {{involves}} <b>manual</b> <b>pulling</b> and very frequent removal of new growth; diligence being {{the key to}} success. Plants may be killed manually by severing the roots 7 - 10 cm below ground surface to remove the crown and prevent re-sprouting. Tillage is often ineffective and can harm host plant roots, but broadleaf herbicides such as glyphosate can be useful when care is taken not to spray host plant leaves. Multiple applications are necessary to eventually move herbicide to the root and block production of new shoots. The dispersed seeds are viable for many years, so manually removing B. alba before seed production is important.|$|E
50|$|A typical Gravity racer cart {{is usually}} made of steel, and has 4 wheels, {{arranged}} as a fixed rear axle, and a steerable front beam axle - usually {{with a very}} simple single central pivot. A seat is arranged at the back, and perhaps the seat area is enclosed, as in the original soap-box design. More sophisticated designs might employ a fully enclosed body. The types of wheels employed vary according to what can be obtained easily - wheels from baby carriages, pushchairs, prams, and discarded bicycles being common. Ready-made wheels are also available from hardware suppliers. Steering is typically actuated using a rope connected {{to the ends of}} the steerable beam (which can then double as a useful <b>manual</b> <b>pulling</b> device).|$|E
50|$|Fire-Lite Alarms is an American company {{owned by}} Honeywell and based in Northford, Connecticut.

5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "Fire" [...] or [...] "General Alarm". This {{indicator}} is lit when an alarm condition {{exists in the}} system, initiated by smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler flow switches, <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> stations, <b>manual</b> call points, or otherwise. Along with the indicator on the panel, notification appliances, such as horns and strobes, are also activated, signaling a need to evacuate to building occupants. In an alarm condition, the fire alarm panel indicates where the alarm originated. The alarm panel can be reset once the device which initiated the alarm is reset, such as returning the handle of a <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> station to its normal position.|$|R
50|$|Operation - Activation of a {{fire alarm}} {{initiating}} device, or a <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> station, signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flows from all sprinklers simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of cooperative luminescence in seven different compositions of Yb 2 O 3 doped tellurite glasses. High refractive index (~ 2. 0) and large transmission window (360 - 6000 nm) are characteristics of the glasses studied. The emission measured in the visible region, centered at 500 nm, is a strong indication of the presence of the cooperative luminescence; The cooperative luminescence was also measured in glass fibers prepared by <b>manual</b> <b>pulling</b> in one of the compositions studied (TeO 2 -ZnO) ...|$|E
40|$|The fellmongery process {{involves}} {{the removal of}} wool from sheep and lamb skins prior to tanning. The pelts also must be free from epidermic, sweat and fat glands, muscle tissue, blood vessels, fat cells and collagen fibrous tissue. The process consists of the following operations:- (1) Washing of pelts. (2) Lime/Na 2 S paint application. (3) Wool removal; <b>manual</b> <b>pulling.</b> (4) Lining; removal of residual wool, pelt conditioning, carried out in a "dolly" or drum.

Devices for manual fire alarm activation are installed to be readily located (near the exits), identified, and operated. They are usually actuated by means of physical interaction, such as pulling a lever or breaking glass.|$|R
50|$|Small {{outboard}} motors are frequently used as trolling motors on boats with much larger engines {{that do not}} operate as efficiently or quietly at trolling speeds. These typically are designed with a <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> start system, throttle and gearshift controls {{mounted on the body}} of the motor, and a tiller for steering, but in a trolling application, will be connected to the steering mechanism at the helm.|$|R
5000|$|A {{revolver}} houses cartridges in a {{rotary cylinder}} and rotates them in-line with the cylinder bore (actually a forcing cone) prior to each shot. Revolvers {{are most often}} handguns, however examples of rifles and shotguns and cannon have been made. The cylinder is most often rotated by manipulation of the trigger and/or hammer, although some are [...] "double action" [...] using the <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> of the trigger to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer.|$|R
40|$|Endobutton, the graft is {{pretensioned}} in situ by repetitive <b>manual</b> <b>pulls</b> at 15 – 20 ° of flexion, {{monitoring the}} graft ten-sion with tensioners on a tensioning boot {{installed on the}} calf. Tibial fixation with pullout sutures is achieved using Double Spike Plate and a screw at the pre-determined amount of tension of 10 – 20 N. While better outcomes with less failure rate are being obtained compared {{to those in the}} past, higher graft tear rate remains a problem. Improved preventive training may be required to avoid secondary ACL injuries...|$|R
50|$|This resets {{the panel}} after an alarm condition. All {{initiating}} devices are reset, and {{the panel is}} cleared of any alarm conditions. If an initiating device is still in alarm after the system is reset, such as a smoke detector continuing to sense smoke or a <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> station still in an activated position, another alarm will be initiated, or in some cases, the panel will refuse to reset until all the alarms have been reset/cleared. A system reset is often required to clear supervisory conditions. A system reset does not usually clear trouble conditions. Most trouble conditions will clear automatically when conditions are returned to normal.|$|R
50|$|The Cherry Grove Fire Department (CGFD) {{is a low}} {{incident}} department. The CGFD {{also has}} pull stations located at every other street corner where unique hose houses contain vital equipment that would be needed by the members to suppress any fire; {{this is due to}} the unique nature of Cherry Grove. There are no roads, only boardwalks, hence no ability to respond with a fire engine. If a fire or emergency is spotted, one should call 911 or run to the nearest street corner and pull the lever down. A fire siren is activated, which alerts the members to respond. CGFD is one of the few fire departments in New York that still uses a <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> station system.|$|R

50|$|A {{fire alarm}} pull station {{is an active}} fire {{protection}} device, usually wall-mounted, that, when activated, initiates an alarm on a fire alarm system. In its simplest form, the user activates the alarm by pulling the handle down, which completes a circuit and locks the handle in the activated position, sending an alarm to the fire alarm control panel. After operation, most fire alarm pull stations must be restored to the ready position using a special tool or key {{in order for the}} panel to be reset. Primitive manual stations, requiring only a single action or hand motion to activate, can be subject to unwanted activation by jarring or accidental contact. Early strategies to cope with this problem included requiring the operator to break a pane of glass to release an internal spring-operated mechanism. <b>Manual</b> <b>pull</b> stations that require two hand motions, such as lift up and pull down, or push in and pull down, have since replaced the break-glass and single-action models in many modern installations.|$|R
40|$|Full text : [URL] audienceThis paper {{reports on}} the {{integration}} of thick carbon-polydimethylsiloxane (C-PDMS) electrodes in microfluidic systems for electrokinetic operations. The C-PDMS material, obtained by mixing carbon nanopowder and PDMS, preserves PDMS processing properties such as O 2 plasma activation and soft-lithography patternability in thick or 3 D electrodes. Conductivity {{in the order of}} 10 S m− 1 was reached for a carbon concentration of 25 wt%. To evaluate the adhesion between PDMS and C-PDMS, we prepared bi-material strips and carried out a <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> test. The cohesion and robustness of C-PDMS were also evaluated by applying a large range of electric field conditions from dc to ac (300 kHz). No damage to the electrodes or release of carbon was noticed. The use of such a material for electrokinetic manipulation was validated on polystyrene particles and cells. Here, we demonstrate that C-PDMS seems to be a valuable technological solution for electrokinetic in microfluidic and particularly for biological applications such as cell electrofusion, lysis and trapping, which are favored by uniform lateral electric fields across the microchannel section...|$|R
50|$|The Skyhook {{system can}} also cause complications. One such {{incident}} was captured on video, where a spinning main caused a Skyhook to severely twist the reserve. A standard RSL or <b>manual</b> reserve <b>pull</b> would have taken longer to deploy—but a reserve pilot chute would have pulled the reserve freebag upwards, rather than spinning and entangling it. Due to the increased risk of spinning malfunctions, the use of Skyhooks with high-performance canopies remains an active area of discussion.|$|R
50|$|Most rotary push mowers are {{powered by}} {{internal}} combustion engines. Such engines are usually four-stroke engines, used for their greater torque and cleaner combustion (although {{a number of}} older models used two-stroke engines), running on gasoline (petrol) or other liquid fuels. Internal combustion engines used with lawn mowers normally have only one cylinder. Power generally ranges from four to seven horsepower. The engines usually have a carburetor and require a <b>manual</b> <b>pull</b> crank to start them, although an electric starter is offered on some models, particularly large riding and commercial mowers. Some mowers have a throttle control on the handlebar with which the operator can adjust the engine speed. Other mowers have a fixed, pre-set engine speed. All are equipped with an air vane style of governor to maintain the pre-selected speed when the force needed to cut the thicker or taller grass is encountered. Gasoline mowers have the advantages over electric mowers of greater power and distance range. They do create {{a significant amount of}} pollution due to the combustion in the engine, and their engines require periodic maintenance such as cleaning or replacement of the spark plug and air filter, and changing the engine oil.|$|R
50|$|In golf, both <b>manual</b> push or <b>pull</b> and {{electric}} golf trolleys {{are designed to}} carry a golfers bag, clubs and other equipment. Also, the golf cart, car, or buggy, is a powered vehicle that carries golfers and their equipment around a golf course faster and with less effort than walking.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} golf trolley is {{an electric}} cart (a battery-powered cart) {{that is designed}} to carry a golf bag, complete with clubs and other golf equipment.

50|$|An {{aero engine}} inertia starter uses a pre-rotated {{flywheel}} to transfer kinetic {{energy to the}} crankshaft, normally through reduction gears and a clutch to prevent over-torque conditions. Three variations have been used, hand driven, electrically driven and a combination of both. When the flywheel is fully energised either a <b>manual</b> cable is <b>pulled</b> or a solenoid is used to engage the starter.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAnatomic ACL {{reconstruction}} is {{the reasonable}} approach to restore stability without loss of motion after ACL tear. To mimic the normal ACL like a ribbon, our preferred procedures is the anatomic rectangular tunnel (ART) technique with a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) graft or the anatomic triple bundle (ATB) procedure with a hamstring (HS) tendon graft. It {{is important to}} create tunnel apertures inside the attachment areas to lessen the tunnel widening. To identify the crescent-shaped ACL femoral attachment area, the upper cartilage margin, the posterior cartilage margin and the resident’s ridge are used as landmarks. To delineate the C-shaped tibial insertion, medial intercondylar ridge, Parson’s knob and anterior horn of the lateral meniscus are helpful. In ART-BTB procedure which is suitable for male patients engaged in contact sports, the parallelepiped tunnels with rectangular apertures are made within the femoral and tibial attachment areas. In ATBHS technique which is mainly applied to female athletes engaged in non-contact sports including skiing or basketball, 2 femoral and 3 tibial round tunnels are created inside the attachment areas. These techniques {{make it possible for}} the grafts to run as the native ACL without impingement to the notch or PCL. After femoral fixation with an interference screw or cortical fixation devices including Endobutton, the graft is pretensioned in situ by repetitive <b>manual</b> <b>pulls</b> at 15 – 20 ° of flexion, monitoring the graft tension with tensioners on a tensioning boot installed on the calf.
