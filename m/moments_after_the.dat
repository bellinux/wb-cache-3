5|$|In 2014, BOOM! Studios began {{publishing}} an Escape From New York {{comic book}} by writer, Christopher Sebela. The {{first issue of}} the series was released on December 3, 2014 and the story picks up <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> end of the film.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{two planes}} collided, the only mayday {{distress}} call radioed by the United Airlines crew was heard at 8:30a.m. plus 20 seconds. The crippled airlinernow missing about eight feet (2.5 m) of its right wingtrailed black smoke and flames as it spiraled earthward, {{and crashed into}} a then-empty patch of desert outside the town of Arden {{in what is now}} the unincorporated town of Enterprise. The nearly vertical impact and subsequent explosion instantly killed everyone on board.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> drill is stopped, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E

5|$|Descent 3 {{takes place}} in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a {{mercenary}} working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> events of Descent II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very last moment, the Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team.|$|E
5|$|The last of {{the murders}} in the Whitechapel file was {{committed}} on Friday 13 February 1891 when prostitute Frances Coles was murdered under a railway arch. Her body was found by PC Ernest Thompson only <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> attack at 2:15am at Swallow Gardens, a passageway under a railway arch between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street, Whitechapel. Minor wounds {{on the back of}} her head suggest that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut at least twice, from left to right and then back again. Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body. Superintendent Arnold and Inspector Reid arrived soon afterwards from the nearby Leman Street police station, and Chief Inspectors Donald Swanson and Henry Moore, who had been involved in the previous murder investigations, arrived by 5am. A man named James Sadler, who had been seen with Coles earlier, was arrested by the police and charged with her murder. A high-profile investigation by Swanson and Moore into Sadler's past history and his whereabouts at the time of the previous Whitechapel murders indicates that the police may have suspected him to be the Ripper. However, Sadler was released on 3 March for lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Link is told by {{the priest}} in the {{sanctuary}} that Agahnim, a wizard who has usurped the throne, is planning to break a seal made {{hundreds of years ago}} by the Seven Sages. The seal was placed to imprison a dark wizard named Ganon in the Dark World, a near-mirror of Hyrule which was once known as the Sacred Realm before Ganon invaded it, obtained the legendary Triforce held there, and used its power to turn the realm into a land of darkness. Agahnim intends to break the seal by sending the descendants of the Seven Sages who made the seal into the Dark World. The only thing that can defeat Agahnim is the Master Sword, a sword that can only be wielded by the chosen hero and forged to combat evil. To prove that he is worthy to wield it, Link needs three magic pendants, hidden in dungeons guarded by mythical defenders. On his way to retrieve the first, he meets an elder, Sahasrahla, who becomes Link's mentor, offering hints and advice at key stages of the journey. After retrieving the pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword. As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that soldiers of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying Sanctuary keeper that Zelda has been taken to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda to the Dark World. Link then faces Agahnim in battle and defeats him, but Agahnim's last act is to send Link to the Dark World as well.|$|E

25|$|On October 11, 1979, a {{security}} guard shot and wounded a visitor <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> man scuffled with guards and reportedly made a furtive move as though reaching for a weapon. The shooting {{was found to be}} justifiable.|$|E
25|$|Later {{authorities}} confiscated {{a computer}} from Bishop's parents' house {{to try to}} determine a motive for the incident. <b>Moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> incident, President George W. Bush was briefly informed about the incident and two unrelated crashes that same day.|$|E
25|$|Three {{other news}} {{helicopters}} from other stations (KSAZ, KPNX and KPHO) {{were in the}} area and within seconds began reporting on the crash.

25|$|Caravaggio did {{several pieces}} {{depicting}} the <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> event depicted here. One {{of these is}} on display in London's National Gallery; the other, in the Royal Palace of Madrid. It is believed {{that one of these}} may be the image that Caravaggio was said to have sent in an effort to appease Alof de Wignacourt, Grand Master of the Knights who expelled Caravaggio, but this is not certainly known.|$|E
25|$|Yet another model {{involves}} a dense stellar cluster undergoing core-collapse as the negative heat {{capacity of the}} system drives the velocity dispersion in the core to relativistic speeds. Finally, primordial black holes may have been produced directly from external pressure in the first <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Big Bang. Formation of black holes from {{the deaths of the}} first stars has been extensively studied and corroborated by observations. The other models for black hole formation listed above are theoretical.|$|E
25|$|According to Vutichai Singhamany, {{a safety}} {{director}} at Thailand's Department of Civil Aviation, the pilot had deployed {{the landing gear}} on approach to Phuket airport runway 27, but had retracted it while attempting a go-around. Singhamany added that the wheels had not touched the runway and that the accident had happened <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> pilot raised {{the nose of the}} aircraft to abort the landing. It appears that the plane was caught in wind shear, causing it to sink abruptly.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> crash, the cockpit crew told flight attendants to delay {{evacuating}} the aircraft {{as they were}} communicating with the tower. A flight attendant seated at the second door {{on the left side}} (door 2L) observed fire outside the aircraft near row 10 and informed the cockpit crew, at which point the evacuation order was given some 90 seconds after the aircraft came to rest. Flight attendants told NTSB investigators that there was no fire inside the cabin when the evacuation began.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} agenda rossa, the red notebook {{in which}} Borsellino {{used to write}} down details of his investigations and which he always carried on his person, disappeared from the site in the <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> explosion. A carabinieri officer who was present when the explosion occurred reported he had delivered the notebook to Giuseppe Ayala, the first Palermo magistrate {{to arrive at the}} scene. Ayala, who said he had refused to receive it, was later criticized for saying escorts to anti-mafia judges should be reduced, despite evidence of further failed attempts on them in subsequent years.|$|E
25|$|Two {{shopping}} centres {{adjacent to}} Dawson, Place Alexis Nihon and Westmount Square, {{directly linked to}} the Atwater metro station, were evacuated and the green line of the Montreal Metro was shut down for several hours between Lionel-Groulx and McGill. The Pepsi Forum entertainment centre, opposite the eastern corner of Dawson, was open when {{many of the students}} came running into the premises to seek refuge <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> shooting began. Shortly afterward, the Pepsi Forum went into lockdown under the directives of the Montreal Police. Eventually, one of the Forum's entrances onto St. Catherine Street re-opened under police/security guard to allow monitored access and egress.|$|E

25|$|The game begins <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} {{original}} MDK. Believing they had vanquished the alien invaders, Kurt Hectic, Dr. Hawkins and Max are shocked to find a single Minecrawler remains. Kurt heads to destroy it, but upon doing so, encounters a massive alien called Shwang Shwing, who reveals the invasion of Earth is far from over. The main difference between MDK and MDK2 {{is the ability to}} control three playable characters (Kurt, Hawkins and Max), each with their own strengths and weaknesses. As such, the variety of gameplay in the sequel is more varied than in {{the original}} game, with more emphasis on platforming and puzzles than straight run-and-gun shooting.|$|E
25|$|Ties That Bind {{was first}} {{referred}} to in late 2004, when Midway Games released an earnings statement in which it spoke of the financial success of the first game. No other information was revealed at the time, {{other than the fact}} that a sequel was in development. On January 19, 2005, Midway revealed the game would be released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and was being developed by Surreal Software, the same team who had worked on the first game. They also announced the title, and revealed the game would begin <b>moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> end of the first game, but the intro sequence would depend on which ending the player received in the first game, assuming they still had a saved game file.|$|E
25|$|Just {{minutes before}} the murder, Sheriff's Deputy Don Welch had driven by and spotted Lunsford {{speaking}} to the men. <b>Moments</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> murder, Welch witnessed the suspects speed past him in their vehicle. Welch immediately {{drove back to the}} spot where Lunsford had been and found his dead body. Welch radioed for help, and at around 2:00a.m., Chief Deputy Stanaland, another colleague of Lunsford, found them both. Stanaland noticed the video camera in Lunsford's cruiser. He rewound the video, watched it over and then made a copy of it. The three suspects, realizing Welch had spotted them, abandoned their vehicle {{less than a mile from}} the town of Garrison. They then fled on foot, taking the marijuana with them. Their vehicle was found later in the day.|$|E
