40|$|Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station (QCNPS), Unit 1, as {{a result}} of {{suspected}} steam dryer degradation. The degradation was suspected due to noted increases in <b>moisture</b> <b>carryover</b> and corresponding changes in main steam flow. Following reactor vessel disassembly, EGC completed detailed inspections of 100 % of the accessible exterior and interior areas of the QCNPS Unit 1 steam dryer. Details of the inspections were discussed with the NRC in a conference call on November 20, 2003. It was identified during the November 13, 2003, initial inspection that a portion of the damaged steam dryer outer hood bank was missing. The original size of the loose part is approximately 6. 5 " x 9. 0 " x 0. 5 ", and it is unknown if the part remained as a single piece or broke into multiple pieces. In a conference call with the NRC on November 25, 2003, EGC discussed the comprehensive inspections that have been performed in an attempt to locate the missing dryer material. To date, the specific location of the missing dryer material has not been identified. An evaluation addressing safety and operational concerns has been performed by General Electric (GE), and reviewed and accepted by EGC, to support plant operation {{for the remainder of the}} current operating cycle without recovery of the loose part.

40|$|The Budyko {{curve is}} often used to {{estimate}} the actual evaporation {{as a function of the}} aridity index in a catchment. Different empirical equations exist to describe this relationship; however, these equations have very limited physical background. The model concept presented in this paper is physically based and uses only measurable parameters. It makes use of two types of evaporation: interception and transpiration. It assumes that interception can be modeled as a threshold process on a daily time scale. If multiplied with the rainfall distribution function, integrated, and multiplied with the expected number of rain days per month, the monthly interception is obtained. In a similar way, the monthly interception can be upscaled to annual interception. Analogous to the interception process, transpiration can be modeled as a threshold process at a monthly time scale and can be upscaled by integration and multiplication with the expected number of rain months. The expected rain days permonth are modeled in two ways: as a fixed proportion of the monthly rainfall and as a power function based on Markov properties of rainfall. The latter is solved numerically. It appears that on an annual basis the analytical model does not differ much from the numerical solution. Hence, the analytical model is used and applied on 10 locations in different climates. This paper shows that the empirical Budyko curve can be constructed on the basis of measurable parameters representing evaporation threshold values and the expected number of rain days and rain months and, in addition, a monthly <b>moisture</b> <b>carryover</b> amount for semiarid zones.

40|$|After the Great East Tohoku Earthquake of 2011, {{operations}} at three critical reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi site were disrupted. All three reactor plants had automatic shutdowns. After a reactor is shutdown from power, decay heat {{must continue to}} be removed for several hours. The earthquake caused electrical equipment disruption which interrupted power supply from off-site. In Unit 2, emergency diesel generators and battery power were also affected. This interruption of on-site and off-site power affected operability of decay heat removal systems. In Unit 2, the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling System (RCIC) was an installed means of removing decay heat. The RCIC System uses a tangential flow impulse turbine called a Terry turbine to power a pump, which directs cooling water into the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV). Though DC and AC power were unavailable, the RCIC System was able to operate for 70 hours. One reason for this may be lowered efficiency due to <b>moisture</b> <b>carryover</b> in the steam line. The events of the plants which were operating at Fukushima Daiichi have been modelled using several computational codes. Instrument data is limited due {{to the loss of}} electrical power, so assumptions were necessary. To more fully understand the events of Fukushima Daiichi Unit 2, it was desired to investigate the performance of a tangential flow impulse turbine under two-phase flow conditions. Estimation techniques have been made of the effect of two-phase injection on turbine performance, but these were also tested for this unique turbine design. A Terry turbine similar to those used in the RCIC Systems was installed in an experimental facility. The facility was equipped to inject compressed air or steam, along with a water component, into the inlet of the turbine. The turbine shaft work was measured by a water brake dynamometer. Dry and wet mixes from 60 g/s to 0 g/s were injected into the turbine down to the lower limit of operability. Torque, shaft work, and isentropic efficiency were obtained for 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 shaft revolutions per minute (RPM). The steam tests produced higher shaft work and torque than the air tests due to the higher enthalpy content of steam. Air, however, achieved similar isentropic efficiency to the steam tests. The 1912 approximations of Baumann for low-quality steam had good agreement with the results from tests using the wet mixes...|$|E
