5|$|In 1999, the Yankees and Red Sox {{faced each}} other {{for the first time in}} the ALCS.

The Yankees won the first game of the ALCS against the Red Sox on a 10th-inning walk-off home run by Bernie Williams off Boston reliever Rod Beck. The game was the first actual postseason <b>meeting</b> <b>between</b> the rivals because the one-game playoff in 1978 technically counted as a regular season game. Intensity built up due to this historic, first-ever postseason <b>meeting</b> <b>between</b> the two longtime rivals. The Yankees would win the first two games at home with 7th-inning comebacks.|$|E

5|$|Buckler {{suggests}} the following: According to the Athenian politician Demosthenes, Kersebleptes met Philip at Maroneia (in Thrace), {{together with the}} Theban general Pammenes, and came to an agreement with Philip; furthermore, he states that Amadokos was hostile to Philip at the time. Demosthenes says that the Athenian general Chares filed the report about the <b>meeting</b> <b>between</b> Philip, Pammenes and Kersebleptes; and Polyaenus says that after Philip's Maroneia campaign, Chares ambushed Philip's fleet {{off the coast of}} Neapolis. Since it is recorded that Neapolis appealed to Athens for aid against Philip in 355 BC, it is a strong possibility that these events all took place in 355 BC. It is not entirely clear what occasioned this <b>meeting</b> <b>between</b> Philip and Kersebleptes; Buckler suggests that Philip and Kersebleptes agreed to divide Thrace between them, leaving Kersebleptes free to attack the other Thracian kings (to try to reunite the Thracian kingdom), and leaving Philip free to campaign elsewhere.|$|E
