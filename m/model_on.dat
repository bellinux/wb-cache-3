5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3, is a {{painting}} by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The work shows two women dressed in white, one sitting on a sofa and the other resting on the floor. The <b>model</b> <b>on</b> the sofa is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. By calling the painting Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler intended to emphasise his artistic philosophy of corresponding arts, inspired by the poet Charles Baudelaire. The presence of a fan on the floor shows the influence of Japonisme, which was a popular artistic trend in European art at the time. Whistler was also greatly influenced by his colleague and friend Albert Joseph Moore, and their works show considerable similarities.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, {{the first}} Miss World contest (originally the Festival Bikini Contest), was {{organized}} by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains {{the first and last}} Miss World to be crowned in her bikini, a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls, though she did not mind French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette (1947) and the <b>model</b> <b>on</b> a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 2000, Boeing {{launched}} its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn {{during the early}} 2000s. The first model {{to emerge from the}} program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the <b>model</b> <b>on</b> March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 {{film was}} also tied into the books. A novelization {{of the movie}} was written {{to look like the}} older books. Two books were also written for the Girl Detective and Clue Crew series that deal with a mystery on a movie set. In 2008, the Girl Detective series was re-branded into trilogies and to have a <b>model</b> <b>on</b> the cover. The mysteries became deeper, with Nancy often making mistakes. These trilogies were also met with {{negative}} fan reception due to Nancy's constant mistakes, shortness of the books, and lack of action. With the new trilogy format, sales began slipping. Simon & Schuster then cut back from six to four books per year. In December 2011, they finally announced that the series was cancelled along with the Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers series.|$|E
5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, {{the number of}} copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher <b>model.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{have worked}} to {{understand}} these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks, which can be simulated using computers. Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than {{the details of how}} they are implemented in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons. No <b>model</b> <b>on</b> any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.|$|E
