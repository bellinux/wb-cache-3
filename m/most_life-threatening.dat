5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. <b>Most</b> <b>life-threatening</b> complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|The European Commission {{expects that}} {{approximately}} 500,000children under age5 in Burkina Faso will suffer from acute malnutrition in 2015, including around 149,000 who will suffer from its <b>most</b> <b>life-threatening</b> form. Rates of micronutrient deficiencies are also high. According to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS2010), 49percent {{of women and}} 88percent of {{children under the age}} of five suffer from anemia. Forty percent of infant deaths can be attributed to malnutrition, and in turn, these infant mortality rates have decreased Burkina Faso's total work force by 13.6percent, demonstrating how food security affects more aspects of life beyond health.|$|E
500|$|..... a basic {{principle}} of triage {{is to treat}} victims having the <b>most</b> <b>life-threatening</b> injuries first with available medical resources and to utilize limited medical personnel {{in a manner that}} will provide maximum effectiveness. However, the Safety Board is also aware that in recent years a number of victims of cold water drowning have been successfully resuscitated. They survived after periods of underwater, including sea water, as long as one hour or more. In view of these facts, the Safety Board believes that all emergency response organizations should review their emergency plans to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained personnel arrive to perform CPR, even during mass casualty/triage incidents, regardless of whether vital signs are present, especially if cold-water immersion/near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not indicate death.|$|E

50|$|Complications include pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade, pleuritis, and {{pulmonary}} infiltration. Of these {{cardiac tamponade}} is the <b>most</b> <b>life-threatening</b> complication. The pericardial fluid increases intra-pericardial pressure therefore preventing complete {{expansion of the}} atria and the ventricles upon the diastole. This causes equilibration of the pressure in all four heart chambers, and results in the common findings of the tamponade which are pulsus paradoxus, Beck's triad of hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and JVD, as well as EKG or Holter monitor findings such as electrical alternans. Physically the patients who progress to severe pericardial tamponade obtundate, become mentally altered, and lethargic. If left untreated, severe cardiac output decrease, vascular collapse, and hypoperfusion of body including the brain results in death.|$|E

After the Second Chechen War ended, President Vladimir Putin ordered Chechnya's restoration under Russia's governance, {{which was the}} source of opposition in the surrounding areas. Rivalries between Chechnya and Ingushetia made it difficult for journalists to report on political issues and were threatened. According to The International Federation of Journalists, {{this is one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>life-threatening</b> regions for any journalist to report in. Ali Astamirov was just one of the hundreds of correspondents who were abducted as a result of the conflict.
