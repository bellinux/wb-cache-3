QPR was replaced in the following season's European competition by a First Division side.|$|E
5|$|The main medieval Germanic {{cognates}} (words of {{a common}} origin) of elf are Old Norse alfr, plural alfar, and Old High German alp, plural alpî, elpî (alongside the feminine elbe).

5|$|Most early {{theories}} of gamma-ray bursts posited nearby sources within the Milky Way Galaxy. From 1991, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data {{that showed the}} distribution of GRBs is isotropic—not biased towards any particular direction in space. If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated {{in or near the}} galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts <b>must</b> <b>come</b> from beyond the Milky Way. However, some Milky Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic plumes at Pele and Loki in 1979 provided conclusive evidence that Io was geologically active. Generally, plumes form when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds {{of gas and}} dust. Additional materials that might {{be found in the}} volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. Although striking in appearance, volcanic plumes are relatively uncommon. Of the 150 or so active volcanoes observed on Io, plumes have only been observed at a couple of dozen of them. The limited area of Io's lava flows suggests that much of the resurfacing needed to erase Io's cratering record <b>must</b> <b>come</b> from plume deposits.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change <b>must</b> <b>come</b> gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E

As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they <b>must</b> <b>come</b> and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|The National Basketball Association's Sixth Man of the Year Award is {{an annual}} National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1982–83 NBA season to the league's best {{performing}} player {{for his team}} coming off the bench as a substitute (or sixth man). A panel of sportswriters and broadcasters from throughout the United States and Canada votes on the recipient. Each judge casts a vote for first, second and third place selections. Each first-place vote is worth five points; each second-place vote is worth three points; and each third-place vote is worth one point. The player with the highest point total, regardless {{of the number of}} first-place votes, wins the award. To be eligible for the award, a player <b>must</b> <b>come</b> off the bench in more games than he starts.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} the series is that Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a Slayer, endowed with superhuman {{strength}} to fight vampires and evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. In the fourth season, Buffy begins attending college, where she discovers that her psychology professor, Walsh, is a scientist for the Initiative. Adam is Dr. Walsh's horrible masterpiece, an allusion to Frankenstein's monster, whose first conscious act is killing his creator. Adam's search for understanding himself and his true nature, combined for his penchant for chaos, leads him to orchestrate a massacre between demons and humans, after which {{he will be able}} use body parts left over from the melee to create an army of monsters to set loose on Sunnydale. Buffy's effectiveness as a Slayer is increased because her close friends and family, called the Scooby Gang, assist her in her battles. By the end of season four the members of the group have become estranged and <b>must</b> <b>come</b> back together in order to defeat the apparently invincible Adam.|$|E

5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one <b>must</b> <b>come</b> to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes <b>must</b> <b>come</b> from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that <b>must</b> <b>come</b> to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E
