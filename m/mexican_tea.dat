6000|$|... "We haven't seen Sara Ray {{since you}} got sick. She is awful lonesome, and Judy says she cries {{nearly all the}} time but that is nothing new. I'm awful sorry for Sara but I'm glad I'm not her. She is going to write you a letter too. You'll let me see what she puts in it, won't you? You'd better take some <b>Mexican</b> <b>Tea</b> now. It's a great blood purifyer.|$|E
60|$|Felix had a sick spell {{soon after}} {{we began our}} dream books, and Aunt Janet essayed to cure him by {{administering}} a dose of liver pills which Elder Frewen had assured her were a cure-all for every disease the flesh is heir to. But Felix flatly refused to take liver pills; <b>Mexican</b> <b>Tea</b> he would drink, but liver pills he would not take, {{in spite of his}} own suffering and Aunt Janet's commands and entreaties. I could not understand his antipathy to the insignificant little white pellets, which were so easy to swallow; but he explained the matter to us in the orchard when he had recovered his usual health and spirits.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} that myself--but I CAN'T stay home, Cecily. It {{would be more than}} flesh and blood could endure. I MUST hear that missionary speak. They say he was all but eaten by cannibals once. Just think how many new stories I'd have to tell after I'd heard him! No, I must go, but I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll wear my school dress and hat. THAT will be penance. Felicity, when you set the table for dinner, put the broken-handled knife for me. I hate it so. And I'm going to take a dose of <b>Mexican</b> <b>Tea</b> every two hours. It's such dreadful tasting stuff--but it's a good blood purifier, so Aunt Janet can't object to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR EVERYBODY, BUT ESPECIALLY FELICITY:--I {{was awful}} {{glad to get}} your letters. It makes you real {{important}} to be sick, but the time seems awful long when you're getting better. Your letters were all great, but I liked Felicity's best, and next to hers the Story Girl's. Felicity, it will be awful {{good of you to}} send me things to eat and the rosebud plate. I'll be awful careful of it. I hope you won't catch the measles, for they are not nice, especially when they strike in, but you would look all right, even if you did have red spots on your face. I would like to try the <b>Mexican</b> <b>Tea,</b> because you want me to, but mother says no, she doesn't believe in it, and Burtons Bitters are a great deal healthier. If I was you I would get the velvet hood all right. The heathen live in warm countries so they don't want hoods.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mexican</b> <b>tea</b> {{culture is}} known for its {{traditional}} herbal teas which are reputed to have medicinal properties. In recent decades, imported tea beverages have also become popular in Mexico. <b>Mexican</b> <b>tea</b> recipes have grown in popularity beyond Mexico as well.|$|E

50|$|Epazote or <b>Mexican</b> <b>Tea</b> (Dysphania ambrosioides) and American {{wormseed}} (Dysphania anthelmintica) are medicinal herbs, Epazote {{is used as}} tea. They {{are also}} used als insecticides.|$|E
50|$|The {{wormseed}} plant itself (<b>Mexican</b> <b>tea)</b> {{is traditionally}} used in Mexican cuisine for flavoring dishes and preventing flatulence from bean-containing food. It {{is also part}} of tonic drinks and infusions to expel intestinal parasites and treat asthma, arthritis, dysentery, stomach ache, malaria, and nervous diseases in folk medicine practiced in North and South America, China, and Turkey.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} {{flavor of}} the Chilean tree boldo (Peumus boldus) primarily originates from ascaridole. Ascaridole is also {{a major component of}} epazote (or <b>Mexican</b> <b>tea,</b> Dysphania ambrosioides, formerly Chenopodium ambrosioides) where it typically constitutes between 16 and 70% of the plant's essential oil. The content of ascaridole in the plant depends on cultivation and is maximal when the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio in the soil is about 1:4. It also changes through the year peaking around the time when the plant seeds become mature.|$|E
50|$|Ascaridole is {{a natural}} organic {{compound}} classified as a bicyclic monoterpene that has an unusual bridging peroxide functional group. It is a colorless liquid with a pungent smell and taste that is soluble in most organic solvents. Like other low molecular weight organic peroxides, it is unstable and prone to explosion when heated or treated with organic acids. Ascaridole determines the specific flavor of the Chilean tree boldo and is a major constituent of the oil of <b>Mexican</b> <b>tea</b> (wormseed). It is a component of natural medicine, tonic drinks and food flavoring in Latin American cuisine. As part of the oil, ascaridole is used as an anthelmintic drug that expels parasitic worms from plants, domestic animals and the human body.|$|E
40|$|Biological invasions by alien (c. f. non-native, non-indigenous, foreign, exotic) {{species are}} {{recognised}} {{as a significant}} component of global environmental change, often resulting in a significant loss in the economic value, biological diversity and function of invaded ecosystems (Wittenberg and Cock 2001). Numerous alien species, many introduced {{only in the last}} 200 years ago, have become successfully established over large areas of Europe (Hulme 2007). Future global biodiversity scenarios highlight potentially dramatic increases in biological invasions in European ecosystems (Sala et al. 2000). Interacting effects through rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, warmer temperatures, greater nitrogen deposition, altered disturbance regimes and increased habitat fragmentation may facilitate further invasions (Vil√† et al. 2006). Early warning and prevention of the harmful impact of alien species on ecosystems is a fundamental requirement of the European Biodiversity Strategy and the EU Action Plan to 2010 and Beyond (European Commission 2006) yet, in the absence of reliable regional analyses, the European states have been unable to tackle this issue strategically (Miller et al. 2006; Hulme et al. 2007). In the United States, the cost of biological invasions has been estimated to total 97 billion hitherto for 79 major bioinvasions (Pimentel et al. 2001). Although only limited monetary data are available at present for Europe, there is a similar indication that biological invasions have imposed losses on the economy. The strongest evidence is for alien pest and weeds that impact upon the agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and other sectors (Williamson 2002). Examples of direct economic impacts include the damage caused by Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica to flood defences and the impact of bark stripping by grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis on forestry production. The western corn rootworm Diabrotica virgifera was accidentally introduced in the 1990 s into Serbia and is an important pest of maize and leads to yield losses. Preliminary studies on the potential of establishment of the western corn rootworm show that this pest is likely to survive and develop wherever maize is grown in Europe. Leaving aside introduced pests and diseases affecting agriculture, alien parasites such as Gyrodactylus salaris (an ectoparasite of Atlantic salmon) and Anguillicola crassus (swimbladder nematode of eels) have led to dramatic decreases in fisheries sector incomes in several Nordic countries. The American oyster drill Urosalpinx cinerea is an important gastropod pest of the cultured oyster industry as it feeds preferably on oyster spat and is recorded as consuming more than half the oyster spat in certain European estuaries (Cole 1942). The muskrat Ondatra zibethicus and coypu Myocastor coypus, both introduced by the European fur industry, damage river banks through digging and have increased the risk and severity of floods in many central and southern European countries. Notorious invasive alien weeds are of major economic significance, e. g., <b>Mexican</b> <b>tea</b> Chenopodium ambrosioides, knotgrass Paspalum paspaloides, Canadian horsew-eed Conyza canadensis, Bermuda buttercup Oxalis pes-caprae. While other alien plants act as hosts of plant pathogens e. g., rescuegrass Bromus catharticus as host for barley yellow dwarf virus and wheat stem rust. Invasive alien species can also affect human health e. g., phytophotodermatitis through contact with giant hog-weed Heracleum mantegazzianum, asthma and hay-fever arising from the pollen of annual ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia, poisoning of humans through consumption of toxic fruit e. g., American pokeweed Phytolacca americana, silverleaf nightshade Solanum elaeagnifolium, or leptospirosis spread by the brown rat Rattus norvegicus. ...|$|E
