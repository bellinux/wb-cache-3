50|$|An area {{variance}} is {{the most}} common type. It can be requested by a builder or landowner when an odd configuration of the land, or sometimes the physical improvements (structures) on the land, requires a relaxation of the applicable regulations to avoid denying the landowner the same rights and use of the property enjoyed by owners of neighboring properties. A textbook example would be a house built on an oddly-shaped lot. If the odd shape of the lot makes it onerous for the landowner or builder to comply with the standard building setbacks specified in the code, a variance could be requested to allow a reduced setback. Another would be a house built on a sloping lot. If the slope of the lot makes it onerous to comply with the height limit—typically due to the way the <b>municipality's</b> <b>code</b> requires height to be measured—then a variance could be requested for a structure of increased height because of the special conditions on the lot.|$|R

40|$|It is wellknown that {{communities}} {{can influence the}} mental health of their inhabitants. Furthermore, not all inhabitants experience these community effects in a similar manner. The present study aims to explore the gender differential effects of work and income related community features. Research in related areas often states that gender differences in mental health result from women and men showing a differential vulnerability and exposure to stressors. In addition, the differential expression hypothesis states that the expression of distress is gendered: while women show more internalisaling problems, such as depression, men are more prone to externalising problems, such as problem drinking. Pooled data from the multistaged stratified cluster samples of the Belgian Health and Interview Surveys 2001 and 2004 were linked with data derived from the Socio-Economic Survey from 2001. The population sample was restricted to respondents of 15 years or more, consisting of 10092 men and 11284 women, inhabitating 590 <b>municipality</b> <b>codes.</b> Design and population weight were applied. Linear multilevel analyses in SPSS were used to examine the influence on the frequency and severity of complaints of depression (SCL- 90 -R) and alcohol dependence (CAGE). At the individual level, labour market situation, social support (MOS), education, age, composition and equivalent income of the household were taken into account; {{at the level of the}} municipality unemployment rates, mean household income, an indicator of income inequality, and population density were added and gender specific interactions were tested. Results show consistent and profound effects of the employment rate of the municipality on the occurrence of depression and 70 drinkingproblems. In general, community effects exert a stronger impact on {{the mental health of}} women. Moreover, the expression of distress caused by higher unemployment rates is gendered...|$|R
40|$|Background: Postpartum {{depression}} is a transient mood that starts within four weeks {{up to one}} year after delivery, and is an important cause of morbidity and life threatening condition varying from 8 % to 36 % among women worldwide. Objectives: This study sought to assess prevalence of depressive symptoms and the associated risk factors among postpartum mothers attending reproductive health and child health clinics. Methods: Using a cross-sectional methodology, 309 postpartum mothers aged 15 to 45 years delivered within one month to one year within the study period were conveniently enrolled from Sinza and Magomeni Health Centres (Kinondoni <b>Municipality).</b> <b>Coded</b> structured Kiswahili questionnaires were used to collect demographic data and an adapted "SONONA questionnaire" by the Ministry of Health and Social welfare was used to screen for depressive symptoms. Data entry and analysis was done using the SPSS version IS. Results: Out of 309 postpartum mothers, 53 (17. 2 %) mothers {{were found to have}} symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD). The overall prevalence of PPD symptoms was 17. 2 %; 95 % Cl (13. 0 - 21. 4). Prevalence for Magomeni Health Centre was 16. 9 % (n= 21); 95 % Cl (10. 3 - 23. 5) and for Sinza was 17. 3 % (n= 32); 95 % Cl (11. 9 - 22. 8). On multivariate analysis, factors associated with PPD symptoms were; poor relationship with in-laws, poor relationship with husband, miscarriage, death of a child, lack of breastfeeding and having a higher number of children. Conclusion and recommendations: Post partum {{depression is}} a considerable problem that needs attention. However, early detection of postpartum depression is important in assisting postpartum mothers, and this should begin during prenatal period. Prevention of depression for nursing mothers helps not only the psychological well-being of the mothers but also the entire family. Postpartum depression is under-researched and under-reported, therefore priority should be given...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of {{age at first}} marriage in three regions of Flanders (roughly {{the northern part of}} Belgium) during 1800 to 1913 is examined by gender and social status. The study areas are Leuven, Aalst, and Bierbeek-three municipalities with different socioeconomic structures and cultural climates. All the data from these <b>municipalities</b> were <b>coded</b> and taken front almost 17, 000 marriage certificates. The demographic marriage parameters point to the same thing: from the mid-nineteenth century, a passionate zest for marriage became obvious in Flanders. The proportion of those remaining unmarried fell sharply, and age at first marriage declined rapidly. This process occurred among all social groups.

40|$|To design {{sustainable}} buildings {{represents one}} of the priority challenges that {{we have to deal with}} in order to reduce the use of global resources and preserve the natural environment. Within solutions for designing sustainable buildings, renewable energy systems (RES) have been introduced in order to provide buildings with non-fossil energy. However, when we consider historical buildings we can face issues in particular when it comes to the installation of photovoltaic systems. This is due to the aesthetical effect produced by photovoltaic modules on the typical view ofthe historic city centers. Within the Italian context, characterized by the wide presence of historical city centers, such issue is not yet solved. Therefore, facing this issue in such specific context can represent a significant objective.
