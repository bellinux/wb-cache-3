5|$|HNTB, of Kansas City, Missouri, was the {{designer}} and consulting engineer {{for both the}} new bridge {{as well as the}} original Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge. The federal government provided $110 million to begin building {{the main part of the}} bridge consisting long spans supported by cables. The main superstructure construction began in December 2001. Massman Construction Company in a joint venture with Traylor Brothers, Inc. received the contract to construct two large piers in the river; these were built using both floating caissons and open caisson construction. The construction on the last <b>main</b> <b>span</b> section of the bridge was finished in April 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} owned and {{maintained}} by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, a conglomerate between Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It has a <b>main</b> <b>span</b> of three lanes, which use a tidal flow arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these {{is used as a}} local access route from Saltash, while the south is used by cyclists and pedestrians, as it can no longer be used for vehicular traffic due to weight restrictions.|$|E
5|$|For {{the bridge}} over Ydseelva in Verdal, {{which had a}} <b>main</b> <b>span</b> of only , {{construction}} started in April 1903 and was completed on 21 November. The area has quik clay, so the bridge needed piling. At Røra, a spur was originally planned to Hylla, but this was discarded late in the planning phase. At Hellem in Inderøy the right-of-way had to be moved because of poor soil mechanics. There were similar issues north of the Lunnan Tunnel, forcing the tunnel to be extended and a supporting being built. Construction of the tunnel was performed by 40 men {{during the winter of}} 1904 and 1905. It cost NOK90,179 and took 23.9 man-hours per meter to build.|$|E

5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center <b>main</b> <b>span,</b> were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main trusses were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E

50|$|When {{looking at}} the loading due to wind loads on the bridge the main portion that is {{important}} to analyze is the <b>main</b> <b>spans.</b> Because the two <b>main</b> <b>spans</b> are relative short the wind loading is insignificant. The wind loads however would be accounted for due to the outward bend of the towers that support the tension cables. This theory of widening the bottom of towers was first used by Gustav Eiffel when constructing the Eiffel Tower. The bent shape is very good at transferring the wind load to the base supports of the structure.|$|R

50|$|Archive {{studies by}} Ivan Kondratiev {{indicate}} that original draft had 5 <b>main</b> <b>spans</b> of 40 arshin each. Later, numerous repairs (1707, 1731, 1771, 1788-1792, 1809-1812) changed it to seven spans over eight stone pillars.|$|R
25|$|The {{bridge is}} 333 feet long, with a <b>main</b> <b>span</b> of 288 feet. Its 60-ft-wide roadway carries two lanes of traffic in each direction. The roadway is {{approximately}} 170 {{feet above the}} ground. The bridge was repaved and repaired between 2008 and late 2010.|$|E
25|$|The two {{caissons}} {{that the}} <b>main</b> <b>span</b> stands on were cast as hollow cylinders {{in the old}} Kishorn Dry Dock and floated to site where they were sunk onto the prepared loch bed.

25|$|Surprise Creek Bridge (originally number 36, now number 46) was {{constructed}} in 1890-91. Originally the <b>main</b> <b>span</b> had timber approaches, but these were replaced in the late 1890s by pin-jointed steel lattice trusses recycled from an older bridge. New interior steel longitudinals were added under the bridge in the late 1990s.|$|E

25|$|During the {{disassembly}} {{work of the}} bridges’ {{structural steel}} members, several difficult engineering challenges had to be resolved: the order of disassembly, a safe method for detonating charges on concrete and steel members in a publicly open and difficult to control area such as the Tampa Bay, {{and the development of}} a safe methodology for the removal in one piece of the bridge’s <b>main</b> <b>span</b> and concrete piers.|$|E
25|$|However, even Brunel was not infallible, and his {{foresight}} {{in allowing}} for slight {{movement of the}} suspension chains against supports on the bridge-deck to relieve stress, led to a weakening of the structure. In the 1950s, the speed of trains using the bridge was restricted to , {{because some of the}} girders had become distorted. In 1962, a new structure to support the bridge beneath the <b>main</b> <b>span</b> was put in place.|$|E
25|$|The first {{steel deck}} segment was lifted into place in late 1994. The {{approach}} deck segments were constructed in Britain and Dubai and then shipped to Hong Kong for assembling. The <b>main</b> <b>span</b> segments were built by Cleveland in the U.K. and by Mitsui in Japan.

50|$|Albany's {{historic}} Broad Avenue Memorial {{bridge was}} constructed in 1920 and comprises three open spandrel concrete deck arch <b>main</b> <b>spans</b> and eight closed spandrel deck arch spans. Deconstruction of the bridge was started in early 2013.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by chief engineer Henry Charles Stanley and is similar to, but smaller than, the Albert Bridge, which he designed to replace the Brisbane River crossing which was washed away during the 1893 flood. Five metal truss spans were used, two at 75 metres in length and two at 30.5 metres. No falsework was used during construction {{because of the risk}} of floods. The first of the <b>main</b> <b>spans</b> was floated into position on 14 June 1899. The method used to place the <b>main</b> <b>spans</b> was also similar to that used for the Albert Bridge, where a hulk was employed to float the span into position.|$|R
50|$|The New Richmond Swing Bridge {{has four}} <b>main</b> <b>spans,</b> plus eight short {{approach}} spans, totaling 422 ft in length. The four <b>main</b> <b>spans</b> include an 89 ft long pinned Warren pony truss swing span, two 70 ft long pinned Warren pony truss spans on either side, {{and an additional}} 51 ft long rivetted Warren pony truss span (repaired in 1899). On the south side, two 24 ft long approach spans slope upward to meet the bridge, which sits on a concrete abutment. On the north side, six short-span steel stringer structures, each 12 ft to 16 ft long, approach the bridge, again on concrete abutments.|$|R
