40|$|Longevity is a {{desirable}} trait in the dairy industry {{because of its}} relationship to profitability. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate genetic parameters for longevity measurements related to productive life, or life in the herd, and linear type traits of Brazilian Holstein cows born between the years 1990 and 2008. The (co) variance components were estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood method. The heritability for measurements of longevity and linear type traits ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 07 and 0. 08 to 0. 39, respectively. The genetic correlations between measurements of longevity and linear type traits ranged from - 0. 39 to 0. 31. Direct selection for longevity does not necessarily lead to long-lived cows, due to low heritability.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether treatment with melatonin during lactation harms milk production, two experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, 188 Lacaune ewes, lambed between September 12 and November 1 were used, and in Experiment 2, 124 Assaf ewes that lambed between November 14 and January 11. In Experiment 1, a first <b>milk</b> <b>record</b> was obtained on February 11, {{which was used}} to divide the animals into two groups, M and C. On March 11, a subcutaneous melatonin implant was administered to M animals (n = 93), and the rest (n = 95) corresponded to the Control Group (C). In Experiment 2, the first <b>milk</b> <b>record</b> was at weaning (January 5) and, on February 15, ewes were divided into M (n = 90) and C (n = 34). From that date until dry-off, monthly milk records were obtained. In both experiments, melatonin treatment significantly {{increased the number of}} lambs produced, and no detrimental effects on milk production were detected. In conclusion, the use of melatonin to improve reproduction in dairy sheep does not interfere with milk production. Moreover, {{an increase in the number}} of lambs produced, and the greater number of ewes that can be milked in the following period because of exogenous melatonin can provide economical benefits to farms.

The emergence of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the Czech Republic dates back to 1905, when it began <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> {{carried out by the}} Danish model. From the beginning of the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> was not met with such great success. Over time, the importance of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the Czech Republic grew. Patronage over <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> over the years was taken by the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR), which includes the Czech Republic since 1992. The <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the Czech Republic is performed using several methods. Official method A and unofficial methods B and F, wherein the method A is divided into A 4 -P, A 4 -A and A 4 -T. <b>Milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the Czech Republic is performed only properly educated personnel, who takes sample in individual farms. After sampling, the samples are transported and subsequently processed in laboratories for analysis of milk. Results of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> are important for the monetization of milk and breeding organization. The results of many years of breeding work, the main base are just the results of <b>milk</b> <b>recording,</b> were the reduction cows and increase milk production. Only the number of cows in lactation period from the year 2005 to 2014 fell by 50, 636 dairy cows. To reduce dairy cows occurred precisely because of the increasing milk production. Larger quantities of milk milked from each cow meant that {{there was no need for}} such a large amount of dairy cattle.

40|$|Information on {{accuracy}} of milk-sampling devices used on farms with automated milking systems (AMS) {{is essential for}} development of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> protocols. The hypotheses {{of this study were}} (1) devices used by AMS units are similarly accurate in estimating milk yield and in collecting representative milk samples compared with devices used by certified <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> providers on farms with conventional milking systems (CMS) and (2) devices used on both AMS and CMS comply with accuracy criteria described by the New Zealand Standard and by the International Committee of Animal <b>Recording</b> (ICAR). <b>Milk</b> <b>recording</b> data from 5 AMS farms were collected during 13 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test days between December 2011 and February 2013. Milk yield was estimated by ICAR-approved milk meters on AMS units. Milk samples were collected over a 48 -h period and submitted to an off-site certified laboratory for milk composition analysis. Data were also collected manually from 5 to 10 cows per AMS unit; a complete milking of a cow was weighed to serve as gold standard for milk yield, and 3 milk samples per cow milking were collected and analyzed in the laboratory to serve as gold standards for milk composition. A similar procedure was used during 6 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> occasions with devices used during conventional <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> at a CMS research farm. Farm type, breed, season, and region did not appear to affect accuracy of devices used on AMS units. Milk meters used by AMS units complied with ICAR limits in 12. 5 and 25 % of the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test days for test bucket weights between 2 and 10 kg and for test bucket weights > 10 kg, respectively. These percentages were 52 and 42 %, respectively, for devices used on CMS. Analyzing all samples as one <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test day, 1. 4 % fell outside the 20 % difference band for AMS compared with 1. 1 % of the milk samples for CMS. Devices used by AMS complied with ICAR in 73 % of the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test days for fat percentage, compared with 42 % of the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test days by devices used at the CMS farm. When analyzing all milk samples as one <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test day, 3. 5 % of the milk samples fell outside the 99 % ICAR limit for AMS compared with 17. 2 % of the milk samples for CMS. Applying the ICAR standards for fat percentage to crude protein percentage and SCC, devices used on AMS were accurate in estimating crude protein percentage but not in estimating SCC. Thus, devices on AMS units did not comply with national nor ICAR standards with regard to milk yield and fat percentage. However, devices used on AMS were similarly or more accurate compared with devices used during conventional <b>milk</b> <b>recording.</b> It is proposed that devices used on AMS units, when calibrated regularly and when set up according to the manufacturer’s instruction, have similar or improved accuracy compared with CMS devices. Because the New Zealand industry accepts data from devices currently used by certified providers for <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> on CMS farms, results imply that the AMS devices should also be permitted to be used for <b>milk</b> <b>recording...</b>|$|R

The data used in this study were 11, 430 individual test-day <b>milk</b> yield <b>records</b> collected from November 2004 to November 2006 on 813 cows reared on 15 family farms in Croatia. <b>Milk</b> <b>recording</b> was performed according to A 4 and A 6 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> method by the field officer of the Croatian Livestock Centre. From the corrected database with test-day records, two different datasets were created. The first dataset (A 4; n = 7, 500) included test day records collected every four weeks, while the second dataset (A 6; n = 3, 830) included test day records collected every six weeks. When lactation milk yields were predicted from alternative <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> methods (AT 4, AT 6), daily (24 h) milk yield was estimated from single evening or morning milk yield using linear model that taken into account effect of interval between successive milkings. Lactation milk yield was calculated for three different days in milk (100, 200 and 305 days) using the Test Interval Method (TIM) that is reference method by ICAR (ICAR, 2003). Results show that the alternate <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> method at 4 -week intervals provides low bias and high accuracy of prediction of 100, 200 and 305 -milk yields, while <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> methods at 6 -week intervals gives prediction of 305 -milk yield with higher bias and lower accuracy.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} study on seasonal {{variations in the}} characteristics of cow's milk and temperature-humidity index (THI) relationship was conducted on bulk milk data collected from 2003 to 2009. The THI relationship study was carried out on 508 613 bulk milk data items recorded in 3328 dairy farms form the Lombardy region, Italy. Temperature and relative humidity data from 40 weather stations were used to calculate THI. Milk characteristics data referred to somatic cell count (SCC), total bacterial count (TBC), fat percentage (FA%) and protein percentage (PR%). Annual, seasonal and monthly variations in milk composition were evaluated on 656 064 data items recorded in 3727 dairy farms. The model highlighted a significant association between the year, season and month, and the parameters analysed (SCC, TBC, FA%, PR%). The summer season emerged as the most critical season. Of the summer months, July presented the most critical conditions for TBC, FA% and PR%, (52 054 Â± 183 655, 3. 73 %Â± 0. 35 % and 3. 30 %Â± 0. 15 %, respectively), and August presented higher values of SCC (369 503 Â± 228 377). Each <b>milk</b> <b>record</b> was linked to THI data calculated at the nearest weather station. The analysis demonstrated {{a positive correlation between}} THI and SCC and TBC, and indicated a significant change in the slope at 57. 3 and 72. 8 maximum THI, respectively.

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the {{lactating}} dairy goat, combining a minimum of mechanistic representations of homeorhetic regulations and a long-term approach, was developed. It describes (i) the main changes in body weight, dry-matter intake, milk production and composition of a dairy goat; (ii) the succession of pregnancy and lactation throughout the productive life; and (iii) the major changes in dynamics induced by the female profile (production potential and body weight at maturity). The model adopts a ‘pull’ approach including a systematic expression of the production potential and not representing any feed limitation. It involves three sub-systems. The reproductive events sub-system drives the dynamics through time with three major events:service, kidding and drying off. It also accounts for the effect of production potential (kg of milk {{at the peak of}} lactation) and lactation number (potential reached at the fourth lactation). The regulating sub-system represents the homeorhetic mechanisms during pregnancy and lactation with two sets of theoretical hormones, one representing gestation and the other lactation. The operating sub-system describes the main physiological flows and the energetic requirements linked to these functions through a compartmental structure. Simulations were run in order to test (i) the behaviour of the model at the scale of the productive life for an average profile of female (60 kg at maturity and 4 kg of milk at peak); (ii) the sensitivity of the simulated dynamics(mainly milk production and body reserves) to the production potential and body weight at maturity; (iii) external validation with comparison of model outputs to data from the experimental flock of Grignon and data from the French <b>milk</b> <b>record</b> organization (French organism in charge of animal recording for dairy farmers). The results at the scale of one productive life show the model simulates a relevant set of dynamics. The sensitivity analysis suggests that the model fairly well simulates the link between a female’s ability to produce and mobilise reserves. Finally, external validation confirms the model’s ability to simulate a relevant set of physiological dynamics while pointing out some limits of the model (simulation of milk fat and protein content dynamics, for example). The results illustrate the relevance of the model in simulating biological dynamics and confirm the possibility of including minimum representations of homeorhetic regulations with a simple structure. This simplicity gives an opportunity to integrate this basic element in a herd simulator and test interactions between females’ regulations and management rules...|$|E

40|$|Improvements after {{precision}} dietary {{management of}} nitrogen rejection in two commercial dairy farms in Wallonia. Two dairy farms located in Pays de Herve and in Ardennes were followed {{at regular intervals}} {{in order to assess}} levels of nitrogen rejection. In Farm 1, the cows were divided into two groups: group HP contained high production cows and group BP contained cows with a lower production yield. Each group was offered a specific basal diet. In Farm 2, only one group of cows was assessed. The feed rations on both farms were characterized by a imbalance between the yields allowed by the energy or the nitrogen supplies and by an extremely high OEB balance of 794, 582 and 726 g, respectively, in groups HP and BP and in the Farm 2 group. Dietary changes were proposed in order to balance milk yields and to reduce the hypothesized nitrogen balance. The yield and urea content data from each <b>milk</b> <b>record,</b> along with data regarding nitrogen rejection, were statistically analyzed using a mixed model, which included an autoregressive covariance. The data from records 2, 3, 4 and 5 were then compared to the data from record 1. The advised changes implemented in the feeding management plan maintained milk yields at values similar to the yields observed in record 1 – 36. 2, 24. 3 and 23. 0 l of 4 % fat-corrected milk expressed for fixed days in milk produced by groups HP and BP and the Farm 2 group. The changes induced a significant reduction in the milk urea content (220 vs 300 mg·l- 1) and a significant reduction in nitrogen rejection, whether expressed in terms of g per day per cow, g·l- 1 or kg per year per cow. The cows in the Farm 2 group rejected less nitrogen in absolute terms (217. 9 vs 260. 1 g per day). However, {{it is interesting to note}} that the management approach in Farm 1 was more efficient in terms of nitrogen rejection since the level was on average 9 g·l- 1 in comparison with 10 g·l- 1 in Farm 2.

40|$|Breeding and {{official}} selection activity {{in any country}} depends on the economic importance of the considered livestock, therefore of the products that {{can be obtained from}} it. The first step in the breeding and selection activity with regard to any dairy livestock is the milk recording of the productivity of each yielding animal. The results, when appropriately merged with the genealogy data, allow a definition of the milk genetic merit of each animal, in particular of the bull, for which we have no other <b>milk</b> <b>record</b> except the production of his progeny. The importance of animal recording for the activity of selection is well recognized {{all over the world and}} is demonstrated by the fact that in most countries such activity is at least partially financed by governments, which consider it an important means for the improvement of animal production. An international non governmental organization, the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) has been active for over thirty years in the field of promotion and standardization of animal recording. The highest proportion of milk recorded buffaloes, in fact, is found in Italy (27. 8 %), in Iran is 4. 5 %, while in other countries the recorded buffaloes are about 1 % of total dairy females (Turkey, Egypt) or less. We have high percents of recorded buffaloes in Bulgaria, Syria and Greece, where the buffalo population is disappearing. The productivity in other countries is lower than in Italy, considering that only in Italy there was a very long work of recording, selection and genetic improvement, health, feeding and livestock system rising. Also milk composition was improved in Italy in few years, with mean protein percentage from 4. 4 to 4. 8 and fat percentage from 7. 3 to 8. 1 without any selection of this character. Moreover the possibilities of genetic improvement for milk quantity and quality will be higher, if the selection pressing will be increased reducing the number of bred females. So, just now there are in Italy many females producing more than 5, 000 kg milk for lactation (270 days). Therefore the selection will be directed for the improvement of the yield of mozzarella cheese, not simply for milk production, because the farm income actually is resulting first from mozzarella cheese, alter from the selling of pregnant heifers, at the last from beef (Borghese, 2004). A consistent number of recorded buffaloes is obviously found in countries with the highest presence of buffaloes (India, Pakistan and Egypt) which signifies that these countries have also taken steps towards implementing an organized milk improvement activity, on a solid scientific and technical basis...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were 1) to investigate the relationship between milk yields at early and entire lactation including the definition of initial lactation milk yield, and 2) to characterize limiting factors affecting milk yield, especially at the onset of lactation. Between April 2013 and February 2014 an observational study was conducted at a dairy farm in Northeastern Germany (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, 2000 Holstein Friesian cows) with an average annual milk production of 10900 kg (according to <b>milk</b> <b>record</b> in 2012 / 2013). For this study daily milk production from day 1 to 7 p. p., average weekly milk production until week 7 p. p., and cumulative 100 -day and 305 -day milk yield were recorded. Furthermore, quantity (kg) and quality of colostrum (densimeter, refractometer), backfat thickness (ultrasound) at the day entering transition-cowshed (RFD 1, primiparous cows 1 - 2 weeks a. p., pluriparous cows approx. 6 weeks a. p. at drying off), at calving day (RFD 2), and at the day leaving transition-cowshed (RFD 3, approx. 2 weeks p. p.) were measured. Blood samples were taken 1 - 2 weeks a. p. (v), at calving day (0), and at day (1), (3), and (7) p. p. for laboratory analysis of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), calcium, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). Further information was retrieved via herd management records, including lactation number, father of the cow, reproduction data (conception date, number of inseminations, calving-toconception interval), cow movement (date of dry-off, transfer to close-up group, calving, exit from transition-cowshed, and length of early dry period, close-up period and gestation) as well as calving data (calf number, gender, weight, stillbirths, calving process), and diseases (injury, retained placenta, metritis, milk fever, ketosis, dislocated abomasum [up to day 30 p. p. ] mastitis, and lameness [up to day 150 p. p. ]). Recurrent diseases were not counted until day 11 after first diagnosis. Cows were categorized into one of three groups: A) cows in first lactation, B) cows in second or third lactation, and C) cows in fourth or higher lactation. Data analyses were conducted using crosstables with chi-square tests, odds ratios, correlation analyses, t-tests, general linear models, and analyses of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc tests, discriminant analyses, and stepwise multiple linear regression analyses. Initial lactation milk yield was defined as mean first week yield (average milk yield between days 2 - 7 p. p.) and mean peak week yield (highest average weekly milk yield between weeks 3 - 7 p. p.), thus milk production within the first 50 days post partum. From the 1 st day p. p. significant differences in milk yield exist among the lactation categories: the average first week milk yields are 20. 9 kg (A), 35. 4 kg (B) and 35. 1 kg (C), the average peak week milk yields are 30. 6 kg (A), 49. 1 kg (B) and 50. 8 kg (C), the 100 -day milk yields are 2885 kg (A), 4441 kg (B) and 4637 kg (C), and 305 -day milk yields 8768 kg (A), 11525 kg (B) and 11903 kg (C). The mean first week milk yield is significantly positively correlated with mean peak week milk yield (0, 815), 100 -day milk yield (0, 837), and 305 -day milk yield (0, 709). Similarly, the mean peak week milk yield is significantly positively correlated with 100 -day milk yield (0, 963) and 305 -day milk yield (0, 858). Due to these strong coherences it is not recommended milk yield during the first 50 days of lactation to allow to stagnate or to decrease. Instead, because of productivity, animal health and longevity, it is recommended to pay special attention to the specific demands of each lactation category with different limiting factors for initial lactation milk yield. Factors influencing milk yield positively are a greater quantity of colostrum (> 4 kg), the length of the close-up period (A), gestation length (B) or total length of the dry period (C), thus the directly antepartal phase. This might be due to the accelerated rate of cell differentiation in the mammary gland at this time. The relationship emphasizes the importance of an optimal management during the final weeks of gestation. A positive effect of a more than 14 days close-up period exists especially in primiparous cows. Therefore, it is recommended to separate primiparous and pluriparous cows ante and post partum to allow a better adaption to the new environment and feed ration, to minimize hierarchic stress of primiparous cows, and to manage each group intensively. Further factors influencing milk yield positively are the father of the cow (genetics), body condition (backfat thickness) 6 weeks a. p. and at calving, an increasing body condition during dry period, and a moderate loss of body condition after calving. Additionally, higher blood concentrations of BHB and NEFA 7 days p. p. are associated with greater milk production. Higher NEFA concentration before calving (7 days a. p.) is associated with lower milk production in pluriparous cows but with higher milk yield in primiparous cows. Probably primiparous cows are more able to compensate an energy deficiency, or alternatively, an adaption problem exists in pluriparous cows. Thus, severe overcondition during dry period, stress, and a depression in feed intake during the final 2 weeks ante partum should be avoided in pluriparous cows. Necessity of calving assistance is negatively but the weight of the calf is positively associated with milk yield. However, selective breeding for higher birth weights should be refused due to the increasing risk of difficult calvings and associated diseases. Additionally, sick cows (within the first 30 days p. p.) produce less milk than healthy cows and milk losses rise with the number of diseases per cow. The most important diseases with significant negative effects on milk production are metritis (A), retained placenta (B), and milk fever (C), hence different diseases are determined by age. Thus, transition cow management (with individualized animal monitoring and early treatments) should take lactation category into account. Finally, an extended calving-to-conception interval (> 100 days) is associated with higher 305 -day milk yield across groups. Thus, it should be reflected upon an extended voluntary wait period for very high yielding cows to stay healthy and to better realize their high yielding potential...|$|E

40|$|Dairy cows grazing {{pasture and}} milked using {{automated}} milking systems (AMS) have lower milking frequencies than indoor fed cows milked using AMS. Therefore, <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> intervals used for herd testing indoor fed cows {{may not be}} suitable for cows on pasture based farms. We hypothesised that accurate standardised 24 h estimates could be determined for AMS herds with <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> intervals of less than the Gold Standard (48 hs), but that the optimum <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> interval {{would depend on the}} herd average for milking frequency. The Gold Standard protocol was applied on five commercial dairy farms with AMS, between December 2011 and February 2013. From 12 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test periods, involving 2211 cow-test days and 8049 cow milkings, standardised 24 h estimates for milk volume and milk composition were calculated for the Gold Standard protocol and compared with those collected during nine alternative sampling scenarios, including six shorter sampling periods and three in which a fixed number of milk samples per cow were collected. Results infer a 48 h <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> protocol is unnecessarily long for collecting accurate estimates during <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> on pasture based AMS farms. Collection of two milk samples only per cow was optimal in terms of high concordance correlation coefficients for milk volume and components and a low proportion of missed cow-test days. Further research is required {{to determine the effects of}} diurnal variations in milk composition on standardised 24 h estimates for milk volume and components, before a protocol based on a fixed number of samples could be considered. Based on the results of this study New Zealand have adopted a split protocol for herd testing based on the average milking frequency for the herd (NZ Herd Test Standard 8100 : 2015) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} semi-parametric model for {{lactation}} curves that, along with stage of lactation, accounts for {{day of the}} year at <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> and stage of gestation. Lactation is described as having 3 different phases defined by 2 change points of which the second is a function of gestation stage. Season of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> is modelled using cosine and sine functions. As an application, the model is used to estimate the association between intramammary infections (IMI) dynamics as measured by somatic cell count (SCC) over the dry period and the shape of the lactation curve. <b>Milk</b> <b>recording</b> data collected in 2128 herds from England and Wales between 2004 and 2007 were used in the analysis. From a random sample of 1000 of these herds, smoothed milk production was used to test the behaviour of the model and estimate model parameters. The first change point was set at 60 days in milk. The second change point was set at 100 days of gestation or 200 days in milk when the latter was not available. Using data from the 1128 remaining herds, multilevel models were then used to model individual test-day milk production within lactations within herds. Average milk production at 60 days in milk for cows of parities 1, 2, 3 and greater than 3 were 26. 9 kg, 31. 6 kg, 34. 4 kg and 34. 7 kg respectively and, after this stage, decreases in milk production per 100 days milk of lactation were 3. 1 kg, 5. 1 kg, 6. 3 kg and 6. 7 kg respectively. Compared to cows that had an SCC below 200, 000 cells/mL on both the last <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in a lactation and the first <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the following lactation, cows that had an SCC greater than 200, 000 cells/mL on their first <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> after calving had an estimated loss of milk production of between 216 and 518 kg depending on parity.

Heritability from the paternal half-sib correlation among records of daughters of sampling sires was similar for registered and nonregistered cows. Differences in heritability in different years and class of herd production {{were similar to those}} found in previous analyses that ignored registry status. Residual variances were similar for records of registered and nonregistered cows. Differences in variances by year and class of herd production also were similar to those found in previous analyses.

40|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>recording</b> is {{essential}} for both genetic improvement and herd management. Test day (TD) yields of milk are the basic data for estimation of daily (24 h) and total lactation milk yield. Simplifications of the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> practice have been proposed {{in order to reduce}} the cost of <b>milk</b> <b>recording.</b> The alternate morning and evening testing scheme (known as the “AT method”) that requires single morning or evening recording on a monthly basis, has been regarded as an efficient way to achieve reasonable accuracy at a lower cost. Potential benefits from the use of the AT recording method include more herds being served by each field officer and lower <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> cost per animal. Furthermore, <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> may provide useful information for animal comparison and selection. Prediction of milk yield at a fixed reference lactation length makes these comparisons more objective. In addition, prediction of milk yield at a reference length is useful in sheep selection schemes as it allows rams to be compared and selected before the milking period of their daughters is finished. This reduces the generation interval, thereby resulting in higher genetic progress. The objectives of this thesis were i) to develop and evaluate methods for the estimation of daily (24 h) and total lactation milk yield of dairy sheep from single morning (am) or evening (pm) <b>milking</b> <b>records</b> and ii) to evaluate and define a reference lactation length for the Chios dairy sheep. For the first objective, linear models were developed to estimate the daily (24 h) and total lactation milk yield of dairy sheep from single am or pm records. A total of 22, 908 individual test-day <b>milk</b> <b>records</b> of 5110 ewes of the Chios breed, raised in 46 flocks, were used. Data were collected throughout year 2000. Depending on the model, different daily yield estimates were derived for each ewe accounting for lactation number, stage of lactation, season of previous lambing and interval between successive milkings. Daily milk yield was also estimated from doubling the single am or pm records. Actual and estimated milk yields were compared using the following criteria: a) root mean squared error (RMSE), b) mean absolute difference, c) an accuracy parameter and d) the product-moment correlation. Linear model RMSE decreased by 7 - 37 % and mean absolute differences by 36 - 82 g, compared to doubling. Highest accuracy and correlation (0. 92 - 0. 98) were obtained from linear model application. ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Historically, most cows {{enrolled}} in a <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> program in the United States have had <b>milk</b> weights <b>recorded</b> monthly (Voelker 1981). However, practices for collecting milk and component data have been changing rapidly. Over 30 innovative test plans were introduced between 1989 and 1995. These plans differ widely {{in the number of}} <b>milk</b> weights <b>recorded</b> and the number of component samples taken. Often cows in innovative test programs are recorded less frequently than monthly, and some cows have as few as three milk component samples tested per year. For other innovative test plans, however, <b>milk</b> weights are <b>recorded</b> more frequently than before because technological development has made electronic recording feasible. Many of the newer plans have reduced labor requirements for <b>recording</b> <b>milk</b> weights and collecting samples, thus reducing cost to producers. In 1969, the test interval method (TIM) replaced the centering date method in the United States for estimatin...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the variability in cow´s milk somatic cell counts (SCC) depending on the type of milk meter used by dairy farms for official <b>milk</b> <b>recording.</b> The study was performed in 2011 and 2012 in the major cattle area of Spain. In total, 137, 846 lactations of Holstein-Friesian cows were analysed at 1, 912 farms. A generalised least squares regression model was used for data analysis. The model showed that the milk meter had a substantial effect on the SCC for individual milk samples obtained for official <b>milk</b> <b>recording.</b> The results suggested an overestimation of the SCC in milk samples from farms that had electronic devices in comparison with farms that used portable devices and underestimation when volumetric meters are used. A weak positive correlation was observed between the SCC and the percentage of fat in individual milk samples. The results underline the importance of considering this variable when using SCC data from <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the dairy herd improvement program or in quality milk programs. ...|$|R
