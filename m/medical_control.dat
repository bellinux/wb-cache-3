25|$|In many localities, paramedics {{operate as}} a direct {{extension}} of a physician medical director and practice {{as an extension of}} the medical director's license. In the United States, a physician delegates authority under an individual state's Medical Practice Act. This gives a paramedic the ability to practice within limited scope of practice in law, along with state DOH guidelines and <b>medical</b> <b>control</b> oversight. The authority to practice in this manner is granted in the form of standing orders (protocols) (off-line <b>medical</b> <b>control)</b> and direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line <b>medical</b> <b>control).</b> Under this paradigm, paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional emergency physicians, with independent clinical decision.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} on {{attitudes toward the}} mentally ill has produced conflicting results, {{due in part to}} methodological problems. The present study examined this issue using a more sophisticated design. Randomly, 600 residents of Delaware County Indiana were chosen from the telephone directory to be the recipients of a mail survey. Of these, 206 responded, yielding a return rate of 34. 5 %. Each subject was randomly assigned to either the experimental group that read a case vignette which described a hypothetical mental patient, or the control group which read about a medically ill patient. In both conditions there were three levels of severity of behavior. Thus, three cases described hypothetical patients labeled as mentally ill with a range of severity of psychopathology, and three described comparably behaving <b>medical</b> <b>controls.</b> It was found that the mentally ill were rejected significantly more than <b>medical</b> <b>controls</b> at each level of severity. Respondents also rated the mentally ill as less predictable, and having less hopeful outcomes, than the <b>medical</b> <b>controls.</b> In addition, beliefs about mental illness were not sufficient to account for all rejection. Finally, no demographic characteristics of the population were found to significantly correlate with rejection. Department of Psychological ScienceThesis (M. A. ...|$|R

The study examined <b>medical</b> stocks <b>control</b> system, factors affecting performance and then propose ways for improvement {{of the performance of}} <b>medical</b> stocks <b>control</b> system at Dodoma Regional Hospital. In the study both primary and secondary data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations from 68 employees of DRH and 80 patients. Findings were analysed through qualitative techniques in which explanations were drawn, and the summary was drawn in frequency and percentage tables and figures with the use of SPSS and Excel programs. The results show that at DRH there are no fixed pre-established stock levels, order quantities, and ordering time for non-vertical programme items, and stock records are mainly kept in paper files. For non-vertical programme items, order quantities and ordering time are mainly determined basing on the available funds and stock balances while main determinant of ordering time and order quantities for items in vertical programme are stock balances and consumption rate. The results reveal that performance of <b>medical</b> stocks <b>control</b> system has been mostly affected by low information sharing among the individuals involved in the system, limited supply of items at Medical Stores Department (MSD), lack of computerised system and insufficient funds allocation. In order to improve the performance of <b>medical</b> stocks <b>control</b> system, DRH management needs to strengthen its information sharing system, undertake effective budgeting and funds allocation for medical stocks, purchase items missing at MSD from authorised suppliers of medical stocks as well as improve data management, supervisions and management follow-ups in the <b>medical</b> stocks <b>control</b> system...|$|R
25|$|Changes in {{procedures}} {{also included}} {{the manner in}} which the work of paramedics was overseen and managed. In the earliest days of the field, <b>medical</b> <b>control</b> and oversight was direct and immediate, with paramedics calling into a local hospital and receiving orders for every individual procedure or drug. This still occurs in some jurisdictions, but is becoming very rare. As physicians began to build a bond of trust with paramedics, and experience in working with them, their confidence levels also rose. Increasingly, in many jurisdictions day-to-day operations moved from direct and immediate <b>medical</b> <b>control</b> to pre-written protocols or 'standing orders', with the paramedic typically only calling in for direction after the options in the standing orders had been exhausted. Medical oversight became driven more by chart review or rounds, than by step by step control during each call.|$|E
25|$|The second care structure, {{termed the}} Anglo-American model, {{utilizes}} pre-hospital allied health staff, such as emergency medical technicians and paramedics, to staff ambulances, {{which may be}} classified according to the varying skill levels of the crews. In this model it is rare to find a physician actually working routinely in the pre-hospital setting, although they may be utilised on complex or major injuries or illnesses. In this system, a physicians involvement {{is most likely to}} be the provision of medical oversight for the work of the ambulance crews, which may be accomplished in terms of off-line <b>medical</b> <b>control,</b> with protocols or 'standing orders' for certain types of medical procedures or care, or on-line <b>medical</b> <b>control,</b> in which the technician must establish contact with the physician, usually at the hospital, and receive direct orders for various types of medical interventions. In some cases, such as in the UK, South Africa and Australia, a paramedic may be an autonomous health care professional, and does not require the permission of a physician to administer interventions or medications from an agreed list, and can perform roles such as suturing or prescribing medication to the patient.|$|E
25|$|Paramedics in {{countries}} that follow the Anglo-American model normally function under the authority (medical direction) {{of one or more}} physicians charged with legally establishing the emergency medical directives for a particular region. Paramedics are credentialed and authorized by these physicians to use their own clinical judgment and diagnostic tools to identify medical emergencies and to administer the appropriate treatment, including drugs that would normally require a physician order. Credentialing may occur {{as the result of a}} State Medical Board examination (U.S.) or the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (U.S.). In England, and in some parts of Canada, credentialing may occur by means of a College of Paramedicine. In these cases, paramedics are regarded as a self-regulating health profession. The final common method of credentialing is through certification by a Medical Director and permission to practice as an extension of the Medical Director's license to practice some medical acts. The authority to practice in this semi-autonomous manner is granted in the form of standing order protocols (off-line <b>medical</b> <b>control)</b> and in some cases direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line <b>medical</b> <b>control).</b> Under this paradigm, paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional emergency physicians, with clinical decision-making authority using standing orders or protocols.|$|E

25|$|Registered Nurse: Some jurisdictions use {{specially}} trained nurses for pre-hospital services. These are mostly air-medical personnel or critical care transport providers with specialized {{training and experience}} in pre-hospital care. Such nurses are required by their employers to seek additional certifications beyond basic nursing licensure and are often required to have three years (minimum) of full-time experience in emergency and/or intensive care. Certifications requirements vary but often include advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), basic life support (BLS), pediatric advanced life support (PALS), neonatal resuscitation program (NRP), trauma nursing core course (TNCC), and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), in addition to Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS). Standards also include being board certified in Emergency Nursing (CEN), Critical Care Nursing (CCRN), and Ground Transport (CTRN) or Flight Nursing (CFRN) respectively. These nurses are trained up to and able to operate {{at or above the}} level of a paramedic and in some regions are authorized to operate base station phones for medical command. Some states allow them to operate entirely under standing orders while on a ground ambulance or air medical unit (i.e. offline <b>medical</b> <b>control).</b> Training also includes specific education relevant to the state and its protocols, and often require the nurse to train with paramedics {{for a period of time}} as well as taking an additional exam administered by their medical director before being allowed to operate on a ground ambulance or air medical unit. Many of these nurses hold certifications as Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics, and in some states are required to, but it is not the standard of practice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nature of}} the air {{operation}} frequently determines the type of <b>medical</b> <b>control</b> required. [...] In most cases, an air ambulance staffer is considerably more skilled than a typical paramedic, so <b>medical</b> <b>control</b> permits them to exercise more medical decision-making latitude [...] Assessment skills tend to be considerably higher, and, particularly on inter-facility transfers, permit inclusion of functions such as reading x-rays and interpretation of lab results. [...] This allows for planning, consultation with supervising physicians, and issuing contingency orders in case they are required during flight. Some systems operate almost entirely off-line, using protocols for almost all procedures and only resorting to on-line <b>medical</b> <b>control</b> when protocols have been exhausted. [...] Some air ambulance operations have full-time, on site medical directors with pertinent backgrounds (e.g., emergency medicine); others have medical directors who are only available by pager.

In contrast, the Rb+ efflux from lymphocytes of patients with CRPS or LNP was not modified by either treatment.
