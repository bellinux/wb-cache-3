This caused a considerable loss of blood and body fluids, estimated to be about 6% of the total weight. As a whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific are smaller on average than those from Antarctic waters. Adult weights typically range from [...] There is some uncertainty about the biggest blue whale ever found, as most data came from blue whales killed in Antarctic waters {{during the first half}} of the twentieth century, which were collected by whalers not well-versed in standard zoological measurement techniques. The standard <b>measuring</b> <b>technique</b> is to measure in a straight line from the upper jaw to the notch in the tail flukes. This came about because the edges of the tail flukes were typically cut off, and the lower jaw often falls open upon death. Many of the larger whales in the whaling records (especially those over [...] ) were probably measured incorrectly or even deliberately exaggerated. The heaviest weight ever reported was for a southern hemisphere female in 1947, it is likely that the largest blue whales would have weighed over [...] The longest whales ever recorded were two females measuring , but in neither of these cases was the piecemeal weight gathered. Possibly the largest recorded male was killed near the South Shetland Islands in 1926 and was measured at 31.7m (104ft).|$|E

This reversed the direction of causality that neoclassical economics assumed between the rate of profit {{and the amount of}} capital. Further, Sraffa showed that a change in the rate of profit would change the measured amount of capital, and in highly nonlinear ways: an increase in the rate of profit might initially increase the perceived value of the truck more than the laser, but then reverse the effect at still higher rates of profit. See [...] "Reswitching" [...] below.

40|$|Compared to the {{traditional}} light sources, applications of LED lights are continuously increasing as they have many advantages including high reliability, greater energy efficiency, long life time, small in size, and faster switching speed. Even though LEDs have high reliability and long life time, manufacturers and lighting systems designers still need to assess the reliability of LED lighting systems and the failures in the LED. This is very important {{with respect to the}} maintainability of the LED lighting systems after the deployment. In particular assessing the reliability of the LED lighting systems which are used for safety critical and emergency applications is a requirement to ensure the light output meets the standards all the time. This paper investigates distance <b>measure</b> <b>techniques</b> for a real-time prognostics system which can assess the reliability, predict the failure in advance and estimate remaining useful life time of a LED packaging. In particular Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance <b>measure</b> <b>techniques</b> are used to measure the degradation in the light output of the LEDs and used to predict the failure in advance. LEDs are tested under accelerated voltage conditions to collect the training and test data sets. Results show that both distance <b>measure</b> <b>techniques</b> predict the degradation in the light output.
