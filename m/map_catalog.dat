40|$|The National Geologic Map Database (NGMDB) is an Internet-based {{system for}} query and {{retrieval}} of earth-science map information, {{created as a}} collaborative effort between the USGS and the Association of American State Geologists. Its functions include providing a catalog of available map information; a data repository; and a source for general information on the nature and intended uses of {{the various types of}} earth-science information. The <b>map</b> <b>catalog</b> is a comprehensive, searchable catalog of all geoscience maps of the United States, in paper or digital format. It includes maps published in geological survey formal series and open-file series, maps in books, theses and dissertations, maps published by park associations, scientific societies, and other agencies, as well as publications that do not contain a map but instead provide a geological description of an area (for example, a state park). The geologic-names lexicon (GEOLEX) is a search tool for lithologic and geochronologic unit names. It now contains roughly 90 % of the geologic names found in the most recent listing of USGS-approved geologic names. Current mapping activities at 1 : 24, 000 - and 1 : 100, 000 -scale are listed in the Geologic Mapping in Progress Database.

40|$|Maps are {{not always}} {{published}} with coordinates. However, by following strict guidelines in the 034 and 255 MARC fields, and by using cataloging rules, one can interpolate this data {{in order to provide}} coordinates in bibliographic records. Bounding boxes and center point coordinates are key components in the catalog record, but problems arise with maps providing information outside of discussed or established standards, or maps not providing coordinates at all for different reasons. This article explores the importance of correctly understanding, using, and interpreting <b>map</b> <b>cataloging</b> rules to provide the most accurate information possible, with the goal of making it possible to find maps quickly and accurately?whether using database retrieval or a coordinate-driven search engine. It is proposed that we can find an efficient universal method to represent locations, addresses, and areas of the world through the use of geographic coordinates for print and digital cartographic materials. Finally, the article states the strong need to standardize spatial cataloging information to improve search query responses by providing uniform information and by addressing the problems discussed in this article...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore the}} current multilinear map {{candidates}} and attacks against them. This involves analyzing the three proposals for multilinear maps {{which are based}} on ideal lattices, integers, and standard lattices. The attacks exploit the geometry of the lattices and linearity of the integers to break security. I also compare the applications of these schemes with what is required for attacks. Key agreement seems to need certain features of multilinear maps which expose vulnerabilities while other applications like indistinguishability obfuscation. I analyze the attacks against these maps and show why they are not able to break the program obfuscation application of multilinear maps. by William Cyr. Thesis: M.

40|$|In recent years, {{multiple}} eQTL (expression {{quantitative trait}} loci) catalogs have become available {{that can help}} understand the functionality of complex trait-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In eQTL catalogs, gene expression is often strongly associated with multiple SNPs, which may reflect either one or multiple independent associations. Conditional eQTL analysis allows a distinction between dependent and independent eQTLs. We performed conditional eQTL analysis in 4, 896 peripheral blood microarray gene expression samples. Our analysis showed that 35 % of genes with a cis eQTL {{have at least two}} independent cis eQTLs; for several genes up to 13 independent cis eQTLs were identified. Also, 12 % (671) of the independent cis eQTLs identified in conditional analyses were not significant in unconditional analyses.

HerS covers 79 deg 2 along the SDSS Stripe 82 to an average depth of 13. 0, 12. 9, and 14. 8 mJy beam- 1 (including confusion) at 250, 350, and 500 ??m, respectively. HerS was designed to measure correlations with external tracers of the dark matter density field - either point-like (i. e., galaxies selected from radio to X-ray) or extended (i. e., clusters and gravitational lensing) - in order to measure the bias and redshift distribution of intensities of infrared-emitting dusty star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei.

We used the VLSS catalog as a sky model to correct the ionospheric distortions in the data and create a new set of sky <b>maps</b> and {{corresponding}} <b>catalog</b> at 73. 8 MHz. The VLSS Redux (VLSSr) has a resolution of 75 arcsec, and an average map RMS noise level of σ∼ 0. 1 Jy beam^- 1. The clean bias is 0. 66 ×σ, and the theoretical largest angular size is 36 arcmin. Six previously un-imaged fields are included in the VLSSr, which has an unbroken sky coverage over 9. 3 sr above an irregular southern boundary. The final catalog includes 92, 964 sources. The VLSSr improves upon the original VLSS {{in a number of areas}} including imaging of large sources, image sensitivity, and clean bias; however the most critical improvement is the replacement of an inaccurate primary beam correction which caused source flux errors which vary as a function of radius to nearest pointing center in the VLSS.
