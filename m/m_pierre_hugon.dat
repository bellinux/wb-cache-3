50|$|In about 1612 a {{new form}} of public {{transport}} appeared, called the fiacre, a coach and driver which could be hired for short journeys. The business was started by an entrepreneur from Amiens named Sauvage on the rue Saint-Martin. It took its name from the enseigne or hanging sign on the building, with an image of Saint Fiacre. By 1623 there were several different companies offering the service. In 1657 a decree of the Parlement of Paris gave the exclusive rights to operate coaches for hire to an ecuyer of the King, <b>Pierre</b> <b>Hugon,</b> the sieur of Givry. In 1666, the Parlement fixed the fare at twenty sous for the first hour and fifteen sous for each additional hour; three livres and ten sols for a half day, and four livres and ten sols if the passenger desired to go into the countryside outside Paris, which required a second horse. In 1669 fiacres were required to have large numbers painted in yellow on the sides and rear of the coach.|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{consider}} obstacle problem, with {{one and two}} irregular barriers, for semilinear evolution equation involving measure data and operator corresponding to semi-Dirichlet form. We prove the existence and uniquueness of solutions {{under the assumption that}} the right-hand side of the equation is monotone and satisfies mild integrability conditions. To treat the case of irregular barriers, we extend the theory of precise version of a function introduced by <b>M.</b> <b>Pierre.</b> We also give some applications to so-called switching problem...|$|R
40|$|In [23] <b>M.</b> <b>Pierre</b> {{introduced}} parabolic Dirichlet spaces. Such {{spaces are}} obtained by considering certain families (E(τ)) τ∈R of Dirichlet forms. He developed a rather far-reaching and general potential theory for these spaces. In particular, he introduced associated capacities and investigated {{the notion of}} related quasi-continuous functions. However, the only examples given by <b>M.</b> <b>Pierre</b> in [23] (see also [22]) are Dirichlet forms arising from strongly parabolic differential operators of second order. To our knowledge, only very recently, when Y. Oshima in [20] was able to construct a Markov process associated with a time dependent or parabolic Dirichlet space, these parabolic Dirichlet spaces {{attracted the attention of}} probabilists. The proof of the existence of such a Markov process depends much on the potential theory developed by <b>M.</b> <b>Pierre.</b> Moreover, in [21] Y. Oshima proved that a lot of results valid for symmetric Dirichlet spaces (see [7] as a standard reference) also hold for time dependent Dirichlet spaces. The purpose of this note is to give some concrete examples of time depen-dent Dirichlet spaces which are generated by pseudo-differential operators and therefore are non-local. In Section 1 we recall the basic definition of a time dependent Dirichlet space and in Section 2 we give some auxiliary results. Sections 3 – 5 are devoted to examples. In Section 3 we discuss some spatially translation invariant operators. We do not really give there any surprising examples, but we emphasize the relation to the theory of balayage spaces. In Section 4 we consider time dependent Dirichlet spaces constructed from a special class of symmetric pseudo-differential operators analogous to those handled in our joint paper [9] with W. Hoh. Finally, in Section 5 we construct time dependent generators of (symmetric) Feller semigroups following [15]. The estimates used in this construction already ensure that we get non-local time dependent Dirichlet spaces. We would like to mention that non-local Dirichlet forms have recently been investigated by U. Mosco [19] in his study of composite media...|$|R
