25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in <b>my</b> <b>style.</b> So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
500|$|The Max Weinberg 7 {{released}} a self-titled album in 2000 on Hip-O Records; Weinberg said {{he waited until}} then because [...] "I wanted to change <b>my</b> <b>style</b> of playing and hone <b>my</b> <b>style</b> before I committed to a record." [...] He was especially proud that the band had successfully backed Tony Bennett during a late 1990s appearance on Late Night: [...] "Two years ago if you'd asked me if I could play with Tony Bennett, I would have said absolutely not. I'm not in his league. But we played with him the other night, and it was wonderful. We swung." ...|$|E

It was too {{far removed}} from <b>my</b> filmmaking <b>style.</b> But if the studio is {{willing to make the}} film with me, in <b>my</b> own <b>style,</b> it's worth trying. It would be difficult, though. There's not much of a market for {{alternative}} films here Thailand," [...] he said in a 2007 interview.|$|R

500|$|Following its release, {{there was}} media {{speculation}} that Spears {{had written a}} song {{as a response to}} [...] "Cry Me a River"; she denied the rumors, explaining, [...] "You know, it's funny. I read that I wrote this song and I wrote these lyrics and that's not <b>my</b> <b>style.</b> I would never do that." [...] Annet Artani, who co-wrote Spears' 2003 song [...] "Everytime", stated that the song was written as a response to [...] "Cry Me a River".

500|$|After Carey {{finished}} {{writing and}} producing the track alongside Williams, Dogg added his rap verse, and added some ulterior beats and components. Before taking the still-uncompleted song to the studio, Dogg described {{the song and}} beat [...] "The beat was just sick and it was bangin'. I was like, 'All right, give me that, M.C.' I took [...] down to my studio and flipped <b>my</b> <b>style</b> to it." [...] After slightly altering the song, as well as adding his verses, Dogg met with Carey once again for her approval on the song, [...] "When I played [...] for her, she was like, 'Oh, I love it!'

500|$|The nostalgic [...] "Memory Lane (Sittin' in da Park)" [...] {{contains}} a Reuben Wilson sample, which comprises {{the sound of}} a Hammond organ, guitar, vocals and percussion, and adds to the track's ghostly harmonies. Spence D. of IGN wrote that the lyrics evoke [...] "the crossroads of Old School and New School." [...] "One Love" [...] is composed of a series of letters to incarcerated friends, recounting mutual acquaintances and events that have occurred since the receiver's imprisonment, and address unfaithful girlfriends, emotionally tortured mothers, and underdog loyalty.

500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but <b>my</b> <b>style</b> was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
