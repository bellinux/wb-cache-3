5|$|From March 26 to March 28, 1958, the NCLC {{held the}} first of many {{workshops}} on using nonviolent tactics to challenge segregation. These workshops were led by James Lawson, who had studied the principles of nonviolent resistance while working as a missionary in India. The workshops were mainly attended by students from Fisk University, Tennessee A (later Tennessee State University), American Baptist Theological Seminary (later American Baptist College), and Meharry Medical College. Among those attending Lawson's sessions were students who would become significant leaders in the Civil Rights Movement, among them: <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry,</b> James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, John Lewis, Diane Nash, and C.

25|$|In 1981, Gay Pride Day first {{hosted a}} parade in {{addition}} to the street festival. The growing festival drew more than 10,000 attendees that year.

25|$|Also in 1987, WWC {{moved to}} a larger building, located at 1407 S Street, NW (formerly the Evelyn Towers Apartments). This {{facility}} would operate as the organization's headquarters {{for more than two}} decades. Whitman-Walker was able to purchase the building in 1988. At this time, D.C. Mayor <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry</b> and the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation were the Clinic's primary financial supporters. Simultaneously, individual contributions from the local LGBTQ community made up about half of the organization's income.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, Bonds {{helped the}} defense {{attorney}} in <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry's</b> drug and perjury charges.

In May 1998, Bonds was named campaign manager for Councilmember Harold Brazil's bid for District mayor. In August 1998, she left that role after a campaign reorganization.|$|R
25|$|The Federal City Council also opposed casino {{gambling}} in the District, {{and paid for}} a study of the District's finances which was highly critical of the city's excessive spending and lack of revenue. It supported a 1995 plan by Mayor <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry</b> to spend $2 billion improving New York Avenue NE, efforts to build a local cultural center, downtown revitalization, an effort to give the District a delegate in the United States Senate, and a National Museum of American Music (to be part of the Smithsonian Institution).|$|E
25|$|In 1977, a {{total of}} twelve gunmen took about 150 people hostage at three sites around Washington. During the crisis, later known as the 1977 Hanafi Siege, two of those gunmen held about a dozen hostages inside the council {{chambers}} {{on the fifth floor}} of the District Building. Then-councilman <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry</b> was hit by a stray bullet during the commotion, which left two others dead, including DC Protective Services Police Officer Wesley Cantrell. The press room at the Wilson Building is named in memory of Maurice Williams, a 24-year-old reporter who was killed during the attack.|$|E
25|$|Marion Shepilov Barry (born <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry</b> Jr.; March 6, 1936– November 23, 2014) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the second Mayor of the District of Columbia from 1979 to 1991, and again as the fourth mayor from 1995 to 1999. A Democrat, Barry had served three tenures on the Council of the District of Columbia, representing as an at-large member from 1975 to 1979 and in Ward 8 from 1993 to 1995, and again from 2005 to 2014.

5000|$|Gurley {{announced}} his candidacy {{for mayor of}} the District of Columbia in 1986. Unemployed and living in Anacostia, Gurley ran as an Democratic candidate, challenging <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry's</b> reelection. Gurley said {{he was running for}} office so that a lifelong District resident would {{be in charge of the}} District's government. Gurley advocated for improvements to the District's prison system and housing department, and he said that Mayor Barry's leadership was [...] "decaying".|$|R
50|$|May {{moved to}} Ward 8 in 2002. While in law school, May took a {{position}} as {{the executive director of}} the Gift Family Resource Center, a program of Garden Memorial Presbyterian Church which provided after-school and summer educational and enrichment programs for children in elementary and middle school. She left the position in 2003. In 2005 and 2006, May served as a legislative intern and then as Director of Constituent Services in D.C. Council member <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry's</b> office.|$|R
25|$|GCA {{opposed the}} {{redesigned}} project as well. In November 1980, the GCA {{called for a}} two-year delay of the now $120 million project while a floodplain study was done. The GCA argued that the project was on such low land and {{so close to the}} water that it would regularly flood. Nine of the 13 D.C. City Council members sponsored a bill to ban construction on the project until the Federal Emergency Management Agency (which was already conducting a floodplain study of the area) was complete. Mayor <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry</b> opposed the legislation. Although no floodplain study requirement was imposed, another nine months passed while final architectural drawings and building permits were secured. By July 1981, the cost of the project had risen to $154 million (primarily due to inflation).|$|E
25|$|<b>Marion</b> <b>Barry</b> {{first began}} his spirit {{of civil rights}} {{activism}} {{when he was a}} paperboy in Memphis. The paper he worked for organized a contest in which any boys who gained 15 new customers could win a trip to New Orleans. Barry and a couple of the other black paperboys reached the quota of 15 new customers yet were not allowed to go on the trip to New Orleans, a segregated city. The paper said it could not afford to hire two buses to satisfy Mississippi's segregation rules. Barry decided to boycott his paper route until they agreed to send the black paperboys on a trip. After the paper offered the black paperboys a chance to go to St. Louis, Missouri on a trip, because it was not a segregated city, Barry resumed his paper route.|$|E
25|$|The project again caused {{significant}} controversy, but {{was eventually}} terminated. In early October 1997, D.C. Mayor <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry</b> proposed legislation giving National Children's Island, Inc., a 99-year lease on Kingman and Heritage islands. Although it initially {{appeared that the}} legislation would pass quickly, opposition from the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund led several Council members to withdraw {{their support for the}} lease. Opponents pointed out, too, that the company had performed none of the studies required by the 1993 Council vote. The delay doomed the project. In 1995, Congress had imposed a Financial Control Board on the D.C. government in an attempt to help the city avoid impending bankruptcy. The Control Board had the power to override decisions made by the mayor and city council. On March 5, 1999, the Financial Control Board exercised that power and voided the city's agreements to build Children's Island. The Control Board said the project would cost too much and was not financially viable. The decision {{was the first time the}} panel overturned a decision by city officials.|$|E
5000|$|After graduation, Lewis {{went to work}} as an {{attorney}} in the U.S. Justice Department and later in the Office of Compliance in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Fauntroy. He led <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry's</b> mayoral transition team in 1978 and his re-election campaign's financial committee in 1982.|$|R
50|$|Leo Alexander, meanwhile, criticized Fenty for {{allowing}} {{teachers to be}} fired, and he criticized Gray for doing nothing to stop the firings as Council Chair. Alexander said that both Gray and Fenty both {{want to keep the}} District generally the same as it is now. Gray responded that the Council had no authority to stop the firings, but Alexander recalled that former Council Chair John Ray had successfully done so during former mayor <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry's</b> administration. Alexander also blamed businesses who hire illegal immigrants for the District's unemployment rate.|$|R

500|$|The city's local government, {{particularly}} during the mayoralty of <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry,</b> was criticized for mismanagement and waste. During his administration in 1989, The Washington Monthly magazine claimed that the District had [...] "the worst city government in America." [...] In 1995, {{at the start of}} Barry's fourth term, Congress created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to oversee all municipal spending. Mayor Anthony Williams won election in 1998 and oversaw a period of urban renewal and budget surpluses. The District regained control over its finances in 2001 and the oversight board's operations were suspended.|$|E

Mayor Kelly was vindicated, {{at least in the}} short term: Drug arrests declined dramatically after the fence went up, though crimes did continue. [...] But much of the drug activity just shifted to other areas, and assaults and robberies remained high—to the point in 1995 that <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry’s</b> administration hired the Nation of Islam on an emergency contract to restore order.|$|R

500|$|The second segment parodies Moses who, {{according}} to the Book of Exodus, freed the Israelites from the Egyptian Pharaoh.

When Bart is seized by the Pharaoh's guards, he exclaims [...] "No, the bush set me up!" [...] Bart's line refers to the 1990 arrest of <b>Marion</b> <b>Barry</b> who, while being arrested by the FBI for smoking crack cocaine, exclaimed [...] "No, the bitch set me up!" [...] In a scene in the segment, Milhouse and Lisa can be seen pouring frogs into Skinner's tent. The scene refers to the second of ten Biblical plagues that were imposed on Egypt by Yahweh, in chapters 7-12 of the Book of Exodus. While they are inside the torture chamber, Milhouse and Lisa walk past an orb. The orb is called [...] "Orb of Isis" [...] and played a big part in the season 9 episode [...] "Lost Our Lisa". In another scene, Milhouse parts the Red Sea so that his fellow slaves can escape. The execution of the scene is based on the one seen in the 1956 American epic film The Ten Commandments, in which Moses parts the Red Sea.
