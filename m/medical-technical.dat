40|$|Chronic {{low back}} pain (CLBP) is a highly prevalent, costly and {{disabling}} condition {{that is associated with}} high levels of health-care resource utilization. Over the past few decades, there has been a paradigm shift in our understanding of CLBP. Nowadays, this condition is accepted as a biopsychosocial phenomenon in which anatomical injury interplays with psychosocial factors. The considerable progress made in elucidating the aetiology of {{low back pain}} and the sharp increase in related health-care costs have not translated into a decreased prevalence of CLBP or the development of therapies with markedly improved efficacy and safety. Classic <b>medical-technical</b> interventions for CLBP always need to be placed in a broader therapeutic framework comprising physical, psychosocial and behavioural strategies, and must address the patient's welfare in a holistic context.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Guideline {{development}} and uptake are still suboptimal; {{they focus on}} clinical aspects of diseases rather than on improving the integration of care. We used a patient-centered network approach to develop five harmonized guidelines (one multidisciplinary and four monodisciplinary) around clinical pathways in fertility care. We assessed the feasibility of this approach with a detailed process evaluation of the guideline development, professionals' experiences, and time invested. METHODS: The network structure comprised the centrally located patients and the steering committee; a multidisciplinary guideline development group (gynecologists, physicians, urologists, clinical embryologists, clinical chemists, a medical psychologist, an occupational physician, and two patient representatives); and four monodisciplinary guideline development groups. The guideline development addressed patient-centered, organizational, and <b>medical-technical</b> key questions derived from interviews with patients and professionals. These questions were elaborated and distributed among the groups. We evaluated the project performance, participants' perceptions of the approach, and the time needed, including time for analysis of secondary sources, interviews with eight key figures, and a written questionnaire survey among 35 participants. RESULTS: Within 20 months, this approach helped us develop a multidisciplinary guideline for treating infertility and four related monodisciplinary guidelines for general infertility, unexplained infertility, male infertility, and semen analysis. The multidisciplinary guideline included recommendations for the main <b>medical-technical</b> matters and for organizational and patient-centered issues in clinical care pathways. The project was carried out as planned except for minor modifications and three extra consensus meetings. The participants were enthusiastic about the approach, the respect for autonomy, the project coordinator's role, and patient involvement. Suggestions for improvement included timely communication about guideline formats, the timeline, participants' responsibilities, and employing a librarian and more support staff. The 35 participants spent 4497 hours in total on this project.

The aim was to elucidate conditions for parents' participation {{in the care of}} their child in NICUs. Methods A field study with a hermeneutic lifeworld approach was used and data were collected at two NICUs through participative observations and interviews with representatives of management, staff and parents. Results The results point to a number of contradictions in the way parents were offered the opportunity to participate in neonatal intensive care. Management and staff both had good ambitions to develop ideal care that promoted parent participation. However, the care including the conditions for parental participation was driven by the terms of the staff, routines focusing on the <b>medical-technical</b> care and environment, and budgetary constraints. Conclusion The result shows that tangible strategies need to be developed in NICUs aimed at optimising conditions for parents to be present and involved in the care of their child. </p...|$|E

However, few studies found have focused on how nurses think and act as preceptors, hence providing a base for professional socialization to occur.

This was an ethnographic study guided by symbolic interactionism. A purposeful sampling of 13 precepting nurses was observed during the field work period. In addition, 16 staff nurses, purposively selected, and experienced in precepting, participated in focus group interviews. All text from field notes and interviews were read as a whole and analyzed following the ethnographic approach. Findings illustrated how nursing was mediated as the <b>medical-technical,</b> the administrative, and the caring role. Preceptors aimed for professionalism in their students by teaching the students to reflect on what they can do independently as nurses.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Genetic {{counselling}} for familial conditions {{during pregnancy}} {{may have some}} disadvantages, such as time pressure and induced worry. However, {{little is known about}} the reasons for and consequences of this timing of genetic counselling. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide an overview of research aimed at the counselee's reasons for seeking genetic counselling during pregnancy and the <b>medical-technical</b> and procedural consequences thereof. METHODS: We searched the databases Medline and PsycINFO for primary research papers, reviews and case reports, published from 1989 to June 2004. RESULTS: No papers could be retrieved which explicitly addressed our research questions. However, 34 papers, out of a total of 399 papers, covered issues with some relevance to our research questions. Limited knowledge and alertness towards genetics and a greater apparent relevance of genetic issues during pregnancy seemed to explain, at least partly, the timing of referral during pregnancy. Literature on the consequences of this timing for the quality of the genetic counselling process appeared to be scarce. These consequences, therefore, remain unclear. CONCLUSION: In the literature, little attention is paid to the various aspects of the timing of genetic counselling for familial conditions during pregnancy.

40|$|Objective: Generally, {{increasing}} {{attention is}} being paid {{to the quality of}} doctor-patient communication. However, children's contributions have been, until now, primarily ignored in communication research, although there are indications that considering their views increases satisfaction and compliance. In the communication during outpatient pediatric encounters and what factors were associated with children's contributions. Patients: Twenty-one consulting pediatricians video-taped a total of 302 consecutive outpatient encounters. Design. Multilevel analysis was used {{to take into account the}} similarity among encounters with the same pediatrician. Results. Children's contributions to the outpatient encounters were limited to 4 %. Pediatricians directed one out of every four statements to the child. Although pediatricians asked children a lot of medical questions (26 %), only a small part of the medical information (13 %) was directed at the children. Apart from social talk and laughter, the amount of pediatrician-child communication increased with children's age. Communication with children suffering from disorders of the nervous system seemed to differ from that with children suffering from other diseases. Allowing children more room in the medical visit did not seem to increase the duration of the visit. Conclusions. Although recent legislation requires children to be adequately informed, in pediatric outpatient encounters information still tends to be directed primarily at the parents. Children do get the opportunity to talk about social and psychosocial issues. Pediatricians may need to acquire similar communication skills to discuss <b>medical-technical</b> issues with the children. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Nurses are {{increasingly}} {{involved in the}} design of healthcare facilities. While their experience differs from that of patients, they are often expected to represent patients in design processes. Especially {{in the context of an}} emergency department (ED) patients’ state of mind alters their experience. Knowledge about the role of space in ED patients’ experience is limited. Our study aims to gain insight into this role and thus provide ED nurses with information to better represent ED patients’ perspective in design. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with 22 patients. The interviews were supported by visual material collected through ethnographic methods to facilitate participants’ reflection on the role of space in their experience. Participants were selected during their stay at the emergency department by convenience sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed in combination with the visual material through open and axial coding. Results: We found that the role of space in ED patients’ experience is affected by their altered sensory awareness and shaped by material, social and time-related aspects. These aspects are intertwined and influenced by the transit character of the emergency department. Discussion: The study indicates that paying attention to the role of space yields a nuanced understanding of ED patients’ experience. The challenge for hospital designers and staff lies in taking into account patients’ altered sensory awareness and in designing interventions that support staff in emphasizing a human approach without counteracting the <b>medical-technical</b> aspect of emergency care. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Effort-reward {{imbalance}} (ERI) and work-life imbalance (WLI) are recognised {{risk factors}} for work stress and burnout but have not been investigated conjointly so far and compared {{with each other in}} this regard. The present cross-sectional study provides initial evidence by studying associations of ERI and WLI with general stress and burnout simultaneously. METHODS: The study was based on survey data collected in 2007 among the personnel of a large public hospital in the canton of Zurich covering a random sample of 502 employees of all professions and positions. Prevalence rates, correlation coefficients, standardised regression coefficients and odds ratios were calculated as measures of association. RESULTS: Concerning the main research question and relating to the entire study sample, WLI was found to be more strongly associated with general stress and burnout than ERI. As stratified analyses with regard to burnout have shown, this applied especially to nursing, technical care and emergency staffs who account for more than three fifths of the study population. But for other professional categories like physicians, therapists and <b>medical-technical</b> personnel the opposite of a stronger association of ERI with burnout was found. Results also suggested that general stress plays a (rather minor) mediating role in the relationships between ERI and burnout and particularly between WLI and burnout. CONCLUSION: For the prevention of chronic stress and burnout one should consider both high efforts put into work as well as all job demands that are competing and interfering with family responsibilities or other private activities should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Little {{research}} has been done on how beliefs of infertility patients about their embryos are related to their disposition decisions. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe how patients speak about their embryos, in moral (e. g. status) and non-moral terms, and to investigate how patients' narratives are related to their disposition preferences. In-depth interviews based on the method of interpretative phenomenological analysis were conducted with patients undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment between May and July 2006. Seven couples and 11 female patients were interviewed. Six major themes emerged from the narratives of the participants when they spoke about their embryos: (i) a <b>medical-technical</b> perspective; (ii) feelings; (iii) genetic link to oneself and/or one's partner; (iv) symbolic meaning of the relationship between the infertile partners; (v) moral status and (vi) instrumental value. All but two participants spontaneously considered the embryo disposition options as a two-stage decision sequence. In the first step, they considered donation to another couple for reproductive purposes. At this stage, the presence of the themes 'genetic link' and 'symbol of the relationship' was linked with a clear reluctance to donate. In the second step of the decision-making process, the option of donation for research and discarding were considered. At this stage, participants' confidence in medical science and the instrumental value they attached to the embryo were related to their decisions. Patients' conceptualization of their embryos plays an important role in embryo disposition decisions. Our research showed that patients deal with these decisions in a two-stage decision sequence...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{recognised}} {{that when}} an organisation experiences a crisis {{caused by a}} natural disaster,publics {{are less likely to}} apportion responsibility to that organisation. This contrasts with crisesinvolving events such as product tampering, accidents or management transgressions where thelevel of organisational control is perceived or judged to be greater (Coombs, 2000, p. 86). In 2012,biomedical company Gambro’s manufacturing plant, based in Medolla, a small town of 6000 in theModena region of Italy, was hit by a devastating series of earthquakes. Damage to the plant hadsignificant and immediate impact for employees, customers and other key stakeholders, as operationsceased {{in the wake of the}} earthquakes. This chapter will reflect on Gambro’s crisis management response and their crisis communicationstrategies in response to the earthquakes and the ensuing rumours. An analysis ofGambro’s crisis response shows they acted to counteract stakeholder concerns and leveragewell-established stakeholder relationships. As Coombs (2000, 2006, 2007 a, 2007 b) makes clear,relationships are central to effective crisis management, and, although stakeholders often view anatural disaster as being removed from the organisation’s responsibility, this concession may not exist in a prolonged recovery period or where the stakeholders face a life or death outcome. Thesewere the very conditions Gambro faced. So, a relational approach can add depth to the attributionalanalysis of such a crisis (Coombs 2000, p. 86). To extend the analysis of crises caused bynatural disaster and Gambro’s crisis response, the chapter will also examine crisis communicationstrategies of similar disaster case studies.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the implementation of a broad-scale team resource management (TRM) program on safety culture in a Dutch eye hospital, detailing the program’s content and procedures. Aviation-based TRM training is recognized as a useful approach to increase patient safety, but little is known about how it affects safety culture. Design/methodology/approach – Pre- and post-assessments of the hospitals’ safety culture was based on interviews with ophthalmologists, anesthesiologists, residents, nurses, and support staff. Interim observations were made at training sessions and in daily hospital practice. Findings – The program consisted of safety audits of processes and (team) activities, interactive classroom training sessions by aviation experts, a flight simulator session, and video recording of team activities with subsequent feedback. Medical professionals considered aviation experts inspiring role models and respected their non-hierarchical external perspective and focus on <b>medical-technical</b> issues. The post-assessment showed that ophthalmologists and other hospital staff had become increasingly aware of safety issues. The multidisciplinary approach promoted social (team) orientation that replaced the former functionally-oriented culture. The number of reported near-incidents greatly increased; the number of wrong-side surgeries stabilized to a minimum after an initial substantial reduction. Research limitations/implications – The study was observational and the hospital’s variety of efforts to improve safety culture prevented us from establishing a causal relation between improvement and any one specific intervention. Originality/value – Aviation-based TRM training can be a useful to stimulate safety culture in hospitals. Safety and quality improvements are not single treatment interventions but complex socio-technical interventions. A multidisciplinary system approach and focus on “team” instead of “profession” seems both necessary and difficult in hospital care...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite {{the growing}} number of studies {{concerning}} quality of care for older people, {{there is a lack of}} studies depicting factors associated with good quality of care from the formal caregivers' perspective. The aim was to describe formal caregivers' perceptions of quality of care for older people in the community and explore factors associated with these perceptions. In total, 70 nursing assistants, 163 enrolled nurses and 198 registered nurses from 14 communities in central Sweden participated in the study. They filled out the following questionnaires: a modified version of Quality from the Patient's Perspective, Creative Climate Questionnaire, Stress of Conscience Questionnaire, items regarding education and competence, Health Index and Sense of coherence questionnaire. The overall response rate was 57  % (n =  431). Results: In the perceived reality of quality of care respondents assessed the highest mean value in the dimension <b>medical-technical</b> competence and physical technical conditions and lower values in the dimensions; identity-oriented approach, socio-cultural atmosphere and in the context specific dimension. The caregivers estimated their competence and health rather high, had lower average values in sense of coherence and organizational climate and low values in stress of conscience. Conculsions: The PR of quality of care were estimated higher among NA/ENs compared to RNs. Occupation, organizational climate and stress of conscience were factors associated with quality of care that explained 42  % of the variance. Competence, general health and sense of coherence were not significantly associated to quality of care. The mentioned factors explaining quality of care might be intertwined and showed that formal caregivers' working conditions are of great importance for quality of care...|$|E
40|$|If {{the male}} seed is {{not strong enough}} for impregnation, this {{weakness}} can be com-pensated by medical intervention in (parts of) the female body. If something in the unborn child is not quite right, this can be diagnosed and occasionally even surgically repaired—again by means of intervention in the female body. Paradoxically, now that women have achieved an unprecedented level of emancipation and autonomy, and their life fulfillment no longer exclusively lies in the (re) production of husband and child, the advent of new technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), prenatal diagnostics, and fetal surgery leads to an increasing subjection of women to medical treatment {{for the benefit of}} others. What has been acquired via the political and social front door—independence, relative freedom, right of self-determination—seems to slip away again through the medical-technological backdoor. The woman, reduced to a manipulable body, may once more cushion the problems of men and children. I probably formulate it less diplomatically than she does, but this issue, with its strong political connotations, is the main theme of van der Ploeg’s dissertation, Pros-thetic Bodies.

40|$|Objectives This {{qualitative}} study explores Nigerian {{health care professionals}}’ concepts of good dying/a good death and how telemedicine technologies and services would fit the current Nigerian palliative care practice. Materials and Methods Supported by the Centre for Palliative Care Nigeria (CPCN) and the University College Hospital (UCH) in Ibadan, Nigeria, the authors organized three focus groups with Nigerian health care professionals interested in palliative care, unstructured interviews with key role players for palliative care and representatives of telecom companies, and field visits to primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare clinics that provided palliative care.
