5|$|Another {{factor that}} helped Tchaikovsky's music become popular was {{a shift in}} {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the <b>music</b> <b>itself.</b> Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E

Harris explained that Hi-5 was primarily a television series, but the <b>music</b> <b>itself</b> had the ability to stand alone. She expected that the series would initially become formatted into international versions, however was so confident with the original cast that the Australian series was sold overseas instead.|$|E

5|$|Interest in Monteverdi revived in {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries among music {{scholars}} in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the <b>music</b> <b>itself</b> began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the Orfeo score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following {{the discovery of the}} L'incoronazione manuscript in 1888 and that of Il ritorno in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or other, during {{the first quarter of the}} 20th century: L'Orfeo in May 1911, L'incoronazione in February 1913 and Il ritorno in May 1925.|$|E
5|$|Symphonic Suite Final Fantasy is an {{arranged}} soundtrack {{album of}} music from Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy II, composed by Nobuo Uematsu, arranged by Katsuhisa Hattori and his son Takayuki Hattori, and performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra.

The original release bears the catalog number H28X-10007, and the re-release bears the catalog number PSCR-5253.

5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The <b>music</b> <b>itself</b> dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E

5|$|The kulintang {{repertoire}} has no fixed labels {{because the}} <b>music</b> <b>itself</b> {{is not considered}} a fixed entity. Due to the fact it is orally transmitted, the repertoire itself is considered something always {{in a state of}} flux due to two primary reasons. First, standardized titles weren’t considered a priority. Though to the musicians themselves the melodies would sound similar, the labels they would place on a particular rhythmic mode or style could vary even from household to household within that same village. For the musicians, the emphasis is on the excitement and pleasure of playing the music without much regard to what the piece was referred to as. Secondly, because musicians improvised their pieces regularly, modes and styles were continually revised and changed as they were passed on to a newer generation of musicians, making the pieces and therefore the labels attached to them relevant only during a certain frame of time.|$|E

25|$|The {{tradition}} of kulintang ensemble <b>music</b> <b>itself</b> is regional, predating {{the establishment of}} present-day Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.

25|$|Bebop {{differed}} drastically {{from the}} straightforward compositions {{of the swing}} era and was instead characterized by fast tempos, asymmetrical phrasing, intricate melodies, and rhythm sections that expanded on their role as tempo-keepers.

Instead, bebop appeared to sound racing, nervous, erratic and often fragmented.

The first two new albums were issued at the same time, The Remixes and Live in Concert (the latter of which was a 1981 recording). These were only for sale on the Internet. A new collection of Glitter's chart hit singles followed, The Best of Gary Glitter. In 2006 his back catalogue was made available via the Internet from sites such as iTunes and eMusic.|$|E
25|$|Northwest Spain (Asturias, Galicia and Cantabria) {{is home to}} a {{distinct}} musical tradition extending back into the Middle Ages. The signature instrument of the region is the gaita (bagpipe). The gaita is often accompanied by a snare drum, called the tamboril, and is played in processional marches. Other instruments include the requinta, a kind of fife, as well as harps, fiddles, rebec and zanfona (hurdy-gurdy). The <b>music</b> <b>itself</b> runs the gamut from uptempo muinieras to stately marches. As in the Basque Country, Cantabrian music also features intricate arch and stick dances but the tabor pipe does not play as an important role as it does in Basque music. Traditionally, Galician music included a type of chanting song known as alalas. Alalas may include instrumental interludes, and were believed to have a very long history, based on legends.|$|E
25|$|The {{next few}} years saw Rundgren {{recording}} under the pseudonym TR-i ("Todd Rundgren interactive") for two albums. The first of these, 1993's No World Order, consisted of hundreds of seconds-long snippets of music, that could be combined in various ways to suit the listener. Initially targeted for the Philips CD-i platform, No World Order featured interactive controls for tempo, mood, and other parameters, along with pre-programmed mixes by Rundgren himself, Bob Clearmountain, Don Was and Jerry Harrison. The disc was also released for PC and Macintosh and in two versions on standard audio CD, the continuous mix disc No World Order and, later, the more song-oriented No World Order Lite. The <b>music</b> <b>itself</b> was quite a departure from Rundgren's previous work, with a dance/techno feel and much rapping by Rundgren. The follow-up, The Individualist (1995), featured interactive video content, that could be viewed or in one case, played; {{it was a simple}} video game along with the music, which was more rock-oriented than No World Order.|$|E
