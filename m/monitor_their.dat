5|$|Atangana {{won over}} other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and {{intervention}} on their behalf. He lavished attention on visitors {{from out of}} town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him to <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained {{a substantial amount of}} wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{decompression}} sickness after diving {{can be managed}} through effective decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon, though it remains to some degree unpredictable. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use decompression tables or dive computers to limit or <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> exposure and to control their ascent speed and decompression procedures. If DCS is contracted, it is usually treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber. If treated early, there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 2000, Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN {{human rights}} {{conventions}} and, in 2004, the government approved {{the establishment of}} the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence. Saudi Arabia was one of only eight countries that did not accept the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it was launched in 1948. Now, only Saudi Arabia remains openly opposed to the declaration. In response to the continuing criticism of its human rights record, the Saudi government points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{exclusively}} {{reported a}} new storyline for Hollyoaks as Mercedes and Joe Roscoe's (Ayden Callaghan) unborn baby would die before birth in scenes to air in early November 2015. It was revealed the show {{had been working}} with stillbirth charities, Count the Kicks and Sands to produce various ways mothers can <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> unborn baby's progress. Rival soap opera, EastEnders, had produced a similar storyline when Shabnam Masood and Kush Kazemi (Rakhee Thakrar and Davood Ghadami) lost their son Zaair before he was born, but fans were reassured the storyline had been planned {{months prior to the}} announcement of EastEnders storyline. It was revealed Mercedes would first admit her fears to John Paul and they visited the hospital where a doctor would inform them that their son had died. Kilkelly teased that the storyline would see how Mercedes coped with the situation, how it affects Mercedes and Joe's relationship, as well as seeing the permanent return of Myra.|$|E
5|$|Lenin tasked Trotsky with {{establishing}} a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, {{and with his}} support, Trotsky organised a Revolutionary Military Council in September 1918, remaining its chairman until 1925. Recognising their valuable military experience, Lenin agreed that officers from the old Tsarist army could serve in the Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils to <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> activities. The Reds held control of Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, {{as well as most}} of Great Russia, while the Whites were located largely on the former Empire's peripheries. The latter were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered, and because their ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities. Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the White Terror, a campaign of violence against perceived Bolshevik supporters which was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror. Both White and Red Armies were responsible for attacks against Jewish communities, prompting Lenin to issue a condemnation of anti-Semitism, blaming prejudice against Jews on capitalist propaganda.|$|E
5|$|The {{essay was}} {{extensively}} {{discussed in the}} media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E

5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee to <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Soviet Navy and Communist Bloc's fishing fleets began {{operating}} around the British Isles in increasing numbers. The British public began taking {{an interest in}} their operations as civilian fisherman began complaining about their presence. Operation Chacewater began, in which Coastal Command began monitoring their movements, in particular other vessels that loitered in areas covering the arrival and departure routes for Royal Navy nuclear submarine forces. Soon after, counter operations such as Operation Adjutant were carried out, which was aimed at searching for Soviet submarines. The main threat from the Soviets in the Atlantic came from the Soviet Northern Fleet and in early 1965 most of the Command's units were concentrated in No. 18 Group RAF, based in Scotland to <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> activities. No recorded confrontation took place between Coastal Command and Soviet naval forces during this time, although both the Shackletons from RAF Ballykelly and frigates operating out of Londonderry would 'ping' the Soviet submarines carrying out surveillance off the mouth of Lough Foyle. In at least one instance, a Ballykelly-based Shackleton lost its radome when making a mock attack on the Russian sub.|$|E
5|$|Symes was not {{a regular}} in the Shrewsbury side {{at the start of}} the 2007–08 season, making 12 starts and nine {{substitute}} appearances as he scored just three goals. In January 2008, he rejoined Macclesfield Town with defender Neil Ashton on loan until the end of the season. Despite his exit, Shrewsbury manager Gary Peters said the pair could both return to Shrewsbury at the end of the season. He played his first Macclesfield game in a 1–0 defeat to Peterborough on 12 January, and scored his first goal as Macclesfield drew 1–1 with Milton Keynes Dons on 29 January. It was his only goal in his first eight games and he was dropped for Macclesfield's 3–0 defeat against Peterborough on 23 February when he came on as a substitute in the 44th minute. He returned to the side a week later for new manager Keith Alexander's first match against Notts County when Macclesfield were denied a victory by a late goal from Richard Butcher. While Symes was on loan at Macclesfield, Shrewsbury manager Peters left the club and was replaced with Paul Simpson, who promised Symes and other players out on loan that he would <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> progress and build his own opinion of them. Macclesfield were involved in a relegation fight during Symes' stay and it was not until a 1–0 victory over Chesterfield on the penultimate weekend of the season that Macclesfield ensured they would be in the league the following season. Symes played 14 games, four as substitute, but scored just one goal during his stay with Macclesfield.|$|E

25|$|As to {{structural}} plasticity {{induced by}} bilingualism, it {{has recently been}} shown that bilinguals, as compared to monolinguals, have increased grey matter density in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC is a brain structure that helps subjects to <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> actions and {{it is part of}} the attentional and executive control system. Bilinguals have increased grey matter in this brain area because they continuously <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> languages in order to avoid unwanted language interferences from the language not in use. The continuous use of the ACC in turn induces plastic neural effects. This may be the same reason why bilinguals are faster than monolinguals on many attentional control tasks.|$|E
