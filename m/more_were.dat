5|$|A {{monument}} {{was raised}} in 790 although {{the name of the}} ruler responsible is not preserved. Two <b>more</b> <b>were</b> raised in 800 and three in 810. No monument was erected to commemorate the important Bak'tun-ending of 830 and it is probable that political authority had alreadly collapsed at this time. Important cities such as Oxpemul, Nadzcaan and La Muñeca that were Calakmul's vassals at one time now erected their own monuments, where before they had raised very few; some continued producing new monuments until as late as 889. This was a process that paralleled events at Tikal. However, there is strong evidence of an elite presence at the city continuing until AD 900, possibly even later.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make <b>more</b> <b>were</b> not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.|$|E

The Indian military was placed on standby to undertake search-and-rescue missions immediately after the storms' passage. Fourteen districts of Gujarat were placed on red alert, the highest level of preparedness. Seven emergency control centers were set up across the country and officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about the approaching storm.|$|E

5|$|Angela caused {{severe damage}} in the Philippines. It is {{estimated}} that 119 people perished, and 192 <b>more</b> <b>were</b> injured. Additionally, 	28 remained missing following the storm. In total, 219,178 people, or 39,095 families, were affected by the cyclone. About 33,309 homes sustained some degree of damage. The typhoon's intense winds and heavy rainfall triggered flooding and damaged crops. The hardest-hit areas were in the Cagayan province. Overall, the storm left approximately $8 million (1989 USD) in damage across the region. The same area was impacted by Typhoon Sarah in September. Angela forced thousands of residents to seek shelter in evacuation centers.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the run-up to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many <b>more</b> <b>were</b> cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with many fortresses, Golubac's {{structure}} was modified over time. For years, there were only five towers. Later, four <b>more</b> <b>were</b> added. The towers were all built as squares, a sign of the fortress' age, showing that battles were still fought with cold steel. Once firearms came into use, the Turks fortified the western towers with cannon ports and polygonal or cylindrical reinforcements up to two metres thick. After the Hungarian raid in 1481, they added the final tower, complete with cannon embrasures and galleries.|$|E

5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 <b>more</b> <b>were</b> invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money.
