But I find that if it be fused with <b>metallic</b> <b>antimony,</b> a new sulphuret is formed, containing much more of the metal than the former, and separating distinctly, when fused, both from the pure metal on the one hand, and the ordinary gray sulphuret on the other.

50|$|In pre-modern medicine, antihecticum poterii was {{a celebrated}} {{chemical}} preparation {{for use in}} hectic disorders. It was prepared by melting together one part each of tin and chalybeated regulus (the <b>metallic</b> form of <b>antimony,</b> impregnated with iron) in a large crucible, then gradually adding three parts potassium nitrate. When the reaction has run its course, the product is washed with warm water to remove traces of salt.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{interest}} in reversible conversion reaction process versus lithium in transition metal oxides raises a fundamental question regarding {{the role played}} by the metallic cobalt or the electrolyte. In this work, we report on the electrochemical reactivity of cobalt oxide and antimonide, <b>metallic</b> cobalt and <b>antimony</b> thin films toward lithium. Nanometer thin films were prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using a stoichiometric target. The obtained films were characterized from their chemical and electrochemical properties by means of various complementary techniques such as x-ray diffraction (XRD), electronic microscopy and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM).

It was purported to be written by a Benedictine monk, writing under the name Basilius Valentinus in the 15th century; if it were authentic, which it is not, it would predate Biringuccio.|$|E

The effects of the thermal annealing on the structural, optical and electrical properties on the sulfosalt Sn-Sb-S films have been investigated. The estimation of elemental composition was carried out with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy.

60|$|And this {{hypothesis}} is entirely {{in harmony with the}} phenomena of allotropy. Various substances, conventionally distinguished as simple, have several forms under which they present quite different properties. The semi-transparent, colourless, extremely active substance called phosphorus may be so changed as to become opaque, dark red, and inert. Like changes are known to occur in some gaseous, non-metallic elements, as oxygen; and also in <b>metallic</b> elements, as <b>antimony.</b> These total changes of properties, brought about without any changes to be called chemical, are interpretable only as due to molecular rearrangements; and, by showing that difference of property is producible by difference of arrangement, they support the inference otherwise to be drawn, that the properties of different elements result from differences of arrangement arising by the compounding and recompounding of ultimate homogeneous units.|$|R

50|$|An Antimony pill is a pill {{made from}} <b>metallic</b> <b>antimony.</b> It {{was a popular}} remedy in the nineteenth century, and {{it was used to}} purge and {{revitalise}} the bowels.

50|$|The size {{of those}} used in England and America from the 17th century were about two inches high and about two in diameter. They held about four ounces of wine. Although there were other kinds of emetics in this time period available, many {{households}} possessed an antimonial cup of their own. The instructions typically were to fill the antimonial cup at 6 PM with white wine and take all the wine at 7 AM {{the next morning to}} induce vomiting. A child was instructed to take just half the amount. If it had not induced vomiting within a couple of hours, then they were to take {{the other half of the}} liquid. This method of using wine to gather a small portion of the <b>metallic</b> part of <b>antimony</b> was dependent on the acidity of the wine. If the wine was too acidic, then the concoction could become too strong for the body, resulting in poisoning or even death.|$|R

50|$|Four allotropes of {{antimony}} are known: {{a stable}} metallic form and three metastable forms (explosive, black and yellow). Elemental antimony is a brittle, silver-white shiny metalloid. When slowly cooled, molten antimony crystallizes in a trigonal cell, isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic. A rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony trichloride. When scratched {{with a sharp}} implement, an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as <b>metallic</b> <b>antimony</b> forms; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor. It has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic, it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100 Â°C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of stibine (SbH3) at â90 Â°C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.|$|E
5000|$|We have {{referred}} {{in the past}} to the economy which used to be practiced by our fore-fathers. Thus, for instance, it was customary to use leeches over and over again and there are instances of infection with syphilis by leeches that had been previously used on luetic patients. But we believe that the everlasting cathartic pill beats everything in the line of economy. This pill was a little bullet composed of <b>metallic</b> <b>antimony</b> which had or was believed to have the property of purging as often as it was swallowed. It is not inconceivable that it might have had such property, for it is possible that a minute amount was dissolved by the gastro-intestinal juices and this amount, plus the suggestion, was sufficient to produce cathartic action. Then again the everlasting pill probably aided peristalsis by its mechanical weight and motion. The bullet was passed out, recovered from the feces and used over and over again. This, as Dr. J. A. Paris says, was economy in right earnest, for a single pill would serve a whole family during their lives and might be transmitted as an heirloom to posterity.|$|E
50|$|Sometra {{was founded}} {{as a private}} firm in 1939 {{for the purpose of}} zinc smelting. Initially, it had three {{distillation}} furnaces, with five more added in 1948, the year it was nationalized by the new communist regime. Its initial capacity was 3000 tons of zinc per year, expanded to 4000 tons in 1946. Between 1950 and 1960, capacity was gradually expanded to 28,000 tons a year. In 1955, a unit for producing sulfuric acid was inaugurated. The unit was expanded in 1966, a year that also saw the introduction of a system for agglomerating concentrates of zinc and lead. This was the culmination of a four-year program of thorough restructuring and modernization, with the new equipment having a capacity of 30,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of lead bullion per year. The 1967-1970 period saw the introduction of an electrolytic lead refining system (capacity 24,000 tons a year); a unit for extracting metallic bismuth for technical and pharmaceutical use from anode sludge, as well as gold and silver alloys and antimony slag; a unit for zinc sulfate production; a unit for zinc and ammonium chloride production; and an air preheater. Capacity was doubled between 1975 and 1984. A second zinc and lead extraction unit, with annual capacities of 30,000 tons (zinc) and 20,000 tons (lead) went online, as well as two thermal zinc refineries and greater cadmium refining. In 1983, <b>metallic</b> <b>antimony</b> production began by extracting the metal from slag, along with sodium thioantimoniate and stibnite. In 1984, a second blast furnace began operation, so that the old components built from 1939 to 1957 were retired. Between 1985 and 1989, zinc powder production began and a system for collecting residual gases was put in place. In 1988, a 250 m high chimney was built. By 1989, the plant was annually generating 43,490 tons of sulfuric acid (against a projected capacity of 126,000 tons), 23,519 tons of electrolytic lead (below the 38,000 tons projected), 29,840 tons of pure zinc, 2,094 tons of zinc powder, 19 tons of cadmium, 29 tons of bismuth and 195 tons of antimony.|$|E

This paper reports doping SnS films with antimony, a potential n-type dopant. Small amounts of antimony (~ 1 %) were found to greatly increase the electrical resistance of the SnS. The resulting intrinsic SnS(Sb) films {{could be used for}} the insulating layer in a p-i-n design for solar cells. Higher concentrations (~ 5 %) of antimony did not convert the SnS(Sb) to low-resistivity n-type conductivity, but instead the films retain such a high resistance that the conductivity type could not be determined.
