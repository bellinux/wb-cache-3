40|$|Balamuthia mandrillaris amoebas are {{recognized}} as a causative agent of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, a disease that is usually fatal. They were first recognized when isolated from the brain of a <b>mandrill</b> <b>baboon</b> that died in the San Diego Zoo Wild Life Animal Park. Subsequently, the amoebas {{have been found in}} a variety of animals, including humans (young and old, immunocompromised and immunocompetent persons), in countries around the world. Until recently, the amoebas had not been recovered from the environment and their free-living status was in question. The recovery of a Balamuthia amoeba from a soil sample taken from a plant at the home of a child from California, USA, who died of Balamuthia amoebic encephalitis, was reported previously. In a continued investigation, a second amoeba was isolated from soil that was obtained from an outdoor potted plant in a spatially unrelated location. A comparison of these two environmental amoebas that were isolated from different soils with the amoeba that was obtained from the child’s clinical specimen is reported here. Included are the isolation procedure for the amoebas, their growth requirements, their immunological response to anti-Balamuthia serum, their sensitivity to a selection of antimicrobials and sequence analysis of their 16 S rRNA gene. The evidence is consistent that the amoebas isolated from both soil samples and the clinical isolate obtained from the Californian child are B. mandrillaris...|$|E
50|$|Trypanolytic {{factors are}} {{found only in}} a few species {{including}} humans, gorillas, <b>mandrills,</b> <b>baboons</b> and sooty mangabeys. This appears to be because haptoglobin related protein and apolipoprotein L-1 are unique to primates. This suggests these gene appeared in the primate genome -.|$|R
40|$|We {{would like}} to report two {{tuberculosis}} cases {{in a group of}} 10 <b>mandrill</b> <b>baboons</b> (Mandrillus sphinx) at the Lisbon zoo. In early 2006, a 16 -year-old female, brought in from France in 1998, started to show signs of apathy, coughing and weight loss. Identical clinical signs were observed shortly after, in its threeyear-old daughter. Tuberculosis in zoo animals is uncommon in Portugal. This case reinforces the need for continuous veterinary surveillance of zoo animals as they could act as reservoirs for human pathogens...|$|R
50|$|After {{some time}} spent working as Research Associate to Dr. Alan Dixson on {{marmoset}} reproductive sex behaviour in the labs of the British Medical Research Council (1989-90) {{and later in}} the field studies of <b>Mandrill</b> <b>baboons</b> in the jungles of Gabon, West Africa (WHO attache, 1990-91), Dickinson then returned to the University of Edinburgh, where he was invited to conduct a longitudinal study concerned with the characterisation of intelligent systems (both real and artificial), involving experimental cognition work with human children, birds, monkeys, robots and human adult clinical outpatients. It was during this latter time spent in the Laboratory for Cognitive Neuroscience (1990-1999) that, under the direction of Dr. Brendan McGonigle, Dickinson prepared his PhD thesis, concurrent with his employment in the Department of Psychology as a Lecturer in Comparative Psychology and Neuroscience.|$|R
50|$|Popular {{political}} {{practices of}} the time reinforced colonial rule by legitimizing European (and/ or Japanese) male authority, and also legitimizing female and non-mother-country race inferiority through studies of Craniology, Comparative Anatomy, and Phrenology. Biologists, naturalists, anthropologists, and ethnologists of the 19th century were focused {{on the study of}} colonized indigenous women, {{as in the case of}} Georges Cuvier's study of Sarah Baartman. Such cases embraced a natural superiority and inferiority relationship between the races based on the observations of naturalists' from the mother-countries. European studies along these lines gave rise to the perception that African women's anatomy, and especially genitalia, resembled those of <b>mandrills,</b> <b>baboons,</b> and monkeys, thus differentiating colonized Africans from what were viewed as the features of the evolutionarily superior, and thus rightfully authoritarian, European woman.|$|R

5000|$|Extending their {{partnership}} {{into the}} realm of comics, Zaarour and Dolivet co-created the graphic novel series Monkey Bizness. The first volume of this series was released in 2010. Published under their respective pseudonyms, Pozla and ElDiablo, Zaarour is credited as the illustrator of this series and Dolivet as the writer. Zaarour's wife, Miaw, handled the coloring. Monkey Bizness marked Zaarour's first foray into creating comic book art professionally. The series focuses on Jack <b>Mandrill</b> the <b>baboon</b> and Hammerfist the gorilla, as they navigate the criminal underworld of a post-apocalyptic city known as [...] "Los Animales". Volume 2 of Monkey Bizness was released in 2013, and Volume 3 was released in 2017.|$|R

50|$|Extant {{primates}} {{exhibit a}} broad range of variation in sexual size dimorphism (SSD), or sexual divergence in body size. It ranges from species such as gibbons and strepsirrhines (including Madagascar’s lemurs) in which males and females have almost the same body sizes to species such as chimpanzees and bonobos in which males’ body sizes are larger than females’ body sizes. In extreme cases, males have body sizes that are almost twice as large as those of females, as in some species including gorillas, orangutans, <b>mandrills,</b> hamadryas <b>baboons,</b> and proboscis monkeys.Patterns of size dimorphism exhibited in primates may correspond to the intensity of competition between members of the same sex for access to mates-intrasexual competition. Some callitrichine and strepsirrhine primates are, however, characterized by the reverse dimorphism, a phenomenon in which females are larger than males. For lemurs, for example, females’ dominance over males accounts for the reverse dimorphism.|$|R
50|$|After half {{a century}} of {{development}} the Shanghai Zoo {{has become one of the}} best ecological gardens in Shanghai. The zoo houses and exhibits more than 6,000 animals, among which are 600 Chinese animals that include giant pandas, golden snub-nosed monkeys, lions, South China tigers, hoopoe, black bulbuls, scimitar-horned oryx, great hornbills and Bactrian camels. Animals from other parts of the world include chimpanzees, giraffes, polar bears, kangaroos, gorillas, ring tailed lemurs, common marmosets, spider monkeys, african wild dogs, olive <b>baboons,</b> <b>mandrills,</b> Canadian lynxes and maned wolves. The zoo is constantly developing and improving the animal enclosures in order to provide better environments for the animals and a pleasurable experience for visitors.|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of relatedness {{is a key}} determinant {{in the evolution of}} social behavior in primates. Humans are able to detect kin visually in their own species using facial phenotypes, and facial resemblance in turn influences both prosocial behaviors and mating decisions. This suggests that cognitive abilities that allow facial kin detection in conspecifics have been favored in the species by kin selection. We investigated the extent to which humans are able to recognize kin visually by asking human judges to assess facial resemblance in 4 other primate species (common chimpanzees, western lowland gorillas, <b>mandrills,</b> and chacma <b>baboons)</b> on the basis of pictures of faces. Humans achieved facial interspecific kin recognition in all species except baboons. Facial resemblance is a reliable indicator of relatedness in at least chimpanzees, gorillas, and mandrills, and future work should explore if the primates themselves also share the ability to detect kin facially...|$|R
40|$|We {{established}} chromosomal homologies {{between all}} chromosomes {{of the human}} karyotype and that of an old world monkey (Macaca fuscata) by chromosomal in situ suppression (CISS) hybridization with human chromosome specific DNA libraries. Except for the human chromosome 2 library and limited cross-hybridization of X and Y chromosome libraries all human DNA libraries hybridized to single GTG-banded macaque chromosomes. Only three macaque chromosomes (2, 7, 13) were each hybridized by two separate human libraries (7 and 21, 14 and 15, 20 and 22 respectively). Thus, an unequivocally high degree of synteny between human and macaque chromosomes has been maintained for more than 20 million years. As previously suggested, both Papionini (macaques, <b>baboons,</b> <b>mandrills</b> and cercocebus monkeys, {{all of which have}} nearly identical karyotypes) and humans are chromosomally conservative. The results suggest, that CISS hybridization can be expected to become an indispensable tool in comparative chromosome and gene mapping and will help clarify chromosomal phylogenies with speed and accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|Tooth wear in {{primates}} {{is caused}} by aging and ecological factors. However, comparative data that {{would allow us to}} delineate the contribution of each of these factors are lacking. Here, we contrast age-dependent molar tooth wear by scoring percent of dentine exposure (PDE) in two wild African primate populations from Gabonese forest and Kenyan savanna habitats. We found that forest-dwelling mandrills exhibited significantly higher PDE with age than savanna yellow <b>baboons.</b> <b>Mandrills</b> mainly feed on large tough food items, such as hard-shell fruits, and inhabit an ecosystem with a high presence of mineral quartz. By contrast, baboons consume large amounts of exogenous grit that adheres to underground storage organs but the proportion of quartz in the soils where baboons live is low. Our results support the hypothesis that not only age but also physical food properties and soil composition, particularly quartz richness, are factors that significantly impact tooth wear. We further propose that the accelerated dental wear in mandrills resulting in flatter molars with old ag...|$|R
40|$|In {{species with}} {{separate}} sexes, social systems can {{differ in the}} relative variances of male versus female reproductive success. Papionin monkeys (macaques, mangabeys, <b>mandrills,</b> drills, <b>baboons,</b> and geladas) exhibit hallmarks of a high variance in male reproductive success, including a female-biased adult sex ratio and prominent sexual dimorphism. To explore the potential genomic consequences of such sex differences, we used a reduced representation genome sequenc-ing approach to quantifying polymorphism at sites on autosomes and sex chromosomes of the tonkean macaque (Macaca tonkeana), a species endemic to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The ratio of nucleotide diversity of the X chromosome {{to that of the}} autosomes was less than the value (0. 75) expected with a 1 : 1 sex ratio and no sex differences in the variance in reproductive success. However, the significance of this difference was dependent on which outgroup was used to standardize diversity levels. Using a new model that includes the effects of varying population size, sex differences in mutation rate between the autosomes and X chromosome, and GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) or selection on GC content, we found that the maximum-likelihood estimate of the ratio of effective population size of the X chromosome to that of the autosomes was 0. 68, which did not differ significantly from 0. 75. We also found evidence for 1) a higher level of purifying selection on genic than nongenic regions, 2) gBGC or natural selection favoring increased GC content, 3) a dynamic demography characterized by population growth and contraction, 4) a higher mutation rate i...|$|R
40|$|African trypanosomiasis, {{caused by}} {{extracellular}} protozoan parasites (Trypanosoma), is, a major disease in cattle that affects agricultural production in broad regions of Africa. The, parasites are transmitted between mammals by infected tsetse flies (Glossina sp.) during, blood feeding. Both wild and domestic animals are potential reservoirs of the parasites for, human infection resulting in human sleeping sickness. In order {{to control the}} disease, we, proposed a new strategy for creating resistance in cattle to African trypanosomiasis by a, transgenic approach. Using the technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer (cloning), we aim, to establish genetically modified cattle on the background of a Kenyan indigenous breed –, Kenyan Boran, which carry a gene that imparts resistance to African trypanosomes. The, gene, apoL- 1, encodes the key trypanolytic component of baboon’s protective Trypanosome, Lytic Factor (TLF) against both cattle and human infective trypanosomes. TLFs are only, found in humans, gorillas, sooty mangabys, <b>mandrills</b> and <b>baboons</b> and govern resistance, to different African trypanosome species. Baboons are remarkably resistant to all African, trypanosomes due to its TLF, specifically apoL- 1. Previous research with transgenic mice, {{has shown that the}} baboon apoL- 1 product was able to confer protection to the mice, against trypanosome infection. Therefore, we hypothesise that expression of baboon apoL-, 1 in cattle will also endow endogenous resistance to trypanosomes. As the proof of concept, step, we have successfully set up and tested the platform for somatic cell nuclear transfer, using Boran bovine embryonic fibroblasts (BEFs). In total, two cloned calves were born by, caesarean section operation. One calf survives up to today and is in good health. Attempts, are ongoing to introduce the apoL- 1 gene into two of the BEFs lines for future production, of transgenic cattle. ...|$|R
40|$|Leishmaniasis causes {{significant}} {{morbidity and}} mortality, constituting an important {{global health problem}} for which there are few effective drugs. Given the urgent need to identify a safe and effective Leishmania vaccine to help prevent the two million new cases of human leishmaniasis worldwide each year, all reasonable efforts {{to achieve this goal}} should be made. This includes the use of animal models that are as close to leishmanial infection in humans as is practical and feasible. Old world monkey species (macaques, <b>baboons,</b> <b>mandrills</b> etc.) have the closest evolutionary relatedness to humans among the approachable animal models. The Asian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are quite susceptible to leishmanial infection, develop a human-like disease, exhibit antibodies to Leishmania and parasite-specific T-cell mediated immune responses both in vivo and in vitro, and can be protected effectively by vaccination. Results from macaque vaccine studies could also prove useful in guiding the design of human vaccine trials. This review summarizes our current knowledge on this topic and proposes potential approaches that may result in the more effective use of the macaque model to maximize its potential to help the development of an effective vaccine for human leishmaniasis...|$|R
50|$|In the {{rainforest}} interior, the crowned eagle occupies a unique niche and it is, by far, {{the largest and}} most dominant raptorial bird in such areas. Other large predators that may exploit similar prey in the same forested habitats include leopard (Panthera pardus), African golden cat (Profelis aurata), Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis), African rock python (Python sebae), chimpanzee and larger monkeys, like <b>mandrill</b> and <b>baboons.</b> All of these competitors are much heavier bodied than a crowned eagle, ranging in size from the 10 kg golden cat to the 225 kg Nile crocodile. While the reptiles usually hunt on the ground or near water, felids, large monitor lizards and baboons can be assured thieves who will climb trees and take crowned eagle kills. In a comparison of the monkey-based diets of rainforest crowned eagles with leopards and chimpanzees, the big cat was estimated to take prey averaging 11.27 kg, about twice the average estimated prey weight for crowned eagles in the same ecosystem, and the great ape 6.9 kg, about a kilogram more than that of the crowned eagle. In South Africa, it is reported that Cape porcupines and bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) are attracted to trees used for prey consumption by crowned eagles, in order to scavenge the sinew and bone that's discarded to the ground. In more mixed eastern and southern habitats, the diversity of large predators is higher and the crowned eagle, despite its great power, is not assured {{at the top of the}} avian food chain. Amongst the more formidable raptors, the martial, the Verreaux's and the crowned eagles, may live on the same hillside and all hunt hyraxes. While the Verreaux's eagle is something of a rock hyrax specialist, the martial eagle, even more so than the crowned eagle, has an extremely broad prey base. All these eagles will readily steal the prey caught by the other raptors. However, the great eagles are segregated by both their habitat preferences and main hunting techniques, which make it possible for the species to successfully nest within a few kilometers of one another. While the crowned eagle lives in denser woods and hunts from a perch, the martial eagle tends to live in more open wooded savanna habitats and tends to hunt on the wing at a high flying height (thanks to its superb vision) and the Verreaux's eagle lives in precipitous mountain habitats and tends to contour-hunt, hugging the uneven contours of the rocks while flying, only a few meters high. Like the martial eagle, the crowned eagle has been known to prey on smaller raptorial birds. Crowned eagles may be killed as prey by large carnivores. Two eagle reintroduced into the wild were killed by predators, one by a leopard that surprised a male on a monkey kill in the rain, and the other by a crocodile that took a female as she ate a young bushbuck kill near the water's edge. In Kenya, cases of predation on nestlings and fledglings have reportedly involved honey badgers (Mellivora capensis) and cobras. In one extraordinary case, an adult male Sanje mangabey (Cercocebus sanjei), estimated to weigh 10 to 12 kg, attacked an adult female crowned eagle that was trying to hunt his troop, jumping onto her back when she was in mid-flight and killing her with a strong bite. This is the first confirmed instance of a monkey killing an adult crowned eagle. In one case, a female who tried to hunt an adult female baboon was found seriously wounded after a male baboon interceded, though the eagle was captured, medically treated and lived on in captivity. In another case involving potential prey turning the tables, an eagle that was trying to hunt an incubating female Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus) was quickly attacked by her mate, who flew at the eagle and bit repeatedly at it, causing the eagle to quickly withdraw. The average life expectancy for crowned eagles is 14 years.|$|R
