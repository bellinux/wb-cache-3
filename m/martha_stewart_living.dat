2500|$|Following {{her release}} from prison in March 2005, Stewart {{launched}} a highly publicized comeback and was once again involved in <b>Martha</b> <b>Stewart</b> <b>Living.</b> Offerings of her company's Martha Stewart Everyday line at Kmart were expanded to include {{a new line of}} ready-made home furnishings, and its mass market interior paint line became available at the larger Sears stores.

Stewart returned to daytime television with The Martha Stewart Show and appeared in an adapted version of The Apprentice (called [...] ). Both shows premiered in September 2005, and both were produced by Mark Burnett. Her prime time Apprentice spin-off received poor ratings, which some attribute to popular dislike for the opportunistic tone of the network's massive promotional campaign and to NBC's slotting the show up against the hit drama Lost.
