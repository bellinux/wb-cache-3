5000|$|Alice or Bob may use {{a client}} {{connected}} to a corporate email system, such as IBM Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange. These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product's Internet <b>mail</b> <b>gateway</b> which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.|$|E

5000|$|For email, {{interoperability}} {{between the}} [...] "Grey Book" [...] email addressing style of user@UK.AC.SITE and Internet addresses {{of the style}} user@site.ac.uk was achieved by way of <b>mail</b> <b>gateways.</b> However, problems were caused when the least significant part of an Internet address matched the most significant part of an NRS address and vice versa. (The classic joke was that e-mail intended for UK universities ended up in Czechoslovakia, since many JANET e-mail addresses were of the form user@UK.AC.universityname.CS, where [...] "CS" [...] stood for Computer Science (department), but [...] ".cs" [...] was also the two-letter country code for Czechoslovakia until 1995.) ...|$|R
50|$|LMTP is {{designed}} {{as an alternative}} to normal SMTP for situations where the receiving side does not have a mail queue, such as a mail storage server acting as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA). Mail queues are an inherent requisite of SMTP. In situations in which mail queues are not possible, LMTP is desirable, since a mail storage server should manage only its mail store without having to allocate more storage for a mail queue. This is not possible with SMTP when there are multiple recipients for a mail message. SMTP can only indicate successful delivery or failure for all or none of the recipients, creating the need for a separate queue to handle the failed recipients. LMTP, on the other hand, can indicate success or failure to the client for each recipient, allowing the client to handle the queueing instead. The client in this case would typically be an Internet-facing <b>mail</b> <b>gateway.</b> LMTP is not intended for use over wide area networks. In other words, the Message transfer agent (MTA) still handles all outgoing mail, including the mail stream from the LMTP, to another mail server located somewhere on the Internet.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about a smtp accept filter [1] kernel module to protect <b>mail</b> <b>gateways</b> against overload- and downtime-situations, most notably against DDoS-attacks. The system only affects the smtp {{protocol}} and protocols based {{on top of the}} SMTP protocol like SMTPS or TLS (STARTTLS). Heavy load situations caused by those DDoS attacks, or many simultaneous connections from different originating IP-addresses accessing software/hardware at the same time can lead to software or hardware deadlocks or to very slow unresponsive reply times of the underlying operation system (OS) and the software running within the operating system. The kernel module solves these problems with a new innovative approach...|$|R

Bio-surveillance strategies are projected for detection of disease outbreaks from existing diagnostic data, but their performance is typically not understandable. The focus of the paper is to develop a bio-surveillance system which can serve the aim of biosurveillance by collecting health connected data from medical experts or individual person and check for relative health modifications to observe any silent change in health condition by employing a anomaly detection algorithm and time series analysis. Simulation is employed to check practical performance with speculative results. This data is analyzed daily by the system, permitting epidemiologists to envision potential epidemics via mapping tools. An alert message is send through message gateway or electronic <b>mail</b> <b>gateway.</b> Reports are generated in graphs and maps that show the outbreaks probability at specific location and by informing through electronic mail can help in alerting the user an early outbreak of any changes in specific surroundings...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Greylisting and {{real-time}} block listing are {{two common}} mechanisms for spam filtering. The former can efficiently {{reduce the number}} of spam sessions, but can be easily evaded if spammers retry spam delivery within a period of time. The latter can detect and reject the clients with poor reputation during SMTP sessions by looking up an external blacklist. Its weaknesses are the high false-positive rate and a lack of locality. We design a method of dynamically updating the greylist and block list based on the delivery behavior of spammers to block spam sessions in time. The method is implemented on a <b>mail</b> <b>gateway</b> in a senior high school. In our experiments with the real-world mail traffic for a month, the method can block 70. 29 % and 69. 21 % of the known and possible messages in the spam sessions with greylisting and block listing. The forward and reverse DNS lookups are also adopted to further reduce the false-positive rate to under 0. 01 %. Therefore, the required system resources for further spam filtering on mail servers can be greatly saved by blocking most of the spam sessions in time...|$|E
40|$|W 3 Gate, a <b>mail</b> <b>gateway</b> {{developed}} by GMD {{to fill the}} gap between email and WWW, was presented {{for the first time to}} an international audience during the JENC 7 conference in May 1996. We run W 3 Gate as a regular value-added service in the meantime and its usage grew up to 7 GB traffic a month. Not only people with a poor Internet connectivity use it but also people who like to work asynchronously or people who have to cross a firewall to access WWW. In this paper we describe our experiences with the use and abuse of W 3 Gate in the last months. Due to load and security considerations and influenced by postmasters' and end users' suggestions we changed W 3 Gate's functionality and set-up several times. Finally, a complete redesign became unavoidable. Our paper describes the development of a useful software package to a regular value-added service. It shows that it is not easy to predict end users' needs and behaviour and that the times where you write a piece of code, make a service out of it [...] ...|$|E

This content-type is intended as a machine-processable replacement for the various types of delivery status notifications currently used in Internet electronic mail. Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X. 400 or the so-called "LAN-based" systems), the DSN protocol is designed to be useful in a multiprotocol messaging environment. To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign " addresses and error codes, in addition to those normally used in Internet mail. Additional attributes may also be defined to support "tunneling " of foreign notifications through Internet mail.
