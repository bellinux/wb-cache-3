At home, Chippy suffers with a head cold, but Mrs. Hackee's lack of expression in the illustration leaves the reader wondering how she took his abrupt return. One wonders why Mrs. Hackee did not pursue Chippy once she learned of his whereabouts from a bird. After the reader discovers Goody is the happy mother of triplets and Timmy has made the decision to keep his nuts under lock and key, he <b>may</b> <b>wonder</b> what sort of fate the future holds for the Hackees.|$|E

25|$|Without {{denying that}} sex and gender can offer valid interpretive {{strategies}} for the investigation of Artemisia's art, we <b>may</b> <b>wonder</b> whether the application of gendered readings has created too narrow an expectation. Underpinning Garrard's monograph, and reiterated in a limited way by R. Ward Bissell in his catalogue raisonné, are certain presumptions: that Artemisia's full creative power emerged only in the depiction of strong, assertive women, {{that she would not}} engage in conventional religious imagery such as the Madonna and Child or a Virgin who responds with submission to the Annunciation, and that she refused to yield her personal interpretation to suit the tastes of her presumable male clientele. This stereotype has had the doubly restricting effect of causing scholars to question the attribution of pictures that do not conform to the model, and to value less highly those that do not fit the mold.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Clark Collis wrote that the album's title [...] "justifies its name thanks to a chunkier array of riffs and choruses" [...] compared to Where You Want to Be. Sarah Dean wrote on FasterLouder that Louder Now differs from the band's past records; it has [...] "a darker mood, bigger choruses and perhaps even catchier melodies," [...] with the [...] "emo-pop punk flavour Taking Back Sunday are renowned for." [...] Gigwise contributor Lee Glynn wrote that the album had [...] "no standout tracks" [...] other than [...] "MakeDamnSure." [...] Apart from the latter, [...] "there is nothing on this album that reaffirms them as a band full of malice and bite." [...] Spence D. of IGN gave the album a score of 6.7 out of 10: [...] "It's a safe bet to say that TBS diehards will soak up the 11 tracks with a sponge-like vengeance. Newcomers <b>may</b> <b>wonder</b> what all {{the bells and whistles}} are about, though. But tracks like 'My Blue Heaven', 'Spin', 'Divine Intervention' and 'I'll Let You Live' promise even greater things to come from this band, who are only now hinting at their growing sonic maturity." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly gave a [...] "B+" [...] rating to {{the first}} half of the film and a [...] "C-" [...] rating to the second half, and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "As {{political}} theater, Che moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly ... Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been". James Verniere of The Boston Herald gave the film a B-, describing the work as a new genre of [...] "arthouse guerrilla nostalgia", while lamenting Che as the film version of Alberto Korda’s iconic 1960 photograph Guerrillero Heroico. In Verniere's view, so much information was missing, that he recommended one first see The Motorcycle Diaries to fill in the background. In her review for USA Today, Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "With its lyrical beauty and strong performances, the film can be riveting. Its excessive length and rambling scenes also make it maddening. It is worth seeing for its attention to visual detail and ambitious filmmaking, but as a psychological portrait of a compelling historical figure, it is oddly bland and unrevealing". Anthony Lane, in his review for The New Yorker, wrote, [...] "for all the movie’s narrative momentum, Che retains the air of a study exercise—of an interest brilliantly explored. How else to explain one’s total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?" [...] Taking a more positive stance, film critic Chris Barsanti compared Che to a [...] "guerrilla take on Patton", calling it [...] "an exceptionally good" [...] war film, which rivaled The Battle of Algiers in its [...] "you-are-there sensibility". Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and addressed the film's length: [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>wonder</b> if the film is too long. I think there's a good reason for its length. Guevara's experience in Cuba and especially Bolivia was not a series of events and anecdotes, but a trial of endurance that might almost be called mad".|$|E

2500|$|In his {{mathematical}} style, Erdős {{was much}} more of a [...] "problem solver" [...] than a [...] "theory developer" [...] (see [...] "The Two Cultures of Mathematics" [...] by Timothy Gowers for an in-depth discussion of the two styles, and why problem solvers are perhaps less appreciated). Joel Spencer states that [...] "his place in the 20th-century mathematical pantheon is a matter of some controversy because he resolutely concentrated on particular theorems and conjectures throughout his illustrious career." [...] Erdős never won the highest mathematical prize, the Fields Medal, nor did he coauthor a paper with anyone who did, a pattern that extends to other prizes.Fields] medalists (a fact perhaps worthy of further contemplation)... there are many other important international awards for mathematicians. Perhaps the three most renowned...are the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, and the Leroy P. Steele Prizes. ... Again, one <b>may</b> <b>wonder</b> why KAPLANSKY is the only recipient of any of these prizes who collaborated with Paul Erdös. (After this paper was written, collaborator Lovász received the Wolf prize, making 2 in all). He did win the Wolf Prize, where his contribution is described as [...] "for his numerous contributions to number theory, combinatorics, probability, set theory and mathematical analysis, and for personally stimulating mathematicians the world over".

2500|$|Both {{private and}} public colleges exist side by side, public {{institutions}} called general and professional education colleges (Official French only name: Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel or CÉGEP) and private independent college institutions in Quebec straddle the definitions of both secondary and post-secondary education. [...] In Quebec, these institutions are readily considered post-secondary, but Quebec is the only province that requires 11 (rather than 12) years of study {{in order to obtain}} the high school diploma. [...] While standard admission to college is based on the secondary school diploma of Quebec (representing completion of grade 11), completion of the two-year college program does not give students the equivalent of a university Diploma (university diplomas throughout Canada are awarded following completion of at least a two-year post-secondary program of study). [...] Rather, holders of the two-year college diploma still must complete a minimum of three years of university education in order to obtain a bachelor's degree. [...] Under Canadian law, Bachelor's degrees from government-accredited universities in Canada are considered equal, whether from Quebec or other provinces. [...] Those unfamiliar with Quebec <b>may</b> <b>wonder</b> if three-year university programs there are therefore equal to four-year university programs in other provinces, or in other countries where four-year first university degree programs are the norm. [...] However, given that college diploma holders are granted up to one year of advanced standing credit at any university, it is clear {{that this is not the}} case. [...] What exists in Quebec is simply a different structure of education than in other provinces, which ultimately yields exactly the same total duration of study when years of secondary and post-secondary study are combined.|$|E
