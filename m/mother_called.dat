5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun {{was born}} on the 23rd day of the month of Ramadan 220 AH (20 September 835) or {{slightly}} later, probably in Baghdad. His father, Tulun, was a Turk from a locality known in Arabic sources as Tagharghar or Toghuzghuz, i.e. the Uyghur confederation. In the year 815/6 (200 AH) Tulun was taken captive along with other Turks, and sent {{as part of the}} tribute of the Samanid governor of Bukhara Nuh ibn Asad to the Caliph al-Ma'mun (reigned 813–833), who at the time resided in Khurasan. After al-Ma'mun returned to Baghdad in 819, these Turkish slaves were formed into a guard corps of slave soldiers (ghilmān, sing. ghulām) entrusted to al-Ma'mun's brother and eventual successor, al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842). Tulun did well for himself, eventually coming to command the Caliph's private guard. Ahmad's <b>mother,</b> <b>called</b> Qasim, was one of his father's slaves. In 854/5, Tulun died, and Qasim is commonly held to have married a second time, to the Turkish general Bayakbak or Bakbak. This report, however, does not appear in Ibn al-Daya or al-Balawi, and may be spurious. According to al-Balawi, after his father's death Ahmad came under the tutelage of Yalbakh, a close companion of Tulun, who had been taken captive alongside him. At his deathbed, Tulun urged his friend {{to take care of his}} wife and son, and Bakbak thereafter treated the young Ahmad as his own son.|$|E

Instead, she gave Houser $5,000.|$|E

25|$|Freddie worries over Effy's {{psychological}} {{state in}} his centric episode, {{as she is}} developing a psychotic depression that resembles what his mother had before she committed suicide. He is able to save Effy after an attempt on her life; she is hospitalised and he is left desolate. JJ's episode sees him {{fall in love with}} a single <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> Lara (Georgia Henshaw), through whom he finds a new-found confidence and begins to doubt whether he really needed to be so highly medicated his whole life. In the penultimate episode, Effy's psychiatric counsellor Dr John Foster (Hugo Speer) uses unorthodox hypnotic methods to cure Effy's depression, making her forget and want to abandon her old friends. After an incident at the spot of Tony's accident where she nearly commits suicide again, her psychosis comes back and Freddie insists Dr Foster cease treating Effy. Later, Foster lures Freddie to discuss Effy, and brutally murders Freddie with a baseball bat. In the finale episode, everyone deals with Freddie's absence, thinking that he has left of his own volition. Naomi and Emily finally repair their damaged relationship, scorched by cheating, and Naomi confesses she loved Emily since they first met; Thomas and Pandora are thrown back together by chance when they both get into Harvard College; a mostly-recovered Effy holds Freddie's birthday party in his shed, knowing that he loved her and pining for his return. Cook, who is on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, uncovers Dr Foster's killing and after confronting him, furiously lunges at Foster. The series ends here in freeze-frame leaving both Cook's and John Foster's fates unknown.|$|E

500|$|At Regent's Park David {{made little}} {{professional}} progress. The company was distinguished, headed by Nigel Playfair and Jack Hawkins, and, in the leading female roles, Anna Neagle and Margaretta Scott. David {{was restricted to}} bit parts. Among her colleagues in the company was an actor nine years her senior, Charles Gibson Cowan. His disregard for social conventions appealed strongly to her, and she also found him sexually irresistible. His being married did not daunt either of them, and they began an affair that outlasted her stage career. According to an interview with Chaney, [...] "Cowan was the ultimate outsider. He was working class, left wing, Jewish, an actor, a pickpocket, a vagabond, who lived in caves in Hastings for a time. Her <b>mother</b> <b>called</b> him a 'pacifist worm'. He was a sexual presence, and slept with anything that moved." [...] David's mother strongly disapproved, and tried {{to put a stop}} to the affair. She arranged for her daughter to spend several weeks holidaying with family and friends in Malta in the first half of 1936 and in Egypt later in the same year, but in her 1999 biography Artemis Cooper comments that David's lengthy absence failed to detach her from her involvement with Cowan. During her stay in Malta, David was able to spend time learning from her hostess's cook, Angela, who was happy to pass on her expertise. Although she could produce elaborate grand dinners when required, the most important lesson she taught David was to work day in, day out, with all available ingredients, showing her how to make an old bird or a stringy piece of meat into a good dish.|$|E
500|$|Tone {{clusters}} {{have been}} employed by jazz artists {{in a variety}} of styles, since {{the very beginning of the}} form. Around the turn of the twentieth century, Storyville pianist Jelly Roll Morton began performing a ragtime adaptation of a French quadrille, introducing large chromatic tone clusters played by his left forearm. The growling effect led Morton to dub the piece his [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] (...) [...] In 1909, Scott Joplin's deliberately experimental [...] "Wall Street Rag" [...] included a section prominently featuring notated tone clusters. The fourth of Artie Matthews's Pastime Rags (1913–20) features dissonant right-hand clusters. Thelonious Monk, in pieces such as [...] (1962), [...] "Introspection" [...] (1946) and [...] "Off Minor" [...] (1947), uses clusters as dramatic figures within the central improvisation and to accent the tension at its conclusion. They are heard on Art Tatum's [...] "Mr. Freddy Blues" [...] (1950), undergirding the cross-rhythms. By 1953, Dave Brubeck was employing piano tone clusters and dissonance in a manner anticipating the style free jazz pioneer Cecil Taylor would soon develop. The approach of hard bop pianist Horace Silver is an even clearer antecedent to Taylor's use of clusters. During the same era, clusters appear as punctuation marks in the lead lines of Herbie Nichols. In [...] "The Gig" [...] (1955), described by Francis Davis as Nichols's masterpiece, [...] "clashing notes and tone clusters depic a pickup band at odds with itself about what to play." [...] Recorded examples of Duke Ellington's piano cluster work include [...] "Summertime" [...] (1961) and ...And His <b>Mother</b> <b>Called</b> Him Bill (1967) and This One's for Blanton!, his , recorded in 1972 with bassist Ray Brown.|$|E
