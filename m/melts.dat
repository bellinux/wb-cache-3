5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this <b>melts,</b> it first <b>melts</b> as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy <b>melts</b> sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E
5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof <b>melts</b> and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that <b>melts</b> later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E

Whilst it is widely accepted that water leaving the slab causes the magmatism, the method in which the water leaves the slab and causes magmatism is unclear. In this thesis we will examine the hypothesis that water leaving the slab via a large hydraulic fracture will cause instantaneous ‘flash’ <b>melting</b> in the mantle wedge. We will test whether this flash <b>melting</b> occurs and whether it produces sufficient <b>melting.</b> We will also look at hydrous flux <b>melting</b> and hydrous decompression <b>melting</b> occuring after the initial flash <b>melting</b> {{to see if they}} increase the <b>melting.</b> A thermal model for a subduction zone is built, with the wedge flow solved analytically, to provide the temperature input for the <b>melting</b> models. Four <b>melting</b> models were tested; flash <b>melting,</b> flash <b>melting</b> followed by hydrous flux <b>melting,</b> flash <b>melting</b> followed by hydrous decompression <b>melting</b> and flash <b>melting,</b> then hydrous flux <b>melting</b> followed by hydrous decompression <b>melting.</b> Another thermal model was also made with the wedge flow solved numerically, this allowed buoyancy to be added into the model to allow investigation into the magma migrating buoyantly. We show that the flash <b>melting</b> model does produce flash <b>melting</b> from large hydraulic fractures but the <b>melting</b> produced is not sufficient compared to observations from volcanic arcs.

40|$|The {{timing of}} <b>melt</b> onset affects the surface energy uptake {{throughout}} the <b>melt</b> season. Yet the processes triggering <b>melt</b> and causing its large interannual variability {{are not well}} understood. Here we show that <b>melt</b> onset over Arctic sea ice is initiated by positive anomalies of water vapor, clouds, and air temperatures that increase the downwelling longwave radiation (LWD) to the surface. The earlier <b>melt</b> onset occurs; the stronger are these anomalies. Downwelling shortwave radiation (SWD) is smaller than usual at <b>melt</b> onset, indicating that <b>melt</b> is not triggered by SWD. When <b>melt</b> occurs early, an anomalously opaque atmosphere with positive LWD anomalies preconditions the surface for weeks preceding <b>melt.</b> In contrast, when <b>melt</b> begins late, clearer than usual conditions are evident prior to <b>melt.</b> Hence, atmospheric processes are imperative for <b>melt</b> onset.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the importance of <b>melt</b> migration in shaping major characteristics of geological features associated with the partial <b>melting</b> of the upper mantle, such as sea-floor spreading, continental flood basalts and rifting. The partial <b>melting</b> produces permeable partially molten rocks and a buoyant low viscosity <b>melt.</b> <b>Melt</b> migrates through the partially molten rocks, and transfers mass and heat. Due to its much faster velocity and appreciable buoyancy, <b>melt</b> migration {{has the potential to}} modify dynamics of the upwelling partially molten plumes. I develop a 2 -D, two-phase flow model and apply it to investigate effects of <b>melt</b> migration on the dynamics and <b>melt</b> generation of upwelling mantle plumes and focusing of <b>melt</b> migration beneath mid-ocean ridges. <b>Melt</b> migration changes distribution of the melt-retention buoyancy force and therefore affects the dynamics of the upwelling plume. This is investigated by modeling a plume with a constant initial <b>melt</b> of 10 % where no further <b>melting</b> is considered. <b>Melt</b> migration polarizes melt-retention buoyancy force into high and low <b>melt</b> fraction regions at the top and bottom portions of the plume and therefore results in formation of a more slender and faster upwelling plume. Allowing the plume to <b>melt</b> as it ascends through the upper mantle also produces a slender and faster plume. It is shown that <b>melt</b> produced by decompressional <b>melting</b> of the plume migrates to the upper horizons of the plume, increases the upwelling velocity and thus, the volume of <b>melt</b> generated by the plume. <b>Melt</b> migration produces a plume which lacks the mushroom shape observed for the plume models without <b>melt</b> migration. <b>Melt</b> migration forms a high <b>melt</b> fraction layer beneath the sloping base of the impermeable oceanic lithosphere. Using realistic conditions of <b>melting,</b> freezing and <b>melt</b> extraction, I examine whether the high <b>melt</b> fraction layer is able to focus <b>melt</b> from a wide partial <b>melting</b> zone to a narrow region beneath the observed neo-volcanic zone. My models consist of three parts; lithosphere, asthenosphere and a <b>melt</b> extraction region. It is shown that <b>melt</b> migrates vertically within the asthenosphere, and forms a high <b>melt</b> fraction layer beneath the sloping base of the impermeable lithosphere. Within the sloping high <b>melt</b> fraction layer, <b>melt</b> migrates laterally towards the ridge. In order to simulate <b>melt</b> migration via crustal fractures and cracks, <b>melt</b> is extracted from a <b>melt</b> extraction region extending {{to the base of the}} crust. Performance of the <b>melt</b> focusing mechanism is not significantly sensitive to the size of <b>melt</b> extraction region, <b>melt</b> extraction threshold and spreading rate. In all of the models, about half of the total <b>melt</b> production freezes beneath the cooling base of the lithosphere, and the rest is effectively focused towards the ridge and forms the crust. To meet the computational demand for a precise tracing of the deforming upwelling plume and including the chemical buoyancy of the partially molten zone in my models, a new numerical method is developed to solve the related pure advection equations. The numerical method is based on Second Moment numerical method of Egan and Mahoney [1972] which is improved to maintain a high numerical accuracy in shear and rotational flow fields. In comparison with previous numerical methods, my numerical method is a cost-effective, non-diffusive and shape preserving method, and it can also be used to trace a deforming body in compressible flow fields...|$|R

The {{source of heat}} must be due {{to one or more}} processes among thickening and radiogenic heating, viscous dissipation, and heat from asthenospheric mantle. Melt-bearing rocks become porous at a few vol % <b>melt</b> initiating an advective flow regime.
