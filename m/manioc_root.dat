50|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} for {{varying degrees of}} cultivation of maca in the Lake Junin region from around 1700 BC to 1200 AD. Maca has been harvested and used by humans in the puna grasslands of the Andean Mountains for centuries. Contrary to frequent claims that maca's cultivation was common in what is today Peru, until the late 1980s, maca has been cultivated only in a limited area around Lake Junin, in central Peru. Historically, maca often was traded for lowland tropical food staples, such as corn, rice, <b>manioc</b> (tapioca <b>roots),</b> quinoa, and papaya. It also {{was used as a}} form of payment of Spanish imperial taxes.Maca was eaten by Inca imperial warriors before battles. Their legendary strength was allegedly imparted by the preparatory consumption of copious amounts of maca, fueling formidable warriors. After a city was conquered, the women had to be protected from the Inca warriors, as reportedly they became ambitiously virile from eating such quantities of maca.

5000|$|Period of {{the transatlantic}} slave tradeIn 1646, Jesuit friar Gonçalo João succinctly stated the {{importance}} of the economic relationship between Brazil and Angola as [...] "Without Angola, there is no Brazil". Angola was a major source of slaves to Brazil, which was, out of the several European colonies in the Americas, the largest single importer of slaves during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Two-thirds of those slaves in Brazil originated from the Angola-Congo region. Rio de Janeiro depended on the consistent influx of slaves from Angola to work on sugar cane plantations and for re-exportation to Buenos Aires in exchange for silver.Exports from Brazil to Angola in exchange for these slaves included <b>manioc</b> <b>root</b> meal and cachaça.During Dutch occupation of Angola in early 17th century, Brazil and Portugal acted as [...] "co-colonizers" [...] together in their efforts to reclaim the territory.

50|$|Chicha is a Spanish {{word for}} any of variety of {{traditional}} fermented beverages from the Andes region of South America. It can be made of maize, <b>manioc</b> <b>root</b> (also calledyuca or cassava) or fruits among other things. During the Inca Empire women were taught the techniques of brewing chicha in Acllahuasis (feminine schools). Chicha de jora is prepared by germinating maize, extracting the malt sugars, boiling the wort, and fermenting it in large vessels, traditionally huge earthenware vats, for several days. In some cultures, in lieu of germinating the maize to release the starches, the maize is ground, moistened in the chicha maker's mouth and formed into small balls which are then flattened and laid out to dry. Naturally occurring diastase enzymes in the maker's saliva catalyzes the breakdown of starch in the maize into maltose. Chicha de jora has been prepared and consumed in communities throughout in the Andes for millennia. The Inca used chicha for ritual purposes and consumed it in vast quantities during religious festivals. In recent years, however, the traditionally prepared chicha is becoming increasingly rare. Only in {{a small number of}} towns and villages in southern Peru and Bolivia is it still prepared.|$|E

References to yucca root as food often arise from confusion with the similarly pronounced, but botanically unrelated, yuca, also called cassava or <b>manioc</b> (Manihot esculenta). <b>Roots</b> of soaptree yucca (Yucca elata) {{are high in}} saponins and are used as a shampoo in Native American rituals. Dried yucca leaves and trunk fibers have a low ignition temperature, making the plant desirable for use in starting fires via friction.In rural Appalachian areas, species such as Yucca filamentosa {{are referred to as}} [...] "meat hangers".

40|$|Konzo is an {{irreversible}} paralytic disease afflicting tens {{of thousands}} of women and children in rural Zaire and throughout sub-Sahara Africa. The disease can occur where bitter, high-yield varieties of cassava that thrive in arid soils provide the basic nutritional staple. The paraparesis is related to upper motor neuron damage stemming from the consumption of insufficiently processed toxic cassava <b>roots</b> (<b>manioc)</b> and a diet poor in the sulfur-based amino acids necessary for the body to detoxify the cyanide in this plant. The ecological paradigm [Kelly (1968) Toward an ecological conception of preventive interventions, in Research Contributions from Psychology to Community Mental Health, ed. J. W. Carter, pp. 75 - 99, Behavioral Publications, New York] is adapted as the evaluative model for evaluating the potential effectiveness of a proposed health behavior/education intervention for konzo. This qualitative research model involves a consideration of the cycling of resources (human labor and material), adaptation (of personal and social practices related to the health issue), succession (of social institutions, values, customs), interdependence (of human social units), and feasibility (or the congruency of the proposed intervention and cultural traits of the host environment). Based on this evaluative model, a health behavior/education level of intervention focusing specifically on using focus groups and multichannel communication techniques to discourage unsafe manioc short-soaking tendencies among village women farmers seems feasible. Such an approach is not dependent on sophisticated technical or material inputs and is therefore readily sustainable without outside agency support once it is effectively initiated within that culture. infectious disease sub-Sahara Africa diet ecology...|$|R
