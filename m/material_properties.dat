The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs.

5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect <b>material</b> <b>properties,</b> such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E

Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity.

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient gradient-based optimization {{approach for}} inverse material characterization from incomplete system response measurements that can utilize a generally applicable parameterization (e. g., finite element-type parameterization) is presented and evaluated. The {{key to this}} inverse characterization algorithm {{is the use of}} a direct inversion strategy with Gappy proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) response field estimation to initialize the inverse solution estimate prior to gradient-based optimization. Gappy POD is used to estimate the complete (i. e., all components over the entire spatial domain) system response field from incomplete (e. g., partial spatial distribution) measurements obtained from some type of system testing along with some amount of a priori information regarding the potential distribution of the unknown <b>material</b> <b>property.</b> The estimated complete system response is used within a physics-based direct inversion procedure with a finite element-type parameterization to estimate the spatial distribution of the desired unknown <b>material</b> <b>property</b> with minimal computational expense. Then, this estimated spatial distribution of the unknown <b>material</b> <b>property</b> is used to initialize a gradient-based optimization approach, which uses the adjoint method for computationally efficient gradient calculations, to produce the final estimate of the <b>material</b> <b>property</b> distribution. The three-step [(1) Gappy POD, (2) direct inversion, and (3) gradient-based optimization] inverse characterization approach is evaluated through simulated test problems based on the characterization of elastic modulus distributions with localized variations (e. g., inclusions) within simple structures. Overall, this inverse characterization approach is shown to efficiently and consistently provide accurate inverse characterization estimates for <b>material</b> <b>property</b> distributions from incomplete response field measurements. Moreover, the solution procedure is shown to be capable of extrapolating significantly beyond the initial assumptions regarding the potential nature of the unknown <b>material</b> <b>property</b> distribution...|$|R

The spectral form of the elastodynamic boundary integral equations are derived for a functionally graded material, which is used as the numerical tool in our analysis. The <b>material</b> <b>property</b> gradient is assumed to vary unsymmetrically in the direction normal to the fracture plane. A parametric study has been performed by systematically varying the inhomogeneity length scale. In comparison with a homogeneous material, an unsymmetric functionally graded material offers lesser fracture resistance.

The <b>material</b> <b>property</b> inhomogeneity affects only the transient crack propagation velocities, while the quasi-steady-state velocity remains unaltered...|$|R
