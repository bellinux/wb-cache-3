40|$|Despite {{the level}} of skill of the {{operator}} {{and the use of}} ultrasound guidance, central venous catheter (CVC) placement can result in CVC <b>malpositioning,</b> an unintended placement of the catheter tip in an inadequate vessel. CVC <b>malpositioning</b> is not a complication of central line insertion; however, undiagnosed CVC <b>malpositioning</b> can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this review were to describe factors associated with intravascular <b>malpositioning</b> of CVCs inserted via the neck and chest and to offer ways of preventing, identifying, and correcting such <b>malpositioning.</b> A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and MD Consult was performed in June 2014. By searching for “Central line malposition” and then for “Central venous catheters intravascular malposition,” we found 178 articles written in English. Of those, we found that 39 were relevant to our objectives and included them in our review. According to those articles, intravascular CVC <b>malpositioning</b> is associated with the presence of congenital and acquired anatomical variants, catheter insertion in left thoracic venous system, inappropriate bevel orientation upon needle insertion, and patient’s body habitus variants. Although plain chest radiography is the standard imaging modality for confirming catheter tip location, signs and symptoms of CVC <b>malpositioning</b> even in presence of normal or inconclusive conventional radiography findings should prompt the use of additional diagnostic methods to confirm or rule out CVC <b>malpositioning.</b> With very few exceptions, the recommendation in cases of intravascular CVC <b>malpositioning</b> is to remove and relocate the catheter. Knowing the mechanisms of CVC <b>malpositioning</b> and how to prevent, identify, and correct CVC <b>malpositioning</b> could decrease harm to patients with this condition...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Malpositions</b> after central venous {{cannulation}} {{are frequently}} encountered and {{may need a}} change in catheter. The incidence of <b>malpositions</b> are varied according to various studies and depend {{on the experience of}} the operator performing the cannulation. Aim: To access the incidence of <b>malpositions</b> and related complications associated with landmark-guided central venous cannulation in a 15 -bedded medical surgical ICU over a period of three years. Settings and Design: Retrospective analysis of records of all the central venous cannulation done in a 15 - bedded medical- surgical ICU over the period of three years (April 2008 to June 2011) were evaluated for the site and side of insertion, number of attempts of puncture, arterial puncture as well as the <b>malpositions</b> on post procedural chest X-ray. The records were also evaluated for the experience of the operator performing cannulation and relationship between experience of operator to <b>malpositions</b> of catheter. Statistical Analysis: Analysis was done using SPSS v 17. 0 for Windows. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the statistical significance. P > 0. 05 was significant. Results: Records of 696 cannulations were evaluated. <b>Malpositions</b> occurred in 40 patients. Subclavian vein cannulation resulted in increased <b>malpositions</b> in relation to internal jugular vein cannulation. More common with left sided cannulation. Experience of operator had positive correlation with <b>malpositions</b> and arterial puncture. Arterial puncture was common in 6 %, while more than one attempt for cannulation was taken in 100 patients. Conclusion: Incidence of <b>malpositions</b> was low. We conclude that experience of operator improves successful catheterization with lesser number of complications...|$|R

30|$|When {{a biopsy}} needle is {{misplaced}} {{in the normal}} lung parenchyma distinct from the target, the operator usually removes the needle and re-attempts targeting. However, in select patients, instead of removing a <b>malpositioned</b> needle, we re-attempted lesion targeting using a second needle through another puncture site while the first needle was in position. The <b>malpositioned</b> needle retained in lung parenchyma was beneficial in performing the second attempt. First, when the patient did not reproduce designated respiration and re-targeting could not depend on CT images, the operator determined the lesion location based on {{the location of the}} <b>malpositioned</b> needle. Although the patient’s respiration was irregular, the relative position between the lesion and inserted needle did not change; thus, the operator calculated the distance of the lesion relative to the <b>malpositioned</b> needle and determined a new puncture site and needle direction. Second, the <b>malpositioned</b> needle acted as an anchor to hold the lung. In a patient with pre-existing pneumothorax, the first needle failed to target the lesion because of the movability of the lung. In the second trial using another needle, the <b>malpositioned</b> needle held the lung in place, which was helpful for accurate lesion targeting by the second needle. When the patient’s respiratory movement was large and variable, the inserted needle restricted the patient’s respiratory motion to a limited range, enabling the operator to estimate the lesion location. Furthermore, the operator could control the patient’s respiratory movement by observing the needle movement. Because pneumothorax did not occur or progress while the <b>malpositioned</b> needle was ‘holding’ the lung, the operator could proceed with another biopsy attempt.|$|R
25|$|Women {{who have}} {{undergone}} breast augmentation also {{are susceptible to}} breast ptosis; which incidence might be induced by the physical and mechanical stresses exerted by the breast implants upon the internal tissues and the skin envelope; such overstretching thins the skin and atrophies its elastic qualities. Statistically, breast augmentation and mastopexy are plastic surgery operations with low incidence rates of medical complications; yet, when performed as a combined breast-repair procedure (mastopexy–augmentation), the physiologic stresses upon {{the health of the}} woman increase the risks of incision-wound infection, breast-implant exposure, damage to the breast and nipple nerves leading to sensation changes, <b>malposition</b> of the nipple-areola complex, and <b>malposition</b> of the breast implant in the implant pocket. Therefore, a mastopexy–augmentation procedure features increased surgical complication rates, when compared to the lesser complication rates of breast augmentation and mastopexy as discrete surgical operations; likewise, the individual incidence rates of surgical revision and complications, when compared to the revision and complication rates for the combined mastopexy–augmentation procedure. Recent studies of a newer technique for simultaneous augmentation mastopexy (SAM) indicate that it is a safe surgical procedure with minimal medical complications. The SAM technique involves invaginating and tacking the tissues first, in order to previsualize the final result, before making any surgical incisions to the breast.|$|E
25|$|Complex {{fractures}} like pelvis fractures, calcaneus or tibia head fractures, etc. need {{an exact}} placement of screws and other surgical implants to allow quickest possible {{treatment of the}} patients. Minimally invasive surgical approaches result in less trauma for the patient and quicker recovery. However, the risk of malpositionins, revisions and nerval damage cannot be underestimated (<b>Malposition</b> and revision rates of different imaging modalities for percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation following pelvic fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis). The possibility {{of the use of}} an angio system with a spatial resolution of 0.1mm, the large field of view to image the entire pelvis in one image and the high kW rate allows the surgeon high precision images while not impairing hygiene (floor mounted systems) or access to the patient (CT). Degenerative spine surgery, traumatic spinal fractures, oncologic fractures or scoliosis surgery are other types of surgery that can be optimized in a hybrid OR. The large field of view and the high kW rate allow to optimally image even obese patients. Navigations systems or the use of integrated laser guidance can support and improve the workflow.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review: This article {{reviews the}} {{thoracic}} complications from <b>malpositioned</b> blindly inserted nasogastric feeding tubes in mechanically ventilated patients {{in intensive care}} and the methods to check the position and promote safe placement of the feeding tubes. Recent findings: <b>Malpositioned</b> feeding tubes {{are not included in}} risk management databases. The reported incidence is 1 - 3 % and more than half occur in mechanically ventilated patients. Eighty three mechanically ventilated patients were reported with <b>malpositioned</b> nasogastric tubes and 66 % of them developed serious thoracic complications. Pneumothoraces accounted for 80 % of thoracic complications that were evenly distributed between tubes with and without stylet. Repeated misplacements appear to increase the risk. Non-radiological confirmation of the position of the tube has suboptimal performance. Protocols to place feeding tubes and new technology are promising candidates.

40|$|Metal-on-metal (MoM) {{bearings}} {{have shown}} low-wear rates under standard hip simulator conditions; however, retrieval {{studies have shown}} large variations in wear rates and mechanisms. High-wear in vivo has caused catastrophic complications and {{has been associated with}} steep cup-inclination angle (rotational <b>malpositioning).</b> However, increasing the cup-inclination angle in vitro has not replicated the increases in wear to the same extent as those observed in retrievals. Clinically relevant wear rates, patterns, and particles were observed in vitro for ceramic-on-ceramic bearings when microseparation (translational <b>malpositioning)</b> conditions were introduced into the gait cycle. In the present study, 28 and 36 -mm MoM bearings were investigated under adverse conditions. Increasing the cup angle from 45 ° to 65 ° resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} wear rate of the 28 mm bearings. However, for the 36 mm bearings, head-rim contact did not occur under the steep cup-angle condition, and the wear rate did not increase. The introduction of microseparation to the gait cycle significantly increased the wear rate of the MoM bearings. Cup angle and head size did not influence the wear rate under microseparation conditions. This study indicated that high-in vivo wear rates were associated with edge loading due to rotational <b>malpositioning</b> such as high-cup-inclination angle and translational <b>malpositioning</b> that could occur due to several surgical factors.

40|$|Background We {{hypothesized}} that {{the direction of the}} J-tip of the guidewire during insertion into the internal jugular vein (IJV) might determine its ultimate location. Methods In this study, 300 patients between the ages of 18 and 99 years who required central venous catheterization via IJV in the emergency department enrolled for randomization. IVJ catheterization was successful in 285 of 300 patients. An independent operator randomly prefixed the direction of the J-tip of the guidewire to one of three directions. Based on the direction of the J-tip, patients were allocated into three groups: the J-tip medial-directed group (Group A), the lateral-directed group (Group B), or the downward-directed group (Group C). Postoperative chest radiography was performed on all patients in order to visualize the location of the catheter tip. A catheter is considered <b>malpositioned</b> if it is not located in the superior vena cava or right atrium. Results Of the total <b>malpositioned</b> catheter tips (8 of 285; 2. 8 %), the majority (5 of 8; 62. 5 %) entered the contralateral subclavian vein, 2 (25. 0 %) were complicated by looping, and 1 (12. 5 %) entered the ipsilateral subclavian vein. According to the direction of the J-tip of the guidewire, the incidence of <b>malpositioning</b> of the catheter tip was 4 of 92 in Group A (4. 3 %), 4 of 96 in Group B (4. 2 %), and there were no <b>malpositions</b> in Group C.
