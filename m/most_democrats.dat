5|$|A {{controversial}} plan, {{known as}} the Major Moves plan, was passed in 2006. The Indiana Toll Road was leased to Statewide Mobility Partners, a joint venture company owned by Spanish firm Cintra and Australia's Macquarie Infrastructure Group for 75 years {{in exchange for a}} one time payment of $3.85 billion. The measure was opposed by <b>most</b> <b>Democrats,</b> who began an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling the road to foreign nations. The income from the lease was used to finance a backlog of public transportation projects and create a $500 million trust fund to generate revenue for the maintenance of the highway system.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, <b>most</b> <b>Democrats</b> left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E
5|$|Pierce and his {{administration}} used threats and promises to keep <b>most</b> <b>Democrats</b> on board {{in favor of the}} bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the Know Nothings, and the founding of the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|In early 1974, {{the group}} Americans for Democratic Action rated Mathias {{the most liberal}} member of the GOP in the Senate based on twenty key votes in the 1973 {{legislative}} session. At 90 percent, his score was higher than <b>most</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the Senate, and was fourth highest amongst all members. Issues considered when rating senators included their positions on civil rights, mass transit, D.C. home rule, tax reform, and reducing overseas troop levels. The League of Women Voters gave Mathias a 100% on issues important to them, and the AFL-CIO agreed with Mathias on 32 out of 45 key labor votes. Conversely, the conservative group Americans for Constitutional Action stated Mathias agreed with their positions only 16% of the time.|$|E
5|$|Randall's {{defense of}} smaller, less {{centralized}} government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats {{lost control of}} the House in 1881, and was considered a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from <b>most</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and when that party regained control of the House in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress as head of the Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader, but gradually lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.|$|E

25|$|Within samizdat, several works {{focused on}} the {{possibility}} of a democratic political system. Democratic samizdat possessed a revolutionary nature because of its claim that a fundamental shift in political structure was necessary to reform the state, unlike socialists who hoped to work within the same basic political framework to achieve change. Despite the revolutionary nature of the democratic samizdat authors, <b>most</b> <b>democrats</b> advocated moderate strategies for change. <b>Most</b> <b>democrats</b> believed in an evolutionary approach to achieving democracy in the USSR, and focused on advancing their cause along open, public routes, rather than underground routes.|$|E
25|$|Some Democratic officeholders have championed {{consumer}} protection laws that limit {{the sharing of}} consumer data between corporations. <b>Most</b> <b>Democrats</b> oppose sodomy laws and believe that government should not regulate consensual noncommercial sexual conduct among adults {{as a matter of}} personal privacy.|$|E

50|$|The {{approval}} of the deal was opposed by various lawmakers, including GOP Senators Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Todd Young and Dean Heller along with <b>most</b> <b>Democrat</b> Senators who voted to advance the measure in order to block the sale, citing the human rights violations by Saudi Arabia in the Yemeni Civil War. Among the senators who voted against moving the measure to block the sale were Democratic Senators Joe Donnelly, Claire McCaskill, Bill Nelson, Joe Manchin and Mark Warner along with top Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Bob Corker and John McCain.|$|R
50|$|Stark {{voted against}} the {{bipartisan}} May 2008 farm subsidy bill, which was supported by <b>most</b> House <b>Democrats</b> and over half of House Republicans, {{in part because of}} its cost.|$|R
25|$|In 1993, Santorum {{was one of}} 17 House Republicans who {{sided with}} <b>most</b> <b>Democrats</b> to support {{legislation}} that prohibited employers from permanently replacing striking employees.

As a member of the Gang of Seven, Santorum was involved in exposing members of Congress involved in the House banking scandal.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party also {{divided on}} a {{strategy}} for contesting the general election. <b>Most</b> <b>Democrats</b> heading into the May convention decided to not oppose the governorship and other state offices because Governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain had implemented many favorable reforms. Known as fusionists, they also felt that any effort spent on state offices would be wasted and better served by trying to acquire {{a majority in the}} General Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Pierce and his {{administration}} used threats and promises to keep <b>most</b> <b>Democrats</b> on board {{in favor of the}} bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines, and the conflict finally destroyed the ailing party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency.

50|$|The {{battle over}} Kansas {{escalated}} into {{a battle for}} control of the Democratic Party. On one side were Buchanan, <b>most</b> Southern <b>Democrats,</b> and northern Democrats allied to the Southerners ("Doughfaces"); on the other side were Douglas and <b>most</b> northern <b>Democrats</b> plus a few Southerners. Douglas's faction continued to support the doctrine of popular sovereignty, while Buchanan insisted that Democrats respect the Dred Scott decision and its repudiation of federal interference with slavery in the territories. The struggle lasted the remainder of Buchanan's presidency. Buchanan used his patronage powers to remove Douglas' sympathizers in Illinois and Washington, DC and installed pro-administration Democrats, including postmasters.|$|R
50|$|Rep. Farr, like <b>most</b> Progressive <b>Democrats</b> in Congress, {{opposes the}} USA PATRIOT Act and is pro-choice. He {{received}} a 91% progressive rating by Progressive Punch, ranking him the 42nd most progressive member of congress.|$|R

25|$|Citing his {{potential}} views {{on abortion and}} the environment, Cantwell was one of 22 senators to vote against United States Supreme Court nominee John Roberts. In January 2006, after publicly announcing her opposition to Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, Cantwell, along with 18 other Democrats and all 53 present Republicans, voted for the cloture motion. The success of this motion ended an unlikely attempt to filibuster the confirmation of Judge Alito that was being led by Senator John Kerry and Senator Ted Kennedy. Alito was confirmed the next day {{by a vote of}} 58–42, with <b>most</b> <b>Democrats,</b> including Cantwell, voting against the confirmation.|$|E
25|$|Conrad is more {{politically}} conservative than <b>most</b> <b>Democrats.</b> He has voted consistently {{in favor of}} banning the partial-birth abortion medical procedure. He also opposes public funding of abortion. However, Conrad {{voted in favor of}} lifting the ban on abortions on military bases. Conrad has a mixed record on gay rights. While he personally is opposed to gay marriage, he voted against a proposed constitutional ban on the matter and has supported bills that prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation. On January 31, 2006, Conrad was one of four Democrats to vote in favor of confirming Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Many Democrats {{are opposed}} to the Patriot Act, however when the law was passed <b>most</b> <b>Democrats</b> were {{supportive}} of it and all but two Democrats in the U.S. Senate voted for the original Patriot Act legislation in 2001. The lone nay vote was from Russ Feingold of Wisconsin; Mary Landrieu of Louisiana did not vote. In the House the Democrats voted for the Act by 145 yea and 62 nay. Democrats split on the renewal in 2006. In the Senate, Democrats voted 34 for the 2006 renewal, and 9 against. In the House, Democrats voted 66 voted for the renewal, and 124 against.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic Party {{supports}} {{the death penalty}} {{far less than the}} Republican Party. Though <b>most</b> <b>Democrats</b> in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, particularly in New Jersey and in New Mexico. They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and New York. During the Clinton administration, Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton; the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{and some}} Republicans are {{critical}} of such ideas, {{partly because of the}} large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between revenues and expenses that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the United Kingdom's privatized pension plan. See Social Security debate (United States). In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a welfare program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.|$|E
25|$|Oberstar {{was given}} a rating of 100 by the Environment America and the League of Conservation Voters in 2009. The American Wind Energy Association also gave him a rating of 100 in 2006.

He also voted to pass a bill, Trade-in Vouchers for Fuel-Efficient Cars, in 2009 which granted a $3,500 voucher, or document that could be exchanged for services {{in the place of}} money, for trading in an old vehicle with at least 4 miles per gallon more, the purpose of which was to increase the purchasing of fuel efficient cars. However, Oberstar went against <b>most</b> <b>Democrats</b> and voted in favor of allowing drilling in ANWR.|$|E
