40|$|Abstract: Metallic soaps of {{gadolinium}} {{with lower}} carboxylic acids (Butyric, Valeric, Caproic & Caprylic) have been synthesized and characterized {{with the help}} of elemental analysis and IR spectral data. I R spectra indicate that the fatty acids exist with dimeric structure through hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl groups of acid molecules whereas the metal soaps have an ionic character. All the metallic soaps have been screened for their antimicrobial activity against fungi viz. A niger, A. flavous, P. triticena, F. species and bacteria viz. E. coli, B. subtilis, S. typhi, S. aureus. The results of antimicrobial activity show that <b>metallic</b> <b>soap</b> of butyric acid have more potency towards experimental fungi and bacteria. It also shows that <b>metallic</b> <b>soap</b> of butyric acid is more toxic against bacteria B. subtilis...|$|E

The main objective in this study is to synthesis a various zinc fatty acids soap to have a lower melting point that possess the same functions as zinc stearate. The zinc content of zinc fatty acids soap will be analysed by using MP-AES. The composition of the fatty acids will be analysed by Gas Chromatography. The iodine value is to determine the completion of the reaction. The melting point also will be recorded by using Mettler Tolendo FP 80.

40|$|When a <b>metallic</b> <b>soap</b> such as Aluminum Stearate is {{suitably}} dispersed in {{a liquid}} hydrocarbon such as benzene or gasoline, gels are formed which have visco-elastic properties differing considerably {{from those of}} ordinary liquids. The anomalous flow characteristics of these systems render them useful {{for a number of}} practical applications such as in medications (vaseline) and lubricating greases. During World War II, Aluminum soap-gasoline gels were used extensively as incendiary bomb chargings and flame thrower fuels. The merit of these systems may be indicated by referring to the behavior of one or two commercial products. For application to the skin medications with high viscosity are required to prevent the material from running off. Since it is much more convenient to apply a material of low viscosity, there are distinct advantages in using materials such as a soap-hydrocarbon which has low viscosity while being applied and high viscosity when allowed “to set”. The change from a high to a low viscosity is brought about simply by rubbing or shearing the material. Soap-hydrocarbon lubricants have similar merit. When they are used in high speed machinery they become fluid and there is little resistance to flow. 9 When the machine is stopped the grease adheres to the metal surfaces and forms a protective coating.

40|$|Soaps are a {{class of}} surface active {{compounds}} derived from natural oils and fats. Double decomposition reactions permit the synthesis of <b>metallic</b> <b>soaps,</b> which are long-chain carboxylates of metal ions, from alkaline ones such as sodium, potassium or ammonium <b>soaps.</b> <b>Metallic</b> <b>soaps</b> are commercially important as they find use in diverse applications such as driers in paints or inks, components of lubricating greases, heat stabilizers for plastics (especially PVC), catalysts and water proofing agents, fuel additives and cosmetic products amongst others.

Rubber seed oil (RSO) which is an unsaturated triglyceride abundantly available in Nigeria, India and Australia is an excellent starting material for metal soaps. In this study rubber seed oil having 2. 2 % myristic acid, 7. 6 % palmitic acid, 10. 7 % stearic acid, 20. 61 % oleic acid, 36. 62 % linoleic acid, 22. 5 % linolenic acid was used in making barium, calcium, cadmium and zinc soaps. The thermal behaviour of soaps (Ba, Ca, Cd and Zn) of rubber seed oil for use as additives in the processing of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) was investigated by thermal gravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. The stability of the soaps was examined by thermogravimetry up to 873 K at a constant heating rate of 10 °C min - 1. The soaps were found to be thermally stable up to 473 K as they recorded less than 5 % mass loss at this temperature with values of apparent activation energy for decomposition varying from 52 to 96 kJ mol- 1.

5000|$|Polymer clays {{contain a}} basis of PVC resin and a liquid plasticizer, making it a {{plastisol}}. Polymer clay plastisol is also categorized as a plastigel because of its rheological properties. It is a high yield thixotropic material; when a sufficient force is applied the material yields, flows like a viscous liquid until that force is removed, whereupon it returns to being a solid. This plasticity {{is what makes it}} useful as modeling clay as opposed to putty or paste. Plastigels retain their shape even when heat is applied, which is why polymer clay does not melt or droop when oven cured. Various gelling agents are added to give it this property such as aminated bentonite, <b>metallic</b> <b>soaps,</b> or fumed silica. The base resin can be modified in various ways. Mineral oil, lecithin, and odorless mineral spirits can be added to reduce its viscosity or alter its working properties. Small amounts of zinc oxide, kaolin, or other fillers are sometimes added to increase opacity, elastic modulus, or compression strength.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of oil paintings produced by Georgia O'Keeffe (1887 - 1986) show surface protrusions of varying width, up to several hundreds of microns. These protrusions {{are similar to those}} described in the art conservation literature as <b>metallic</b> <b>soaps.</b> Since the presence of these protrusions raises questions about the state of conservation and long-term prospects for deterioration of these artworks, a 3 D-imaging technique, photometric stereo using ultraviolet illumination, was developed for the long-term monitoring of the surface-shape of the protrusions and the surrounding paint. Because the UV fluorescence response of painting materials is isotropic, errors typically caused by non-Lambertian (anisotropic) specularities when using visible reflected light can be avoided providing a more accurate estimation of shape. As an added benefit, fluorescence provides additional contrast information contributing to materials characterization. The developed methodology aims to detect, characterize, and quantify the distribution of micro-protrusions and their development over the surface of entire artworks. Combined with a set of analytical in-situ techniques, and computational tools, this approach constitutes a novel methodology to investigate the selective distribution of protrusions in correlation with the composition of painting materials at the macro-scale. While focused on O'Keeffe's paintings as a case study, we expect the proposed approach to have broader significance by providing a non-invasive protocol to the conservation community to probe topological changes for any relatively flat painted surface of an artwork, and more specifically to monitor the dynamic formation of protrusions, in relation to paint composition and modifications of environmental conditions, loans, exhibitions and storage over the long-term.

50|$|In late 1888, <b>metallic</b> <b>soaps</b> were tried. At first a lead {{stearate}} was used, but in {{the summer}} months, these records started to sweat and decompose. In 1889, Aylsworth developed an aluminum wax, using acetate of alumina and stearic acid with sodium hydroxide added as a saponifying agent. It was found these records were much more durable. Problems arose, however, {{since there was no}} tempering agent and hot weather caused these records to decompose. Two problems contributed to this, stearic quality varied from different makers; Aylsworth purchased some from P&G and found it had too much olaic acid in it. The next cause {{of the problem is that}} all stearic acid without a tempering agent takes on moisture, and after many experiments it was found that Ceresine was ideal. To make the wax hard, sodium carbonate was added. Even so, a few batches of records still had some problems and became fogged. The fog problem arose from acetic acid left in the wax; this problem was solved when higher temperatures were used to make sure all the acetic acid was boiled out of the wax. As such, the records from 1889 to 1894 are a reddish-brown color due to the long cooking time. By 1896, Edison started using hydrated alumina in place of acetate of alumina. The use of hydrated alumina (sheet aluminum dissolved in a mixture of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and distilled water) made better records, and the wax could be manufactured in a shorter period of time. Using the hydrated aluminum resulted in more desirable blanks, with fewer defects and shorter production time.|$|R
5000|$|The Columbia Phonograph Company used Edison {{recording}} blanks until 1894. The North American Phonograph Company was {{dissolved in}} the fall of 1894, and Edison quit supplying blanks to Columbia, who had purchased 70,000 blanks from 1889 to 1894. Columbia was frantic to find a solution to make cylinder blanks in house, and the recipe for making Edison's wax was a well kept secret. Thomas McDonald started doing experiments with wax alloys with poor results: the records fogged or decomposed in the summer, just like the early Edison blanks. The Columbia company had a deadline to either supply recordings, or have their contracts cancelled and be sued for loss of records. Columbia resorted to attempt to steal secrets from Edison company by hiring old Edison Phonograph Works employees, such as Mr. Storms. Unfortunately for Columbia, the names of the components used by Edison were not labeled with ingredients but were instead indicated by number (i.e. 1,2,3 keeping the identities of these components a secret.) Paraffin, ceresine, and ozokerite all look similar, making the tempering agent even more difficult to be identified by the wax mixer. Wax mixers were given instructions on how much of the numbered components to put in the mixture, and how to process it, but no idea as to what the ingredients actually were. It took over a year for Columbia {{to come up with the}} formula for cylinders. Columbia placed an ad in the Soap Makers' Journal for a practical man to work with <b>metallic</b> <b>soaps.</b> Adolph Melzer, a soap manufacturer from Evansville, Indiana took the job.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Chemical Engineering, İzmir, 2003 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 80 - 83) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishvi, 83 leavesZinc stearate (ZnSt 2) is {{an important}} compound among the <b>metallic</b> <b>soaps.</b> It has many applications e. g., in resins, paints, cosmetics, textile, lubricants and Langmuir-Blodgett films. Double decomposition (precipitation) and fusion processes are widely used techniques in ZnSt 2 production. The product purity {{has been a major}} concern in most of the ZnSt 2 applications such as PVC stabilization, coating of textile goods, additive in cosmetic products. In this study, the production of ZnSt 2 using precipitation, fusion and modified fusion processes was investigated based on product purity. Raw materials and ZnSt 2 were characterized by using various techniques. In the precipitation process, in order to maximize the solubility of sodium stearate and to minimize the water evaporation, the reaction was carried out at 70 °C. 2. 5 % (w) NaSt was used in the reaction at this temperature. The equivalent, excess Zn and deficient Zn cases were studied to determine the raw materials ratio on product purity. Equivalent raw materials produced highest product purity. From washing experiment, it was seen that Na 2 SO 4 adsorption did not take place on to wet ZnSt 2. The washing water to zinc stearate ratio was found to be 40 dm 3 /kg for effective removal of by products and raw materials unreacted at room temperature. Any further increase in the amount of water did not bring any significant removal results. In the drying of wet ZnSt 2 at 100 °C, it was determined that it has 85 % (w) water. In IR spectra, characteristic ZnSt 2 peak was observed at 1540 cm- 1. ZnSt 2 obtained by this process did not contain any free Na+ and SO 4 - 2 ions as indicated by ICP, EDX and elemental analysis results. Only two of the characteristic peaks of ZnSt 2 at 2. values of 6. 40 and 19. 58 were obtained in XRD pattern of the dried product due to low crystallinity. From SEM micrographs, it was seen that zinc stearate has lamellar structure and particle size changes between 2 - 4. m. Melting point of the zinc stearate was found to be about 122 °C using optic microscopy with temperature controlled hot stage. In fusion process, reaction was carried out at 140 °C in equivalent amounts for different stirring rates 400, 600 and 750 rpm. The increase in mixing rate decreased the delay time occurring {{at the beginning of the}} reaction. The conversion was found to be 80 % using the developed method from IR spectra. In the comparison of the experimental conversion data with shrinking core model no relation was established. In IR spectra, two peaks observed at 1540 cm- 1 and 1700 cm- 1 which belong to ZnSt 2 COO- stretching and stearic acid C. O stretching vibrations, respectively. All of the characteristic 2. values of zinc stearate were observed for product, which means that the crystallinity of the product is high. From SEM micrographs, it was seen that zinc stearate structure is in the form of layered lamella and particle size change between 4 - 6. m. The melting point of zinc stearate samples from fusion process was found to be slightly lower than 122 °C by optic microscopy with temperature-controlled hotstage. In the modified fusion process, reaction was carried out at 80 °C for 1 h. with equivalent amounts of stearic acid and zinc oxide in the presence of H 2 O. Sodium stearate 1. 5 % (w) was added into reaction mixture as a surfactant and its effect was examined. At the end of reaction it was seen from IR spectra that it does not significantly increase the reactants dispersion. The presence of unreacted raw materials was determined in IR spectras and XRD patterns. This result was confirmed by SEM micrographs too. In TGA analysis, thermal decomposition temperature of zinc stearate was found to be 250 °C. The use of zinc stearate in n-paraffin wax shifted the thermal decomposition temperature of wax 10 °C. Increasing the amount of zinc stearate in n-paraffin increased the decomposition temperature of wax. According to the results of this study, for pure zinc stearate production precipitation process should be preferred in spite of high wash water consumption. The fusion and modified fusion processes needs to be studied further to increase the conversion and decrease the delay time...|$|R
