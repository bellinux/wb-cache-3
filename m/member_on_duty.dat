50|$|The crew {{split into}} shifts after {{reaching}} orbit, with Gardner, Parker, and Parise comprising the Red Team; the Blue team consisted of Hoffman, Durrance, and Lounge. Commander Vance Brand was unassigned to either team and helped coordinate mission activities. The telescopes were powered up and raised from their stowed position by the Red Team 11 {{hours into the}} flight. Observations began under the Blue Team 16 hours into the mission after the instruments were checked out. In a typical ASTRO-1 ultraviolet observation, the flight crew <b>member</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> maneuvered the Shuttle to point the cargo bay {{in the general direction}} of the astronomical object to be observed. The mission specialist commanded the pointing system to aim the telescopes toward the target. They also locked on to guide stars to help the pointing systemremain stable despite orbiter thruster firings. The payload specialist set up each instrument for the upcomingobservation, identified the celestial target on the guide television, and provided the necessary pointing correctionsfor placing the object precisely in the telescope's field of view. He then started the instrument observation sequencesand monitored the data being recorded. Because the many observations created a heavy workload, the payloadand mission specialists worked together to perform these complicated operations and evaluate the quality ofobservations. Each observation took between 10 minutes to a little over an hour.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{wireless}} remote teleoperated and autonomous mobile security robot {{based on a}} multisensor system to monitor the ship/cabin environment. By doing this, pilots in charge of monitoring can be {{away from the scene}} and feel like being at the site monitoring and responding to any potential safety problems. Also, this robot can be a supplementary device for safety cabin crew members who are very busy and/or very tired of properly responding to crises. This can make one crew <b>member</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> at the cabin a possible option. In fact, when the robot detects something unusual in the cabin, it can also notify the pilot so that the pilot can teleoperate the robot to response to whatever is needed. As a result, a cabin without any crew members on duty can be achieved through this type of robot/system...|$|E

Some airlines impose additional restrictions, and many pilots also impose stricter standards upon themselves. Commercial pilots found to be in violation of regulations are typically fired or resign voluntarily, and they may lose their pilot certificates and be subject to criminal prosecution under Federal or State laws, effectively ending their careers.|$|R
