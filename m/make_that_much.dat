Why in the deuce hadn’t Lon given me the tip before we arrived? I looked at her face, unnoticed by her, and the longer I looked the harder it was to take my eyes away. It was a wonderfully beautiful face, unearthly, I may say, with a light in it or an expression or something “that was never on land or sea.” Fear and terror had completely vanished, and it was a placidly beautiful face—if by “placid” one can characterize that intangible and occult something that I cannot say was a radiance or a light any more than I can say it was an expression.|$|E

The NFL could not guarantee that they would <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> and refused. A representative for Bradshaw has since denied this report. After an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (February 6, 2006) Bradshaw stated that the reason why he did not attend the MVP parade was that he was spending time with family, that he hates the crowds and the Super Bowl media circus, and also that the only way he would attend a Super Bowl is when Fox is broadcasting the game (it was ABC who broadcast Super Bowl XL), though Bradshaw attended several press conferences in Detroit days earlier. Bradshaw also stated that money was not an issue.|$|E

50|$|With the {{proposal}} of the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004, {{it was to}} be determined by the Commissioner that any violator was subject to fines up to $275,000 for the first violation, $375,000 for the second violation, and $500,000 for the third and any subsequent violations. The incremental increase of fines seemed appropriate, but the Houses continuously amended the bill and ultimately it never passed. A strong resistance within the creative community rose in conjunction with the fine appropriation. Radio host Dave Ross noted that “The concern, of course, is that if Congress has the power to outlaw one word, it has the power to outlaw another word.... And {{the fact that it was}} indecency and not politics doesn't <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> difference, because if you give the government the power to decide what you can hear, you've given them power over discourse.” With responses like these, the legislation eventually lost the momentum behind it.The last action on the bill occurred as it was placed on Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders.

5000|$|After {{successfully}} {{testing and}} detonating his deadly bomb on Philippine Airlines Flight 434, Yousef returned to Manila and began preparing {{at least a}} dozen bombs each with a higher concentration of explosive materials. But just weeks before the Bojinka Plot was due to be launched, Murad was mixing chemicals which started a fire on January 6, 1995. Yousef and Murad fled the fire, but Murad was sent back to retrieve the laptop computer in the apartment, which contained the plans for the attack. He called himself Ahmed Saeed as he was being arrested. He offered 110,740 Philippine pesos ($2,000 U.S. dollars) to the Manila police if they let him go.

50|$|In {{the case}} of the {{application}} of radar, all there was at the beginning was a variation of the cathode ray tube which would show only the distance to a single target. Only with the introduction of the more familiar round-screen format would radar reach its full potential. So, there were the raw data, but without the use of a readable 2- or 3-D format no-one can <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> use of this information. One thing to remember about radar is {{that when it comes to}} illuminating aircraft, most of the energy is deflected. Only the existence of corners, air intakes and flat surfaces that face the radar makes it possible to detect these aircraft. What is actually seen by traffic controllers is the return beep from the aircraft's IFF. As in {{the case of}} 9/11, once the hijacked aircraft's IFF was turned off, there wasn't much to see. This can also be seen in the use of radar reflectors that are routinely added to power lines in order to avoid crashes by low-flying aircraft. The actual characteristics of synthetic aperture radar is of course, classified, so one can only speculate on what is actually observable.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{state that}} the tax cuts, {{including}} those given to middle and lower income households, failed to spur growth. Critics have further stated that the cuts also increased the budget deficit, shifted the tax burden from the rich to the middle and working classes, and further increased already high levels of income inequality. [...] Economists Peter Orszag and William Gale described the Bush tax cuts as reverse government redistribution of wealth, [...] "shifting the burden of taxation away from upper-income, capital-owning households and toward the wage-earning households of the lower and middle classes." [...] Supporters argued that the tax brackets were still more progressive than the brackets from 1986 until 1992, with higher marginal rates on the upper class, and lower marginal rates {{on the middle class}} than established by either the Tax Reform Act of 1986 or the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.Economist Simon Johnson wrote in 2010: [...] "The U.S. government doesn’t take in much tax revenue—at least 10 percentage points of GDP less than comparable developed economies—and it also doesn’t spend much except on the military, Social Security and Medicare. Other parts of government spending can be frozen or even slashed, but it just won’t <b>make</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> difference. That means older Americans are going to get squeezed, while our ability to defend ourselves goes into decline. Just because there’s a bipartisan consensus on an idea, such as tax cuts, doesn’t mean it makes sense.
