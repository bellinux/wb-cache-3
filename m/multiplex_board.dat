50|$|On 11 June 2007, Brookfield Asset Management {{proposed}} an acquisition of Multiplex which valued {{the company at}} approximately A$7.3 billion. The offer to shareholders of $5.05 per security {{was supported by the}} <b>Multiplex</b> <b>board</b> of directors, including the Roberts family, who sold their 26% ownership of Multiplex to Brookfield. The offer also proved popular with investors, with Brookfield rapidly acquiring 90% ownership of the company by 31 October 2007.|$|E
50|$|A {{climbing}} wall is an artificially constructed {{wall with}} grips for hands and feet, usually used for indoor climbing, but sometimes located outdoors. Some are brick or wooden constructions, but on most modern walls, the material {{most often used}} is a thick <b>multiplex</b> <b>board</b> with holes drilled into it. Recently, manufactured steel and aluminum have also been used. The wall may have places to attach belay ropes, but may {{also be used to}} practise lead climbing or bouldering.|$|E
50|$|Each hole {{contains}} a specially formed t-nut to allow modular climbing holds to be screwed onto the wall. With manufactured steel or aluminum walls, an engineered industrial fastener {{is used to}} secure climbing holds. The face of the <b>multiplex</b> <b>board</b> climbing surface is covered with textured products including concrete and paint or polyurethane loaded with sand. In addition to the textured surface and hand holds, the wall may contain surface structures such as indentions (incuts) and protrusions (bulges), or {{take the form of}} an overhang, underhang or crack.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a new, {{scalable}} and low cost multi-channel monitoring system for Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs) has been designed, constructed and experimentally validated. This developed monitoring system performs non-intrusive voltage measurement {{of each individual}} cell of a PEFC stack and it is scalable, {{in the sense that}} it is capable to carry out measurements in stacks from 1 to 120 cells (from watts to kilowatts). The developed system comprises two main subsystems: hardware devoted to data acquisition (DAQ) and software devoted to real-time monitoring. The DAQ subsystem is based on the low-cost open-source platform Arduino and the real-time monitoring subsystem has been developed using the high-level graphical language NI LabVIEW. Such integration can be considered a novelty in scientific literature for PEFC monitoring systems. An original amplifying and <b>multiplexing</b> <b>board</b> has been designed to increase the Arduino input port availability. Data storage and real-time monitoring have been performed with an easy-to-use interface. Graphical and numerical visualization allows a continuous tracking of cell voltage. Scalability, flexibility, easy-to-use, versatility and low cost are the main features of the proposed approach. The system is described and experimental results are presented. These results demonstrate its suitability to monitor the voltage in a PEFC at cell level.

40|$|Projecte final de carrera realitzat en col. laboració amb Technical University of LodzThe {{main goal}} of this project is to {{implement}} and experimentally verify various control algorithms for MEMS electrostatic actuators. Those algorithms include a charge injection compensation subsystem. The hardware platform consists of some MEMS electrostatic actuators, a front-end sensing system (comprising a full-custom mixed-signal integrated circuit designed at UPC and a highspeed A/D converter) and a Xilinx FPGA for algorithm coding. The work involves the following: o Understanding the working principle of the hardware platform and the issues related to MEMS electrostatic actuators. o Improve the hardware platform, if required by the control algorithm. This might involve some simple PCB design and test with laboratory instrumentation. o Algorithm implementation in VHDL. This includes the signal-processing algorithms and also the ancillary routines for I/O data extraction and signal visualization. Capacitance of MEMS electrostatic actuators were measured under different voltages conditions. It was found that positive voltage stress caused negative charging of the dielectric whereas negative voltage stress caused positive charging of the dielectric. This {{is consistent with the}} nature of traps in the silicon oxynitride dielectric used for the switches. Report is divided into three parts, the first chapter is devoted to the description to the MEMS word. The chapter is devoted a small <b>multiplexing</b> <b>board</b> design description.

40|$|Electrical {{impedance}} spectroscopy is a non-invasive {{technology for}} characterizing the dielectric properties of biological tissues and cells. Electrical impedance tomography extends impedance measurements from one dimension {{to two or}} three dimensions. Impedance measurements are performed across multiple electrodes, mapping the conductivity distribution within an object. In this paper, electrical impedance tomography is used to image a multi-nucleated cell, Physarum polycephalum, growing on agar gel in a miniaturized chip containing a circular 16 -electrode array. An impedance analyzer combined with a USB-controlled <b>multiplexing</b> circuit <b>board</b> is used to perform adjacent impedance measurements.

The South Pole Telescope is a 10 -meter millimeter-wavelength telescope designed to measure anisotropies in {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) at arcminute angular resolution.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{analyses}} {{an effective}} method of increasing accuracy of active power measurement (and energy measurement) by non-coherent sampling. The measurement bias caused by non-coherent sampling are reduced by windowing the instantaneous power sequence of samples by various generalized cosine windows. Active power is found by processing signal in time domain, without using FFT. Newly obtained analytical formulae are given, a comparison to classical method and numerical simulations verifying the derived formulae are presented. A simple method of compensation multiplexing delay by measurement using <b>multiplexing</b> DAQ plug-in <b>board</b> is explained and verified both in simulation and measurement. Application of windowing for measurement of multi-frequency signals is also included, formula for standard uncertainty of active power estimate is given. Basic numerical integration methods applied to quantized input signals in power computation are briefly compared, and numerical values showing decrease in power bias for selected windows are shown...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} multibeam {{satellite system}} with a new multiple access technique and an on-board baseband switch with priority rule is analyzed. The performance analysis includes the computation of the various packet loss, call locking, and packet delays of a typical user in an integrated satellite internetworking environment. The uplink technique employed is a hybrid packet/circuit switched approach of the Demand Assignment type, while the down link is a Time Division <b>Multiplexing</b> technique. On <b>board</b> the satellite, a baseband nonblocking switch is employed to route packets from input to output ports. Various amounts of input and output buffering as well as priority rules and a head of line blocking resolution algorithm are employed to improve {{the performance of the}} data services without affecting other services performance. The delay and throughput characteristics of the services are determined by examining the relationships between the head of line resolution, buffer sizes, and internal speedup ratio of the baseband switch...|$|R
40|$|The NEMO {{collaboration}} {{proposes to}} build an underwater neutrino telescope located South-East off the Sicily coast. This paper describes the concepts underlying the communication link design going over the whole data acquisition and transport from the front-end electronics to the module sending data on-shore through a fiber optic link which relies on Dense Wavelength Division <b>Multiplexing.</b> An on-shore <b>board,</b> plugged into a PC, extracts and distributes data both to first-level trigger and control systems. Underwater apparatus monitoring and controls are guaranteed by oceanographic instruments and dedicated sensors, whose data are packed and sent back to shore using the same optical link. The communication is fully bidirectional, allowing transmission of timing and control commands. The architecture described here provides a complete real-time data transport layer between the onshore laboratory and the underwater detector. During winter 2006 a first prototype of the apparatus has been deployed: calibration results from the currently working system are here reported. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
