500|$|Morrison's {{libretto}} was {{appreciated by}} various critics as [...] "charming" [...] and for having [...] "wit and characterful colours" [...] and supplying [...] "jaunty lines ... some individual characters, dramatic story-telling". Tanner, however, thought the text rather opaque {{and found the}} problem of comprehension aggravated by the high vocal lines which {{made it difficult to}} <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
500|$|It {{was here}} where the young Como {{acquired}} polish {{and his own}} unique style, {{with the help of}} Ted Weems. Mutual's Chicago affiliate [...] WGN radio threatened to stop carrying the Weems broadcasts from Chicago's Palmer House if Weems's new singer did not improve. Weems had recordings of some previous radio programs; one evening he and Como listened to them after the show. From listening to them, Como was shocked to realize that no one could <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> to the songs he was singing. Weems told Como {{there was no need for}} him to resort to vocal tricks; what was necessary was to sing from the heart.|$|E
6000|$|After {{several days}} Trot {{received}} a postal card from Button-Bright. It was awkwardly scrawled, {{for the boy}} was {{not much of a}} writer, but Trot managed to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> It read as follows: ...|$|E

I {{observed}} that he could rarely sound the letter r, but used l, as also r for l sometimes; as load for road, pickelel for pickerel, Soogle Island for Sugar Island. He generally added the syllable um to his words, as paddlum, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Early in the ensemble's life, {{band members}} would compose lengthy verses, which usually rhymed and {{contained}} words {{chosen to be}} awkward to pronounce. These were distributed to the band members who would cheer them {{on the way to}} the stadium and at other times during the game, frequently to the confusion of spectators who could not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> all <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> Often these cheers, known to band members as [...] "Spam," [...] were often customized to poke fun at specific opponents.|$|R
60|$|The snoring {{got more}} {{distinct}} every minute, and {{sounded more like}} a tune: at last she could even <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> and she listened so eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly missed them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alberto Montani, confectioner, deposes that he {{was among}} the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.

Thinks it the voice of a Russian. Corroborates the general testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of Russia.|$|E
60|$|The {{ground was}} {{as soft as}} velvet, and my {{footsteps}} gave forth no sound. When the wind lulled I paused behind a tree and waited for another gusty roar. I kept {{very close to the}} trail, for that was the only means by which I could return to my horses. I felt the skin tighten on my face. Suddenly, as I paused, I beard angry voices, pitched high. But I could not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{point of}} {{interest}} dating {{from the time of}} the Revolution, when Christianity was suppressed and Saint-Sulpice became a place for worship of the [...] "Supreme Being", is a printed sign over the center door of the main entrance. One can still barely <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> printed <b>words</b> ‘’Le Peuple Francais Reconnoit L’Etre Suprême Et L’Immortalité de L’Âme’’ ("The French people recognize the Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul"). Further questions of interest are the fate of the frieze that this must have replaced, the persons responsible for placing this manifesto and the reasons that it has been left in place.|$|R
60|$|Jock puzzled {{his head}} in vain {{over the meaning of}} <b>the</b> <b>words</b> he had heard. The {{governor}} had while speaking been facing the door; but to what he alluded, or what it was that the officer had declared strong enough to hold half a dozen Scots, Jock could not in <b>the</b> slightest degree <b>make</b> <b>out.</b> Still <b>the</b> <b>words</b> were strange and might be important; and he resolved, directly the preparations were finished and the place closed, so that there could be no chance of his learning more, to return himself to Archie instead of sending a message, as much might depend upon his repeating, word for word, what he had heard, as there was somehow, he felt, a significance {{in the manner in which}} the question had been asked and answered more than in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> themselves.|$|R
60|$|She was glad, as {{with new}} meaning, she watched their proceedings, {{to see how}} easily, {{and as a matter}} of course, Louis let Mary bring his {{footstool}} and his slipper, fetch his books, each at the proper time, read Spanish with him, and <b>make</b> him look <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> in <b>the</b> dictionary when he knew them by intuition, remind him of orders to be written for his buildings, and manage him as her pupil. If she ruled, it was with perfect calmness and simplicity, and the playfulness was that of brother and sister, not even with the coquettish intimacy of cousinhood.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the little}} antechamber, after his admission, {{he heard a}} high voice come from the salon and, {{stopping}} a moment to listen, noted that Miriam was already launched in a recitation. He was able to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> all the more that before he could prevent the movement the maid-servant who had led him in had already {{opened the door of}} the room--one of the leaves of it, there being, as in most French doors, two of these--before which, within, a heavy curtain was suspended. Miriam was in the act of rolling out some speech from the English poetic drama-- ...|$|E
60|$|She didn’t {{return the}} wish audibly, though her lips did move a little, while her gaze black like a starless night never {{for a moment}} wavered before him. He stepped in, and {{as he turned to}} close the door she was still there {{motionless}} and disturbing, with her voluptuous mouth and slanting eyes, with the expression of expectant sensual ferocity of a baffled cat. He hesitated for a moment, and in the dumb house he heard again the blood pulsating ponderously in his ears, while once more the illusion of Tom’s voice speaking earnestly somewhere near by was specially terrifying, because this time he could not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Fortune favoured me again. I had scarce {{got to the}} top of {{the first}} hill when I spied a light on my left, about a furlong away. It might be a case of sickness; what else it was likely to be--in so rustic a neighbourhood, and at such an ungodly time of the morning--was beyond my fancy. A faint sound of singing became audible, and {{gradually}} swelled as I drew near, until at last I could <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> which were singularly appropriate both to the hour and to the condition of the singers. [...] "The cock may craw, the day may daw," [...] they sang; and sang it with such laxity both in time and tune, and such sentimental complaisance in the expression, as assured me they had got far into the third bottle at least.|$|E
6000|$|... "She has {{youth and}} age all at once--that is rare. Her father is an {{interesting}} man, too; I am trying to paint him; he is very difficult. He sits lost {{in some kind of}} vacancy of his own; a man whose soul has gone before him somewhere, like that of his Church, escaped from this age of machines, leaving its body behind--is it not? He is so kind; a saint, I think. The other clergymen I see passing in the street are not at all like him; they look buttoned-up and busy, with faces of men who might be schoolmasters or lawyers, or even soldiers--men of this world. Do you know this, monsieur--it is ironical, but it is true, I think a man cannot be a successful priest unless {{he is a man of}} this world. I do not see any with that look of Monsieur Pierson, a little tortured within, and not quite present. He is half an artist, really a lover of music, that man. I am painting him at the piano; when he is playing his face is alive, but even then, so far away. To me, monsieur, he is exactly like a beautiful church which knows it is being deserted. I find him pathetic. Je suis socialiste, but I have always an aesthetic admiration for that old Church, which held its children by simple emotion. The times have changed; it can no longer hold them so; it stands in the dusk, with its spire to a heaven which exists no more, its bells, still beautiful but out of tune with the music of the streets. It is something of that which I wish to get into my picture of Monsieur Pierson; and sapristi! it is difficult!" [...] Fort grunted assent. So far as he could <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> painter's <b>words,</b> it seemed to him a large order.|$|R
5000|$|The Doom Buggies drift {{out of an}} Attic {{window and}} onto the balcony, coming {{face to face with}} the Hatbox Ghost amidst a starry night sky filled with wispy spirits rising from the Graveyard below. The Doom Buggies turn around, and tip {{backward}} down a 15-percent grade surrounded by dark, ghoulish trees with knotted expressions. The red-eyed raven (previously seen in the Conservatory and Séance Circle) caws at guests from a branch overhead as guests enter the Graveyard. The Doom Buggies then reach the ground and turn towards the gate of the Graveyard. There stands a caretaker and his dog, the attractions only [...] "living" [...] characters. The caretaker cowers in fright, an expression of terror on his face, while his emaciated dog whines and whimpers. The dog is said to be based on Walts childhood dog Rover, and also appears in the Carousel of Progress. Around the corner, a ghostly band of minstrels plays a jazzy rendition of [...] "Grim Grinning Ghosts" [...] as a family of cats and two owls join in harmony. Ghouls pop up from behind tombstones, a king and queen balance on a teeter-totter, and a skeletal hellhound howls from behind guests. The Doom Buggies travel down a hill and turn to see five expressive haunted busts singing [...] "Grim Grinning Ghosts" [...] in barbershop harmony. Next, guests encounter a ghostly tea party surrounding a hearse stuck in the mud. A bony arm protrudes from a crypt with a wine glass in its hand, while banshees ride bicycles in the distance. An Egyptian mummy sits up in his sarcophagus, holding a cup of tea and singing along, while the ghost of a [...] "wise old man" [...] from the Renaissance period holds an ear trumpet to his ear in an attempt to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> muffled <b>words</b> of <b>the</b> mummy. The Doom Buggies then turn and pass a group of singing ghosts (an operatic pair, a decapitated knight, a masked executioner, and a prisoner) standing in front of a series of crypts. A bony arm holding a trowel protrudes from a partially walled-up crypt, its occupant attempting to finish the job.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{letter from}} Godolphin in the morning, {{but in the}} course of the forenoon there came a {{newspaper}} addressed in his handwriting, and later several others. They were Midland papers, and they had each, heavily outlined in ink, a notice of the appearance of Mr. Launcelot Godolphin in a new play written expressly for him by a young Boston littérateur. Mr. Godolphin believed the author to be destined to make his mark high in the dramatic world, he said {{in the course of}} a long interview in the paper which came first, an evening edition preceeding the production of the piece, and plainly meant to give the public the right perspective. He had entered into a generous expression of his own feelings concerning it, and had given Maxwell full credit for the lofty conception of an American drama, modern in spirit, and broad in purpose. He modestly reserved to himself such praise as might be due for the hints his life-long knowledge of the stage had enabled him to offer the dramatist. He told how they had spent the summer near each other on the north shore of Massachusetts, and had met almost daily; and the reporter got a picturesque bit out of their first meeting at the actor's hotel, in Boston, the winter before, when the dramatist came to lay the scheme of the play before Godolphin, and Godolphin made up his mind before he had heard him half through, that he should want the piece. He had permitted himself a personal sketch of Maxwell, which lost none of its original advantages in the diction of the reporter, and which represented him as young, slight in figure, with a refined and delicate face, bearing the stamp of intellectual force; a journalist from the time he left school, and one of the best exponents of the formative influences of the press in the training of its votaries. From time to time it was hard for Maxwell to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> whose <b>words</b> <b>the</b> interview was couched in, but he acquitted Godolphin of the worst, and he certainly did not accuse him of the flowery terms giving his patriotic reasons for not producing the piece first in Toronto as he had meant to do. It appeared that, upon second thoughts, he had reserved this purely American drama for the opening night of his engagement in one of the most distinctively American cities, after having had it in daily rehearsal ever since the season began.|$|R
60|$|Hans {{promptly}} snubbed {{with the}} rope, as though Buck were a boat. The rope thus tightening {{on him in}} the sweep of the current, he was jerked under the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body struck against the bank and he was hauled out. He was half drowned, and Hans and Pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him and {{the water out of}} him. He staggered to his feet and fell down. The faint sound of Thornton's voice came to them, and though they could not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of it, they knew that he was in his extremity. His master's voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He sprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous departure.|$|E
60|$|With {{a curious}} swaying motion which I {{have never seen}} {{anything}} like--for he seemed less to be walking than to be impelled from behind like a perambulator, or dragged from in front like a canal-boat--he advanced to the table, where lay some pieces of a white substance like papyrus, all of the same size and oblong shape, which showed on their surfaces, some of them antique-looking figures and faces curiously stained, and others red and black dots, arranged, as it seemed to me, in some sort of design, although at first sight they looked jumbled enough. Near to these lay a book bound in brown, but with heavy black and gold lettering, amid which I thought I could <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> Modern Magic, and the name Hoffmann. The swathed figure poised itself a moment, resting one thin hand on the table, and then spoke.|$|E
60|$|Not a {{sound was}} heard {{through the whole}} forest for some hours, but at midnight there {{suddenly}} arose such a clamour that the young man, tired as he was, started broad awake in an instant. Peeping cautiously between the wooden pillars of the chapel, he saw a troop of hideous cats, dancing furiously, making the night horrible with their yells. The full moon lighted up the weird scene, and the young warrior gazed with astonishment, taking great care to keep still, lest he should be discovered. After some time he thought that {{in the midst of}} all their shrieks he could <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> 'Do not tell Schippeitaro! Keep it hidden and secret! Do not tell Schippeitaro!' Then, the midnight hour having passed, they all vanished, and the youth was left alone. Exhausted by all that had been going on round him, he flung himself on the ground and slept till the sun rose.|$|E

6000|$|In {{a corner}} of the Cathedral {{graveyard}} at Spanish Town, overhung by a big spreading mango tree, and thickly covered by prickly scrub of agave and cactus, the white-haired old mulatto gentleman led Cecil Mitford up to a water-worn and weathered stone, on which a few crumbling letters alone were still visible. Cecil kneeled down on the bare ground, regardless of the sharp cactus spines that stung and tore his flesh, and began clearing the moss and lichen away from the neglected monument. Yes, his host was right! right, right, right, indubitably. The first two letters were IO, then a blank where others were obliterated, and then came ANN. That stood clearly for IOHN CANN. And below he could slowly <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> [...] "Born at ... vey Tra ... Devon...." [...] with an illegible date, [...] "Died at P ... Royal, May 12, 1669." [...] Oh, great heavens, yes. John Cann's grave! John Cann's grave! John Cann's grave! Beyond any shadow or suspicion of mistake, John Cann and his precious secret lay buried below that mouldering tombstone.|$|E
6000|$|All this {{passed in}} such low tones that {{we seemed to}} <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> more by {{watching}} each other’s lips than through our sense of hearing. Man is a strange animal. I didn’t care what I said. All I wanted was to keep her in her pose, excited and still, sitting up with her hair loose, softly glowing, the dark brown fur making a wonderful contrast with the white lace on her breast. All I was thinking of {{was that she was}} adorable and too lovely for words! I cared for nothing but that sublimely aesthetic impression. It summed up all life, all joy, all poetry! It had a divine strain. I am certain that I was not in my right mind. I suppose I was not quite sane. I am convinced that at that moment of the four people in the house it was Doña Rita who upon the whole was the most sane. She observed my face and I am sure she read there something of my inward exaltation. She knew what to do. In the softest possible tone and hardly above her breath she commanded: “George, come to yourself.” ...|$|E
60|$|She {{sat with}} her hands nervously clasped, a spot of colour on her high cheek bones, {{listening}} to {{what was about to}} happen below. They all listened. They heard him clatter down the wooden stairs and throw open the door. The singing stopped suddenly, but the gramophone continued to bray out its vulgar tune. They heard Davidson's voice and then the noise of something heavy falling. The music stopped. He had hurled the gramophone on the floor. Then again they heard Davidson's voice, they could not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> then Miss Thompson's, loud and shrill, then a confused clamour as though several people were shouting together at the top of their lungs. Mrs Davidson gave a little gasp, and she clenched her hands more tightly. Dr Macphail looked uncertainly from her to his wife. He did not want to go down, but he wondered if they expected him to. Then there was something that sounded like a scuffle. The noise now was more distinct. It might be that Davidson was being thrown out of the room. The door was slammed. There was a moment's silence and they heard Davidson come up the stairs again. He went to his room.|$|E

5000|$|The {{treaty was}} quite {{controversial}} for many reasons.

60|$|I {{am aware}} that the Rev. Jonas Tutchel, in a recent {{communication}} to the 'Bogus Four Corners Weekly Meridian,' has endeavored to show {{that this is the}} sepulchral inscription of Thorwald Eriksson, who, as is well-known, was slain in Vinland by the natives. But I think he has been misled by a preconceived theory, and cannot but feel that he has thus made an ungracious return for my allowing him to inspect the stone with the aid of my own glasses (he having by accident left his at home) and in my own study. The heathen ancients might have instructed this Christian minister in the rites of hospitality; but much is to be pardoned to the spirit of self-love. He must indeed be ingenious who can <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> hèr hvilir from any characters in the inscription in question, which, whatever else it may be, is certainly not mortuary. And even should the reverend gentleman succeed in persuading some fantastical wits of the soundness of his views, I do not see what useful end he will have gained. For if the English Courts of Law hold the testimony of gravestones from the burial-grounds of Protestant dissenters to be questionable, even where it is essential in proving a descent, I cannot conceive that the epitaphial assertions of heathens should be esteemed of more authority by any man of orthodox sentiments.|$|E
60|$|Again Wilkins {{shouted at}} the top of his voice, and waved his arms more frantically than before. Tom could not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> He judged, however, that no man would put himself to such violent {{physical}} exertion without good reason, so he turned and looked cautiously around him. Presently he heard a crashing sound in the bushes, and a few moments afterwards observed three buffaloes tearing along the path in which he stood. It was these that Wilkins had seen from the boat when he attempted in vain to warn his friend. Tom jumped behind a bush, and as they passed tried to fire, but the foliage was so dense that he failed to get a good aim. Reserving his fire, therefore, he dashed after them at full speed. After running some distance the buffaloes stood still, and the nearest bull turned round and looked at Tom, who instantly sent a two ounce ball crashing into his shoulder. This turned them, and they all three made off at once, but the wounded one fell behind. Tom therefore stopped to reload, feeling pretty sure of him. Starting off in pursuit, he gained on the wounded animal at every stride, and was about to fire again, when his limbs were for a moment paralysed, and his heart was made almost to stand still at the sight of three full-grown lions which sprang at the unfortunate brute from a neighbouring thicket. They had no doubt gone there to rest for the day, but the sight of a lame and bleeding buffalo was a temptation too strong for them. The lions did not leap upon him, but, seizing him with their teeth and claws, stood on their hind legs and tried to tear him down with terrible ferocity.|$|E
