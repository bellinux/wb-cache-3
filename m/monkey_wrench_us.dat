5000|$|Adjustable coach {{wrenches}} for the odd-sized nuts of wagon wheels were {{manufactured in}} England and exported to North America {{in the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They were set either by sliding a wedge, or later by twisting the handle, which turned a screw, narrowing or widening the jaws. In 1840, Worcester, Massachusetts knife manufacturer Loring Coes invented a screw-based coach wrench design in which the jaw width was set with a spinning ring fixed under the sliding lower jaw, above the handle. This was patented in 1841 and the tools were advertised and sold in the United States as <b>monkey</b> <b>wrenches,</b> a term which was already in use for the English handle-set coach wrenches. For the next eighty-seven years a very wide and popular range of <b>monkey</b> <b>wrenches</b> was manufactured by Coes family partnerships, licensees and companies, which filed further wrench patents throughout the nineteenth century. Some Coes wrenches could be bought with wooden knife handles, harking back to the company's early knife making business. In 1909 the Coes Wrench Company advertised a six-foot-long [...] "key" [...] wrench, shaped like a <b>monkey</b> <b>wrench,</b> for use on railroads. The Coes wrench designs were acquired by longtime toolmaker Bemis & Call of Springfield, Massachusetts in 1928. After 1939 its successor companies manufactured <b>monkey</b> <b>wrenches</b> from Coes designs until the mid-1960s, yielding a production run of over 120 years.|$|R
