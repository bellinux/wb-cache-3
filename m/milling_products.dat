50|$|Neenah did not {{in general}} suffer {{economically}} due to these changes however, because the water power on the Fox River was still valuable. Soon paper mills replaced the flour mills, for example, and well into the 21st Century the Fox River Valley {{remains one of the}} top paper producing areas in the world. There were other additional benefits to the economy of the state of Wisconsin, one being that the Edward P. Allis Company {{was one of the few}} manufacturers who were capable of producing the rollers and auxiliary equipment for the mills, and that company grew rapidly in the latter half of the 19th Century, diversifying from these early flour mill products into a large portfolio of mining and <b>milling</b> <b>products.</b> The Edward P. Allis Company was the forerunner of Allis-Chalmers. Another major effect on the economy of northern Wisconsin came when a consortium of the newly-wealthy Minneapolis millers formed the Soo line railroad for the purpose of shipping their flour products more directly to the east coast and Europe. In the hey day of the logging industry, the Soo Line provided a cheaper, faster and more direct means for lumberjacks and suppliers to reach the lumber camps. Previously these employees and supplies would have to be taken long distances over rough tote roads by wagon, sleigh or on foot.|$|E

40|$|Although Cu and Fe are {{immiscible}} under equilibrium conditions, {{they can}} form supersaturated solid solutions by mechanical alloying. In this paper, nano-structured of the metastable Cu-Fe phase containing 10, 15, 20 and 25 % wt Fe were synthesized by intensive ball milling for 15 h, {{in order to}} achieve a solid solution of Fe in Cu. The phase composition, dissolution of the Fe atoms into the Cu matrix, and the morphology of the <b>milling</b> <b>products</b> were studied by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) techniques, respectively. The mean crystallite size of the milled samples was determined by XRD peak broadening using the Williamson-Hall approximation. The XRD analysis results showed that the solid solubility of the Fe in the Cu was extended to 20 %wt after milling for 15 h, and a homogeneous solid solution of Cu 80 Fe 20 with a mean crystallite size of 19 nm was obtained. The mean crystallite size decreased with increasing milling time and it was more evident in the initial stage of the milling. The Cu lattice parameter increased by dissolving the Fe into the Cu matrix probably due to the magneto-volume effect in the Cu-Fe alloys.

In experiment 1, 16 Holstein cows were {{assigned to one of}} four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. The four diets contained 54. 3 % forage (alfalfa:corn silages, 1 : 1 DM basis) with the wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> replacing 0, 50, 75, or 100 % of the concentrate portion (corn and soybean meal) of the diet (DM basis). The diets containing wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> resulted in 7. 8 % lower DM intake, equivalent milk production (28. 5 kg/ d), and 13. 6 % greater efficiency of 4 % fat-corrected milk (FCM) production than the control diet. There was no effect of diet on ruminal pH. In experiment 2, 16 Holstein cows were assigned to one of four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. The 100 % concentrate replacement diet from experiment 1 was used as control diet. For the test diets, forage was replaced with 15, 30, or 45 % of the corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> (DM basis). Efficiency of FCM production (1. 16) was not affected by diet. Rumination time was reduced for the 30 and 45 % forage replacement diets, but ruminal pH was unaffected. In experiment 3, 30 Holstein cows were assigned at parturition to either a control diet (no corn <b>milling</b> <b>product)</b> or a diet containing 40 % corn milling feed in place of both forage and concentrate (optimal levels from experiments 1 and 2) for 9 wk. The diet containing corn milling feed resulted in 21 % greater efficiency of FCM production than the control diet.
