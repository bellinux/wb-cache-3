5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific. By differing {{the time and}} space between small and large rewards, {{they were able to}} test how these factors affected the decision making in tamarins and <b>marmosets.</b> They showed that tamarins will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as <b>marmosets.</b> Conversely, <b>marmosets</b> will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The tamarins feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The <b>marmosets,</b> on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the <b>marmosets</b> to cover large distances.|$|E
5|$|Delayed {{gratification}} or deferred gratification is {{an animal}} behavior {{that can be}} linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as capuchin monkeys, tamarins, <b>marmosets,</b> rats, and pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Non-human {{primates}} (NHPs) {{are used}} in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of neurology, behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation. They {{are caught in the}} wild or purpose-bred. In the United States and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred. The European Commission reported that in 2011, 6,012 monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 71,188 monkeys in U.S. laboratories in 2016. 23,465 monkeys were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including 929 who were caught in the wild. Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques; but <b>marmosets,</b> spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and chimpanzees {{are used in}} the US. As of 2015, there are approximately 730 chimpanzees in U.S. laboratories.|$|E

5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (<b>marmosets</b> and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The common <b>marmoset</b> {{is widely}} used in {{neuroscience}} and regenerative medicine research. However, information concerning common <b>marmoset</b> disorders, particularly infectious diseases, is scarce. Here, we report {{a case of a}} female common <b>marmoset</b> that died suddenly due to gas gangrene. The animal presented with gaseous abdominal distention at postmortem, and Clostridium perfringens type A was isolated from several tissues. Vacuoles, a Gram-positive bacteremia and intravascular hemolysis were observed microscopically in the muscles, liver and lungs. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed nontraumatic gas gangrene caused by Clostridium perfringens type A in this common <b>marmoset.</b> KEY WORDS: Clostridium perfringens, common <b>marmoset,</b> gas gangrene doi: 10. 1292 /jvms. 15 - 0210; J.

25|$|Pygmy <b>marmosets</b> (Cebuella pygmaea), Goeldi <b>marmosets</b> (Callimico goeldii), pacaranas (Dinomys branickii), {{and eastern}} lowland olingos (Bassaricyon alleni) are found here, {{but not in}} regions to the east. Other {{primates}} present include tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis and Saguinus imperator), brown pale-fronted capuchins (Cebus albifrons), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), white-faced sakis (Pithecia irrorata), and black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus). The rare red uakari monkeys (Cacajao calvus) {{are found in the}} north in swamp forests. Nocturnal two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) are well distributed throughout this region along with the widespread three-toes sloths (Bradypus variegatus). The Amazon River is a barrier to a number of animals such as the tamarins Saguinus nigricollis, which occur on the north side, and Saguinus mystax, which occurs on the southwest side of the Amazon-Ucayali system.|$|E

25|$|The {{experiments}} used <b>marmosets</b> {{that were}} first trained to perform certain behavioral and cognitive tasks, then re-tested after brain damage {{to determine how}} the damage had affected their skills. The monkeys were deprived of food and water to encourage them to perform the tasks, with water being withheld for 22 out of every 24 hours.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether cultured trophoblast tissues, derived from the trophectoderm of <b>marmoset</b> monkey blastocysts, contain homologues of human trophoblast antigens. This is an essential prere-quisite to determine whether the <b>marmoset</b> may be a suitable model for preclinical testing of a human antitropho-blast antigen for fertility regulation. Previously evaluated monoclonal antibodies from the Flinders University labor-atory, which reacted with human trophoblast with a high degree of specificity, were tested for immunohistochemical reactivity using an immunoperoxidase detection method on both frozen and paraformaldehyde-fixed sections of the cultured <b>marmoset</b> monkey trophoblast. All monoclonal antibodies raised against human placenta reacted positively, when compared to controls, suggesting that human and <b>marmoset</b> trophoblast cells share common epitopes. The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies was investigated by determining whether there was cross-reactivity with other <b>marmoset</b> monkey tissues, including adrenal, spleen, kidney, liver, muscle, ovary and testis. The specificities of the monoclonal antibodies on these <b>marmoset</b> tissues were similar to those previously found on the corresponding human tissues. We have concluded that <b>marmoset</b> monkey trophoblast exhibits homologues of human trophoblast antigens. The findings also suggest that <b>marmoset</b> monkeys should be evaluated further as a primate model to test suitable target antigens for antitrophoblast vaccines that may be useful contragestation agents in humans.

25|$|Twins {{are common}} in many animal species, {{including}} cats, sheep, ferrets, giant pandas, dogs, deer, <b>marmosets,</b> and tamarins. The incidence of twinning among cattle is about 1–4%, and research is under way to improve the odds of twinning, which can be more profitable for the breeder if complications can be sidestepped or managed. A female calf that is the twin of a bull becomes partially masculinized and {{is known as a}} freemartin.|$|E
25|$|A common {{example of}} {{polyandrous}} mating {{can be found}} in the field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) of the invertebrate order Orthoptera (containing crickets, grasshoppers, and groundhoppers). Polyandrous behavior is also prominent in many other insect species, including the red flour beetle and the species of spider Stegodyphus lineatus. Polyandry also occurs in some primates such as <b>marmosets,</b> mammal groups, the marsupial genus' Antechinus and bandicoots, around 1% of all bird species, such as jacanas and dunnocks, insects such as honeybees, and fish such as pipefish.|$|E
25|$|Another {{way to look}} at {{punishment}} in cotton-top tamarins is by observing their aggressive behavioral responses within and between groups, as well as between species. The cotton-top tamarin, like many <b>marmosets,</b> other tamarins, and specifically those in the genus Saguinus, stages aggressive displays almost exclusively towards fellow monkeys that belong to the same gender. These intrasexual displays of aggression are more frequent in females, and are vital when a breeding female is forcing both subadult and adult females to emigrate out of a familial group.|$|E
40|$|The common <b>marmoset</b> (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World primate species {{frequently}} {{employed for}} immunological models of human disease. We used flow cytometry to screen {{a panel of}} new anti-human antibodies from the HLDA 8 workshop to establish cross-reactivity with <b>marmoset</b> peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Seventy-seven antibodies were screened of which nine antibodies showed binding. Cross-reactivity of anti-human monoclonal antibodies with CC and CXC chemokine receptors CCR 3, CCR 6, CCR 7, and CCR 8 was demonstrated on untreated <b>marmoset</b> mononuclear cells. Stimulation of <b>marmoset</b> mononuclear cells with ConA and/or PMA-ionomycin resulted in an up-regulated expression of CXCR 1, CXCR 3, and CXCR 4. The expression of TNF-family related molecules TACI and APRIL on <b>marmoset</b> mononuclear cells was also identified. These studies extend the range of cross-reactive antibodies to now include anti-chemokine and anti-TNF family antibodies for this important pre-clinical model species and should provide useful tools for investigation of immunological processes in <b>marmoset</b> monkey models.
