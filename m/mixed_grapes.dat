5000|$|The term Ausbruch {{initially}} {{designated a}} wine made from <b>mixing</b> <b>grapes</b> strongly affected by noble rot with must from less concentrated grapes, in the Spätlese to Beerenauslese range.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of Pichia guilliermondii strains producing {{high levels of}} 4 -ethylphenol in synthetic media was studied in wines and grape juices. These strains lost their viability and did not produce 4 -ethylphenol after 24 hr of inoculation in red wines with ethanol adjusted to 10 or 12 % (v/v) and pH 3. 5, {{in the absence of}} free sulphite. Under the same conditions, at 12 % (v/v) ethanol, growth of Dekkera bruxellensis was observed. When grown in single culture in grape juices, selected strains of P. guilliermondii produced high levels of 4 -ethylphenol. In <b>mixed</b> <b>grape</b> juice fermentations with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P. guilliermondii began to die after starter inoculation at 107 cfu/mL and did not produce 4 -ethylphenol. Low starter inoculation rates (102 cfu/mL) added 72 hr after P. guilliermondii inoculation resulted in high production of 4 -ethylphenol. In conditions mimicking cold pre-fermentative maceration processes, at 10 ºC for 72 hr, P. guilliermondii did not grow, while at 25 ºC growth attained a 104 fold increase. At this temperature, addition of 200 mg/L potassium metabisulfite after grape crushing did not eliminate P. guilliermondii inoculated at 104 cfu/mL in grape juice of pH 3. 57. The possibility that high levels of 4 -ethylphenol in wines are due to the activity of P. guilliermondii should be mostly related with uncontrolled growth in contaminated grape juices before starter inoculation. In wines, its ability to produce 4 -ethylphenol seems to be much lower than that of D. bruxellensis...|$|R

50|$|On {{arrival in}} the chai, the grapes are destemmed and crushed before being {{transferred}} to non-oxidizing concrete or wooden tanks. The maceration of <b>grape</b> skins <b>mixed</b> with <b>grape</b> must begins. Alcoholic fermentation is activated using selected commercial yeasts or yeasts that are naturally present in the bloom on the skins of the grapes. The wine sheds are equipped with temperature-controlled tanks, {{making it possible to}} direct the fermentation process by preventing temperatures from rising too high and then, at the very end, reheating the harvested materials. This procedure is designed to maintain an environment in which the yeasts can efficiently transform the sugar into alcohol, and the colour (anthocyanins) and tannins can best be extracted. Fermentation is a long process, lasting between two and four weeks, depending on the estate and varying from year to year.|$|R

40|$|Background: Grape and {{blueberry}} extracts {{are known}} to protect against age-related cognitive decline. However, beneficial effects achieved by <b>mixing</b> <b>grape</b> and blueberry extracts {{have yet to be}} evaluated in dogs, or their bioavailability assessed. Of concern to us were cases of acute renal failure in dogs, after their ingestion of grapes or raisins. The European Pet Food Industry Federation (2013) considers only the grape or raisin itself to be potentially dangerous; grape-seed extracts per-se, are not considered to be a threat. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the renal and hepatic safety, and measure plasma derivatives of a polyphenol-rich extract from grape and blueberry (PEGB; from the Neurophenols Consortium) in dogs. Polyphenol expression was analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS over 8 hours, for dogs given PEGB at 4 mg/kg. Safety was evaluated using four groups of 6 dogs. These groups received capsules containing no PEGB (control), or PEGB at 4, 20, or 40 mg/kg BW/d, for 24 weeks. Blood and urine samples were taken the week prior to study commencement, then {{at the end of the}} 24 -wk study period. Routine markers of renal and liver damage, including creatinine (Creat), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, minerals, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and alanine transaminase (ALT) were measured. Biomarkers for early renal damage were also evaluated in plasma (cystatin C (CysC), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)), and urine (CysC, clusterin (Clu), and NGAL). Ratios of urinary biomarkers to Creat were calculated, and compared with acceptable maximal values obtained for healthy dogs, as reported in the literature. Results: While several PEGB-specific polyphenols and metabolites were detected in dog plasma, at the end of the PEGB consumption period, our biomarker analyses presented no evidence of either renal or liver damage (Creat, BUN, ionogram, albumin and ALT, ALP). Similarly, no indication of early renal damage could be detected. Plasma CysC, urinary CysC/Creat, Clu/Creat, and NGAL/Creat ratios were all beneath reported benchmarked maximums, with no evidence of PEGB toxicity. Conclusions: Long-term consumption of a pet specific blend of a polyphenol-rich extract from grape and blueberry (PEGB; from the Neurophenols Consortium), was not associated with renal or hepatic injury, and can therefore be considered safe...|$|R

Killer-sensitive strains died off within 24 to 48 h during mixed-strain fermentation. Killer action was demonstrated at pH 3. 0 and pH 3. 5 and over the range of 15 to 25 °C but depended on the proportion of killer to killer-sensitive cells at the commencement of fermentation.

40|$|Grape skins {{recovered}} from winemaking by-products were investigated {{for use as}} sustainable, antioxidant fiber-rich ingredient for the innovation of low-energy dense tomato puree. Six tomato purees fortified with grape skin antioxidant fiber, with varying particle size distribution, and two control tomato purees were studied. Physical parameters of purees were analyzed upon mixing and either an intensive heat treatment or an optimized heat treatment designed to achieve six decimal reductions of a target microorganism (Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris) as recommended for pasteurization of acidic fruit products. <b>Mixing</b> of <b>grape</b> skin antioxidant fiber with tomato purees led to a decrease in both surface-weighted mean diameter (Sauter mean diameter, d(3, 2)) and volume-weighted mean diameter (d(4, 3)) values {{and an increase in}} span. Changes in these descriptors were most significant in purees added with the smallest particle sizes. Thermal stabilization of purees slightly decreased the d(3, 2) values further and increased d(4, 3) values, suggesting concomitant occurrence of particle disaggregation and formation of flocs within the food matrix. Phenolic solubility was inversely correlated to d(3, 2) values. Bostwick consistency, storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli, and complex viscosity (η*) increased in the fortified purees. The η* values displayed a positive correlation with d(4, 3) values. Variations in Hunter colorimetric parameters were within the acceptability threshold. Overall, the information obtained provides knowledge to assist development of fiber-rich, low-energy dense fruit purees...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the {{phylloxera}} louse brought widespread destruction to grapevines, wine production, and those whose livelihoods depended on them; far-reaching repercussions included {{the loss of}} many indigenous varieties.

Some of France's best butter and cheese, for example, is now made from cows that graze on Charentais soil, which was previously covered with vines. Cuvées were also standardized, important in creating certain wines as they are known today; Champagne and Bordeaux finally achieved the <b>grape</b> <b>mixes</b> that now define them.
