Inaccuracies and errors were found for molecular formulae, chemical hydrations, and molar equivalences for iron/EDTA complexation. A comparison with published basal <b>medium</b> <b>formulations</b> from six commercial suppliers uncovered additional inaccuracies, modifications, and errors, thereby emphasizing the need for investigators to examine and describe <b>medium</b> <b>formulations</b> precisely in future publications.

40|$|Abstract: Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 9945 a {{is one of}} the {{bacterial}} strains {{that produce}} �-poly(glutamic acid) (�-PGA). The use of carbohydrate medium components for �-PGA production was explored. Cells were grown in shake flasks or in controlled pH fermentors using <b>medium</b> <b>formulations</b> that contain different carbon sources. During the cultivations, aliquots were removed to monitor cell growth, carbon utilization, polymer production, and polymer molecular weight. Glucose was a better carbon source than glycerol for cell growth. Furthermore, glucose was utilized at a faster rate than glycerol, citrate, or glutamate. However, by using mixtures of glucose and glycerol in <b>medium</b> <b>formulations,</b> the efficiency of �-PGA production increased. For example, by increasing the glycerol in <b>medium</b> <b>formulations</b> from 0 to 40 g/L, the �-PGA broth concentration after 96 h increased from 5. 7 to 20. 5 g/L. Considering that glycerol utilization was low for the glucose/glycerol mixtures studied, it was unclear as to the mechanism by which glycerol leads to enhanced product formation. Cell growth and concomitant �-PGA production (12 g/L) at pH 6. 5 was possible using glucose as a carbon source if trace amounts (0. 5 g/L each) of citrate and glutamate were present in the medium. We suggested that citrate and glutamate were useful in preventing salt precipitation from the medium. In addition, glutamate may be preferred relative to ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source. The conversion of glucose to �-PGA by the strain ATCC 9945 a was believed to occur by glycolysis of glucose to acetyl-CoA and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates that were then metabolized via the TCA cycle to form �-ketoglutarate, which is a direct glutamate precursor. © 1998 John Wiley &...|$|R

In the first study, metabolically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing 4 -coumaroyl:CoA-ligase and chalcone synthase was explored as a platform for producing non-natural flavanones and dihydrochalcones. By precursor addition of cinnamic acid analogues to the engineered yeast, numerous non-natural flavanones and dihydrochalcones were formed. ^ In a second study, S. cerevisiae expressing a flavonoid glucosyltransferase (GT) from Dianthus caryophyllus (carnation flower) was investigated as a whole-cell biocatalyst. GTs are promising biocatalysts for the synthesis of small molecule glycosides. Two yeast expression systems were compared using the flavonoid naringenin as a model substrate. Under in vitro conditions, naringenin 7 -O-glucoside was formed and a higher specific GT activity was found using a galactose inducible expression system compared to a constitutive expression system. The constitutive expression system was significantly more productive than the galactose inducible system under in vivo conditions.

Ten cows naturally infected which were seropositive were selected from small dairy farms, and their urine was collected for bacterial isolation. We evaluated three modifications of liquid Leptospira medium culture supplemented with sodium pyruvate, superoxide dismutase enzyme and fetal bovine serum, and the isolates were characterized by molecular techniques. After isolation and adaptation in standard culture medium, the strains were subcultured for 1 week in the three modified culture media for morphologic evaluation using electronic microscopy. Strains were molecularly identified by multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), partial sequencing and phylogenic analyses of gene sec Y. Combining the liquid culture <b>medium</b> <b>formulations</b> allowed growth of the Leptospira serovar Hardjo in three tubes.

Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report {{the development of a}} fully defined xeno-free medium (RegES), capable of supporting the expansion of human embryonic stem cells (hESC), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and adipose stem cells (ASC). We describe the use of the xeno-free medium in the derivation and long-term (> 80 passages) culture of three pluripotent karyotypically normal hESC lines: Regea 06 / 015, Regea 07 / 046, and Regea 08 / 013. Cardiomyocytes and neural cells differentiated from these cells exhibit features characteristic to these cell types. The same formulation of the xeno-free medium is capable of supporting the undifferentiated growth of iPSCs on human feeder cells. The characteristics of the pluripotent hESC and iPSC lines are comparable to lines derived and cultured in standard undefined culture conditions. In the culture of ASCs, the xeno-free medium provided significantly higher proliferation rates than ASCs cultured in medium containing allogeneic human serum (HS), while maintaining the differentiation potential and characteristic surface marker expression profile of ASCs, although significant differences in the surface marker expression of ASCs cultured in HS and RegES media were revealed. Conclusion/Significance Our results demonstrate that human ESCs, iPSCs and ASCs can be maintained in the same defined xeno-free <b>medium</b> <b>formulation</b> for a prolonged period of time while maintaining their characteristics, demonstrating the applicability of the simplified xeno-free <b>medium</b> <b>formulation</b> for the production of clinical-grade stem cells. The basic xeno-free formulation described herein {{has the potential to be}} further optimized for specific applications relating to establishment, expansion and differentiation of various stem cell types.

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (Lactococcus lactis NZ 9000, Lactococcus lactis MG 1363, Lactobacillus plantarum I-UL 4 and Lactobacillus johnsonii DSM 20553) {{have been}} screened {{for their ability}} to produce folate intracellularly and/or extracellularly. L. plantarum I-UL 4 was shown to be superior producer of folate compared to other strains. Statistically based experimental designs were used to optimize the <b>medium</b> <b>formulation</b> for the growth of L. plantarum I-UL 4 and folate biosynthesis. The optimal values of important factors were determined by response surface methodology (RSM). The effects of carbon sources, nitrogen sources and para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) concentrations on folate biosynthesis were determined prior to RSM study. The biosynthesis of folate by L. plantarum I-UL 4 increased from 36. 36 to 60. 39 µg/L using the optimized <b>medium</b> <b>formulation</b> compared to the selective Man de Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) medium. Conditions for the optimal growth of L. plantarum I-UL 4 and folate biosynthesis as suggested by RSM were as follows: lactose 20 g/L, meat extract 16. 57 g/L and PABA 10 µM. Ispitana je sposobnost mliječno-kiselih bakterija (Lactococcus lactis NZ 9000, Lactococcus lactis MG 1363, Lactobacillus plantarum I-UL 4 i Lactobacillus johnsonii DSM 20553) da intracelularno i/ili ekstracelularno proizvedu folate. Najbolji soj za proizvodnju folata bio je L. plantarum I-UL 4. Statistički je dizajn eksperimenta primijenjen radi optimiranja sastava podloge za uzgoj L. plantarum I-UL 4 i biosintezu folata. Utvrđen je utjecaj koncentracija izvora ugljika i dušika, te para-aminobenzojeve kiseline na biosintezu folata, a zatim su metodom odzivnih površina određene optimalne vrijednosti glavnih parametara sinteze. U usporedbi s uzgojem L. plantarum I-UL 4 u selektivnoj de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe podlozi, u optimiranoj se podlozi biosinteza folata povećala sa 36, 36 na 60, 39 μg/L. Optimalni je sastav podloge bio: 20 g/L laktoze, 16, 57 g/L mesnog ekstrakta i 10 μM paraaminobenzojeve kiseline...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of a simple, high-throughput screen for identifying bacterial strains capable of l-tyrosine production. Through the introduction of a heterologous gene encoding a tyrosinase, we were able to link l-tyrosine production in Escherichia coli with the synthesis of the black and diffusible pigment melanin. Although melanin was initially produced only at low levels in morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) minimal medium, phosphate supplementation was found to be sufficient for increasing both the rates of synthesis and the final titers of melanin. Furthermore, a strong linear correlation between extracellular l-tyrosine content and melanin formation was observed by use of this new <b>medium</b> <b>formulation.</b> A selection strategy that utilizes these findings has been developed and {{has been shown to be}} effective in screening large combinatorial libraries in the search for l-tyrosine-overproducing strains...|$|E
40|$|Photostability {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} characteristic of a dye for fluorescence microscopy. Recently we demonstrated that vitamins present in imaging media dramatically accelerate photobleaching of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) and many other green fluorescent and photoactivatable proteins. Here we tested all vitamins of commonly used media (such as Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, DMEM) one-by-one and found that only two vitamins, riboflavin and pyridoxal, decrease photostability of EGFP. Thus, DMEM without riboflavin and pyridoxal can be used as an imaging medium, which ensures high photostability of GFPs at the expense of minimal biochemical disturbance. Then, we tested some antioxidants and found that a plant flavonoid rutin greatly enhances photostability of EGFP during live cell microscopy. In complete DMEM, rutin increased EGFP photostability up to the level of vitamin-depleted DMEM. Moreover, being added to vitamin-depleted DMEM, rutin was able to further suppress EGFP photobleaching. Potentially, new <b>medium</b> <b>formulations</b> can be widely used for fluorescence microscopy of GFP-expressing cells and model multicellular organisms in a variety of imaging applications, where photostability represents a challenge...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} culture <b>medium</b> <b>formulations</b> on the {{kinetics}} of infective juvenile (IJ) {{production of the}} entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, were studied in submerged monoxenic culture in orbitally agitated cylindrical bottles using four culture media containing agave juice from Agave spp. among other ingredients. The IJ production kinetics was well modelled through a re-parameterised 3 -parameter Gompertz model with kinetic parameters: IJ-lag phase, λIJ (d), maximum IJ-stage conversion rate, mmax (≡[d(CIJ/CIJ, 0) /dt]max) (d- 1), and IJ-multiplication factor, (CIJ/CIJ, 0) max (-), with values within the ranges 14 d < λIJ < 16 d; 33 d- 1 < mmax < 241 d- 1 and 66 (-) < (CIJ/CIJ, 0) max < 611 (-), respectively. It was apparent that maximum values of mmax and (CIJ/CIJ, 0) max were obtained in medium A 4 (27. 6 % (v/v) agave juice, 1. 7 % (w/v) yeast extract, 1. 2 % (w/v) dried egg yolk, 2. 5 % (v/v) corn oil). Also, the maximum average IJ concentration (249, 444 per mL) was achieved in A 4 -fermentations...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of cardiomyocytes from {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESC) enables a variety of potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, progress is challenged by the low efficiency of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Recently, Kattman et al., 2011 showed that individual hESC lines required proper balance of the Activin A and BMP 4 signaling for efficient cardiac differentiation, presenting their differentiation protocols for several human and mouse ESC lines. However, {{two of the most}} utilized hESC lines, H 7 and H 9, were not included. Therefore, we set out to verify the published methodology for highly efficient cardiac specification and investigate the cardiac differentiation in the H 7 and H 9 ESC lines. Our studies examined a range of time points for the initial culture of hESC as embryoid bodies (EB) prior to transfer to monolayer culture, as well as, concentrations of Activin A and BMP 4 in the <b>medium</b> <b>formulations.</b> The results highlight an efficient protocol for reproducibly generating cultures with approximately 50 % cardiomyocytes from H 7 and H 9 ESC lines...|$|R
