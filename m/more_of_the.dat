5|$|A life-size {{sculpture}} of the {{coat of arms}} was created by artist and former Times Union political cartoonist Hy Rosen in 1986. Rosen took some liberty with the design, such as adding farm tools to emphasize the city's agricultural and trading history, as well as adding previously undocumented detail; the left supporter also takes on <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> look of an explorer (e.g., Henry Hudson) than a farmer. The statue was commissioned by Norstar Bank President Peter D. Kiernan {{as part of the}} park across Broadway from the then-newly renovated Union Station, which Norstar used as its headquarters until buyer Bank of America moved its employees out of the building in 2010. The statue still stands in Tricentennial Park on Broadway.|$|E

There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|Adams joined Franklin and Arthur Lee in 1778 as a {{commissioner}} to France, replacing Silas Deane.

Adams' ship was later pursued by several British frigates in the mid-Atlantic, but evaded them. Near {{the coast of}} Spain, Adams himself took up arms to help capture a heavily armed British merchantman ship, the Martha.

5|$|After many years, {{the site}} was finally cleared of {{undergrowth}} in the 1850s, revealing <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle's remains, and William Wynne, {{the owner of the}} site, carried out the first archaeological investigations.

In the 21st century the site is in the care of Cadw and is protected as a scheduled monument and maintained as a tourist attraction. In the light of Welsh devolution and other political changes, the history of Castell y Bere and similar Welsh castles has become increasingly prominent. In response, Cadw have noted that they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured.

Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E

The following day, three Japanese infantry battalions fell on the US positions before dawn. They made some progress around Cox's Creek, but US forces counterattacked with air support, bazookas and flamethrowers, retaking part of the line. A platoon of M4 Sherman tanks arrived during the afternoon, and at around 3:00pm they attacked the Japanese with supporting artillery fire and regained <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perimeter. From there, the battle followed a similar pattern, with a lull in the fighting on 16March, followed by a renewed effort by the Japanese the next day, with several US positions being overrun.|$|E
