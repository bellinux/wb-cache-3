5|$|In the <b>meantime</b> a {{range of}} other schools had appeared.|$|E
5|$|A Final Environmental Document is {{scheduled}} to be released in the middle of 2016. In the <b>meantime,</b> Caltrans studies have begun relating to widening the route to three lanes in each direction, as called for by the 2050 regional plan.|$|E
5|$|After {{this section}} of the game, the player takes control of Jade. Katarn reveals that he has {{discovered}} information as to the whereabouts of a Sith temple on Dromund Kaas. He leaves for the temple, and in the <b>meantime,</b> Jade must take on new assignments for the Republic and continue her studies of the Force.|$|E
5|$|As Samwell Tarly and Gilly {{arrive at}} Oldtown, they witness the Citadel {{releasing}} countless white ravens {{to announce the}} arrival of winter. They report to the Citadel, and Sam is scheduled to meet the Archmaester. In the <b>meantime,</b> Sam is granted access to the library.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{was caught}} {{unprepared}} by Campbell's request, and issued no response {{for over a}} week. In the <b>meantime</b> Campbell, whose retirement was due, was relieved by the Rhodesian government on 10 June. His replacement, Brigadier Andrew Skeen, took over Campbell's London office at Rhodesia House, 429 Strand six days later.|$|E
5|$|Due to the boycott, Martin's rink {{would not}} win another provincial title until 2006. In the <b>meantime,</b> {{the team had}} amassed five Grand Slam titles and won the 2005 Canada Cup of Curling.|$|E
5|$|Fighting at the Notch {{continued}} through the afternoon, but, the attack still unsuccessful, the North Korean troops withdrew suddenly in the mid-afternoon, allowing American forces to recover most of the casualties and vehicles from the Notch. In the <b>meantime,</b> they set up roadblocks to prevent further North Korean attacks from moving down the road. North Korean forces disengaged from the fight without attempting to flank the Americans, and by nightfall {{they were out of}} the region. In the <b>meantime,</b> the 27th Infantry Regiment surprised a large column of North Korean forces advancing on the south road and captured many trucks of supplies. During the North Koreans' retreat from the two roads, US Air Force planes mounted an airstrike against the North Koreans and inflicted heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>meantime</b> Japan had surrendered, and No. 169 Squadron was disbanded. Miller {{had spent}} around 550 {{hours in the}} air with the RAF, to which his RAAF unit had been seconded. He was awarded the 1939–45 Star, France and Germany Star, Defence Medal, War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–45.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>meantime,</b> Magheru, {{upon the}} advice of Colquhoun, ordered the demobilization of his troops (October 10), and, {{accompanied}} by {{a few of his}} officers, passed the Southern Carpathians into Hermannstadt—at the time, the Transylvanian city was nominally in the Austrian Empire, but gripped by the Hungarian Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>meantime,</b> RAF Mosquitos were {{conducting}} large tactical {{air raids}} against German positions inside Berlin on the nights of 15 April (105 bombers), 17 April (61 bombers), 18 April (57 bombers), 19 April (79 bombers), and 20 April (78 bombers).|$|E
5|$|In the <b>meantime,</b> Tiridates, {{backed by}} his brother, {{refused to go}} to Rome, and even engaged in {{operations}} against those Armenians whom he deemed were loyal to Rome. Tension mounted and finally, {{in the early spring}} of 58, war broke out.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>meantime,</b> Wallhead took a {{fight in}} Cage Warriors against Shaun Lomas and {{defeated}} him via rear naked choke in the first round. Due to an injury to Wallhead's previous opponent, Lomas had to step in at short notice, meaning that Wallhead competed at middleweight {{for the first time}} in two years.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>meantime,</b> the Spartans {{had sent}} Dorkis to Byzantium {{with a small}} force, to take command of the Allied force. However, {{he found that the}} rest of the Allies were no longer {{prepared}} to accept Spartan leadership, and therefore returned home.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>meantime,</b> the {{division}} {{had been moved}} to Flanders in February 1917. Initially based at Steenwerck, the following month it shifted north to the Messines area, which was south of Ypres, to relieve the 36th Division.|$|E
5|$|Karthik was not {{selected}} for the ODIs against Pakistan and returned to action in one-dayers for Tamil Nadu in the <b>meantime,</b> but managed only 59 runs at 19.66 in three matches. Karthik returned to India after Zimbabwe tour in 2006 and made 26 and 11 in the Challenger Trophy for India A, which was not {{enough for him to}} force his way into India’s squad for the home ODIs against Sri Lanka and South Africa. In the <b>meantime,</b> he played in the Duleep Trophy and had the chance to make his case for Test retention. However, he scored only 106 runs at 26.50 in two matches and South Zone lost both of these and were eliminated, and Karthik spent the next month on the sidelines.|$|E
5|$|Rick and Hershel {{tour the}} farmland, where Hershel {{reveals that the}} group has to leave once Carl fully recovers. Rick manages to {{convince}} Hershel for the group to stay for the <b>meantime.</b> However, there are rules they must follow. Rick pleads with Hershel to not force them to leave and to reconsider his request.|$|E
5|$|The XR-1, {{having been}} {{repaired}} in the <b>meantime,</b> {{was once again}} flying, and a contract had been awarded to Platt-Lepage {{for the construction of}} seven pre-production aircraft, to be built to an improved version of the XR-1A design, and designated YR-1A. Motivated by Congressional concerns about potential favouritism towards Sikorsky Aircraft, which had in the <b>meantime</b> been given a contract for development of an improved version of their VS-300 experimental helicopter, the contract called for delivery of the first YR-1A to the Army in January 1945. However, due to continued financial and flight-testing problems, Platt-Lepage proved incapable of meeting this schedule.|$|E
5|$|Ticinum {{eventually}} {{fell to the}} Lombards {{in either}} May or June 572. Alboin had in the <b>meantime</b> chosen Verona as his seat, establishing himself and his treasure in a royal palace built there by Theodoric. This choice may have been another attempt to link himself with the Gothic king.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} {{additional}} {{species have been}} assigned to the genus Daspletosaurus over the years, although as of 2007 none of these species have received a proper description or scientific name. In the <b>meantime,</b> all are designated as Daspletosaurus spp; this {{does not imply that}} they all are the same species.|$|E
5|$|A full {{series of}} six episodes (five new episodes, plus the pilot) was {{commissioned}} on 31 August 1977. However, Adams {{had in the}} <b>meantime</b> sent {{a copy of the}} Hitchhiker's pilot episode to the BBC's Doctor Who production office, and was commissioned to write a four-part Doctor Who serial ("The Pirate Planet") a few weeks later. In addition, Brett had left the BBC, and the final five episodes in the first series were produced by Geoffrey Perkins.|$|E
5|$|A second Anglo-Franco-Hellenic {{force would}} then attack the 1st Bulgarian Army between Kožuf and Lake Doiran, {{preventing}} it from forming new defensive {{positions in the}} area. The initial advance would allow the Armée d'Orient to progress in support of other units first to Prilep, Disma and Borran. In the <b>meantime,</b> an Anglo-Hellenic force would strike Mount Belasica, occupying the Rupel Pass.|$|E
5|$|After chasing {{away the}} Japanese forces at Koli Point, the U.S. renewed the western {{offensive}} towards Kokumbona on 10 November with three battalions under the overall command of U.S. Marine Colonel John Arthur. In the <b>meantime,</b> fresh Japanese {{troops from the}} 228th Infantry Regiment of the 38th Infantry Division landed by Tokyo Express over several nights beginning on 5 November and effectively resisted the American attack. After making small advances, at 13:45 on 11 November Vandegrift suddenly ordered all the American forces {{to return to the}} east bank of the Matanikau.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially ended, a {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded {{in the first days}} following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year. In the <b>meantime,</b> Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of Caesar and was appointed praetor with consular power.|$|E
5|$|Amnon Reshef's armored brigade {{completed}} its crossing that morning, and joined Sharon's division, {{just as the}} latter received actual approval to begin an offensive toward Ismailia. In the <b>meantime,</b> the 85th Battalion had completed reorganizing at Inshas Base and returned to Ismailia, where it was placed under Azmy's command once again. The 129th Sa'iqa Group retreated to Abu Suweir, north of Ismailia, to reorganize, and Heikal was also informed of his group's new area of operations, {{with the objective of}} defending the Upper Bridge, and the crucial Cairo-Ismailia Desert Road that incorporated the bridge.|$|E
5|$|At one point, {{the pair}} split up, but soon reunited. The {{relationship}} became more serious as she accompanied {{him in his}} efforts to break through in the music industry, and by 1979 they were discussing marriage, conditional upon his career becoming established. In the <b>meantime</b> she worked in a motor insurance company and in her father's electrical business.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race {{made him}} a {{formidable}} candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley {{had spent most of}} his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and {{he did not want to}} risk his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to unseat Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the <b>meantime,</b> he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.|$|E
5|$|By December, Etruria {{had been}} moved to Tobruk, where she {{provided}} gunfire support to the Italians defending the city. She was joined there by Etna and twelve torpedo boats. In the <b>meantime,</b> most of the fleet had returned to Italy for refitting. In January 1912, Etruria was moved back to Benghazi. For {{the next six months}} she remained here, supporting the garrison against Ottoman counter-attacks. The ship repeatedly shelled the Ottoman camps outside the city. On 15 October, the Ottomans surrendered, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|By {{the next}} morning, the loyalist forces had collapsed. Diệm {{and his younger}} brother and chief adviser, Ngô Đình Nhu, agreed to surrender, and coup plotter Đôn promised them safe passage out of the country. In the <b>meantime,</b> Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) {{headquarters}} and travelled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung. He arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military uniform to supervise the arrest of Diệm and Nhu for the surrender ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Dein in the <b>meantime</b> pursued {{an offer}} from a {{television}} consortium, funded by the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC). They intended to create a football-only channel, available on the Astra satellite transponder. The Observer believed {{that in addition to}} broadcasting league matches, SBC would offer a selection of top clubs fees for airing matches against their European counterparts. Dein was impressed by the proposal – financier Chris Akers forecasted profits of up to £50 million – so he forwarded it to Parry. Although he too was impressed, SBC's offer eventually failed because of sponsorship doubts.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sakonju's fears, the Allies {{were not}} {{immediately}} {{aware of the}} attack on Behar. Her distress signal had been picked up by only a single Allied merchant ship, which did not report it until she arrived at Fremantle on 17March. In the <b>meantime,</b> Somerville had decided on 16March that surface raiders no longer posed a threat to shipping in the Indian Ocean and allowed Allied vessels to resume their normal routing.|$|E
5|$|During her trials, UB-7 {{developed}} a leak which {{took some time}} to repair. In the <b>meantime,</b> she was assigned the Austrian number of U-7 and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for UB-7 {{to be transferred to}} the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time dragged on, the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the overt hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E
5|$|During the drawn Third Test, Barnes {{was injured}} and Ian Johnson {{was used as}} a {{makeshift}} opener because Morris was the only specialist opener left in the team after the omission of Brown. In the <b>meantime,</b> Barnes's injury had opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Harvey managed only ten and Brown only eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.|$|E
5|$|Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele {{initiated}} a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; {{in this way}} they also redefined the autonym B.subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the <b>meantime,</b> if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. lemanniana is placed in B.subg. Banksia.|$|E
5|$|Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele {{initiated}} a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the <b>meantime,</b> if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.grossa {{is placed in}} B.subg. Spathulatae.|$|E
5|$|Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged {{the genus}} Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and {{published}} B.subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B.subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the <b>meantime,</b> if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.attenuata {{is placed in}} B.subg. Banksia.|$|E
