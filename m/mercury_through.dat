5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of mercury in their blood and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of <b>mercury</b> (<b>through</b> biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.|$|E

MerP, a periplasmic mercury transport protein found in gram negative bacteria, transports <b>mercury</b> <b>through</b> the outer membrane {{into the inner}} membrane where it holds the mercury for another protein to bind to it and transport it to mercury(II) reductase. MerT, a membrane bound protein found in both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, binds to free floating mercury. Mercury(II) reductase can directly take mercury from MerT and MerP.|$|E
40|$|Mercury {{concentrations}} in fish, faeces and exhaled air were investigated {{in order to}} evaluate total <b>mercury</b> exposure <b>through</b> the gut in captive bottlenose dolphin and excretion via intestine and pulmonary routes. Results showed that faeces account for elimination of 34 - 48 % of dietary mercury; while only 0. 9 - 1. 2 % of alimentary <b>mercury</b> is eliminated <b>through</b> exhaled air. The remaining 51. 2 - 65. 3 % of ingested mercury, ranging approximately between 266 and 339 mug per day, is retained within the organism. The complexation of mercury with selenium, forming insoluble tiemannite granules, is discussed as an important mechanism, complementary to excretion, by which odontocetes are {{able to cope with}} elevated alimentary exposure to mercury...|$|R

50|$|Transits of Mercury {{occur on}} a regular basis. As {{explained}} in 1882 by Newcomb, the interval between passages of <b>Mercury</b> <b>through</b> the ascending node of its orbit is 87.969 days, and the interval between the Earth's passage through that same longitude is 365.254 days. From the ratio of these values, it can be easily shown that Mercury will make an almost integral number of revolutions about the Sun over intervals of 4, 6, 7, 13, 33, 46, 171 and 217 years.|$|E
