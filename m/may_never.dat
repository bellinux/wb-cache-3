5|$|The {{size of the}} Universe is {{somewhat}} difficult to define. According to a restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected spacetime that could {{have a chance to}} interact with us and vice versa. According to the general theory of relativity, some regions of space <b>may</b> <b>never</b> interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth <b>may</b> <b>never</b> reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.|$|E

5|$|History <b>may</b> <b>never</b> {{know the}} true story of Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{case studies}} of brain damage have shown that damage to {{areas of the brain}} (such as the {{anterior}} prefrontal cortex) results in the reduction or elimination of inhibitions, with a corresponding radical change in behaviour. When the damage occurs to adults, they may still be able to perform moral reasoning; but when it occurs to children, they <b>may</b> <b>never</b> develop that ability.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{conclusions}} {{of the study was}} that the people buried in Lindow Moss may have had a less varied diet than their European counterparts. According to Jody Joy, curator of the Iron Age collection at the British Museum, the importance of Lindow Man lies more in how he lived rather than how he died, as the circumstances surrounding his demise <b>may</b> <b>never</b> be fully established.|$|E

5|$|Some Japanese holdouts, {{especially}} on small Pacific Islands, refused to surrender at all (believing the declaration to be propaganda or considering surrender against their code). Some <b>may</b> <b>never</b> {{have heard of}} it.

5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. This {{is the most}} critical stage of the hunt, as wolves <b>may</b> <b>never</b> catch up with prey running at top speed. If their prey is travelling in a group, the wolves either attempt {{to break up the}} herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.|$|E
5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle <b>may</b> <b>never</b> {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the storm}} wrought {{extensive}} damage along the Gulf Coast. At least 371 {{people were killed}} by the storm; however, this is considered a conservative estimate and the true death toll <b>may</b> <b>never</b> be known. Of the known fatalities, 353 took place in Louisiana and 18 in Mississippi. This makes the 1909 Grand Isle hurricane the eleventh deadliest hurricane in United States history. However, {{at the time of its}} occurrence, it was the sixth deadliest storm in the country. Damage throughout Louisiana and Mississippi was estimated to be at least $10million (1909USD).|$|E
5|$|Lody's {{controllers}} realised {{that his}} mission {{was not going}} according to plan and attempted {{to get in touch}} with him to provide assistance. A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A. Inglis c/o Thomas Cook, Edinburgh, but he never collected it, and <b>may</b> <b>never</b> have been aware of it. Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If the condition is not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late complications. Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they <b>may</b> <b>never</b> be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E
