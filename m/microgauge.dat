40|$|The work {{described}} in this paper arises from a program for the detection and measurement of surface cracks in metals carried out at University College London. The instrument which was developed for the purpose, the Crack <b>Microgauge,</b> employs the acpd (alternating current potential difference) method. An alternating electric current at a frequency of 6 kHz {{is applied to the}} specimen, and the instrument measures the voltage between the probe terminals which are applied {{to the surface of the}} specimen. By examining the variation of the voltage readings with position on the surface and, in particular, the jump in readings obtained when the probe crosses the crack, the crack can be detected and features of its geometry deduced. The correlation between instrument readings and information about the crack geometry must be made by use of a theoretical model of the electromagnetic field produced in the crack neighborhood. The authors have been principally concerned in the study of this mathematical problem. In this paper we have attempted to bring together in summary form the most significant results arising from the studies on several different projects...|$|E
40|$|Microshutter arrays, {{scheduled}} to be launched in 2011 as part of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), {{will be the first}} micro-scale optical devices in outer space using MEMS technology. As the microshutter arrays consist of electrical and mechanical components and must operate in a cryogenic environment reliably over a 10 year mission lifetime, a fundamental challenge for the development of this device is to understand the mechanical behaviors of the micro-scale materials used and the possible failure mechanisms at 30 K. This thesis investigates the mechanical properties and reliability of low-stress LPCVD silicon nitride thin films, the structural materials of the microshutter arrays, at cryogenic temperatures. A helium-cooled cryogenic measurement setup installed inside a focused-ion-beam system is designed, implemented, and characterized to obtain a cryogenic environment down to 20 K.

40|$|Theoretical {{modeling}} studies {{associated with}} the a. c. field measurement technique {{have been a major}} feature of work at UCL for almost the last decade [1]. In that technique, the objective is to establish a spatially uniform current flow in the surface of a metal and to use this to interrogate a defect such as a surface-breaking crack by directing it broadside on to the crack and measuring the perturbations in the surface voltage distribution which it produces (Figure 1 a). We have described the first major result of the theoretical studies as an unfolding theory. It shows that when the electrical skin depth δ is small compared with the defect size, the field problem posed by the interception of a uniform current flow by a surface-breaking crack is the plane potential problem shown in Figure 1 c and d. The descriptive name was adopted because the problem domain is that formed by conceptually sectioning the material in the plane of the crack, as in figure 1 b, and unfolding the crack plane about the surface edge BC to make it coplanar with the metal surface. This approach has been successfully used to solve the field problems associated with cracks of various forms, for example elliptical, circular arc, rectangular and triangular, and it has enabled us to incorporate the influence of crack aspect ratio on the readings of an a. c. f. m. instrument such as the Crack <b>Microgauge</b> [2], Earlier review papers [1, 3] give numerous examples of the comparison between theory and experiment...|$|E

MethodsTwenty two semi-rigid lenses of specified thicknesses were manufactured using a material with refractive index of 1. 376. Central thickness of these lenses was measured using VisanteTM and Zeiss-Humphrey OCT II OCT's (Zeiss, Germany). Two data sets consisting of nominal measures (with a standard pachymeter) of the lenses and one obtained using a digital micrometer was used as references. Regression equations between the new physical and optical (OCT) measures were derived to calibrate the devices. ResultsBefore calibration, repeated measures ANOVA showed that {{there were significant differences}} between mean lens thicknesses from each of the measurement methods (p< 0. 01), where Visante measurements were significantly different from the other three (OCT II, MG and OP) methods (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Electromagnetic fields {{associated}} with surface cracks in metals {{have been widely}} studied {{in recent years in}} connection with eddy current and a. c. field techniques for detecting and sizing fatigue and corrosion cracks. In our own work, studies have been made of thin-skin fields for cracks of various plan forms using unfolded field techniques 1, 2, 3, and of the two-dimensional crack (i. e. the large aspect ratio crack) in a semi-infinite material when the ratio of crack depth to skin depth is arbitrary 4, 5. These studies were prompted by the need to obtain accurate interpretation of surface probe readings from an a. c. potential difference instrument which was developed at University College London and is marketed under the name Crack <b>Microgauge.</b> The instrument was originally designed to operate at a frequency of 5. 6 kHz, but further development has produced a dual-frequency version with a second and lower frequency of 560 Hz. This enables an operator to make a choice of skin depth § to suit his particular test material and crack geometry. A reduction in the frequency has the effect of increasing § which can be practically useful in several ways. For example in examining for subsurface flaws it is necessary to increase the penetration of the field into the material so that it reaches to the depth of the flaw. A further application which provides the motivation for the present paper is to the situation where a crack occurs on one face of a plate of known thickness. There are many instances, for example in investigating structures fabricated from sheet material, or in the examination of pipe-work, where {{it would be useful to}} be able to detect and measure cracks on the inside surface by testing on the outside. Testing from the blind side in this manner evidently requires that the frequency should be low enough for the skin depth to be comparable with the plate thickness. In this paper our main aim is to report the results of a theoretical and experimental study of the field in a plate which has a two-dimensional normal crack on one face. The theory allows arbitrary values of the ratio of skin depth § to plate thickness b. In particular we examine the signal on the face opposite to the crack which would enable the presence of the crack to be detected...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To examine soft contact lens fitting {{characteristics}} using anterior segment {{imaging techniques}} and comfort. The specific aims of each chapter are as follows: Chapter 2 : To calibrate the new ZEISS VisanteTM anterior segment optical coherence tomographer (OCT) using references with known physical thickness and refractive index {{equal to the}} human cornea and to compare the Visante measures to those from a previous generation OCT (Zeiss-Humphrey OCT II). Chapter 3 : The first {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the repeatability of the Visante TM OCT in a normal sample. The second was to compare corneal thickness measured with the Visante TM OCT to the Zeiss-Humphrey OCT II (model II, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena Germany) adapted for anterior segment imaging and to the Orbscan II TM (Bausch and Lomb, Rochester New York). Chapter 4 : Conjunctival displacement observed with the edges of the contact lens, when imaged may be real or may be an artefact of all OCT imagers. A continuous surface appears displaced when the refractive index of the leading medium changes at the edge of a contact lens. To examine this effect, edges of the contact lenses were imaged on a continuous surface using the UHR-OCT. Contact lens edges on the human conjunctival tissue were also imaged to see if the lens indentation on the conjunctival tissue is real or an artefact at the edge of the lens. Chapter 5 : The main {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if we can predict end of the day discomfort and dryness using clinical predictive variables. The second purpose of the study was to determine if there was any relationship between lens fitting characteristics and clinical complications and especially to the superior cornea and conjunctiva with a dispensing clinical trial. Methods Chapter 2 : Twenty two semi-rigid lenses of specified thicknesses were manufactured using a material with refractive index of 1. 376. Central thickness of these lenses was measured using VisanteTM OCT and Zeiss-Humphrey OCT II (Zeiss, Germany). Two data sets consisting of nominal measures (with a standard pachymeter of the lenses and one obtained using a digital micrometer) were used as references. Regression equations between the physical and optical (OCT) measures were derived to calibrate the devices. Chapter 3 : Fifteen healthy participants were recruited. At the Day 1 visit the epithelial and total corneal thickness, across the central 10 mm of the horizontal meridian were measured using the OCT II and the Visante TM OCT. Only total corneal thickness across the central 10 mm of the horizontal meridian was measured using the Orbscan II. The order of these measurements was randomized. These measurements were repeated on Day 2. Each individual measurement was repeated three times and averaged to give a single result. Chapter 4 : (2 -D) Images of the edges of marketed silicone hydrogel and hydrogel lenses with refractive indices (n) ranging from 1. 41 - 1. 51 were taken placing them concave side down on a continuous surface. Five images for each lens were taken using a UHR-OCT system, operating at 1060 nm with ~ 3. 2 um (axial) and 10 μm (lateral) resolution at the rate of 75, 000 A-scans/s. The displacement of the glass slide beneath the lens edge was measured using Image J. Chapter 5 : Thirty participants (neophytes) were included in the study and the four lenses (Acuvue Advance 8. 3, Acuvue Advance 8. 7, Pure Vision 8. 3, and Pure Vision 8. 6) were randomly assigned for each eye. The lenses were worn for a period of two weeks on a daily wear basis for 8 to 10 hrs per day. Lens performance was monitored over the 2 week period. Assessment of subjective comfort was made using visual analogue scales. Total corneal and epithelium thickness was measured using the Visante OCT, the lens edge profiles of the contact lenses were observed using the ultra-high resolution OCT and the conjunctival epithelial thinning was measured using the RTVue OCT. Conjunctival blood velocity was measured at the baseline and 2 week visit using a high magnification camera. Results Chapter 2 : Before calibration, repeated measures ANOVA showed that there were significant differences between the mean lens thicknesses from each of the measurement methods (p< 0. 05), where Visante measurements were significantly different from the other three (OCT II, MG and OP) methods (p< 0. 05). Visante thickness was significantly higher than the <b>microgauge</b> measures (453 ± 37. 6 µm compared to 445. 1 ± 38. 2 µm) and the OCT II was significantly lower (424. 5 ± 36. 1 µm both, p< 0. 05). After calibration using the regression equations between the physical and optical measurements, there were no differences between OCT II and Visante OCT (p< 0. 05). Chapter 3 : Mean central corneal and epithelial thickness using the Visante™ OCT after calibration at the apex of the cornea was 536 ± 27 µm (range, 563 - 509 µm) and 55 ± 2. 3 µm (range, 57. 3 - 52. 7 µm), respectively. The mean corneal and epithelial thickness using OCT II at the apex was 520 ± 25 µm and 56 ± 4. 9 µm, respectively. The mean of total corneal thickness measured with the Orbscan II was 609 ± 29 µm. Visante OCT was the most repeatable for test-retest at the apex, nasal and temporal quadrants of the cornea compared to OCT II and Orbscan II. COR’s of Visante OCT ranged from ± 7. 71 µm to ± 8. 98 µm for total corneal thickness and ± 8. 72 µm to ± 9. 92 µm for epithelial thickness. CCC’s with Visante OCT were high for total corneal thickness for test-retest differences ranging from 0. 97 to 0. 99, CCC’s for epithelial thickness showed moderate concordance for both the instruments. Chapter 4 : Results showed that artefactual displacement of the contact lens edge was observed when the lenses were imaged on the glass reference sphere, custom made rigid contact lenses (1. 376) and on the conjunctival tissue. The displacement measured on the conjunctival tissue ranged from 7. 0 ± 0. 86 µm for the Air Optix Night and Day to 17. 4 ± 0. 22 µm for the Acuvue Advance contact lenses. The range of displacement with the soft lens edges imaged on the rigid contact lens was from 5. 51 ± 0. 03 µm to 9. 72 ± 0. 12 µm. Chapter 5 : The lenses with the steepest sag (Acuvue Advance 8. 3, Pure Vision 8. 3) resulted not only with the tightest fit, but with compromise to the superior conjunctiva. This was especially seen with the Acuvue Advance lenses. The steeper lenses caused more total corneal swelling, superior epithelial thinning, mechanical compression of conjunctiva, conjunctival staining, bulbar hyperemia, conjunctival indentation and reduced blood flow at the lens edge. Not many associations were observed between baseline clinical and 2 weeks sensory variables. However, significant associations were observed when comparing the baseline clinical variables to end of the day sensory variables. Baseline clinical variables compared to 2 week clinical variables also showed significant correlations. Conclusions Chapter 2 : Using reference lenses with refractive index of the cornea (1. 376) allows rapid and simple calibration and cross calibration of instruments for measuring the corneal thickness. The Visante and OCT II do not produce measurements that are equal to physical references with refractive index equal to the human cornea. Chapter 3 : There is good repeatability of corneal and epithelial thickness using each OCT for test-retest differences compared to the between instruments repeatability. Measurements of epithelial thickness are less repeatable compared to the total corneal thickness for the instruments used in the study. Chapter 4 : When contact lenses are imaged in-situ using UHR-OCT the conjunctival tissue appeared displaced. This experiment indicates that this displacement is an artefact of all OCT imagers since a continuous surface (glass slide) was optically displaced indicating that the displacement that is observed is a function of the refractive index change and also the thickness of the contact lens edges. Chapter 5 : Discomfort is a complex issue to resolve since it appears to be related to ocular factors such as the corneal and conjunctival topography and sagittal depth; to lens factors that is 1) how the sag depth of the lenses relate to the corneal/conjunctival shape and depth and therefore how well it moves on the eye. 2) Also with the lens material; whether they are high or low modulus, low or high water content, dehydration properties, wetting agents used and its resistance to deposits, lens edge profile and thickness and its interaction with the upper eyelid. ...|$|E
