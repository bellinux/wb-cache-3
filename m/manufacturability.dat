25|$|One {{effect of}} modern patent usage {{is that a}} small-time inventor, who can afford both the {{patenting}} process and {{the defense of the}} patent, can use the exclusive right status to become a licensor. This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur because he or she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention. Thus the inventor's time and energy can be spent on pure innovation, allowing others to concentrate on <b>manufacturability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Process variations: With MOSFETs {{becoming}} smaller, {{the number}} of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor's properties is becoming fewer, {{with the result that}} control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic. During chip manufacturing, random process variations affect all transistor dimensions: length, width, junction depths, oxide thickness etc., and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks. The transistor characteristics become less certain, more statistical. The random nature of manufacture means we do not know which particular example MOSFETs actually will end up in a particular instance of the circuit. This uncertainty forces a less optimal design because the design must work for a great variety of possible component MOSFETs. See process variation, design for <b>manufacturability,</b> reliability engineering, and statistical process control.|$|E

Issue of the [...] "Frogskin" [...] uniforms to US troops in Europe during the Second World War was halted as it was too often mistaken for the disruptively patterned German uniform worn by the Waffen-SS. Camouflage uniforms need to be made and distributed to a large number of soldiers.

2500|$|The Chevrolet Nova {{nameplate}} {{returned in}} spring 1984 as a front-wheel drive subcompact {{vehicle for the}} 1985 to 1988 model years. It was assembled in Fremont, California by NUMMI, {{a joint venture between}} General Motors in the U.S. and Toyota of Japan. It resurrected a name last used on the compact-sized rear-wheel drive 1979 Chevrolet Nova. The new Nova was a rebadged and mildly restyled Japanese market Toyota Sprinter, a model sold in Japan as a badge engineered version of the Toyota Corolla. Nova shared the Corolla's AE82 platform, [...] 4-cylinder engines and was available with 5-speed manual, 3-speed or 4-speed automatic transmissions. It was designed for <b>manufacturability</b> and reached an unusually high level of quality and production speed at NUMMI, compared to other US factories.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and <b>manufacturability.</b> Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|E
