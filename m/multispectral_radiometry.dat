40|$|Some of the {{possible}} areas of application for large antennas placed in space are discussed, and some initial design concepts for various antenna proposals are described. Applications include rural mobile communications, an orbiting deep space relay station, submillimeter radio astronomy, and <b>multispectral</b> <b>radiometry</b> of earth surface features. As {{a first step in}} developing the needed technology, a deployable 30 -m antenna with 1 -mm surface accuracy is proposed. Flight experience with such an antenna system would enable validation of performance prediction models. The 30 -m-diam mesh deployable-defurlable antenna experiment would be carried out with the shuttle...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{techniques}} for good spatial resolution in {{remotely sensed images}} of renewable resources, such as crops, are discussed for satellite <b>multispectral</b> <b>radiometry.</b> A model is developed for an optically and geometrically thin scattering layer to account for atmospheric scattering above the object pixel of fluxes reflected from adjacent areas. The cross radiance is explored as a spread function of a point source and as a spurious component of measured radiance, and an integration over large source areas is formulated. The Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase function is defined for an integral over a sphere and point-spread functions are presented for HG scattering. Cross radiance limited spatial resolution is also determined for the HG phase function and boundaries between reflecting and black half-planes are considered {{in terms of the}} cross radiance...|$|E
30|$|Many signal {{processing}} applications require computation {{of the so-called}} pruned discrete Fourier transform (DFT), i.e., an efficient alternative to compute the required DFT when the input sequence and/or the required output sequences are smaller than {{the length of the}} full DFT (a full DFT means that all the output components are to be computed, and all the input elements are used to compute the transform); in the literature those are referred to as pruned fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) or pruned DFTs [1]. Common practical examples relate to, e.g., the least mean squared (LMS) optimal DFT-based pruned signal filtering [2], and the complexity-reduced computational implementation of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems [3]. Another practical example relates to efficient implementation of the matched spatial filtering (MSF) algorithm for performing the range and azimuth data compression in unfocused of fractionally focused synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system that both employ the pruned DFT-based MSF processing of the trajectory data signals performed in a factorized fashion in the so-called slow time and fast time data acquisition scales [4 – 6]. Other examples relate to DFT-based analysis of remote sensing (RS) data acquired with a variety of sensor systems, ranging from seismology [7] to <b>multispectral</b> <b>radiometry</b> [8]. Other authors as Zhu et al. in [9] proposed an algorithm for performing SAR polar format re-gridding interpolation suited for the logic-in-memory paradigm (hardware/architecture solution) and to provide the necessary design automation tool chain to implement their proposed algorithm (e.g., FFTs for image formation) in advanced silicon technology. It {{is important to note that}} a majority of real-world RS data acquisition and processing problems can be qualified as sensing in harsh environments [4 – 8, 10, 11] in the sense of intrinsic problem model uncertainties peculiar for such RS modalities. In a context of pruned DFTs, realistic harsh sensing scenarios are characterized by the uncertainties attributed to zero-padded input data acquisition modes with variable composite length windowing of the input and/or output Fourier transform sequences, in general cases, with non-sparse Fourier spectra [10 – 12]. Those specifics motivate the development of efficient pruned DFT/FFT techniques particularly adapted for computational implementation with uncertain data acquired in harsh sensing scenarios.|$|E
40|$|<b>Multispectral</b> {{microwave}} <b>radiometry</b> for temperature reconstruction inside biological {{media is}} considered. Radiometric data on simulated living tissues {{have been obtained}} with a multifrequency radiometer in the frequency range 1. 5 – 3. 5 GHz. Temperature retrieval has been modeled as the solution of a first-kind integral equation, based on the theory of radiative transfer. An example of temperature retrieval is reported. Results compare favorably with experimental measures...|$|R
40|$|Rain {{rates as}} {{estimated}} by <b>multispectral</b> microwave <b>radiometry</b> from satellites are error prone depending on microphysical rain cloud structures and varying surface conditions. The initial {{goal was to}} verify rain rates estimated by PRIRODA measurements by simultaneous and coordinated measurements with the polarimetric Doppler radar POLDIRAD of DLR. Because reliable PRIRODA Data were not gathered nor available, these investigations were performed for well accessible SSM/I data of the DMSP satellites using similar microwave radiometer channels as on board of PRIRODA. POLDIRAD measurements were performed well coordinated with DMSP overflights for selected different weather situations. Thus, the different available algorithms will be evaluated and improved {{in relation to the}} cloud structures as observed by POLDIRAD. Multifrequency and polarimetric microwave radiometer measurements from ground show improvements in quantitative rain rate estimation when using the polarimetric signatures. The airborne water vapour DIAL has been completed {{to the end of the}} project period and its performance has been demonstrated. Measurements, coordinated with the microwave radiometers, however have not been possible before the end of the project. (orig.)

40|$|This study {{presents}} the first quantitative retrievals of vertical profiles of precipitation derived from <b>multispectral</b> passive microwave <b>radiometry.</b> Measurements of microwave brightness temperature (Tb) obtained by a NASA high-altitude research aircraft {{are related to}} profiles of rainfall rate through a multichannel piecewise-linear statistical regression procedure. Statistics for Tb are obtained from a set of cloud radiative models representing {{a wide variety of}} convective, stratiform, and anvil structures. The retrieval scheme itself determines which cloud model best fits the observed meteorological conditions. Retrieved rainfall rate profiles are converted to equivalent radar reflectivity for comparison with observed reflectivities from a ground-based research radar. Results for two case studies, a stratiform rain situation and an intense convective thunderstorm, show that the radiometrically derived profiles capture the major features of the observed vertical structure of hydrometer density...|$|R
40|$|Individual small weather {{satellites}} {{have been}} previously presented including GPS-Radio Occultation, Infrared Sounding, Microwave <b>Radiometry,</b> <b>Multispectral</b> Imaging, and Gas-Filter Correlation Radiometry, but {{to our knowledge}} not as a comprehensive on-orbit system. In this paper, for the first time, we describe a new global Meteorological Network - MetNetTM using multiple electro-optical and microwave satellite constellations. We shall provide {{a brief overview of}} several candidate small weather satellites including Doppler Wind Temperature Sounder (DWTSTM), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer in 3 U (MODIS- 3 U), the Compact Microwave Sounder (CMS), the Compact Infrared Sounder CIS), the stellar occultation temperature retrieval CubeSat (T-STAR), the Aerosols and Cloud Characterization Imaging Polarimeter (ACCIP), and the High-Altitude Temperature Sounder (HATSTM). These instrument constellations when combined shall cover the full range of altitudes from surface to thermosphere, at significantly higher spatial resolutions than available from GEO satellites, with improved retrievals through synergistic data techniques. The disaggregation of instruments onto several spacecraft simplifies the production flow, as well as allowing more flexibility in calibration maneuvers such as lunar scans and cross-calibrations. The full range of measurements shall include horizontal wind speeds, 3 D temperature soundings, humidity, precipitation, sea surface temperature, cloud characterization, aerosol size distributions, and atmospheric chemistry...|$|R
