50|$|The vast {{majority}} of bass amps in the 2010s can be powered solely by AC mains power, obtained by plugging the amp into a wall socket. Inexpensive practice amps may have the AC mains plug hardwired into the unit. Middle-priced to high-priced amplifiers typically have a removable cable and plug, as used with PC computer towers. The benefits of having a removable cable and plug {{is that if the}} cable becomes worn or damaged, a new cable can easily be replaced by a layperson. If a hardwired AC mains cable and plug becomes worn or damaged, a qualified technician or electrician will typically be required to replace the cable and plug. Most amps are designed to work for a single voltage. A small number of expensive bass amps designed for touring professionals have user-selectable voltage, which enables a bassist to play with same amp in North America and Europe. A small number of small combo amps can run on both AC <b>mains</b> <b>power</b> and <b>battery</b> <b>power.</b> This enables bassists to play outside where there is no access to power (e.g., for busking on the street). Amps that are <b>battery</b> <b>powered</b> may have a 12 volt input, enabling the unit to be connected to a car battery with alligator clips.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Trauma/retrieval {{patients}} {{are often in}} shock and hypothermic. Treatment of such patients usually involves restoring their blood volume with transfusion of blood (stored at 2 °C – 6 °C) and/or crystalloids or colloids (stored at ambient temperature). Rapid infusion of these cold fluids can worsen or even induce hypothermia in these patients. Warming of intravenous fluids at accident sites has traditionally been difficult {{due to a lack}} of suitable portable fluid warmers that are not dependent on <b>mains</b> electrical or <b>battery</b> <b>power.</b> If latent heat, the heat released when a liquid solidifies (an inherently temperature limiting process) can warm intravenous fluids, portable devices without a reliance on electrical energy could be used to reduce the incidence of hypothermia in trauma patients. Methods Rapid infusion of red cells into patients was timed to sample typical clinical flow rates. An approved dry heat blood warmer was compared with a prototype blood warmer using a supercooled liquid latent heat storage material, to warm red cells whilst monitoring inlet and outlet temperatures. To determine the effect of warming on red cell integrity compared to the normal storage lesion of blood, extracellular concentrations of potassium, lactate dehydrogenase and haemoglobin were measured in blood which had been warmed after storage at 2 °C – 6 °C for 1 to 42 days. Results A prototype latent heat fluid warmer consistently warmed red cells from approximately 4 °C to approximately 35 °C at typical clinical flow rates. Warming of stored blood with latent heat did not affect red cell integrity more than the approved dry heat blood warmer. Conclusion Using latent heat as an energy source can satisfactorily warm cold blood or other intravenous fluids to near body temperature, without any adverse affects. </p...|$|R

Each BPM consisted of a battery pack with an associated buck–boost converter for individually controlling battery currents. With a proposed discharging scenario, load voltage regulation with charge equalization among batteries was performed by controlling the battery currents {{in accordance with their}} state-of-charges (SOCs) estimated by real-time battery-loaded voltages detected under the same operating condition. In addition, the fault tolerance was executed to isolate exhausted or faulty batteries from the <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> bank without interrupting the system operation. Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the discharging scenario for a laboratory <b>battery</b> <b>power</b> bank with four series buck–boost BPMs...|$|R
