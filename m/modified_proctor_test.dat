40|$|This {{laboratory}} test is performed {{to determine the}} relationship between the moisture content and the dry density of a soil for a specified compactive effort. The compactive effort is the amount of mechanical energy that is applied to the soil mass. Several different methods are used to compact soil in the field, and some examples include tamping, kneading, vibration, and static load compaction. This laboratory will employ the tamping or impact compaction method using the type of equipment and methodology developed by R. R. Proctor in 1933, therefore, the test is also known as the Proctor test. Two types of compaction tests are routinely performed: (1) The Standard Proctor Test, and (2) The <b>Modified</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>Test.</b> Each of these tests can be performed in three different methods as outlined in the attached Table 1. In the Standard Proctor Test, the soil is compacted by a 5. 5 lb hammer falling a distance of one foot into a soil filled mold. The mold is filled with three equal layers of soil, and each layer is subjected to 25 drops of the hammer. The <b>Modified</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>Test</b> is identical to the Standard Proctor Test except it employs, a 10 lb hammer falling a distance of 18 inches, and uses five equal layers of soil instead of three. There are two types of compaction molds used for testing. The smaller type is 4 inches in diameter and has a volume of about 1 / 30 ft 3 (944 cm 3), and the larger type is 6 inches in diameter and has a volume of about 1 / 13. 333 ft 3 (2123 cm 3).

Whilst conventional circular rollers are able to compact layer thicknesses typically in the range of 200 – 500 mm, thicker layers are able to be compacted using RDC.

30|$|According to O’Flaherty (1988) {{the range}} of values that may be {{anticipated}} when using the <b>modified</b> <b>proctor</b> <b>test</b> methods are: for clay, MDD may fall between 1.4 and 1.7  g/cm 3 and optimum moisture content (OMC) may fall between 20 - 30 %. For silty clay MDD is usually between 1.6 and 1.8  g/cm 3 and OMC ranged between 15 - 25 %. For sandy clay, MDD usually ranged between 1.8 and 2.2  g/cm 3 and OMC between 8 and 15 %. Thus, looking at the results in Table  3, it could be noticed that INL samples belong to sandy clay soils whereas UCL and MCL samples are rather silty clay soils. As per CEBTP specification (CEBTP, 1984), lateritic soils having MDD value of 2.0 and 1.8  g/cm 3 are recommended {{to be used as}} raw materials in base and sub-base, respectively in road construction.

The mix design parameters that were adopted in the study are mixing and compaction water content (MWC), compaction effort using a gyratory compactor and aggregate temperature. This parametric study was initially carried out on FBMs with virgin limestone aggregate without reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) material and a mix design procedure was proposed. This proposed methodology was also found to apply to FBMs with RAP. A detailed consideration was also given to characterising the RAP material so as to understand its contribution to the mechanical properties of FBMs. Optimum MWC was achieved by optimising mechanical properties such as indirect tensile stiffness modulus and indirect tensile strength (ITS-dry and ITS-wet).

It is well known that the minimum and maximum voids ratio depend on the mean grain size. However, there is no direct relation available for the voids ratio in terms of grain size. Therefore, in this dissertation, the effect of mean grain size on the relative density of sand has been studied at different compaction energies. In order to arrive at the above, fifty five number of clean sands having D 50 ranges from 0. 34 to 2. 6 mm collected from different river bed of Orissa have been tested in the laboratory.

In the present study, an attempt had made to learn the properties of fly ash and properties of GI reinforcement and effect of the reinforcement on the stress-strain behavior of fly ash. A comprehensive set of laboratory uni- axial compression tests were carried out on fly ash with dry density and different optimum moisture content (OMC) which are obtained from standard proctor test.

40|$|Many times a road {{will fail}} {{and will be}} in need of both a {{structural}} increase and a repair. Full Depth Reclamation (FDR) is a road rehabilitation technique able to offer both. This method also has a lower total cost and significantly lower material usage than traditional overlaying repair methods. FDR is a road repair method which mills up the current road down into the subgrade, and then stabilizes and compacts the milled material. This is also useful for correcting deeper problems in the road structure which are not addressed by traditional methods. In this study, three different suggestions of mix designs for this repair method were observed, and {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of each were compared. A consistent problem with the more thorough mix designs was that there is a large amount of equipment required from different fields of engineering: many of the tests required equipment from both a soils and a pavements laboratory. In an effort to streamline testing equipment, the results of a <b>modified</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>test</b> were compared to the results of densities of samples tested in a gyratory compactor at varying water contents. The Proctor and gyratory compactor both gave similar trends between water content and dry density. The gyratory compactor testing was also much quicker, and the data had a tighter fit line. This is an important step in simplifying FDR mix design in order to make it more widely available. Samples with binder contents of 2 %, 3 %, and 4 % and water contents varying from 2 %- 6 % were created in a slotted gyratory compactor. These samples were tested for density and for compressive strength after Ndesign of 75 Gyrations. It was observed that higher water contents were correlated with higher density, and higher compressive strengths.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 73 - 75). A total of 62 cohesiveness sands were tested to rographics. investigate the importance of the water content, grain size distribution, grading of the soil, particle shape, grain crushing during testing and laboratory compaction test method on the maximum dry unit weight during compaction. Three different laboratory compaction methods were used: 1) Standard Proctor', 2) Modified Proctor; and 3) Vibrating hammer. The effects of the grain size distribution, particle shape and laboratory compaction method were found to be the most important. The grain size distribution is represented by the coefficient of uniformity, whereas the particle shape is represented by the degree of roundness of the sand grains. The various laboratory compaction methods used in this study indicated the importance of vibration on the compaction of cohesiveness sands. The vibrating hammer compaction test method yielded consistently high values of the maximum dry unit weight over the complete range of tests. The standard Proctor test method yielded low values for the maximum dry unit weight over the entire test range, whereas the <b>modified</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>test</b> method yielded low values for the maximum dry unit weight for values of the coefficient of uniformity below 3. 5.

The experimental program consists of 23 tests carried out in the suction range of 0 – 400 kPa. The findings indicate the strong influence of suction on compressibility, stiffness, and shear strength. The mechanical properties of the soil improve with suction following an exponential law with decreasing gradient. Furthermore, the soil exhibited collapsible behaviour upon wetting even at low stress levels. Interesting results were also achieved in elasto-plastic modelling as well. The results led to characterization of soil behaviour with reference to widely accepted modelling criteria for unsaturated soils, providing noteworthy suggestions about their applicability for granular materials with a non-negligible fine component.

For this purpose, 110 sandy soil samples, representing a wide range of grain size distribution (GSD), were selected. Besides the classification <b>tests,</b> standard and <b>modified</b> <b>Proctor</b> compaction <b>tests</b> were performed on selected samples. Based on the test results, the soils used in the study are classified into various groups of medium to fine sand with gravel content not exceeding 5 % and nonplastic fines within 45 %. Multiple regression analyses were carried out on the experimental data and a predictive model was developed to express compaction parameters (γdmax and OMC) in terms of two variables, namely, uniformity coefficient (Cᵤ) and CE. Following the development of predictive correlations based on the 110 samples, a new set of 40 sandy soil samples were selected and their compaction results were used to validate the proposed two predictive equations.

The position of the upper shear box was fixed by using four C-shaped clamps. These clamps, with two steel angles placed {{across the top of the}} upper shear box, fastened the upper shear box to the sides of the lower shear box. This could prevent the rising of the upper shear box during compaction of another two succeeding layers of fill material, which was put into the box.

40|$|Although it {{is known}} that impact {{compaction}} tests are not appropriate for granular soils, these tests continue to be widely used. Excessive settlements frequently occur in granular soils where specified field compaction is based on Standard Proctor (ASTM D 698; AASHTO T 99) maximum dry unit weights. A laboratory test program evaluated alternative test methods for granular soil compaction control and showed that a Vibrating Hammer method (similar to British Standard BS 1377 : 1975, Test 14) has great promise for laboratory compaction of these soils. A One-Point Vibrating Hammer test on an oven-dry soil sample is able to provide the maximum dry unit weight and water content range for effective field compaction of most granular soils. The maximum dry unit weight obtained is comparable to that from other current methods such as the Vibrating Table test (ASTM D 4253) and the <b>Modified</b> <b>Proctor</b> <b>test</b> (ASTM D 1557), and is greater than that from the Standard Proctor test (ASTM D 698). The method is applicable to a broader range of soils than current vibratory table compaction tests (up to 35 percent non-plastic fines and up to 15 percent plastic fines). The equipment is relatively inexpensive and is portable enough to be taken into the field. The test is easier and quicker to perform than the other methods mentioned above and provides reproducible and consistent results. Large sized granular soils/aggregates create potential problems for compaction control methods due to the presence of oversize particles. Oversize particles defined here are those retained on a 3 / 4 -inch (19 -mm) sieve. INDOT Specification 202. 34 (b) 2 requiring correction of densities from laboratory compaction tests on soils with oversized particles is not being used in practice. It is not being followed primarily because guidance is not provided. As a result, the values of maximum dry unit weight from standard compaction tests will be significantly lower than those corrected for oversized particles. This finding may be the biggest reason why granular fills with oversized particles are under- performing. The proposed Vibrating Hammer Method of Compaction specifically addresses the influence of oversize particles. Based on the results from this research, a draft ASTM Standard for the Vibrating Hammer Method of Compaction has been written, is well into the balloting process, and should become an ASTM Standard Method of Test in late 2007 or early 2008. It is included in Appendix A. This report also introduces a simple calibration procedure to verify that the vibrating hammer is supplying sufficient energy to the soil. The Vibrating Hammer Method of Compaction is an alternative method for specifying maximum dry unit weights for granular soils. The method also establishes a water content range for field compaction. This research expands the applicable range of granular soils to those containing oversize particles. An experimental program, along with review of previous compaction research, was carried out to determine the effect of oversize particles on compaction performance. Testing was performed in two sizes of compaction molds, 6 - inch and 11 -inch, in determining this effect. An oversize correction method was considered for water content and dry density when performing a test in a 6 -inch mold with scalping, i. e. removal of oversize particles. Results of an INDOT pilot implementation project used to determine the viability of using the Vibrating Hammer for field compaction are reported. Results indicate that the Vibrating Hammer method is sufficient for use with oversize particles and that maximum dry unit weights may occur at or near saturation...|$|E

From the survey work carried out at seven villages of Chittapurtaluka {{it was observed that}} about 70 lakh tonnes of waste would be produced every year. Characterization of this limestone waste by conducting laboratory studies to find out its feasibility for road construction would help to reduce the demand-supply gap for aggregates, conserve depleting sources of good quality stone aggregate and decrease environmental degradation due to excessive quarrying activities. Laboratory investigation includes determination of physical properties of limestone waste aggregates, preparation of job mix formulae for Granular Sub Base (GSB) and Wet Mix Macadam (WMM) layers, <b>Modified</b> <b>proctor</b> compaction <b>test</b> to evaluate maximum dry density and optimum moisture content on WMM and GSB mixes, CBR test and Direct Shear test on GSB mixes. Laboratory results were compared with conventional Basalt aggregates. Results reveals that lime stone aggregates fulfill the requirements of MoRT&H- 2001 and can completely replace the conventional aggregate like Basalt in GSB and WMM layers...|$|R
40|$|Soil is the {{material}} {{that serves as a}} support for the construction base. Each region has different soil characteristics in other areas, there has a carrying capacity of good to bad or poor. Clay and silt soil has a bearing capacity and low soil properties. To overcome this, the need to improve the soil natures with the stabilization method. Stabilization is to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the soil so that it meets certain technical requirements. One way is with a cement stabilization. In this study, the cement used is a cement-type portland cement. This study aimed to compare the value of CBR clay and silt before and after stabilized by the addition of cement. Soil used is a type of clay taken from the village of Rawa Sragi, District Jabung, East Lampung district and silt types from Yosomulyo Village, East Metro District, Metro City. In the <b>modified</b> <b>proctor</b> compaction <b>test</b> results, the addition of cement on clay and silt proven to increase the value of the maximum volume weight (γd) continuously. While the value of the optimum water content (ωopt) a decline that is not too significant on at every level of the cement. For a density value of clay and silt mixed cement has increased compared with the original soil density. In testing the CBR without soaking in a mixture of cement with <b>modified</b> <b>proctor</b> compaction CBR values obtained optimum cement content of 9 % and ripening 28 days amounted to 107. 6 % in clay, silt soil while the CBR value without immersion saw the largest increase in cement content 9 % and ripening 28 days 58 %. The addition of portland cement is proven to increase the value of CBR significantly compared with the both real soi...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{compaction}} {{induced by}} heavy impact or vibratory rollers is acknowledged {{as the most}} powerful process to increase the shear resistance and to reduce the deformability of granular materials. Ground improvement techniques based on this principle are currently adopted to build artificial embankments and to enhance the mechanical response of in-situ soils. In an attempt to clarify the role of grain size distribution on the compactability of granular materials, a systematic laboratory experimental investigation was undertaken on a variety of quartz-limestone sands. Samples were prepared with ten different grain size distributions, by mixing three selected uniform sands with variable percentage. Each sample was subjected to different standard and <b>modified</b> <b>Proctor</b> compaction <b>tests</b> where the number of blows per layer was systematically varied (i. e. impact energy). The effectiveness of each 2 ̆ 2 Proctor 2 ̆ 2 technique was evaluated in terms of relative density. Test results indicate that compaction effectiveness is noticeably affected by the heterogeneity of soil composition, while a limited dependency on the water content is observed. A single correlation to predict the dry unit weight of sands combining coefficient of uniformity, specific gravity and compaction energy is proposed. It was found that the proposed correlation can predict the dry unit weight under an arbitrary level of compaction energy with an error of less that 5...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{to investigate the}} suitability of recycled construction and demolition materials as alternative pipe backfilling materials for stormwater and sewer pipes. Three commonly found recycled construction and demolition waste materials, (crushed brick, recycled concrete aggregate and reclaimed asphalt pavement) were investigated to assess their suitability as a pipe backfilling material. The physical, geotechnical and chemical properties of these construction and demolition materials were compared with local engineering and water authorities specifications for typical quarried materials so as to assess their performance as a viable substitute for virgin quarried aggregates in pipe backfilling applications. Physical and geotechnical characterisation tests such as particle size distribution, specific gravity, water absorption, Los Angeles abrasion, California Bearing Ratio and <b>modified</b> <b>Proctor</b> compaction <b>tests</b> were undertaken. Chemical properties were also determined, including organic content, pH, trace element or total concentration and leachate testing of the construction and demolition materials {{for a range of}} contaminant constituents. In terms of physical, geotechnical and chemical assessment for pipe backfilling applications, recycled concrete aggregate and crushed brick were found to have the properties recommended by environmental protection authorities while reclaimed asphalt pavement material did not meet some of the specified requirements. Also shear strength properties were found to be equivalent or superior to those of typical quarry backfilling materials. This research indicates that traditional considered waste materials can be reused viably as alternate pipe backfilling materials...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} carried out on clay soil stabilized with pond ash (PA), rice husk ash (RHA) and cement. <b>Modified</b> <b>Proctor</b> compaction <b>tests</b> were performed in order to investigate the compaction behavior of clay, and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were performed to determine the strength characteristics of clay. For evaluation purpose, the specimens containing different amounts of admixtures were prepared. Clay was replaced with PA and RHA at a dosage of 30 %– 45 % and 5 %– 20 %, respectively. The influence of stabilizer types and dosages on mechanical properties of clay was evaluated. In order to study the surface morphology and crystallization characteristics of the soil samples, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out, respectively. The results obtained indicated a decrease in the maximum dry density (MDD) and a simultaneous increase in the optimum moisture content (OMC) with the addition of PA and RHA. Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) showed that the predicted values of CBR tests are in good agreement with the experimental values. Developed stabilized soil mixtures showed satisfactory strength and can be used for construction of embankments and stabilization of sub-grade soil. The use of locally available soils, PA, RHA, and cement in the production of stabilized soils for such applications can provide sustainability for the local construction industry...|$|R
