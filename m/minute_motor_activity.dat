40|$|Goats (n= 12) {{undergoing}} laparoscopy assisted {{embryo transfer}} were randomly allotted to two groups (I and II) and injected lignocaine hydrochloride (4 mg/kg) or ropivacaine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg) at the lumbosacral epidural space. The animals were held with raised hind quarters for first three minutes following injection. Immediately after induction of regional anaesthesia, they were restrained in dorsal recumbency in Trendelenburg {{position in a}} cradle. Laparoscopy was performed after creating pneumoperitoneum using filtered room air. The mean (± S. E) induction time in animals of group I was significantly shorter (5. 33 ± 0. 61 min) than those belonging to group II (12. 66 ± 1. 99 min). Complete analgesia developed throughout the hind quarters and abdomen for 30 min and 60 min in group I and II animal’s respectively. Unlike animals of group I, group II goats continued to show moderate analgesia for 180 <b>minutes.</b> The <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> returned after a lapse of 130. 00 ± 12. 64 min and 405. 00 ± 46. 31 min respectively. Occasional vocalization and struggling was noticed in two goats one from each group irrespective of the surgical manipulations during laparoscopy. The rectal temperature and respiration rates showed only non-significant increase, but the heart rate values were significantly higher (P < 0. 5) up to 150 min in animals of both the groups when compared to their baseline values. From this study, {{it was concluded that}} both anaesthetic agents produced satisfactory regional anaesthesia in goats undergoing laparoscopy.

40|$|McArdle's {{disease is}} the most common {{metabolic}} myopathy of muscle carbohydrate metabolism, due to deficiency of myophosphorylase and alteration of glycogen breakdown in muscle. The clinical manifestations usually begin in young adulthood, with exercise intolerance, exercise-induced muscle cramps, pain and recurrent episodes of myoglobinuria. Many patients experience the second wind phenomenon, characterized by an improved tolerance for aerobic exercise approximately after eight <b>minutes</b> of <b>motor</b> <b>activity,</b> secondary to the increased availability of blood glucose and free fatty acids associated to an enhanced glucose uptake by muscle cells. In this study, we aimed to test a multi-parametric protocol in order to detect the impairment of muscular metabolism and motor performance in patients with McArdle's disease. We enrolled 5 patients and 5 age-matched healthy subjects, that were evaluated by: (01) monitoring of physical activity with an electronic armband; (02) testing of cardiopulmonary, metabolic and respiratory responses to exercise with a cardiopulmonary exercise test and analyzing muscle fatigue during exercise test by surface electromyography (04) evaluating blood lactate and oxidative stress biomarkers at rest and during exercise. The patients were tested at baseline and after three days of carbohydrate-rich diet integrated with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate and creatine. The multiparametric protocol proved to be useful to detect the oxidative capacity impairment and the second wind phenomenon of patients. We did not observe any significant differences of muscle metabolic response during the exercise test after three days of carbohydrate-rich diet...|$|R

40|$|Background: Individuals {{with mild}} {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) may exhibit changes in <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in conducting their activities of daily living. Depression, {{one of the most}} frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms, might affect <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in MCI. Objective: To assess <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in MCI subjects carrying out short functional activity tasks using ambulatory actigraphy. Secondly, we sought to investigate the influence of depressive symptoms on <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> Methods: 20 MCI and 14 healthy subjects carried out a 30 -minute standardized scenario while wearing a chest actigraph. The protocol consisted of directed <b>activities</b> (execution of <b>motor</b> tasks), semi-directed <b>activities</b> (execution of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, IADL), and undirected 'free' activities. Several common assessment scales (GDS, MADRS, and NPI) were used to diagnose depression. Results: MCI subjects had significantly reduced mean <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> while carrying out directed and semi-directed activities, compared to healthy control subjects. No difference was found in <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> between MCI subjects with or without depression. Conclusion: Actigraphic measurement of <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> during the evaluation of IADLs and motor tasks is a potential objective tool in detecting early changes in MCI.

40|$|Ghrelin is a newly {{discovered}} orexigenic peptide originating from the stomach. However, its action in regulating the fed and fasted <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> of {{the digestive tract}} is not fully understood. In the present study, we {{examined the effects of}} intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) and intravenous (i. v.) injection of ghrelin on the physiological fed and fasted <b>motor</b> <b>activities</b> in the stomach and duodenum of freely moving conscious rats. i. c. v. and i. v. injection of ghrelin induced fasted <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in the duodenum in normal fed rats, while i. v. injection of ghrelin induced fasted <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in both the stomach and duodenum in vagotomized rats. The effects of i. c. v. and i. v. injected ghrelin were blocked by growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) antagonist given by the same route and also blocked by immunoneutralization of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the brain. The effects of i. v. injected ghrelin were not altered by i. c. v. injection of GHS-R antagonist in vagotomized rats. Injection of GHS-R antagonist blocked the fasted <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in both the stomach and duodenum in vagotomized rats but did not affect the fasted <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in normal rats. Low intragastric pH inhibited the effect of ghrelin. The present results indicate that ghrelin is involved in regulation of fasted <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in the stomach and duodenum. Peripheral ghrelin may induce the fasted <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> by activating the NPY neurons in the brain, probably through ghrelin receptors on vagal afferent neurons. Once the brain mechanism is eliminated by truncal vagotomy, ghrelin might be primarily involved in the regulation of fasted <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> through ghrelin receptors on the stomach and duodenum.

METHODS: Colonic <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> was recorded using a strain gauge force transducer in 5 dogs before and after 5 -HT 2 B, 5 -HT 3 and 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonist administration. The force transducers were implanted on the serosal surfaces of the gastric antrum, terminal ileum, ileocecal sphincter and colon. Test materials or vehicle alone was administered as an intravenous bolus injection during a quiescent period of the whole colon in the interdigestive state. The effects of these receptor antagonists on normal gastrointestinal <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> were analyzed. RESULTS: 5 -HT 2 B, 5 -HT 3 and 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists had no contractile effect on the fasting canine terminal ileum. The 5 -HT 3 and 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists inhibited phase III of the interdigestive motor complex of the antrum and significantly inhibited colonic <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> In the proximal colon, the inhibitory effect was dose dependent.

40|$|The {{locus coeruleus}} (LC) {{is a group}} of {{norepinephrine}} (NE) -containing neurons that shows marked NE depletion when rats are exposed to uncontrollable shock. The depletion of NE in the LC region results in an increase in burst-firing of LC neurons. Evidence indicates that an increase in burst-firing of LC neurons results in a decrease in <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> Intraperitoneal (ip) administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, also causes an increase in burst-firing of LC neurons, apparently via the induction of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) in the brain. Ip LPS also results in a decrease in spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in rats, a behavior that expressed in “sickness behavior. ” However, a causal relationship between an increase in burst-firing of LC neurons and a decrease in spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> after ip LPS has not yet been established. Therefore, this manuscript examines the effect of IL- 1 acting within the LC region on producing an aspect of sickness behavior - a decrease in spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> — that is seen after ip LPS. We hypothesize that the decrease in spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> that occurs after an injection of ip LPS is mediated by the induction of IL- 1 in the LC region. Several experiments conducted measured spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> as affected by 1) ip LPS, 2) LPS infused into the LC region or 3) IL- 1 infused into the LC or LC surrounding regions. A final experiment tested whether interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra) infused into the LC region would block the decrease in spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in response to an injection of ip LPS. The results showed that a range of ip LPS doses (5 - 20 pg/kg), a range of LPS doses (0. 1 - 4. 0 ng/rat) or a range of IL-lp doses (0. 1 - 40 ng/rat) infused into the LC region all decreased spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, an infusion of IL-ip (0. 4 ng/rat) into LC surrounding regions did not significantly decrease spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> differently from an infusion of IL-ip (0. 4 ng/rat) into the LC region. Finally, central IL-lra (40 pg/rat) was unable to block or affect the decrease in spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> seen after an injection of ip LPS (10 pg/kg). Collectively, the findings do not support the hypothesis that the decrease in spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> that occurs after an injection of ip LPS is mediated by the induction of IL- 1 in the LC region. Although LPS infused into the LC region or IL-ip infused into the LC region decreased spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity,</b> IL-lra was unable to block the decrease in spontaneous <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> seen after an injection of ip LPS...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the association between <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> and severity of depression in 6 depressed adolescent outpatients. Method: <b>Motor</b> <b>activity</b> was assessed by actigraphy and the severity of depression was assessed weekly using the CDRS-R.

Mid-sagittal splitting of the spinal cord did not affect the rhythm generation at all stages examined, suggesting the existence of independent rhythm-generating circuits on each side. The rhythmic <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in the presence of strychnine was synchronized on both sides at all stages examined. These results indicate that the changes in rhythm pattern are mediated by {{development of}} glycinergic inhibitory pathways, while the basic rhythm can be generated without the glycinergic inhibitory pathways...|$|R
40|$|Investigated the {{relationship}} between the mean plasma concentration of arginine vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin (OT) and clinically rated psychomotor retardation. 48 inpatients and outpatients with major depression (aged 22 - 77 yrs) and 30 healthy controls (aged 19 - 73 yrs) participated. Plasma AVP and OT concentrations were measured 3 times a day (8 : 00, 16 : 00, and 23 : 00 hrs) and day and nighttime wrist activity were measured during a period of 5 consecutive days and nights. Principal component analysis revealed 3 components of <b>motor</b> activity: <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> during wakefulness, <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> during sleep, and the awake/sleep time ratio. In patients and controls an inverse relationship between plasma AVP concentrations and <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> during wakefulness was found. Patients with elevated AVP plasma levels showed increased <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> during sleep...|$|R
40|$|The neuroactive {{peptides}} SCPB (small cardioactive peptide B) and FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH 2), both originally {{isolated from}} molluscs, have potent modulatory effects upon {{the production of}} patterned <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in identified neurons (e. g., B 5 and B 19) in the buccal ganglia of the snail Helisoma. Such patterned <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> has previously been shown to underlie feeding behavior. Micromolar concentrations of SCPB initiate patterned <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in quiescent ganglia and increase the rate of activity in ganglia that are spontaneously active. Micromolar concentrations of FMRFamide inhibit patterned <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in Helisoma buccal ganglia, and 10 μM FMRFamide completely suppresses such activity. In addition, there are both anti-SCPB-and anti-FMRFamide-immunoreactive neurons in Helisoma buccal ganglia. Our results suggest that peptides may play {{a prominent role in}} the regulation of feeding behavior in Helisoma...|$|R
40|$|Since {{practice}} {{is a crucial}} variable in motor learning, this study aimed to quantify the level of <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> during inpatient stroke rehabilitation and to investigate the relationship between level of motor ability with performance of <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> Seventeen stroke patients were observed on nine weekdays in a fast-stream rehabilitation hospital. The results showed that for two-thirds of the day, patients {{were not involved in}} structured therapy and that for half of these observations, the patients were not engaged in <b>motor</b> <b>activities.</b> There was a positive correlation (rho = 0. 68, p < 0. 05) between patients' performance of <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> and a total Functional Independence Measure score. It appears that strategies are required so that, regardless of the level of disability, patients can be practising at an appropriate level...|$|R
40|$|Serotonin {{contents}} in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) and dorsal hippocampis of rats {{with different}} levels of inborn <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> were studied by microdialysis in basal and stimulated conditions. Rats were exposed to elevated platform and forced swimming stress. In basal conditions, differences in serotonin contents between rats with {{different levels of}} inborn <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> were found neither in hippocampus nor in PVN. In both kinds of stress conditions, serotonin content in hippocampus increased only in rats with higher level of inborn <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> Serotonin content in PVN dramatically increased during forced swiumming in both rat groups. This increase was significantly more pronounced in rats with low activity. The data suggest that serotonin release in stress depends on inborn <b>motor</b> <b>activity,</b> brain area dialyzed, and the stressor the animals were exposed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Effects of {{cimetidine}} (CIM) on locomotor is controversial. This {{study was}} designed to evaluate the effects of CIM on <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> and possible roles of opioid receptors in CIM-induced decrement in locomotor activity in mice. Materials & Methods: Thirty-six male mice (25 - 30 gr) were divided into six groups in this study. Locomotor activity was evaluated using an automated activity monitor system. CIM (50 mgkg, i. p.) was injected 25 min before testing in presence or absence naloxone (2 mg/kg, sc). Morphine (5 mg/kg, i. p) was injected 25 min before testing in the presence or absence CIM. decreased <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> significantly. Pretreatment of or morphine did not change CIM – induced response significantly. Results: The results showed that CIM significantly decreased <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in mice (P= 0. 000). Pretreatment of nalxone did not change CIM-induced response significantly. Morphine alone did not change <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> Pretreatment of CIM did not change morphine-induced response. Conclusion: Data indicated that cimetidine can reduce <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> independence from interaction with opioid receptors...|$|R
40|$|Increased <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> is a {{commonly}} describedsymptom {{in the course}} of anorexia nervosa. Dietaryrestrictions and intense physical exercise lead toreduction of body mass in the process of acceleratingcaloric consumption. Additionally a permanent increaseof <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> which is observed in some femalepatients is often not perceived by the patients. Thisfeature is considered to be different from exercise. Assessment of physical activity in anorexia nervosapatients is extremely difficult. All attempts at estimatingtime spent on physical exercise seem to be unreliable. There is not much information about the significanceof this symptom and about the lack of it. The researchundertaken so far has not established unambiguousconnections of <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> to osteoporosis risk. Objective: To review the literature concerningthe hyperactivity phenomenon in anorexia nervosapatients. Material and method: Articles from the Medlinedatabase were analyzed using the key words: anorexianervosa, hyperactivity, <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> Results: Neuropsychological aspects and the hyperactivityphenomenon in animal models of anorexianervosa were reviewed. The authors used variousmethods to assess <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> Neurobiologicalconcepts try to explain hyperactivity in terms of HPAdysregulation and the influence of orexin and leptinimbalance, based mainly on studies in rats– the activity-based anorexia model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This work {{is about}} children’s <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> You can often hear in media about {{sedentary}} children, {{and that one}} of the factors which contributed to this is computers and things like that. The main goal with this work is to find out how preschool teachers take care of children’s joy of movement and how they work to promote children’s progress of <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> To get answers to my questions I have used qualitative interviews. I’ve been interviewing four preschool teachers from two different preschools to find out how they work with <b>motor</b> <b>activity.</b> The result of the interviews shows that the teachers had god knowledge about the subject and the answers become pretty similar for all of them. They all considered that children’s <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> make sense for their development and {{that it is important to}} find stimulating environments, for example out in the open an in the forest. They also pointed out that it is important to give children time to play on their own. Keyword: free playing, preschool, <b>motor</b> <b>activity,</b> out in the ope...|$|R
40|$|Three {{students}} systematically {{investigated the}} hypothesis of Rosic, Frontali and Bignami (1969) that certain stimuli facilitate higher levels of avoidance performance (i. e., more correct responses) because {{of their ability to}} generate greater amounts of unconditioned <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> during the stimulus presentation. Experiment I showed that buzzer, tone and light stimuli produce different amounts of unconditioned <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> in rats, with the buzzer generating the most activity and the light generating the least. In Experiment II, the introduction of non-contingent shock resulted in a reduction in <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> levels, but the buzzer still produced higher levels of activity than the light. Experiment III directly tested the effects of different <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> levels in a two-way active shuttle avoidance situation. No significant relationship was shown between the unconditioned <b>motor</b> <b>activity</b> levels associated with warning stimuli and the corresponding avoidance performance. Surprisingly, all warning stimuli produced high levels of avoidance performance. It was suggested that stimulus modality effects still warrant further examination as a possible source of variance in avoidance experiments...|$|R
