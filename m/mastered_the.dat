50|$|In contrast, the illuminations {{reflect the}} work of at least six {{different}} hands. The art historian Walter Oakeshott first identified and named these artists in 1945, referring to them as <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Leaping Figures, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Apocrypha Drawings, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Genesis Initial, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Amalekite, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Morgan Leaf, and <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Gothic Majesty. Close examination of the illustration often reveals {{the work of}} two separate hands, with one providing the original sketch or design and the other painting in the colour and details.|$|R
50|$|Stylistically, <b>the</b> <b>Master's</b> work bears some {{similarities}} {{to that of}} <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Pähl Altarpiece. He is sometimes conflated with both <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Gerona Martyrology and <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Rajhrad Altarpiece, but this attribution is not universally accepted.|$|R

5|$|Music for a Time of War was {{released}} on CD by PentaTone Classics on October 25, 2011. It was recorded in hybrid multichannel (surround sound) Super Audio CD format. Blanton Alspaugh served as producer. John Newton and Jesse Lewis were the recording engineers; mastering and authoring was conducted by Jesse Brayman. In addition to recording the performances, Soundmirror edited, mixed and <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> audio.|$|E
5|$|The {{band was}} {{reported}} to have signed a deal with Victory in July. An announcement of Victory signing the band was released on August 11, 2006. Demos were recorded by Matt Finch at 318 Studios, with pre-production at The Wade Studios in Ocala by Andrew Wade. Recording began in October at Zing Studios, Westfield with producer Eric Arena. Arena also mixed the tracks. Alan Douches <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> record at West West Side Music, New Windsor.|$|E
5|$|Apple's US distributor, Capitol Records, <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> {{single to}} run at a faster speed than the album track, {{in order to make}} the song sound {{brighter}} on the radio. Unusually for an Apple release by a former Beatle, the single was packaged in a plain sleeve in the main markets of Britain and the United States. A variety of picture sleeves were available in European countries, including a design incorporating Harrison's signature and a red Om symbol, both of which were aspects of Tom Wilkes's artwork for the Material World album.|$|E
50|$|The {{roots of}} <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Aachen Altar in Cologne {{painting}} is beyond question. His proximity to <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Holy Clan, which is clear both in stylistic matters {{and in the}} adoption of subjects and motifs, leads to the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Aachen Altar was educated in the workshop of <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Holy Clan. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> of St Severin also had an important influence on <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Aachen Altar, as similarities in their figures and painting methods indicate. A partnership as journeymen in this workshop is possible. The mature works of <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Aachen Altar, such as the Mary panels, show clear influence from <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece. Further afield, the painter has taken important hints from the Netherlandish painters, such as the art of Hugo van der Goes.|$|R
50|$|In 1936, with Earl V. Simpson as <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Lodge, a {{ceremony}} was started which now holds great traditional sentiment in this lodge: The Past Masters’ Chain. During this ceremony, <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Lodge hammers a link engraved with his initials and year as <b>Master,</b> into <b>the</b> chain of Past <b>Masters.</b> <b>The</b> chain currently holds 77 links and is hung behind <b>the</b> <b>Master’s</b> chair.|$|R

5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> use of light by subjugating shadows and {{painting}} the trees {{as if they}} are the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E
5|$|Live at Benaroya Hall {{features}} arrangements by British arranger {{and composer}} Paul Buckmaster, who worked previously with Carlile on Give Up the Ghost, and Sean O'Loughlin. Seattle-based producer and audio engineer Martin Feveyear, who had mixed Carlile's debut album {{in addition to}} other live EPs and demos, recorded, mixed, and <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> album. Carlile had not spoken to Feveyear prior to the first rehearsal, but was pleased with the result of his work. Carlile's band included long-time members (and brothers) Phil and Tim Hanseroth on guitar and bass, Josh Neumann on cello, and Allison Miller on drums. The Seattle Symphony was led by Assistant Conductor Eric Garcia.|$|E
5|$|Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt {{incorporated}} Frusciante's avant-garde {{style of}} song composition, with his stream-of-consciousness methodology. He recorded, mixed, produced and <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> entire record by himself, and released it on Rick Rubin's label, American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, originally held {{the rights to}} the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. Because he was living as a recluse, however, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album under his label.|$|E
500|$|Each {{dictator}} {{appointed a}} <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse (magister equitum or <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Knights), {{to serve as}} his most senior lieutenant. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse had constitutional command authority (imperium) equivalent to a praetor, and often, when they authorized {{the appointment of a}} dictator, the senate specified who was to be <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse. In many respects, he functioned more as a parallel magistrate (like an inferior co-consul) than he did as a direct subordinate. Whenever a dictator's term ended, the term of his <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse ended as well. Often, the dictator functioned principally as <b>the</b> <b>master</b> of <b>the</b> infantry (and thus the legions), while <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse (as the name implies) functioned as <b>the</b> <b>master</b> of <b>the</b> cavalry. The dictator, while not elected by the people, was technically a magistrate since he was nominated by an elected consul. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Horse was also technically a magistrate, since he was nominated by the dictator. Thus, both of these magistrates were referred to as [...] "Extraordinary Magistrates".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Saint Augustine Altarpiece (sometimes called <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of <b>the</b> Augustinians' Altarpiece) was a German painter, {{active in}} Nuremberg {{during the second}} half of the 15th century.

In 1901, Stricklett pitched for the Toledo Swamp Angels of the Western Association and Sacramento Senators of the California League, compiling a 27-22 record. In 1902, he pitched for the Newark Sailors of the Class-A Eastern League and the Sacramento Gilt Edges of the California League, finishing {{the season with a}} 23-22 record. While pitching for Sacramento, Stricklett <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> spitball. In 1903, Stricklett pitched for Los Angeles and the Seattle Chinooks of the Pacific National League, going 24-8.|$|E
5|$|The Kačić family {{originated}} in the Zadar hinterland near the Krka river, and when King Petar Krešimir IV <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> Pagania, {{some members of the}} family likely relocated to the area between the Cetina and Neretva rivers. The social distinction between noble Kačićs in the Zadar-Biograd hinterland and the princely (knezes) Kačićs from Omiš remains uncertain, but the two families are considered to be related. The clearest established connection is the noble Hodimir, mentioned in 1207 in a charter of St. Peter's Church in Bubnjani near Tinj, whose son Nikola was an Omiš knez.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans {{had great}} {{diplomatic}} skill {{and ability to}} raise vast numbers of troops. Initially, their raiding gave them great support from other Turks near Osman's small domain. In time however, as the Turks began to settle in land poorly defended by the Byzantines, {{they were able to}} exploit the hardships of the peasant classes by recruiting their aid. Those that did not assist the Ottomans were raided themselves. Eventually, the cities in Asia Minor, cut off from the outside surrendered and the Ottomans soon <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> art of siege warfare.|$|E

5|$|While no {{official}} knot exists for tying the two {{ends of the}} thong together, the decorative diamond knot {{has become the most}} common. When produced, the thong is joined by a simple overhand knot and various region specific traditions have arisen around tying the diamond knot, including: having a fellow course member tie it; having a mentor or course leader tie it; and having the recipient tie it after completing some additional activity that shows he or she has <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> skills taught to him or her during training.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857 Burne-Jones joined Morris, Valentine Prinsep, J.R. Spencer Stanhope and others in Rossetti's ill-fated scheme to {{decorate}} {{the walls of the}} Oxford Union. None of the painters had <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> technique of fresco, and their pictures had begun to peel from the walls before they were completed. In 1859 Burne-Jones made his first journey to Italy. He saw Florence, Pisa, Siena, Venice and other places, and appears to have found the gentle and romantic Sienese more attractive than any other school. Rossetti's influence still persisted, and is visible, more strongly perhaps than ever before, in the two watercolours of 1860, Sidonia von Bork and Clara von Bork. Both paintings illustrate the 1849 gothic novel Sidonia the Sorceress by Lady Wilde, a translation of Sidonia Von Bork: Die Klosterhexe (1847) by Johann Wilhelm Meinhold.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Tweedy was {{preoccupied with}} trying to {{establish}} Wilco as a viable band on the Reprise label and decided to add another guitarist to the band. Brian Henneman, the lead singer for The Bottle Rockets, was brought into the recording sessions as a lead guitarist. Steel guitarist Lloyd Maines and bassist Daniel Corrigan {{also contributed to the}} album. Corrigan also photographed the band for the liner booklet. Howie Weinberg <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> album, while Barbara Longo provided graphic design. Brian Henneman had to leave the band shortly after recording the album, and was replaced by former Titanic Love Affair guitarist Jay Bennett. Tweedy also attempted to create a more collaborative environment than Uncle Tupelo, requesting songwriting contributions from other members. John Stirratt submitted three songs, hoping to become a secondary songwriter for Wilco. However, although the songs were recorded as demos, only one ("It's Just That Simple") was selected to appear on the album, and was the only Stirratt song, and the only song by Wilco not to have lyrics written by Tweedy, to appear on any Wilco album.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{eventually}} became an excellent {{teacher and a}} fervent believer in academic training. He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874, even acclaimed works such as Sadko and Antar, {{in a search for}} perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life. Assigned to rehearse the Orchestra Class, he <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> art of conducting. Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor, and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class, led to an increased interest in the art of orchestration, an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands. The score of his Third Symphony, written just after he had completed his three-year program of self-improvement, reflects his hands-on experience with the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Su Song was a Hokkien who {{was born}} in modern-day Fujian, near medieval Quanzhou. Like a contemporary, Shen Kuo (1031–1095), Su Song was a polymath, a person whose {{expertise}} spans a significant number of different interests. It was written by his junior colleague and Hanlin scholar Ye Mengde (1077–1148) that in Su's youth, he <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> provincial exams and rose {{to the top of the}} examination list for writing the best essay on general principles and structure of the Chinese calendar. From an early age, his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished path as a state bureaucrat. In his spare time he was fond of writing poetry, which he used to praise the works of artists such as the painter Li Gonglin (1049–1106). He also was an antiquarian and collector of old artworks from previous dynasties.|$|E
5|$|The Lost Levels {{was first}} {{released}} in Japan for the Famicom Disk System as Super Mario Bros. 2 on June 3, 1986, following {{the success of}} its predecessor. It was developed by Nintendo R—the team led by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto—and designed for players who had <b>mastered</b> <b>the</b> original. Nintendo of America deemed the title too difficult for its North American audience and instead chose another game as the region's Super Mario Bros. 2: a retrofitted version of the Japanese Doki Doki Panic. North America first experienced The Lost Levels, as the Japanese sequel became known, in the 1993 Super Nintendo Entertainment System compilation Super Mario All-Stars. It was later ported to the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and Virtual Console (Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U).|$|E
