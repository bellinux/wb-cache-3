5|$|Hindenburg reluctantly {{agreed to}} appoint Hitler as {{chancellor}} after two further parliamentary elections—in July and November 1932—had not {{resulted in the}} formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and Hugenberg's party, the German National People's Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior,</b> and Hermann Göring <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> for Prussia. Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.|$|E

5|$|A search began for a {{suitable}} Serb {{to lead a}} collaborationist regime. From {{the date of the}} Yugoslav capitulation, pro-German politicians, including the president of the fascist Zbor movement, Dimitrije Ljotić, former Belgrade police chief and <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior,</b> Milan Aćimović, the current Belgrade police chief, Dragomir Jovanović, Đorđe Perić, Steven Klujić and Tanasije Dinić met almost daily to assist in this process. Several high-profile men were considered by the Germans, including former Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković, former Foreign Minister Aleksander Cincar-Marković, Aćimović, Ljotić, and Jovanović. Förster decided on Aćimović, who in early 1939 had briefly been <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> in the pro-Axis government of Milan Stojadinović. He formed his Commissioner Government on 30 April 1941, consisting of ten commissioners.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Hitler had {{appointed}} Himmler as <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> and Plenipotentiary General for Administration (Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung). In August 1944 Hitler authorised him {{to restructure}} the organisation and administration of the Waffen-SS, the army, and the police services. As head of the Reserve Army, Himmler was now responsible for prisoners of war. He was also {{in charge of the}} Wehrmacht penal system, and controlled the development of Wehrmacht armaments until January 1945.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{and often}} {{contradictory}} directives were issued by Reich <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Wilhelm Frick, Bernhard Rust of the Reichserziehungsministerium (Ministry of Education) {{and various other}} agencies regarding content of lessons and acceptable textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools. Books deemed unacceptable to the regime were removed from school libraries. Indoctrination in National Socialist thought was made compulsory in January 1934. Students selected as future members of the party elite were indoctrinated {{from the age of}} 12 at Adolf Hitler Schools for primary education and National Political Institutes of Education for secondary education. Detailed National Socialist indoctrination of future holders of elite military rank was undertaken at Order Castles.|$|E

It was probably there that death squads were designated and assigned missions, leading to the murder of Mihai Stelescu, a former associate, in June of the next year.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1941, about 75 {{prominent}} Serbs {{convened a}} meeting in Belgrade where they resolved that Nedić should form a Government of National Salvation to replace the Commissioner Government. The same day, Nedić wrote to Danckelmann agreeing to become the Prime Minister {{of the new government}} on the basis of five conditions and some additional concessions. Two days later, the German authorities appointed Nedić and his government. Real power continued to reside with the occupiers. Aćimović initially retained his position as <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior.</b> In March 1945, he joined a Chetnik group in the NDH, and was killed battling the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, {{a funeral}} {{was held at}} the Cathedral of Santa Maria in Palma.

At least 2,000 gathered outside of the cathedral and a minute of silence was held across Spain in memory of the dead.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Talaat Pasha {{gave the}} {{detention}} order on 24 April 1915. The operation commenced at 8 p.m. In Constantinople, {{the action was}} led by Bedri Bey, the Chief of Police of Constantinople. On the night of 24–25 April 1915, in a first wave 235 to 270 Armenian leaders of Constantinople, clergymen, physicians, editors, journalists, lawyers, teachers, politicians, and others were arrested upon an instruction of the Ministry of the Interior. The differences in number {{may be explained by}} the uncertainties of the police as they imprisoned people with the same names.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of continued control of Alberta's resources {{by the federal}} government extended beyond the merely financial. As Alberta's smaller towns and rural areas were being connected to the electrical grid, Calgary Power made an application to the federal government for hydroelectric rights on the upper Bow River. Not wanting these rights to fall into private hands, Brownlee made an application of his own on behalf of the Alberta government. It was denied by Charles Stewart, federal <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> and the Premier of Alberta whom the UFA had defeated in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} the Deputy Führer had final {{approval}} over civil service appointments, and Bormann reviewed the personnel files and made the decisions regarding appointments. This power impinged on the purview of <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Wilhelm Frick, and {{was an example of}} the overlapping responsibilities typical of the Nazi regime. Bormann travelled everywhere with Hitler, including trips to Austria in 1938 after the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany), and to the Sudetenland after the signing of the Munich Agreement later that year. Bormann was placed in charge of organising the 1938 Nuremberg Rally, a major annual party event.|$|E

5|$|Formerly an {{administrative}} district {{in its own}} right, even a regional capital, Carabane is now just one of 23villages in the rural community of Diembéring, of which Kabrousse, Cap Skirring, and Boucott-Diembéring are the largest centres. This rural community {{is located in the}} Kabrousse Arrondissement. It is part of Oussouye Department, the smallest and least central of the three departments in Ziguinchor Region. In a country which includes some 13,000 villages, the village is considered, by a 1972 decree, the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation. Each is administered by a leader, assisted by a council. After consultation, the nomination of a leader is established by the prefect and approved by the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior.</b> Under Senegalese law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including law enforcement, tax collection, and keeping of vital records in the village.|$|E
5|$|Initially, President Grinius {{refused to}} resign, {{but he was}} {{eventually}} persuaded that Polish invasion was imminent and that Smetona had sworn to uphold the constitution. On 19 December 42 delegates of the Seimas met (without the Social Democrats or the Peasant Popular Union) and elected Aleksandras Stulginskis as the new Speaker of the Seimas. Stulginskis was the formal head of state {{for a few hours}} before Smetona was elected as the President (38 deputies voted for, two against, and two abstained). The Seimas also passed a vote of confidence in the new cabinet formed by Voldemaras. Constitutional formalities were observed thereby. The Lithuanian National Union secured other major roles: Antanas Merkys assumed office as Minister of Defense and Ignas Musteikis as <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior.</b>|$|E
5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that {{triggered}} riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the recent events and disagree with means used by the police, and feel that blacks are unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention {{for lack of a}} passport during an identity check, refusal of employment and housing rental, and police brutality. Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E
