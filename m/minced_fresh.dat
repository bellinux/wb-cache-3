40|$|Since {{minced meat}} is very {{susceptible}} for microbial growth, characterisation of the bacterial community dynamics during storage {{is important to}} optimise preservation strategies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of different production batches and the use of different preservatives on the composition of the bacterial community in minced meat during 9 days of cold storage under modified atmosphere (66 % O 2, 25 % CO 2 and 9 % N 2). To this end, both culture-dependent (viable aerobic and anaerobic counts) and culture-independent (454 pyrosequencing) analyses were performed. Initially, microbial counts of <b>fresh</b> <b>minced</b> meat showed microbial loads between 3. 5 and 5. 0 log cfu/g. The observed microbial diversity was relatively high, and the most abundant bacteria differed among the samples. During storage an increase of microbial counts coincided with a dramatic decrease in bacterial diversity. At the end of the storage period, most samples showed microbial counts above the spoilage level of 7 log cfu/g. A relatively similar bacterial community was obtained regardless of the manufacturing batch and the preservative used, with Lactobacillus algidus and Leuconostoc sp. as the most dominant microorganisms.

40|$|Abstract: When {{a health}} {{practitioner}} prescribes medication to a patient, {{one of the}} concerns is that the quality of the medication taken by the patient remains unaltered throughout the treatment period. Calendula officinalis is a well-researched herb, known for its antimicrobial efficacy and was therefore used in this study to establish whether its properties changed when exposed to different environmental conditions. An herbal extract from Mediherb and a homeopathic mother tincture were used in this study. Although both samples were prepared from Calendula officinalis, they were extracted differently. The Mediherb herbal extract was a 1 : 2 dilution of the plant material (flowers) with a cold percolation method with 90 % ethanol; whereas the homeopathic mother tincture was extracted by <b>mincing</b> the <b>fresh</b> over-ground parts of the plant during flowering time and adding 62 % ethanol to the plant material. It was then stored for 10 days and filtered to obtain the homeopathic mother tincture. The stock samples and dilutions of the samples were then exposed to different environmental conditions (Control – UJ Dispensary, Direct Sunlight, Kitchen Scenario, Office Scenario and Decreased Temperature) and the antibacterial properties were evaluated with the Kirkby Bauer Disc Diffusion Method and the broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration test. Some samples were also separated and analysed with Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. Statistical analysis of the Kirkby Bauer Disc Diffusion results was done and compared accordingly with the Mann Whitney U-Test and the kurtosis and skewness values. A comparison of the results for the broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration test and the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry was also done and reported on. The test results showed that the samples exposed to the different environmental conditions changed in their activity as well as their composition. The testing on the diluted samples were halted due to the inconsistency of the results and a suggestion was made to allow further research on this topic. Amber glass bottles showed overall better protection against environmental conditions than blue glass bottles. The samples in the control environment, the UJ Dispensary, with temperature constant at an average of 21 ºC and with minimal exposure to sunlight, external lighting and electromagnetic waves and radiation showed stability and would be proposed as the best storage environment for herbal extracts and homeopathic mother tinctures.

The optimum concentration of each test ingredient was incorporated into fresh, previously frozen and cooked chicken patties. Control meat (low vitamin E) was divided into 11 groups. Optimum concentrations of test ingredients were added (groups 1 - 9). BHA/BHT was group 10, control (group 11) and dietary vitamin E supplemented meat (group 12). In fresh meat, BHA/BHT was the most effective antioxidant, while RM was the most effective among the food ingredients tested. In previously frozen meat, Vitamin E, TC, S, BHA/BHT and RM were effective antioxidants. In cooked chicken patties, BHA/BHT was the most effective antioxidant, while TC were the most effective among the food ingredients tested. Antioxidants (BHA/BHT, RM, Vitamin E, TC and S) were more active in patties formed from previously frozen meat than patties formed from fresh meat and were most active in cooked patties.

Yeast and mold counts for untreated insects were above the Good Manufacturing Practice limits for raw meat, but all treatments attained a reduction of these microorganisms under this limit.

They have ‘U’ shaped solubility curves, water holding capacity was {{in the range of}} 2. 77 and 1. 77 mL/g, while oil holding capacity ranged between 3. 13 and 2. 23 mL/g. FMM and HWD have the highest bulk density of 0. 53 and 0. 53 for Neutrase and Alcalase 2. 4 L, respectively. Foam capacity and stability ranged from 125. 5 to 61. 4, 138. 5 to 45. 2, 130. 0 to 62. 5, and 124. 5 to 55. 0, 137. 5 to 53. 3, 129. 6 to 62. 7 for FMM and HWD hydrolyzed with Alcalase 2. 4 L, Flavourzyme and Neutrase, respectively. Tilapia fish protein hydrolysates are thus potential functional food ingredients...|$|R
