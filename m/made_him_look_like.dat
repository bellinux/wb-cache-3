25|$|An {{unintended}} {{consequence of the}} attack on Melo was that Paraguay declared war on Brazil in late 1864. The Paraguayans invaded the provinces of Mato Grosso (present-day Mato Grosso do Sul) and Rio Grande do Sul. José Luís served in the Siege of Uruguaiana which resulted, in September 1865, in the surrender of an entire Paraguayan army which had taken the Brazilian town of Uruguaiana. On 22 March 1866, José Luís was given command of the 2nd cavalry division, a part of the 1st army corps. He fought in the Battle of Estero Bellaco on 2 May and in the First Battle of Tuyutí on 24 May. At Tuyutí José Luís was shot in the face with the bullet's trajectory entering one cheek and exiting through the other. He was left with hideous scars that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> he had a grim smile in his face. Tall and lean, José Luís seemed unpleasant at first glance, an impression that the disfigurement only worsened. He was actually a kind and warm person, according to historian Gustavo Barroso, who as commander knew how to impose a strict discipline without hurting the pride of his subordinates.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Greeley's {{effectiveness}} as {{a reformer}} was undermined by his idiosyncrasies: according to Williams, he [...] "must {{have looked like}} an apparition, a man of eccentric habits dressed in an old linen coat that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a farmer who came into town for supplies". [...] Van Deusen wrote, [...] "Greeley's effectiveness as a crusader was limited by some of his traits and characteristics. [...] Culturally deficient, he was to the end ignorant of his own limitations, and this ignorance was a great handicap." ...|$|E
500|$|As each {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} new characters, the writers {{were able to}} attract actors {{who might have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. [...] "Nana's Party" [...] featured Claire Skinner as Angela, who is hosting a party. Pemberton and Shearsmith lived close to Skinner, but they had not properly met. She was one of several members of the cast of the film Life Is Sweet (others being Alison Steadman and Jane Horrocks) who have starred in Inside No. 9. Skinner enjoyed the [...] "funny" [...] script and her [...] "nice" [...] character. Eve Gordon (trained at the Nottingham Television Workshop) starred as Angela's daughter Katie, and Pemberton starred as Angela's husband Jim. Pemberton and Shearsmith suggested that Pemberton's costume <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Mr Chow Mein, a Benny Hill character.|$|E

500|$|Prior to his {{involvement}} in Re:Zero, illustrator Shinichirou Otsuka worked on video games, which led him to draw the backgrounds first when illustrating the series. [...] After reading the web novel, he submitted a number of character designs for the major characters to Ikemoto. [...] 's initial design <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a delinquent, with Otsuka later describing it as [...] "not {{the face of a}} boy in his teens", leading Ikemoto to request that the character be [...] "more friendly and less fierce" [...] so that the audience could empathize with him during emotional scenes. [...] Originally, 's character design appeared extremely plain, so a number of features were added to make her more interesting. [...] Ikemoto specified that she must fit the [...] "archetypal heroine" [...] mold. Rem and Ram also underwent significant changes from the first draft: their original designs lacked the characteristic hair parts, and their maid uniforms were longer and more [...] "traditional".|$|E
500|$|In 1962, Steiger {{appeared}} on Broadway in Moby Dick—Rehearsed, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, {{as well as}} playing a detective searching for a scientist's (Alan Ladd's) mugger in Philip Leacock's 13 West Street for Columbia Pictures. Steiger {{played the role of}} a destroyer commander in the large ensemble cast of The Longest Day, which included John Wayne, Richard Todd, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Sean Connery and Henry Fonda. According to co-star Richard Burton, Steiger had admitted to him that he was in financial trouble at the time and had had a face lift, which Burton thought <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> [...] "one half of a naked ass-hole". The following year, Steiger played ruthless Neapolitan land developer and city councilman Edoardo Nottola, who uses his political power to make personal profit in a large scale suburban real estate deal, in Francesco Rosi's Italian production, Hands over the City (1963). According to biographer Francesco Bolzoni, Rosi had cast Steiger in the Italian language film because he had wanted [...] "a rich interpreter of great capacity" [...] in the part of the land developer.|$|E

5000|$|Reg Holdsworth was a comic {{creation}} {{who made}} his Street debut in 1989. The character was rapidly balding and tried to look more virile by getting an appalling toupée, which he thought would [...] "draw the ladies".

60|$|Clarence {{began to}} explain his mission. While he was doing so the Grand Duke strolled to the basin and began to remove his make-up. He favoured, when on the stage, {{a touch of the}} Raven Gipsy No. 3 grease-paint.

2500|$|His {{early career}} <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a good Sri Lankan prospect, and the undoubted {{highlight}} {{of his career}} was the entertaining innings of 132 not out (including 26 boundaries) that he made on Test debut against a powerful Australian side in 1992. However, he failed to deliver on his promise in a declining Sri Lankan team (prior to the revival of Sri Lankan cricket at the 1996 World Cup).|$|E

2500|$|In a {{day that}} was {{relatively}} free of controversy on the court, several media outlets focused on allegedly unsavoury aspects off it. Sharapova's father, Yuri Sharapov, came under intense scrutiny from Australian media after he made a throat-slashing gesture shortly after his daughter's match against the world No. 1 Justine Henin. Sharapova had earlier joked that her father's camouflage hoodie <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> [...] "an assassin". The WTA claimed that the gesture was simply a joke between the pair, pertaining to this comment.|$|E
50|$|Balan {{also noticed}} that the Egmore Railway Station’s {{pedestrian}} platform was the staying place for rickshaw pullers and other poor people. Balan also slept in that pedestrian platform on one night. After that the pedestrian platform almost became Balan’s residence. Unbearable hunger, deep anxiety about his employment, tears on his eyes and worn out dresses <b>made</b> <b>him</b> to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a beggar on the street. In this situation, as some one said that time would never wait for any one, Balan’s condition also started becoming worse as days started becoming weeks.|$|R
50|$|To portray his {{character}} Torgo as a satyr, John Reynolds wore a metallic rigging under his trousers {{made out of}} wire coat hangers and foam by costar Tom Neyman. Reynolds unintentionally wore them backward, meaning the effect conveyed <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> nothing <b>like</b> a satyr {{and more like a}} man with oversized knees who had difficulty walking. No one ever corrected Reynolds' mistake on-set. Fake cloven hooves should also have been part of Reynolds' satyr costume, but he is instead clearly shown wearing boots in several scenes, which can even be seen in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. The film's dialogue never mentions the fact that Torgo is a satyr, and none of the characters seem to notice anything unusual about his appearance.|$|R

As for the Scarecrow, the straw in his body had shaken down with the jolting and packed itself into his legs and {{the lower part of}} his body--which appeared very plump and round while his upper half seemed like an empty sack. Upon his head the Scarecrow still wore the heavy crown, which had been sewed on to prevent his losing it; but the head was now so damp and limp that the weight of the gold and jewels sagged forward and crushed the painted face into a mass of wrinkles that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> exactly <b>like</b> a Japanese pug dog.|$|R
2500|$|Following his release, Stalin kept Kavtaradze in {{his circle}} of intimates, and nicknamed him Tozho—in {{reference}} to his slant eyes, which, Stalin believed, <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the Japanese prime minister Hideki Tōjō. He also confided in him: at some point after the Great Purge, Stalin allegedly told his friend that [...] "we had to shoot" [...] Nikolai Yezhov. On one occasion in 1945, speaking in Georgian, Stalin told the Mingrelian Lavrentiy Beria he considered him a [...] "traitor" [...] in front of Kavtaradze.|$|E
2500|$|The first makeup {{tests for}} Spock were {{conducted}} as production {{began on the}} pilot. Lee Greenway, a makeup artist for Desilu Studios, applied papier-mâché and liquid latex directly to Nimoy's ears. A variety of tests were conducted {{over the course of}} four or five days. The actor was horrified at the results, saying the creations <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an [...] "overgrown jackrabbit" [...] or an [...] "elf with a hyperactive thyroid". Fred Phillips was subsequently asked to make the ears, but he passed this task onto John Chambers so he could concentrate on achieving the right shade of red for Spock's skin.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1962, a {{group of}} Soviet {{military}} and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. However, according to another source, Castro objected to the missiles deployment that would have <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help {{the interests of the}} entire socialist camp. Also, the deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a [...] "nuclear umbrella" [...] for attacks upon the island.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the sixth}} and last time that Peter Cushing portrayed {{the role of the}} obsessively driven Baron Frankenstein, a part he {{originated}} in 1957's The Curse of Frankenstein. Cushing had long been known throughout his career for his meticulous attention to detail, even in the planned handling and usage of props. For this film, he helped to design the wig that he wore, but years afterward regretted the outcome, and jokingly quipped that it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more <b>like</b> stage and screen actress Helen Hayes. But Cushing's dedication to his role was never truly dampened, and at age 59, looking somewhat gaunt and fragile, he still insisted upon performing a daring stunt which required him to leap from a tabletop onto the hulking creature's back, spinning wildly in circles to subdue the monster gone amok with a sedative.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{an account}} of a visit by J and H Oldershaw to the island in 1826 and their reminiscences of Lord Seymour. They {{described}} him as an eccentric character and an old retired bachelor, who by accounts had not left the island for 20 or 30 years. They said that his normal attire of blue jacket and trousers, together with hobnailed boots, <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more <b>like</b> a labourer, {{for which he was}} frequently mistaken. He would often work in hedges and ditches with his men and would even go into town in his dung cart. He would also play jokes on his visitors by pretending to be a labourer, whilst showing them around the estate. He was even known to accept money from them, which he would give to his servants, saying [...] "Here you are. I have got you something today!".|$|R

2500|$|The {{choice of}} Davis's leading men became {{important}} as well.

[...] Henreid was similarly uncomfortable with the brilliantine image and when Davis insisted on another screen test with a more natural hairstyle, he was finally accepted as the choice for her screen lover. In her 1987 memoir, This 'N That, Davis revealed that co-star Claude Rains (with whom she also shared the screen in Juarez, Mr. Skeffington, and Deception) was her favorite co-star.|$|R

His clothes, being mostly cast-off suits of the captain of a London liner, whom he had sailed with upon many {{previous}} voyages, were all in the height of the exploded fashions, and of every kind of color and cut. He had claret-colored suits, and snuff-colored suits, and red velvet vests, and buff and brimstone pantaloons, and several full suits of black, which, with his dark-colored face, <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> quite clerical; <b>like</b> a serious young colored gentleman of Barbados, about to take orders.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the first}} {{appearance}} of Woody Woodpecker, Knock Knock {{is also the}} first cartoon to feature Woody's trademark laugh, a gurgling cackle voice artist Mel Blanc had been perfecting since high school. This is also the laugh Blanc used for Happy Rabbit, a predecessor to Bugs Bunny in the 1939 cartoon Hare-um Scare-um. This cartoon is also notable for featuring a very crude Woody design, something that was softened by 1942 and later changed into a much more realistic and easier to animate woodpecker by 1944. This first design featured Woody with red [...] "vest feathers" [...] (instead of white), buck teeth in some shots, thick ringed legs, two green tail feathers and a big chin which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more <b>like</b> a pelican than a woodpecker. The short almost never saw {{the light of the}} day because then distributor Bernie Krieser thought Woody was the ugliest thing he had ever seen. Lantz told him, [...] "You're not paying for these pictures, All you're doing is distributing them, so release him, because I'm taking a chance". So then Krieser took it back and asked for a series as the short was a hit.|$|R
60|$|One morning Ford {{found him}} {{sitting on the}} floor of the verandah, his back against the wall, his legs {{stretched}} stiffly out, his arms hanging by his side.

60|$|But in this {{scientific}} {{picture of}} him twenty causes, accidental and conventional, had combined to obliterate him altogether. The limits of photography forbade the strong and almost melodramatic colouring of cheek and eyebrow. The accident of the lighting took nearly all the darkness out of the hair and made him look almost like a fair man. The framing and limitation of the shoulders <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a big man; and the devastating bore of being photographed {{when you want to}} write poetry <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a lazy man. Holding his head back, as people do when they are being photographed (or shot), but as he certainly never held it normally, accidentally concealed the bald dome that dominated his slight figure. Here we have a clockwork picture, begun and finished by a button and a box of chemicals, from which every projecting feature has been more delicately and dexterously omitted than they could have been by the most namby-pamby flatterer, painting in the weakest water-colours, on the smoothest ivory.|$|E

The writer also predicted that their feud would generate weeks of [...] "fuming facial expressions and gurning glances as they vie to become ruler of Walford". David Brown from Radio Times said that Derek [...] "connives like an East End Jabba the Hutt" [...] in his scheme to prevent Carol from leaving.

6000|$|A {{stealthy}} glance now {{and then}} refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens. Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she watched her father's absorbed face, [...] "How he would enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day!" [...] Lastly, Mr. Bhaer {{was dressed in a}} new suit of black, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> more <b>like</b> a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands.|$|R

'Damn it, you know the girl who ought to have been my secretary.' I am not quite sure whether you will take it as a compliment--Sir Jervis appeared to view you in the light of a reference to my respectability. At any rate, he went on with his questions. 'How long do you stop in these parts?' 'I haven't made up my mind.' 'Look here; I want to consult you--are you listening?' 'No; I'm sketching.' He burst into a horrid scream. I asked if he felt himself taken ill. 'Ill?' he said--'I'm laughing.' It was a diabolical laugh, in one syllable--not 'ha! ha! ha!' only 'ha!'--and it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>look</b> wonderfully <b>like</b> that eminent person, whom I persist in thinking he resembles. 'You're an impudent dog,' he said; 'where are you living?' He was so delighted when he heard of my uncomfortable position in the kennel-bedroom, that he offered his hospitality on the spot. 'I can't go to you in such a pigstye as that,' he said; 'you must come to me. What's your name?' 'Alban Morris; what's yours?' 'Jervis Redwood. Pack up your traps when you've done your job, and come and try my kennel. There it is, in a corner of your drawing, and devilish like, too.' I packed up my traps, and I tried his kennel.
