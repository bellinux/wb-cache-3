40|$|Upon {{infection}} {{by human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), host cells react with various innate, cellular and humoral immune responses to counteract the viral invasion. Limited and transient restriction of viral infection is normally achieved. However, HIV ultimately overcomes these antiviral responses resulting in successful viral infection and replication. Expression of several HIV- 1 regulatory and accessory genes such as vif, vpu and tat is known to regulate some of the host cell innate immune responses to maximize viral infection or replication 1 - 3. For example, a host innate antiviral response mediated by APOBEC 3 G was recently found to sabotage HIV reverse transcription through cytidine deamination within <b>minus</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> 4 - 7.

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} genome contains large spans of non-coding RNA, {{which for}} the most part were considered of little functional value to the organism. Recent studies have indicated that vertebrate genomes may have stored hidden secrets in this large span of non-coding RNA, which we refer to here as “Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs). ” NATs can be found in introns, exons, promoters, enhancers, intergenic sequences, and untranslated regions of the genome. They can be located in either the plus or <b>minus</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>strand.</b> NATs utilize several mechanisms that include DNA replication interference, chromatin remodeling, transcriptional interference, RNA masking, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) -dependent mechanisms and translation interference to mechanistically regulate gene expression.

In previous studies, the antisense transcript has been identified both in various HIV-infected cell lines and in leukocytes of HIV- 1 + patients. The expression of the corresponding antisense protein (ASP) during natural HIV- 1 infection has been indirectly evidenced by the identification of anti-ASP antibodies in the sera of HIV+ patients. We have used immunoelectron microscopy procedures (ultrasmall gold particles coupled to silver enhancement) to establish direct evidence of ASP production. ASP has then been detected in chronically and acutely HIV- 1 -infected cell lines. The protein, found mostly associated with various cellular membranes {{as well as with}} the virions released from the cells, indicated that ASP is a bona fide component for the virions and may participate in the particle formation...|$|E

Under these conditions AAV DNA replication proceeds normally, {{but there is}} little, if any, adenovirus DNA synthesis. An analysis of the replicating molecules in sucrose density gradients reveals that there are AAV DNA intermediates which consist of covalently linked plus and <b>minus</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>strands.</b> Under denaturing conditions, these concatemers are linear single strands whose lengths can reach {{at least four times}} the size of the AAV genome.

Not surprisingly, on a vif background nascent <b>minus</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> can be extensively edited leaving multiple uracil residues. Editing occurs preferentially {{in the context of}} TC (GA on the plus strand) and CC (GG) depending on the enzyme. To explore the distribution of APOBEC 3 F and – 3 G editing across the genome, a product/ substrate ratio (AA 1 AG) /(GA 1 GG) was computed for a series of 30 edited genomes present in the data bases. Two highly polarized gradients were noted each with maxima just 50 to the central polypurine tract (cPPT) and LTR proximal polypurine tract (30 PPT).

40|$|Background:?DNA {{methylation}} is {{an important}} regulator of gene expression and chromatin structure. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) is commonly used to identify regions of DNA methylation in eukaryotic genomes. Within MeDIP-Seq libraries, methylated cytosines {{can be found in}} both double-stranded (symmetric) and single-stranded (asymmetric) genomic contexts. While symmetric CG methylation has been relatively well-studied, asymmetric methylation in any dinucleotide context has received less attention. Importantly, no currently available software for processing MeDIP-Seq reads is able to resolve these strand-specific DNA methylation signals. Here we introduce DISMISS, a new software package that detects strand-associated DNA methylation from existing MeDIP-Seq analyses. ? Results:?Using MeDIP-Seq datasets derived from Apis mellifera (honeybee), an invertebrate species that contains more asymmetric- than symmetric- DNA methylation, we demonstrate that DISMISS can identify strand-specific DNA methylation signals with similar accuracy as bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq; single nucleotide resolution methodology). Specifically, DISMISS is able to confidently predict where DNA methylation predominates (plus or <b>minus</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> ? asymmetric <b>DNA</b> methylation; plus and <b>minus</b> <b>DNA</b> stands ? symmetric DNA methylation) in MeDIP-Seq datasets derived from A. mellifera samples. When compared to DNA methylation data derived from BS-Seq analysis of A. mellifera worker larva, DISMISS-mediated identification of strand-specific methylated cytosines is 80 % accurate. Furthermore, DISMISS can correctly (p < 0. 0001) detect the origin (sense vs antisense <b>DNA</b> <b>strands)</b> of <b>DNA</b> methylation at splice site junctions in A. mellifera MeDIP-Seq datasets with a precision close to BS-Seq analysis. Finally, DISMISS-mediated identification of DNA methylation signals associated with upstream, exonic, intronic and downstream genomic loci from A. mellifera MeDIP-Seq datasets outperforms MACS 2 (Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq 2; a commonly used MeDIP-Seq analysis software) and closely approaches the results achieved by BS-Seq. ? Conclusions:?While asymmetric DNA methylation is increasingly being found in growing numbers of eukaryotic species and is the predominant pattern observed in some invertebrate genomes, it has been difficult to detect in MeDIP-Seq datasets using existing software. DISMISS now enables more sensitive examinations of MeDIP-Seq datasets and will be especially useful for the study of genomes containing either low levels of DNA methylation or for genomes containing relatively high amounts of asymmetric methylation. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHIV- 1 reverse {{transcriptase}} uses the host tRNA 3 (Lys) as a primer for {{the synthesis of}} the <b>minus</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>strand.</b> The first event in viral replication is thus the annealing of tRNA to the primer binding site (PBS) in the 5 ' UTR of the viral RNA. This event requires a major RNA rearrangement which is chaperoned by the viral NC protein. The binding of NC to nucleic acids is essentially non-specific, however, NC is known to bind selectively to hairpins located in the 5 ' region of the viral RNA. In a previous study, using an NMR approach in which the reaction is slowed down by controlling temperature, {{we were able to}} follow details in this RNA unfolding/refolding process and to uncover an intermediate state. We showed that annealing initiates at the junction between the acceptor and the TPsiC stems, and that, at physiological temperature, complete annealing is reached only in the presence of NC, probably when the zinc fingers contact the TPsiC/D loops. In the present work, we have refined our model of the formation of the tRNA 3 (Lys) /PBS duplex. First, we show that annealing can initiate both from the single-stranded CCA 3 '-end bases of the acceptor stem and from the bases in the TPsiC stem. Secondly, by NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, we have studied the complex between the NC protein and RNA hairpins that mimic the D and T arms of the tRNA 3 (Lys).

The ability of reverse transcriptase (RT) to extend different mutated primers using an RNA or a DNA template has been investigated in the presence or in the absence of NCp 10. NCp 10 was found to have different effects on RT depending {{on the nature of the}} template: an enhancement at the elongation level of mutated primers using RNA as template versus a slight inhibition using DNA as template. These observations suggest that NCp 10 could be implicated in the genetic variability of MoMuLV by allowing nucleotide misincorporation principally during <b>minus</b> <b>strand</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis. Retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) protein, {{in addition}} to its structural roles in the virion core, is involved in the early and late phases of the viral replication cycle. To further characterise the role of NC protein of MoMuLV (NCp 10) in the replication of the viral genome, the influence of NCp 10 on self-primed versus primer-specific reverse transcription has been analysed in vitro.

40|$|A Fortran {{computer}} algorithm {{has been}} used to analyze the nucleotide se¬quence of several structural genes. The analysis performed on both coding and complementary <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> shows that whereas open reading frames shorter than 100 codons are randomly distributed on both <b>DNA</b> <b>strands,</b> open reading frames longer than 100 codons ("virtual genes") are significantly more frequent on the complementary <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> than on the coding one. These "virtual genes" were further investigated by looking at intron se¬quences, splicing points, signal sequences and by analyzing gene mutations. On the basis of this analysis coding and complementary <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> of several eukaryotic structural genes cannot be distinguished. In particular we suggest that the complementary <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> of the human ε-globin gene might indeed code for a protein...|$|R
40|$|Background]Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 G (APOBEC 3 G) is a host {{cellular}} protein {{with a broad}} antiviral activity.

[Results]In this study, we have demonstrated that overexpressed as well as endogenous APOBEC 3 G were incorporated into HTLV- 1 virions and that APOBEC 3 G inhibited the infection of HTLV- 1. Interestingly, several inactive mutants of APOBEC 3 G also inhibited HTLV- 1 and no G-to-A hypermutation was induced by APOBEC 3 G in HTLV- 1 genome. Furthermore, we introduced the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) vif gene into HTLV- 1 producing cell line, MT- 2, to antagonize APOBEC 3 G by reducing its intracellular expression and virion incorporation, which resulted in upregulation of the infectivity of produced viruses. [Conclusion]APOBEC 3 G is incorporated into HTLV- 1 virions and inhibits the infection of HTLV- 1 without exerting its cytidine deaminase activity. These results suggest that APOBEC 3 G might act on HTLV- 1 through different mechanisms from that on HIV- 1 and contribute to the unique features of HTLV- 1 infection and transmission...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} {{reproducible}} single-cell gel electrophoresis assay for DNA damage and repair in buccal mucosa and sublingual exfoliated cells. Materials and methods: Buccal mucosa and sublingual cells and lymphocytes from six individuals (three males, three females, aged 34 – 45 years) were challenged with increasing doses of gamma-rays. <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> breaks and <b>DNA</b> repair were measured using the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay. Results: Baseline <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> breaks were significantly greater in buccal mucosa and sublingual cells compared with lymphocytes. Buccal mucosa and sublingual cells {{did not differ}} from each other with respect to induction of <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> breaks by 2 or 4 Gy gamma-rays. However, they showed a smaller increase in gamma-ray-induced <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> breaks compared with lymphocytes (32 – 53 % less than lymphocytes; ANOVA pv 0. 0001). Unlike lymphocytes, which repaired 83 % of <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> breaks, buccal mucosa and sublingual cells exhibited only a minimal capacity for DNA repair (approximately 0 – 14 % of the level in lymphocytes). Conclusions: Buccal mucosa and sublingual cells exhibit an apparent resistance to the expression of radiation-induced <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> breaks in vitro and an apparent lack of <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> break repair in the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay.

40|$|Topoisomerases are {{ubiquitous}} proteins {{found in}} all three domains of life. They change the topology of DNA via transient breaks on either {{one or two of}} the <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> to allow passage of another single or double <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> through the break.
