500|$|Hepburn {{went on to}} {{make the}} sports comedy Pat and Mike (1952), the second film written {{specifically}} as a Tracy–Hepburn vehicle by Kanin and Gordon. She was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the film: [...] "As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... it occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> audience was missing a treat." [...] Hepburn was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, many of which did not {{end up in the}} film. Pat and Mike was one of the team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy. The performance brought her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2011 Republican {{presidential debate}} in Tampa, FL, Bachmann criticized Rick Perry for {{his support for}} the humanpapilloma virus (HPV) vaccine and his support for mandating the HPV vaccine for all sixth-grade Texas girls. The American Academy of Pediatrics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and other medical {{organizations}} worldwide are in favor of immunizing girls and boys against HPV. HPV can cause lesions and genital warts, and has been linked to cervical cancer as well as genital and oral cancers in people of any gender. Because the vaccine is effective only if given before the onset of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to the virus, medical groups recommend the three dose vaccine be given to 11- and 12-year-olds. Bachmann, during the debate and in interviews following the event, accused Perry of “crony capitalism” (because Perry’s former chief of staff was chief lobbyist for a drug company manufacturing the vaccine), and claimed that the HPV vaccine was dangerous and caused mental retardation. She repeatedly referred to an anecdotal account from a mother of a girl who been immunized for HPV. “She told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered mental retardation thereafter,” Bachmann said. “There is no second chance for these little girls if there is any dangerous consequences to their bodies." [...] Shortly after Bachmann’s statements at the debate, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement: “The American Academy of Pediatrics would like to correct false statements made in the Republican presidential campaign that HPV vaccine is dangerous and can cause mental retardation. There is absolutely no scientific validity to this statement. Since the vaccine has been introduced, more than 35 million doses have been administered, and it has an excellent safety record." [...] Fewer than one percent of those receiving the vaccine reported neurological side effects or, in rare cases, severe allergic reactions, none linked to changes in cognitive ability. Bachmann later acknowledged that she was not a doctor or a scientist.|$|E
