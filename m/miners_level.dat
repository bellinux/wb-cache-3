The majority of the archaeological record was gathered from three areas: a dump outside the cave left by <b>miners,</b> lower <b>level</b> deposits from the northwest end of the cave, and undisturbed refuse along the outlying edges of the cave. Unfortunately, Loud did not maintain a comprehensive report of the excavation so detailed information is not available. The method and procedure of archaeological excavations has improved over the years and Loud’s excavation does not fit into the standards of today’s practices. He labeled the individual dig locations as “lots” without establishing any grid system. Grid systems are used to determine origin and depth of archaeological record. Loud recorded 41 lots. Heizer and Napton tried to further detail Loud’s findings but because Loud was not consistent with his methods of recording data their efforts were ineffective.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Coal workers' {{pneumoconiosis}} (CWP) is a preventable, but {{not fully}} curable occupational lung disease. More and more coal miners {{are likely to}} be at risk of developing CWP owing to an increase in coal production and utilization, especially in developing countries. Coal miners with different occupational categories and durations of dust exposure may be at different levels of risk for CWP. It is necessary to identify and classify different levels of risk for CWP in coal miners with different work histories. In this way, we can recommend different intervals for medical examinations according to different levels of risk for CWP. Our findings may provide a basis for further emending the measures of CWP prevention and control. Methods The study was performed using longitudinal retrospective data in the Tiefa Colliery in China. A three-layer artificial neural network with 6 input variables, 15 neurons in the hidden layer, and 1 output neuron was developed in conjunction with coal miners' occupational exposure data. Sensitivity and ROC analyses were adapted to explain the importance of input variables and the performance of the neural network. The occupational characteristics and the probability values predicted were used to categorize coal <b>miners</b> for their <b>levels</b> of risk for CWP. Results The sensitivity analysis showed that influence of the duration of dust exposure and occupational category on CWP was 65 % and 67 %, respectively. The area under the ROC in 3 sets was 0. 981, 0. 969, and 0. 992. There were 7959 coal miners with a probability value Conclusion The duration of dust exposure and occupational category were the two most important factors for CWP. Coal <b>miners</b> at different <b>levels</b> of risk for CWP could be classified by the three-layer neural network analysis based on occupational history. </p...|$|R
50|$|While {{the range}} of the noisy miner has not {{significantly}} expanded, the density of the population within that range has substantially increased. High densities of noisy miners are regularly recorded in forests with thick understory in southern Queensland, 20 km or more from the forest/agricultural land edge. Many of these sites have extensive road networks used for forest management, and picnic areas and walking tracks for recreational use, and it has been found that these cleared spaces {{play a role in the}} abundance of noisy miners in the forests. There is evidence to suggest that higher road densities correspond with higher noisy <b>miner</b> population <b>levels.</b> Field work in Victoria showed noisy miners infiltrated anywhere from 150 to 300 m into remnant woodland from the edges, with greater penetration occurring in less densely forested areas. This has implications for the size of woodland habitat needed to contain miner-free areas—around 36 ha. Revegetation projects restoring buloke woodland, a species of she-oak integral to the survival of the red-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorynchus banksii), have been interplanted with a nurse species, usually fast-growing eucalypts. Noisy miner populations were more likely in those buloke woodlands where eucalypts had been planted at densities of up to 16 per hectare (6.4 per acre). The presence of noisy miners was accompanied by a substantial difference in number and types of other birds found in the woodland.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Radon and arsenic are {{established}} pulmonary carcinogens. We investigated {{the association of}} cumulative exposure to these carcinogens with NOTCH 1, HIF 1 A and other cancer-specific proteins in lung tissue from uranium miners. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Paraffin-embedded tissue of 147 miners was randomly selected from an autopsy repository by type of lung tissue, comprising adenocarcinoma (AdCa), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and cancer-free tissue. Within each stratum, we additionally stratified by low or high level of exposure to radon or arsenic. Lifetime exposure to radon and arsenic was estimated using a quantitative job-exposure matrix developed for uranium mining. For 22 cancer-related proteins, immunohistochemical scores were calculated from the intensity and percentage of stained cells. We explored the associations of these scores with cumulative exposure to radon and arsenic with Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r(s)). Occupational exposure was associated with an up-regulation of NOTCH 1 (radon r(s) = 0. 18, 95 % CI 0. 02 - 0. 33; arsenic: r(s) = 0. 23, 95 % CI 0. 07 - 0. 38). Moreover, we investigated whether these cancer-related proteins can classify lung cancer using supervised and unsupervised classification. MUC 1 classified lung cancer from cancer-free tissue with a failure rate of 2. 1 %. A two-protein signature discriminated SCLC (HIF 1 A low), AdCa (NKX 2 - 1 high), and SqCC (NKX 2 - 1 low) with a failure rate of 8. 4 %.

40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{hazardous}} effect of coal dust and to examine whether there still may be {{an increased risk of}} respiratory symptoms among underground miners such as working miners and retired miners in Zonguldak, Turkey. Current miners had to have worked for at least 5 years. Retired miners had worked 10 - 20 years. Both groups are historically associated with exposure to higher levels of coal dust. Some haematological markers of blood samples taken from coal miners were measured in this study. The variations on haematological markers such as hemoglobin, prolactin, lactat dehydrogenase of these miners were observed. There were higher mean values of hemoglobin levels in both current miners and retired <b>miners.</b> Ca+ 2 <b>levels</b> as releated with increase of lactat dehydrogenase increase almost 5 times. The differences in prolactin levels were releated with levels of haemoglobin, ferritin and anemia. There may be high risk of respiratory symptoms even in retired coal miners.

40|$|A medical {{cross-sectional}} {{examination of}} a copper smelter work force was undertaken after environmental contamination with lead, cadmium and arsenic had been documented. A total of 920 subjects was examined, including active smelter employees, retired workers and copper mine employees {{who had never}} worked in the smelter. Slight to moderate absorption of lead and cadmium was definitely present in the active copper smelter employees, who had {{significantly higher levels of}} Pb-B, ZPP and Cd-B than retired employees and <b>miners.</b> Cd-U <b>levels</b> were higher in retired workers, who were also older and had, as a group, longer duration of exposure in the smelter. Cd-U did not exceed 10 micrograms/g creatinine, the level considered critical for nephrotoxicity, in any of the subjects. Median Cd-B level for active workers was 2. 75 micrograms/L. Lead absorption was characterized by a relatively small proportion (16. 7 %) of active employees with Pb-B levels 40 micrograms/dL or higher. We were particularly interested in exploring the possibility that simultaneous exposure to lead and cadmium, although at levels not associated with nephrotoxicity for each metal separately, could result in renal function impairment. Distribution patterns of BUN and serum creatinine levels were unremarkable. Urinary beta 2 -microglobulin levels were less than 200 micrograms/g creatinine in 95 % of copper smelter employees. There were no significant correlations between urinary beta 2 -microglobulin levels and Cd-U, Cd-B, Pb-B and ZPP or between urinary beta 2 -microglobulin excretion and serum creatinine or BUN levels. Urinary beta 2 -microglobulin levels were significantly correlated with age in the copper smelter workers, but not in the miners. Nevertheless, {{in the absence of any}} significant correlations between urinary beta 2 -microglobulin and Cd-U, Cd-B, a causal relationship with cadmium absorption cannot be affirmed. That kidney function could be impaired by long-term exposure in the smelter was only indirectly suggested.

In order that the reader may clearly understand the situation, it is necessary to explain that the accident occurred in one of the upper levels, at or near its extremity. At the same depth there were many of these underground passages, running in various directions, and several miles in extent, some of them being worked, but most of them old and used up--all the ore having been extracted from them. At various depths below this level other levels had been cut--also running in various directions, and of several miles' extent. These successive levels were not only connected and communicated with by the main shafts of the mine, but by [...] "winzes" [...] or smaller shafts which connected level with level in many places.

40|$|Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} {{is the second}} most {{pervasive}} disease in the mining industry. The exposure of <b>miners</b> to noise <b>levels</b> above the permissible exposure level results in hearing loss of approximately 80 % of coal miners by retirement age. In addition, between 2002 and 2011, approximately 48 % of longwall shearer operators were overexposed in coal mines in the United States. Previous research identified the two rotating cutting drums used by the longwall shearer to extract coal as the most significant sound-radiating components. In this context, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted research to develop noise controls for longwall mining systems. To this end, structural and acoustic numerical models of a single cutting drum were developed to assess its dynamic and acoustic response, respectively. Once validated, these models were used to explore various noise control concepts including force isolation, varying structural damping and varying component stiffness. Upon multiple simulations, it was determined that structural modifications to increase the stiffness of the outer vane plates were the most practical and durable approach to reduce the sound radiated by the cutting drums. Furthermore, these modifications did not adversely affect the cutting performance, nor the loading ability of the drums. As a result, these structural modifications were implemented into an actual set of drums for evaluation purposes. Results from the underground evaluation, when the modified cutting drums were used under normal operation conditions, showed noise reduction across the entire frequency spectrum with an overall noise reduction of 3 dB in the sound pressure level at the operator location, confirming the validity of the developed noise controls.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of mercury, a persistent contaminant, in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector is a growing environmental issue. Mounting concern over findings which point to {{the widespread use of}} mercury to amalgamate gold in ASM having significant environmental and health-related impacts has fuelled the launch of numerous donor-funded and government backed projects aimed at minimising its use. Most have taken the form of educational and technical assistance, implemented specifically to stem emissions from the industry and introduce miners to safer practices. These interventions, however, have had minimal impact. In an attempt to understand why the 'mercury pollution agenda' has yielded so {{little in the way of}} improvement, two divergent viewpoints have emerged. The first of these explanations, a view prevalent in donor and regulatory circles, is that miners ignore messages about the dangers of mercury and are reluctant to adopt more environmentally-friendly practices. The second body of opinion contests that approaches taken to educate and provide training on mercury management to communities are flawed, failing to take stock of the successful aspects of previous work and sufficiently eng~e target communities. There is insufficient empirical evidence to support either view, however. A broadened understanding of operators' perceptions toward the environmental impacts of amaJgamation is a necessary first step towards improving the policy context for mercury management in the ASM sector. This thesis helps to bridge this gap, focllsing on the case of Ghana, the location of one of the largest ASM industries in sub-Saharan Africa. It determines levels of awareness and prevaJent attitudes towards mercury use amongst small-scale gold <b>miners,</b> capturing a <b>level</b> of detail not yet undertaken. It also identifies barriers that prevent miners from adopting improved mercury management practices. To address these issues, a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analyses were undertaken: interviews with key institutional stakeholders; individual interviews, group discussions and feedback sessions with miners; and an environmental assessment.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} evaluations examined {{the impact of}} water spray pressure, curtain setback distance, and external and underboom spray use for controlling respirable dust levels and sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas concentrations around a continuous mining machine. This mining machine was equipped with a flooded-bed dust scrubber and was positioned in the box or slab cut. Exhaust line brattice was used for all tests. Dust levels were measured in the return airway and at locations representing the operators of the continuous mining machine and the standard and off-standard shuttle cars. Increasing water pressure or using the underboom sprays produced no significant impacts on dust levels, although their interactions did produce some significant impacts. Increasing curtain setback distance often elevated dust levels, likely by {{reducing the amount of}} airflow reaching the face. Use of the external sprays created additional airflow around the mining machine that pushed the dust cloud past the scrubber inlets. This significantly increased dust levels at all sampling locations. Tracer gas levels were measured on the off-curtain and curtain sides of the cutter head and in the return airway. Increasing water pressure generally led to significantly increased gas levels on the curtain side, although a slight decrease was observed on the off-curtain side with the machine in the box cut. Increasing setback distance elevated gas levels {{on both sides of the}} cutter head and in the return by limiting the quantity of ventilation airflow reaching the face. Use of the external sprays provided additional airflow along the off-curtain side of the machine, significantly reducing gas levels in this region. These sprays adversely impacted the dilution and removal of gas on the curtain side of the cutter head. Use of the underboom sprays adversely impacted gas levels on both sides of the cutter head. Use of the external sprays provided the best control of respirable dust and face gas concentrations. The smaller increases in <b>miner</b> operator dust <b>levels</b> produced by these sprays were offset by larger reductions in face gas levels on the off-curtain side of the cutter head. Although the underboom sprays minimally impacted respirable dust levels, use of these sprays was not recommended because they increased face gas levels...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{influence}} {{takes one}} of the leading roles in the development of sensorineural hearing loss (SHL). At the same time professional deafness steadily occupies the 5 th place in the structure of occupational diseases in Ukraine over the past few years. Of special importance is the problem of pre-clinical and early diagnosis of occupational hearing deterioration, in sense of timely prophylactic and rehabilitation measures in “risk group” workers. The objective research methods {{play an important role in}} the diagnosis of auditory analyzer state. Many scientific studies have shown the diagnostic effectiveness of method of otoacoustic emissions recording in the early diagnosis of lesions of receptor part of auditory analyzer. It is known that SHL of noise genesis largely affects the receptor part of the auditory analyzer, for which the OAE method has great practical diagnostic significance. Objective: to study informativity indicators of otoacoustic emission for the diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss in various occupational groups of coal workers in Ukrainian mines. Materials and Methods: Auditory function of 87 workers of the coal industry (drifters, miners and longwall <b>miners)</b> with different <b>levels</b> of industrial noise and hygienic conditions in their workplaces was: 28 studied drifters (group 1), 25 miners (group 2) and 34 longwall miners (group 3). Work experience in noise in these groups was 17, 9 ± 1, 0; 23, 1 ± 1, 0 and 22, 2 ± 2, 0 accordingly. Noise ratio in drifters was 93, 6 ± 4, 9 dBA, in miners – 92, 9 ± 5, 5 dBA and in longwall miners – 86, 5 ± 6, 04 dBA accordingly, while the maximum permitted level is 80 dBA. The research was conducted on the analyzing system "Eclipse" "Interacoustics" (Denmark). All patients underwent registratiov of the caused OAE at frequency distortion product (DPOAE) at frequencies 1 - 6 kHz. The results were rated using variation statistics Student's test. Results: The most prominent violation of the receptor part of the auditory analyzer according to the OAE among all the examined workers of different professional groups of the coal industry was found in drifters, miners had less pronounced violations and the least significant ones were in longwall miners. At the same time in 42, 9 % drifters caused OAE at frequency distortion products was not recorded on any of the investigated frequencies. Received averages of OAE amplitude in the studied frequencies differed significantly in drifters not only from the norm, but also from that in the group of longwall miners in the 4 - 6 kHz region. The most prominent disorders according to the speech and above-threshold audiometry were found in drifters and miners, testifying to violations in the receptor part of the auditory analyzer. Conclusions: In all occupational groups of coal industry workers according to OAE data, more pronounced violations were found in the frequency distortion products in the 4 - 6 kHz. This is evidenced by significant decrease of OAE amplitudes averages, especially pronounced in 4 and 6 kHz, where they significantly differ from the norm and from the indicators in the group of longwall miners; and OAE registration was absent in the drifters. The identified differences in OAE indicators and dysfunction severity in the receptor structures of the auditory analyzer, obviously, could be explained by the nature of industrial noise and hygienic working conditions in the workplaces of the studied workers of coal industry...|$|R
