50|$|In the 1830s colonial {{policies}} steered {{from the}} Netherlands (<b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>colonial</b> <b>affairs)</b> {{to decrease the}} autonomous and arbitrary nature of the colony, considerably increased pressure on the Indo population to ‘Dutchify’ its society. Particularly during {{the implementation of the}} 'Cultivation System' legislation and regulations discriminatory against Indos were enforced.

Under threat of marginalisation the Indo community was forced to reflect on its position in the Dutch East Indies. For {{the first time in history}} Indos began to organise politically in an attempt to emancipate as a group.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Colonial</b> <b>Affairs</b> was {{the short-lived}} Hokkaidō Colonization Office, {{established in the}} early Meiji period by Prime Minister Kuroda Kiyotaka to protect Japan's sparely populated northern frontier against encroachment by Imperial Russia by encouraging the settlement of ex-soldiers as militia-farmers in Hokkaidō.

5000|$|Between 1914 and 1920 {{the islands}} began the slow {{transition}} from naval to civilian administration. By 1920 all authority had been {{transferred from the}} Naval Defense Force to the Civil Affairs Bureau which was directly responsible to the Navy Ministry. Initially based in Truk, the Civil Affairs Bureau was moved to Koror in the Palau islands in 1921. The naval garrisons were disbanded {{to comply with the}} terms of the Mandate. In April 1922 a civilian government was established in each of the six administrative districts (Saipan, Palau, Yap, Truk, Ponape and Jaluit) {{in the form of a}} civil administration department which still reported to the local naval garrison commander. At the same time a post of Governor of the South Pacific Mandate was created. Governors were mostly admirals or vice-admirals as the administration was initially still the responsibility of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Governor reported directly to the Prime Minister of Japan. After the establishment of the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Colonial</b> <b>Affairs</b> in June 1929, the Governor reported to the Minister of Colonial Affairs instead. The establishment of the [...] "South Seas Government" [...] or [...] "Nan'yo-Cho" [...] in March 1932 finally put the government of the islands under a purely civilian administration. When the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Colonial</b> <b>Affairs</b> was absorbed into the Ministry of Greater East Asia in November 1942, the primacy of the Imperial Japanese Navy was again recognized by the appointment of an admiral as the Governor. Furthermore, the six administrative districts were reduced to three in November 1943: North, East, and West.|$|E

[...] From 1925-1926, Horikiri was governor of Kanagawa Prefecture. The following year, {{he returned to the}} Home Ministry as Director of the Reconstruction Bureau, which was in charge of urban planning and the rebuilding of Tokyo {{in the aftermath of the}} Great Kantō earthquake.

He worked as an official in four different prefectural governments over the next eleven years.

40|$|Technology {{policy and}} {{scientific}} {{research for the}} Java sugar industry during the Cultivation System (1830 - 1870) It has been generally held that during the Cultivation System government poUcies inhibited {{the pace of the}} mechanization process in the sugar industry. Because of this, Java's sugar industry was not able to maintain itself in the fierce competition on the world market for sugar. We want to readjust this idea by focussing on a case study of a research project initiated by the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Colonial</b> <b>Affairs</b> to determine the exact composition of Java's sugar cane in order to improve the Java sugar mills. The project was developed by the famous Utrecht professor in chemistry Gerrit Jan Mulder and was carried out in Java by the agricultural chemist P. F. H. Fromberg at the Agricultural Chemical Laboratory in Buitenzorg, Java. On the basis of this case study it is shown that this research was {{only a small part of}} a more extended policy of the Dutch colonial government and the <b>Ministry</b> <b>of</b> <b>Colonial</b> <b>Affairs</b> in order to improve the production technology of the Java sugar factories. The motivation underlying this policy was that the treasury benefited from a higher sugar production and a better quality of sugar...|$|E
