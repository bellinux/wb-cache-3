The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate student and faculty attitudes toward the need for <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> <b>centers</b> in three selected universities in Thailand. The status of the media services in the three universities also needed to be clarified as part of the research. The three universities selected in Thailand varied in the following characteristics: geographical location, size of the student body, and size of the faculty. Three questionnaires, developed by the researcher, were used in the study. Questionnaire I and II were employed to measure the faculty and student attitudes toward the <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> <b>center.</b> Questionnaire III was designed for heads of media distribution to determine the status of the media services in the three selected universities. Questionnaires were administered by the researcher's representative to students in randomly selected classes with enrollment approximately 3 percent of the total students in each department within each university, faculty members in a randomly selected 5 percent of all the full-time faculty at each university, and all heads of media distribution at the three universities in Thailand. Chi-square analyses were used to test the student and faculty questionnaires. To analyze the data, the SPSS computer program was used. Data were presented for each selected institution and then for the total sample. A probability of. 05 level of confidence was set for the study. Conclusions drawn from the study indicated that, at the present, the media services in the participating universities are located in both the library and in the Faculty of Education area. The major problems for the media services are deficiencies in staff, collections, facilities, and budget. The study also indicated that student attitudes toward the <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> <b>center</b> differ significantly among institutions. There is less difference in faculty attitudes among institutions than in student attitudes among institutions. The study also indicated a significant difference between student attitudes and faculty attitudes in all institutions. All of faculty and almost all of students indicated that they would prefer to have a <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> <b>center</b> in each Thai university and located in their department. This center should serve all administrators, faculty, and students. Based on the results of the survey, the study recommends that the State University Bureau in Thailand should recognize the need for the establishment of a <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> <b>center</b> in each university. Further recommendations relate to the planning stage, the organization of the centers, collections, services, activities, and budgetary procedures...|$|R
