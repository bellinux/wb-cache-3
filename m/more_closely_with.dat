5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of large subunit and {{internal transcribed spacer}} DNA sequence data, the results of which were published in 2012, concluded that the species then known as F.ellipsoidea was closely related to Phellinus gabonensis, P.caribaeo-quercicolus and the newly described P.castanopsidis. The four species share morphological characteristics, and form a monophyletic clade. This clade resolved <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> the Phellinus type species P.igniarius than it did with the Fomitiporia type species F.langloisii, and so the authors proposed a transference of F.ellipsoidea to Phellinus, naming the new combination Phellinus ellipsoideus. While the taxonomic database Index Fungorum follows the 2012 study, MycoBank continues to list Fomitiporia ellipsoidea as the correct binomial. Some mycologists consider Fomitiporia to be a synonym of Phellinus anyway.|$|E
5|$|Stela 10 is on {{the north}} side of StructureA-3. It depicts Wat'ul Chatel, dressed in Terminal Classic Maya style, {{although}} his foreign-looking face bears a moustache, which is not a typically Mayan characteristic. The text on this stela displays the emblem glyphs of Tikal, Calakmul and Motul de San José, describing how he received visitors from those cities. Among the visitors are named Kan-Pet of Calakmul and Kan Ek' of Motul. Wat'ul Chatel wears a headdress associated with the patron gods of Seibal, the heron god and K'awiil, deities that were also the patrons of Palenque. This appears to be an attempt by this foreign king to identify himself <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> the city he came to rule.|$|E

5|$|The Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, {{was a man}} of {{religious}} convictions. Unlike the Emir, he fluently spoke Pashto (the local language), dressed in traditional Afghan robes, and interacted <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> the border tribes. While the Emir favoured British India, Nasrullah Khan was more pro-German in his sympathies. Nasrullah's views were shared by his nephew, Amanullah Khan, the youngest and most charismatic of the Emir's sons. The eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, {{was in charge of the}} Afghan army. The mission therefore expected more sympathy and consideration from Nasrullah and Amanullah than from the emir.|$|E
5|$|The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made Wheeler an {{associate}} professor in 1937, but he wanted to be able work <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> the experts in particle physics. He turned down an offer in 1938 of {{an associate}} professorship at Johns Hopkins University in favor of an assistant professorship at Princeton University. Although it was a lesser position, he felt that Princeton, which was building up its physics department, was a better career choice. He remained a member of the faculty there until 1976.|$|E
5|$|The early {{versions}} {{of both the}} screenplay and the soundtrack followed Kipling's work <b>more</b> <b>closely,</b> <b>with</b> a dramatic, dark, and sinister tone which Disney did not want in his family film, leading to writer Bill Peet and composer Terry Gilkyson being replaced. The casting employed famous actors and musicians Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, George Sanders and Louis Prima, as well as Disney regulars such as Sterling Holloway, J. Pat O'Malley and Verna Felton, and the director's son, Bruce Reitherman, as Mowgli.|$|E

5|$|The {{experience}} in Sierra Leone proved {{the effectiveness of}} relatively small numbers of well trained and equipped soldiers. It inspired the British government to work <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> European allies, particularly France after the latter led Operation Artemis, a UN-mandated intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003. After a summit in 2003, the two governments called on the European Union (EU) to develop the capability to rapidly deploy a battle group of around 1,500 personnel {{able to respond to}} crises, particularly in Africa. The member states of the EU approved the creation of 13 battle groups in 2004.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, the British {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to integrate the}} princely states <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> British India, in 1921 creating the Chamber of Princes as a consultative and advisory body, and in 1936 transferring {{the responsibility for the}} supervision of smaller states from the provinces to the centre and creating direct relations between the Government of India and the larger princely states, superseding political agents. A more ambitious aim was a scheme of federation contained in the Government of India Act 1935, which envisaged the princely states and British India being united under a federal government. This scheme came close to success, but was abandoned in 1939 {{as a result of the}} outbreak of the Second World War. As a result, in the 1940s the relationship between the princely states and the crown remained regulated by the principle of paramountcy and by the various treaties between the British crown and the states.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{plans were}} drawn up to quell Welsh {{nationalism}} by affiliating Elizabeth <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, {{which included a}} fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, {{at a time when}} Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.|$|E

5|$|French naturalist Lucien Quélet {{transferred}} the species to the now-obsolete genus Dictyopus in 1886, {{which resulted in}} the synonym Dictyopus torosus. Boletus xanthocyaneus, first described by Henri Romagnesi in 1948 as Boletus purpureus var. xanthocyaneus and classified as a species in 1976, was considered by Italian mycologist Carlo Luciano Alessio to be synonymous with B. torosus. Others, however, regard this fungus a distinct species. In 2013 Italian mycologists Valerio Bertolini and Giampaolo Simonini observed that the brevity of the original species description meant that some subsequent papers used B.torosus for specimens that aligned <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> descriptions of Boletus rhodopurpureus or B.luteocupreus (both now placed in the genus Imperator). They did note that Swiss and French authors had adhered to a more detailed description by Quélet, and that this was the only description faithful to the original description with a grey cap and yellow pores that slowly turn red. They concluded the original description must have been based on specimens growing near the French-Swiss border and hence selected a neotype specimen from this region.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 {{feature film}} The X-Files, when Scully is {{infected}} with the black oil and taken to Antarctica, it is the Well-Manicured Man who, having grown disillusioned with the Syndicate, gives Mulder the coordinates needed to find her and {{a sample of the}} vaccine needed to cure Scully. The colonists had kept secret a secondary characteristic of the black oil—that those infected with it for prolonged periods would gestate a new colonist lifeform, killing the host. Upon discovering this, the Syndicate vowed to work <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> the colonists in the hope of being spared this fate, while only the Well-Manicured Man wished to continue working on a vaccination for resistance. This rejection led to his betrayal of the Syndicate, and to him committing suicide by car bomb before his duplicity was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Operation Iskra was a {{strategic}} {{victory for the}} Soviet forces. From a military perspective, the operation eliminated {{the possibility of the}} capture of the city and a German–Finnish link up, as the Leningrad Front was now very well supplied, reinforced and able to co-operate <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> the Volkhov Front. For the civilian population, the operation meant that more food was able to reach the city, as well as improved conditions and the possibility of evacuating more civilians from the city. Breaking the blockade also had a significant strategic effect, although it was overshadowed by the surrender of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad only a few days later. Notably, the first Tiger tank captured by the Soviets was taken during this battle. It was undamaged and evacuated by the Soviet forces for evaluation.|$|E

5|$|The major {{political}} and cultural center of Mesoamerica in the Early Classic period was Teotihuacan. The identity of the language(s) spoken by Teotihuacan's founders has long been debated, with the relationship of Nahuatl to Teotihuacan being prominent in that enquiry. While in the 19th and early 20th centuries it was presumed that Teotihuacan had been founded by speakers of Nahuatl, later linguistic and archaeological research tended to disconfirm this view. Instead, {{the timing of the}} Nahuatl influx was seen to coincide <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> Teotihuacan's fall than its rise, and other candidates such as Totonacan identified as more likely. But recently, evidence from Mayan epigraphy of possible Nahuatl loanwords in Mayan languages has been interpreted as demonstrating that other Mesoamerican languages may have been borrowing words from Proto-Nahuan (or its early descendants) significantly earlier than previously thought, bolstering the possibility of a significant Nahuatl presence at Teotihuacan.|$|E
