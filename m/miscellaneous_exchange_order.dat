For any currency pair {{in a particular}} period, one currency has higher assets return than the other and can be considered the high-return-currency (HRC). Financial institutions attempt to hold more HRC assets when they become more risk-loving or the relative return of the assets is expected to increase. Such a portfolio reallocation generates buy order toward the HRC and the currency appreciates. As the HRC changes over time, the direction that the relative return and risk appetite a¤ect the exchange rate varies in di¤erent regimes. JEL classi…cation: F 31; G 11; G 15...|$|R

A typical example is demand planning of a supply chain or a stock <b>exchange</b> <b>order</b> book, where different participants have agreed on a standard protocol.
