40|$|NoThis {{paper is}} part of a {{research}} theme to develop methods that enhance risk assessment studies by the use of 'automated' failure analysis. The paper presents an approach to <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> analysis and introduces a <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> analysis module {{that can be used in}} a virtual reality (VR) environment. The module is used to analyse and predict <b>failures</b> in <b>mechanical</b> assemblies; it considers stress related failures within components, as well as failures due to component interactions. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>failures</b> are divided into two categories in this paper: material failures and interference failures. The former occur in components and the latter happen at the interface between components. Individual component failures can be analysed readily; a contribution of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> analysis module is to predict interference <b>failures.</b> A <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> analysis system that analyses and visualizes <b>mechanical</b> <b>failures</b> in a virtual environment has been developed. Two case studies demonstrate how the system carries out failure analysis and visualization as design parameters are changed...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the global {{installed}} capacity of offshore wind has increased rapidly, due to the world’s green electricity demand. Increasing developments in the offshore wind sector has led to fewer possible locations for new wind farms, forcing the developers to move further and further away from shore. This shift from near-shore to far-shore wind farm locations, increases the complexity and costs of executing operations and maintenance, which can account for 25 % of the production cost of power. The <b>vessels</b> and <b>helicopters</b> {{that are used to}} execute preventive and corrective maintenance activities are expensive, and a crane vessel can easily cost USD 40 000 per day. The potential savings in determining an optimal fleet size and mix for the execution of maintenance activities on an offshore wind farm are therefore considerable. Using a joint fleet for more than one wind farm, is a way of achieving savings in order to obtain cost-efficient projects. However, uncertain factors, such as turbine failures requiring corrective maintenance, vessel spot rates, electricity prices and weather conditions limiting the accessibility of the vessels, raise the need for decision support tools. In this thesis we investigate the possibility of using operations research to determine an optimal fleet size and mix for one or several offshore wind farms. The decisions to be made are how many vessels to acquire or rent in order to meet a given maintenance schedule, in addition to determining whether offshore station concepts are economically viable. Strategic decision support tools in terms of both a deterministic and a stochastic optimisation model are developed and will be presented. Based on different scenarios including turbine <b>failures,</b> <b>vessel</b> and <b>helicopter</b> spot rates, electricity prices and weather conditions, the stochastic model determines the optimal fleet size and mix that should be used to execute maintenance operations on one or several offshore wind farms. A computational study proves that the stochastic model is able to solve problems for real world wind farms with more than 400 wind turbines. Further, the value of the stochastic solution and the expected value of perfect information suggest that the stochastic model gives solutions that are fairly well hedged against possible future outcomes, and returns solutions that perform significantly better than the solutions from the deterministic model. In addition, the stochastic model is shown to have a great economical applicability, in terms of determining the willingness to pay for additional wave capacity of the vessels, the possible savings of using offshore station concepts and the potential savings in using a joint fleet on several offshore wind farms. The stochastic optimization model addressing the fleet size and mix problem for offshore wind is the first of its kind, and this thesis has proven that the model has a real world value in terms of being a great strategic decision support tool taking into account the inherent uncertainties of the problem. The model does, however, not consider the logistics of spare parts or the tactical day-to-day utilisation of the given fleet, thus further work is suggested on these issues. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel stall-detection methodology for low-speed axial-flow fans. Because aerodynamic stall is a major potential cause of <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> in axial fans, effective stall-detection techniques have had wide application for many years. However, aerodynamic stall does not always result in <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure.</b> A subsonic fan can sometimes operate at low speeds in an aerodynamically stalled condition without incurring <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure.</b> To differentiate between aerodynamic stall conditions that constitute a mechanical risk and those that do not, the stall-detection methodology in the present study utilizes a symmetrized dot pattern (SDP) technique that is capable of differentiating between stall conditions. This paper describes a stall-detections criterion based on a SDP visual waveform analysis and develops a stall-warning methodology based on that analysis. This study presents an analysis of measured acoustic and structural data across nine aerodynamic operating conditions represented in a 3 X 3 matrix. The matrix is a combination of (i) three speeds (full-, half-, and quarter-speed) and (ii) three operational states (stable operation, incipient stall, and rotating stall). The matrix of SDPs and structural data are used to differentiate critical stall conditions (those that will lead to <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure</b> of the fan) from noncritical ones (those that will not result in <b>mechanical</b> <b>failure),</b> thus providing a basis for an intelligent stall-warning methodology...|$|R
