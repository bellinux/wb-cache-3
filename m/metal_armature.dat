50|$|Throughout {{most of his}} career, Harryhausen's {{work was}} a sort of family affair. His father did the {{machining}} of the <b>metal</b> <b>armatures</b> (based on his son's designs) that were the skeletons for the models and allowed them to keep their position, while his mother assisted with some miniature costumes. After Harryhausen's father died in 1973, Harryhausen contracted his armature work out to another machinist. An occasional assistant, George Lofgren, a taxidermist, assisted Harryhausen with the creation of furred creatures. Another associate, Willis Cook, built some of Harryhausen's miniature sets. Other than that, Harryhausen worked generally alone to produce almost all of the animation for his films.|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} part of a railgun launch package is the armature where the electromagnetic force is generated leading to the acceleration of the launch package. In case of <b>metal</b> <b>armatures,</b> the most commonly used armature types are the C-shape and the multi-fiber brush technology. However, rarely both armature types were systematically compared under similar experimental conditions. That is why we constructed launch packages based on the C-shaped and brush armature technology with comparable armature and payload mass. With these launch packages a series of experiments were performed in an energy range between 0. 8 MJ and 1. 13 MJ corresponding to a speed range between 950 m/s and 1400 m/s. The results of the experiments were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. On the one hand our results show that the total losses are higher for the C-shaped armature technology than for the brush aramture technology. On the other hand our results show that launch packages based on the C-shaped technology convert better electrical energy into kinetic energy.

These sheets were used for building coach door panels, amongst other structural uses. Theodore Jennens patented a process in 1847 for steaming and pressing these laminated sheets into various shapes, which were then used to manufacture trays, chair backs, and structural panels, usually laid over a wood or <b>metal</b> <b>armature</b> for strength. The papier-mâché was smoothed and lacquered, or finished with a pearl shell finish. The industry lasted through the 19th century. [...] Russia had a thriving industry in ornamental papier-mâché.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} {{the hot water}} test is {{presented}} on thin UHPC slabs that are reinforced by {{a new type of}} armature. It is a textile armature, which should replace the classic <b>metal</b> (steel) <b>armature.</b> Textile armature should not only reduce the cost of production, but, because it is not susceptible to corrosion as conventional steel armature, panels can be designed with significantly less cover thickness in achieving similar or longer lifetime of these elements. The combination of UHPC concrete with a minimum thickness of cover and textile armature allows design elements weighing up to 70 % lower compared to conventional concrete elements with conventional armature. This can achieve significant savings and benefits not only in economic aspects, but also in environmental aspects. This paper follows the paper in reference [1], now it is the different recipe...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Edison was {{impressed}} by the film and O'Brien was hired by the Edison Company to animate a series of short films with a prehistoric theme, these included R.F.D. 10,000 B.C. and Prehistoric Poultry (both 1917). During this time he also worked on other Edison Company productions including Sam Loyd's The Puzzling Billboard and Nippy's Nightmare (both 1917), which were the first stop-motion films to combine live actors with stop motion models. These films led to a commission from Herbert M. Dawley to write, direct, co-star and produce the effects for another dinosaur film, The Ghost of Slumber Mountain (1918), for a budget of $3,000. The collaboration was not a happy one and Dawley would cut the 45-minute film down to 11 minutes and claimed credit for O'Brien's pioneering effects work, which combined realistic stop-motion animated prehistoric models with live action. The film grossed over $100,000 and Dawley used the cut effects footage in a sequel Along the Moonbeam Trail (1920) and the documentary Evolution (1923), but O'Brien received little financial reimbursement from this success. [...] The film however did help to secure his position on Harry O. Hoyt's The Lost World. For his early, short films O'Brien created his own characters out of clay, although for much of his feature career he would employ Richard and Marcel Delgado to create much more detailed stop-motion models (based on O'Brien's designs) with rubber skin built up over complex, articulated <b>metal</b> <b>armatures.</b> The models contained a bladder inside the skeleton model that could be inflated and deflated to give the illusion of breathing. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who appeared in the prologue to the film based on his novel of the same name, reportedly showed a reel of O'Brien's animation from the film to his friends, claiming it was real footage of living dinosaurs, to try to convince them that his story was based on fact.|$|R

50|$|The figure making {{process for}} Madame Tussauds is {{about four months}} long and each figure costs about $300,000 to produce start to finish. The process begins with a sitting with the subject {{to decide on the}} figure's pose, outfit, hair, and makeup. After these details are agreed upon, the studio artists from Madame Tussauds take over 250 precise {{measurements}} and photographs of the subject. Once all of the measurements have been recorded, the studio artists begin crafting the figures. They start by creating a <b>metal</b> <b>armature</b> that serves as a skeleton for the figure. This skeleton is then cast in fiber glass to create the body. While the body is made, the figure's head is carefully sculpted out of clay and a variety of tools until a perfect likeness is achieved. After the clay has dried, a plaster mold is made of the head and cut into thirteen pieces that allows the artists to remove the mold and put it back together. Once this is completed, the wax is melted down and poured into the mold, creating the figure's head. Then, the teeth and eyes are fitted and each piece of hair is inserted individually. The process of hair insertion takes about two weeks to complete. Once this is finished, Madame Tussauds' artists cut and style the hair and apply the figure's makeup using several shades of oil based paints to build the exact colors and tones. Once these steps are finalized, the figure can then be dressed and accessorized.|$|E

50|$|The {{cross-section}} of each mullion or tracery bar was important {{both for the}} structural integrity {{of the window and}} for the visual effect. As can be seen in Viollet-le-Duc's diagram (right) there was normally a roll-moulding on both the inside and outside of the windows, which made the mullions appear even more slender than they actually were. The shoulder marked 'B' on the diagram is the glazing slot, into which the <b>metal</b> frame (<b>armature)</b> of the window glass is mounted. Unlike with plate tracery, where each stone had to be individually shaped, the elements of bar tracery could be mass-produced to standard templates in the mason's yard - work that could continue even when it was too cold for lime mortar to set. The technical aspects of the windows at Reims clearly fascinated Villard de Honnecourt, who visited the construction site, probably in the 1220s, and made a detailed sketch of the various templates, using a key to show how they fitted into the different parts of the window (the templates are in the lower half of folio 32 recto; the symbols besides the templates match similar ones on the detailed drawing of the Reims elevations on the facing page, folio 31 verso).|$|R
