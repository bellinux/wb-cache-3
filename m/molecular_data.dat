5|$|The Blastocladiomycota were {{previously}} considered a taxonomic clade within the Chytridiomycota. Recent <b>molecular</b> <b>data</b> and ultrastructural characteristics, however, place the Blastocladiomycota as a sister clade to the Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The blastocladiomycetes are saprotrophs, feeding on decomposing organic matter, {{and they are}} parasites of all eukaryotic groups. Unlike their close relatives, the chytrids, most of which exhibit zygotic meiosis, the blastocladiomycetes undergo sporic meiosis.|$|E
5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain. They were initially placed in the ratites due to their peculiar, flightlessness-related apomorphies, and a relationship to the Rallidae has also been suggested. Osteological and <b>molecular</b> <b>data,</b> however, agrees that placement in the Columbidae is more appropriate.

5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. <b>Molecular</b> <b>data</b> imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E
5|$|Durio {{is often}} {{included}} in Bombacaceae {{because of the}} presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using <b>molecular</b> <b>data</b> found that the tribe Durioneae should actually be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesize that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the dodo and the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} {{were placed in}} a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was placed in its own monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had evolved their similar features independently. Osteological and <b>molecular</b> <b>data</b> has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, in the family Columbidae.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 {{study by}} Chase et al. {{referred}} to above, {{which was the}} largest yet to use purely <b>molecular</b> <b>data,</b> the results demonstrated paraphyly of the lilioids. However, because their data contradicted purely morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to the monophyly of this group. They identified four major clades of monocots. They named these alismatids, aroids, stemonoids and dioscoreoids, in addition to Acorus, and {{a core group of}} Asparagales, Liliales and commelinoids. They based the names of these groups on the closest corresponding superorders and orders of Dahlgren, with the exception of stemonoids (based on Stemonaceae for which there was no obvious equivalent).|$|E
5|$|Its closest {{relatives}} may be O.concolor {{from the}} northern Amazon rainforest, including northwestern Brazil, southern Venezuela, and eastern Colombia, and O.mamorae from Bolivia, Paraguay, nearby Brazil, and possibly northeastern Argentina. The three share a particular configuration of the arteries in the head known as the derived carotid arterial circulatory pattern, which is unique within the genus Oecomys, and a general similarity in other traits. However, O.sydandersoni differs from the other two in characters of the fur and in metric characters.

5|$|Sirenians are {{classified}} within the cohort Afrotheria in the clade Paenungulata, alongside Proboscidea (elephants), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Embrithopoda, Desmostylia, and Afroinsectiphilia. This clade was first established by George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 based on anatomical evidence, such as testicondy and similar fetal development. The Paenungulata, {{along with the}} Afrotheria, {{are one of the}} most well-supported mammalian clades in molecular phylogeny. Sirenia, Proboscidae, and Desmotylia are grouped together in the clade Tethytheria. Based on morphological similarities, Tethytheria, Perissodactyla, and Hyracoidea were considered to be grouped together as the Altungulata, but this has been invalidated by <b>molecular</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} (especially the sister species, Pinguinus alfrednewtoni) and {{molecular}} evidence {{show that the}} three closely related genera diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout Xantus's murrelet, had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. Apparently, by that time, the murres, or Atlantic guillemots, already had split from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the Pliocene, but {{the evolution of the}} little auk is sparsely documented. The <b>molecular</b> <b>data</b> are compatible with either possibility, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the great auk in a distinct genus. Some ornithologists still believe it is more appropriate to retain the species in the genus Alca. It is the only recorded British bird made extinct in historic times.|$|E
5|$|The rise of {{molecular}} techniques {{at the end}} of the 20th century prompted new evolutionary hypotheses that were different from ones founded on skeletal data. Results {{of molecular}} studies explained a variety of aspects of the evolutionary biology of the Scleractinia, including connections between and within extant taxa, and supplied support for hypotheses about extant corals that are founded on the fossil record. The 1996 analysis of mitochondrial RNA undertaken by American zoologists Sandra Romano and Stephen Palumbi found that <b>molecular</b> <b>data</b> supported the assembling of species into the existing families, but not into the traditional suborders. For example, some genera affiliated with different suborders were now located on the same branch of a phylogenetic tree.

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or <b>molecular</b> <b>data</b> extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect. Verbascum depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum (black or dark mullein), Verbascum lychnitis (white mullein) and Verbascum sinuatum (wavy-leaved mullein).|$|E

A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be basal to the four fish eagles (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus Ichthyophaga).|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Danish naturalist Erik Pontoppidan in 1763, the red-throated loon is a monotypic species, with no distinctive subspecies despite its large Holarctic range. Pontoppidan initially placed the {{species in the}} now-defunct genus Colymbus, which contained grebes as well as loons. By 1788, German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera, and moved the red-throated loon (along with all other loon species) to its present genus. Its relationship to the four other loons is complex; although all {{belong to the same}} genus, it differs more than any of the others in terms of morphology, behaviour, ecology and breeding biology, and may be the basal lineage of the genus. It is thought to have evolved in the Palearctic, and then to have expanded into the Nearctic. Analysis of <b>molecular</b> <b>data</b> together with the fossil record suggests the lineage of the red-throated loon diverged from that giving rise to the other loon species around 21.4 million years ago in the Miocene. It is also most closely related to the fossil Pliocene species Gavia howardae.|$|E
