By altering dislocation density, impurity levels, grain size (in crystalline materials), the yield strength of the material can be fine tuned. This occurs typically by introducing defects such as impurities dislocations in the material. To move this defect (plastically deforming or yielding the material), a larger stress must be applied.

For example, Modified starch is created when the morphological or physico-chemical structure of native starch is disrupted in some way, such as in food preparation.

50|$|Magnetic {{pulse welding}} {{is based on}} a very short {{electromagnetic}} pulse (<100µs), which is obtained by a fast discharge of capacitors through low inductance switches into a coil. The pulsed current with a very high amplitude and frequency (500kA and 15 kHz) produces a high-density magnetic field, which creates an eddy current in one of the work pieces. Repulsive Lorentz forces are created and a high magnetic pressure well beyond the <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> strength causing acceleration and one of the work pieces impacts onto the other part with a collision velocity up to 500 m/s.|$|E
50|$|Impact strength, is the {{capability}} of the material to withstand a suddenly applied load and is {{expressed in terms of}} energy. Often measured with the Izod impact strength test or Charpy impact test, both of which measure the impact energy required to fracture a sample. Volume, modulus of elasticity, distribution of forces, and yield strength affect the impact strength of a material. In order for a material or object to have a high impact strength the stresses must be distributed evenly throughout the object. It also must have a large volume with a low modulus of elasticity and a high <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> strength.|$|E
50|$|The {{neutral line}} (also called the neutral axis) is an {{imaginary}} line {{that can be}} drawn through the cross-section of the workpiece that represents the locus where no tensile nor compressive stresses are present on the work.

In the bend region, the material between the neutral line and the inside radius will be under compression during the bend. The material between the neutral line and the outside radius will be under tension during the bend.|$|E

50|$|In {{mechanics}} of material, {{the strength of}} a material is its ability to withstand an applied load without failure or plastic deformation.The field of strength of materials deals with forces and deformations that result from their acting on a material.A load applied to a mechanical member will induce internal forces within the member called stresses when those forces are expressed on a unit basis. The stresses acting on the material cause deformation of the material in various manners. Deformation of the material is called strain when those deformations too are placed on a unit basis. The applied loads may be axial (tensile or compressive), or rotational (strength shear). The stresses and strains that develop within a mechanical member must be calculated in order to assess the load capacity of that member. This requires a complete description of the geometry of the member, its constraints, the loads applied to the member and the properties of the material of which the member is composed. With a complete description of the loading and the geometry of the member, the state of stress and of state of strain at any point within the member can be calculated. Once the state of stress and strain within the member is known, the strength (load carrying capacity) of that member, its deformations (stiffness qualities), and its stability (ability to maintain its original configuration) can be calculated. The calculated stresses may then be compared to some measure of the strength of the member such as its <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> or ultimate strength. The calculated deflection of the member may be compared to a deflection criteria that is based on the member's use. The calculated buckling load of the member may be compared to the applied load. The calculated stiffness and mass distribution of the member may be used to calculate the member's dynamic response and then compared to the acoustic environment in which it will be used.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{fabricate}} superconducting coated conductors with lower cost, fabrication processes are required high <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> We report an {{improvement of the}} <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> of YBCO films prepared by inside-plume Nd:YAG pulsed laser deposition method on metal substrates with an architecture of CeO 2 /LMO/IBAD-MgO/GZO/HastelloyTM. In this study, we shortened {{a distance from the}} target to the substrate (dT-S) in order to improve the <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> Additionally, we have used Nd:YAG laser because initial and running costs are anticipated to be lower than those of excimer laser. As a result, by shorting the dT-S from 40 mm to 20 mm, the <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> increased on 10 mm× 10 mm substrates. Additionally, by changing the O 2 pressure (PO 2) from 40 Pa to 400 Pa at dT-S = 20 mm, the <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> had a local maximal value of 18. 6 % at PO 2 = 200 Pa.

However, the critical current density (Jc) of the YBCO film which was deposited at dT-S = 20 mm and PO 2 = 200 Pa on the 10 mm× 10 mm substrate was 1. 2 MA/cm 2 at the edges and 0. 2 MA/cm 2 at the center at 77 K in self-field, although the YBCO films showed good aligned crystal textures. In order to improve this non-uniformity, we tilted the surface normal of the target 15 degree from a line connecting target and substrate. As a result, we achieved the uniformity in deposition rate. Then, we prepared YBa 1. 78 Cu 2. 9 Oy target to fabricate YBCO films with stoichiometric composition and obtained the uniform-high Jc...|$|E

40|$|For severe muscle damage, tissue {{engineering}} {{has become a}} viable option to culture muscle tissues with {{the ultimate goal of}} implantation. However, the tissues are typically cultured on permanent scaffolds which would elicit a foreign body response if placed in the body. To avoid this, biological scaffolds are ideal for tissue culture and limiting any negative reactions. A sacrificial scaffold can be used to gather extracellular matrix (ECM), which can then be used as the primary scaffold for culturing tissues for implantation. To reach the ultimate goal of implanting muscle tissue, an understanding of how to produce ECM on a larger scale must also be gained. Supplementing culture media with pro-fibrotic molecules is an option to consider for enhancing ECM formation. Two conditions, molecular crowding and the addition of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î² 1), were considered. In addition, the effect of the concentration of TGF-Î² 1 on <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> was also analyzed. In the first experiment, molecular crowding macromolecules, TGF-Î² 1, and a control with no additives were considered.. For the second experiment, concentrations of TGF-Î² 1 at 0. 5, 1, and 5 ng/mL were added to culture media and <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> was compared to a control set with no TGF-Î² 1. Cells were cultured for three weeks on sacrificial scaffolds under varied culture conditions, the scaffolds were removed, and the mass of ECM collected was measured. The material yields were then analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression. The results from the first experiment indicated that neither molecular crowding nor TGF-Î² 1 increase the <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> In the second experiment, it appeared that the addition of TGF-Î² 1 at all concentrations increased <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> This could indicate even less TGF-Î² 1 could be added to culture media to increase <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> Additionally, the amount of fetal bovine serum (FBS) added to the culture media was different between the two experiments, which could explain the conflicting results regarding the effect of TGF-Î² 1 on <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> in the two experiments.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} significant crystallisation results obtained with purified metallurgical grade silicon {{in the framework of}} the French Photosil project. Especially we show that in case of a high Boron concentration in the feedstock (> 2. 10 17 cm- 3), the higher the compensation level is, the higher the solar cells efficiency will be. Several ingots were crystallised with different concentrations of boron and phosphorus and the best solar cell efficiency (15. 2 %) was obtained with the highest compensated ingot. Moreover we show that this performance improvement is due to an increase of carrier lifetime which largely counterbalances the decrease of carrier mobilities, likely caused by scattering effect of ionized dopants. However, due to the different segregation coefficients of the major dopant atoms, Boron and Phosphorus, compensated multi-c Silicon ingots often show n-type regions, decreasing the overall <b>material</b> <b>yield.</b> Based on these findings, we suggest a novel concept of doping engineering, allowing a control of the compensation level through the entire ingot height, by introducing a well defined mix of dopant atoms (B, P and Ga) to the silicon before crystallisation. This can lead {{at the same time to}} a higher electrical performance and a higher <b>material</b> <b>yield</b> of the crystallised Silicon.
