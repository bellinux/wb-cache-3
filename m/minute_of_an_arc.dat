50|$|The Arab, Arabic, or Arabian mile (الميل, al-mīl) was a {{historical}} Arabic unit of length. Its precise length is disputed, lying between 1.8 and 2.0 km. It {{was used by}} medieval Arab geographers and astronomers. The predecessor of the modern nautical mile, it extended the Roman mile to fit an astronomical approximation of 1 <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> of latitude measured along a north-south meridian. The distance between two pillars whose latitudes differed by 1 degree in a north-south direction was measured using sighting pegs along a flat desert plane.|$|E
50|$|Thus, polar {{twilight}} {{is limited}} to latitudes more than 66.5 degrees from the equator, in other words, north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle. In fact, on either one of these circles, {{at least half of}} the sun's disc will still be above the horizon at midday all year round, and because of refraction even more will be visible. For the sun to be completely invisible at midday one would have to be about 50 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> inside the circle (see Sunrise). This also depends on one's elevation and the elevation of the horizon.|$|R
50|$|This {{computation}} of {{the altitude}} and the azimuth needs a haversine table. For <b>a</b> precision <b>of</b> 1 <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc,</b> <b>a</b> four figure table is enough.|$|R
50|$|While the {{traditional}} thin crossing lines are {{the original and}} still the most familiar cross-hair shape, they are really best suited for precision aiming at high contrast targets, as the thin lines are easily lost in complex backgrounds, such as those encountered while hunting. Thicker bars are much easier to discern against a complex background, but lack the precision of thin bars. The most popular types of cross-hair in modern scopes are variants on the duplex cross-hair, with bars that are thick on the perimeter and thin out in the middle. The thick bars allow the eye to quickly locate {{the center of the}} reticle, and the thin lines in the center allow for precision aiming. The thin bars in a duplex reticle may also be designed {{to be used as a}} measure. Called a 30/30 reticle, the thin bars on such a reticle span 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> (0.5º), which happens to be close to 30 inches at 100 yards. This enables an experienced shooter to deduce (as opposed to guess or estimate) the range within an acceptable error limit.|$|R
40|$|A sealed {{position}} sensitive {{proportional counter}} filled with two atmospheres of 95 % xenon and 5 % methane, and containing <b>a</b> drift region <b>of</b> 24 atm cm, has operated {{in a stable}} manner for many months. The detector contains G- 10 frames to support the anode and cathode wires. The detector was sealed successfully by <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> vacuum baking the G- 10 frames at 150 C for two weeks followed by assembly into the detector in <b>an</b> environment <b>of</b> dry nitrogen, {{and the use of}} passive internal getters. The counter is intended for use with a circumferential cylindrical collimator. Together they provide a very broad field of view detection system with the ability to locate cosmic hard X-ray and soft gamma ray sources to <b>an</b> angular precision <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc.</b> <b>A</b> set <b>of</b> instruments based on this principle have been proposed for satellites to detect and precisely locate cosmic gamma ray bursts...|$|R
50|$|Conversion to {{the angle}} of {{disparity}} dγ is performed by inserting the position difference dz in the formulawhere a is the interocular separation of the observer and z {{the distance of the}} fixed peg from the eye. To transfer dγ into the usual unit <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc,</b> <b>a</b> multiplicative constant c is inserted whose value is 3437.75 (1 radian in arcminutes). In the calculation a, dz and z must be in the same units, say, feet, inches, cm or meters. For the average interocular distance <b>of</b> 6.5 cm, <b>a</b> target distance <b>of</b> 6m and <b>a</b> typical stereoacuity <b>of</b> 0.5 <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> arc, the just detectable depth interval is 8 cm. As targets come closer, this interval gets smaller by the inverse square of the distance, so that an equivalent detectable depth interval at ¼ meter is 0.01 cm or the depth of impression of the head on a coin. These very small values of normal stereoacuity, expressed in differences of either object distances, or angle of disparity, makes it a hyperacuity.|$|R
40|$|The {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surface depends dramatically {{on how it}} is illuminated. In {{order to}} interpret properly satellite and aerial imagery, {{it is necessary to}} know the position of the sun in the sky. This is particularly important if this interpretation is to be done in an automated fashion. Techniques using relatively straightforward methods are presented here for calculating the position of the sun with more than enough accuracy. Caution: Do not use this technique for navigational purposes. Correction terms have been omitted; as a result, the ephemeris data calculated may be in error by about one <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc,</b> <b>an</b> amount which is of no significance for the application of this data in image analysis.

40|$|Recent {{improvements}} in the two-meter focusing curved-crystal gamma-ray spectrometer are described which have extended its quantum energy range well above 1 Mev and have also yielded much better luminosity and resolving power than were obtained initially. The improved components are (1) the crystal holder whose aperture and resolving power have been nearly doubled and (2) the collimator the new model of which can now discriminate between the reflected and transmitted beams when these differ in direction by only 8 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>arc,</b> <b>a</b> threefold improvement over our first model. Our plans for further possible improvements and the factors governing these are also discussed. Wavelengths of two gamma-rays emitted following β-decay of Co 60 have been measured with this new equipment using <b>a</b> source <b>of</b> about 50 mc strength and found to have values of (9. 308 ± 0. 005) × 10 - 11 cm and (10. 580 ± 0. 005) × 10 - 11 cm corresponding to quantum energies of 1. 3316 ± 0. 0010 Mev and 1. 1715 ± 0. 0010 Mev, respectively. The lines appear to have equal intensities. The integrated reflection coefficient of the (310) planes of the curved-quartz crystal still appears to follow a λ 2 -dependence on wave-length down to 9 x. u. the shortest so far observed. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The shapes <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> and {{scoliosis}} are the same. Therefore, {{the geometry}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> can reveal {{the relationship between}} the angles within and around a scoliotic spine. OBJECTIVE: To look for angles which are functions of the geometry <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> and can also be used for assessment of curve progression in scoliosis. DESIGN: Review of the geometry <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> and that <b>of</b> scoliosis. METHOD: English literature on scoliosis (from 1930 to date), searched manually, via Internet and from colleagues, was reviewed. RESULTS: Methods of curve measurement in use presently are functions of the geometry of scoliosis. Three additional methods are proposed for assessment of curve progression in scoliosis. These methods are geometrically related with the previously known ones. CONCLUSION: All methods of assessment of curve progression in scoliosis are fundamentally the same and interchangeable. There is no reason for preference of one method over another method of curve measurement...|$|R

40|$|The motion <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> plasma in <b>a</b> {{quenching}} chamber has {{a significant}} influence on the interruption performance of low-voltage switching devices (LVSDs).

This paper presents <b>a</b> numerical model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> plasma in LVSDs, which can reduce complexity and calculation load <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> simulation by avoiding fully coupled modelling between fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism. There are two steps in the proposed arc modelling; {{the first is the}} finite element analysis of Lorentz force generated by nonlinear ferromagnetic material and current path in a quenching chamber, the second is the finite volume analysis of arc motion with consideration for fluid dynamics and heat transfer. This arc modelling also takes into account a contact motion, potential drops in the sheath layers of splitter plates and plasma radiation. It is shown that the simulated result has a similar trend with experimental data in terms of the arc motion as well as current and voltage waveforms...|$|R
