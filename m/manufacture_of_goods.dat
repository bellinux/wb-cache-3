The Fairey Aviation Company of Hayes, Middlesex, received large contracts for military aircraft and sought a dispersed factory site. They therefore took over the Heaton Chapel facilities in early 1935 and constructed further production buildings. Nearly 4,400 new aircraft were built at the factory between 1936 and 1958 and assembled at test flown at the nearby Ringway Airport.|$|E

Sales dropped to pre-war levels. The worldwide economic crisis and the situation in Germany affected HASAG as well, as workers continually found their remuneration to be inadequate. By 1930, HASAG had 1,000 employees and annual sales of 5 million Reichsmarks, {{but this was a}} drop from previous levels. In October 1931, the company reported that sales were down nearly 15 percent and the company's value had dropped by nearly 30 percent. The board sought changes in company management and on October 1, 1931, Paul Budin was brought in.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the breakup}} of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire {{in the region of}} middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, {{building}} his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship. By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and Gobir – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> Until the fifteenth century, these small states were {{on the periphery of the}} major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.|$|E

2500|$|But Meyer also {{generated}} {{a great deal}} of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program, and forced the resignations of Herbert Bayer, Marcel Breuer, and other long-time instructors. Even though Meyer shifted the orientation of the school further to the left than it had been under Gropius, he didn't want the school to become a tool of left-wing party politics. He prevented the formation of a student communist cell, and in the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse fired him in the summer of 1930. The Dessau city council attempted to convince Gropius to return as head of the school, but Gropius instead suggested Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Mies was appointed in 1930, and immediately interviewed each student, dismissing those that he deemed uncommitted. Mies halted the school's <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> so that the school could focus on teaching. Mies appointed no new faculty other than his close confidant Lilly Reich. By 1931, the National Socialist German Workers' Party [...] (Nazi Party) was becoming more influential in German politics. When they gained control of the Dessau City Council they moved to close the school.|$|E
6000|$|I {{would suggest}} to Congress {{the propriety of}} readjusting the tariff so as to {{increase}} the revenue, {{and at the same}} time decrease the number of articles upon which duties are levied. Those articles which enter into our manufactures and are not produced at home, it seems to me, should be entered free. Those articles of manufacture which we produce a constituent part of, but do not produce the whole, that part which we do not produce should enter free also. I will instance fine wool, dyes, etc. These articles must be imported to form a part of the manufacture of the higher grades of woolen goods. Chemicals used as dyes, compounded in medicines, and used in various ways in manufactures come under this class. The introduction free of duty of such wools as we do not produce would stimulate the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> requiring the use of those we do produce, and therefore would be a benefit to home production. There are many articles entering into [...] "home manufactures" [...] which we do not produce ourselves the tariff upon which increases the cost of producing the manufactured article. All corrections in this regard are in the direction of bringing labor and capital in harmony with each other and of supplying one of the elements of prosperity so much needed.|$|E
