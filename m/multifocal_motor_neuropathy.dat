30|$|MR imaging: We used a 3 -T MRI scanner with a {{dedicated}} protocol for visualisation of the radial nerve. T 1, T 2 fat-saturated and proton density (PD) fat-saturated sequences were acquired with a slice thickness of 3  mm and interslice gap of 0.3  mm. Gadolinium-based contrast {{was used for}} post-contrast images if required. Knowledge of the anatomical relations of the radial nerve is necessary to identify the nerve in its short axis. T 1 -weighted images allow clear visualisation of the nerve in its short axis as the peripheral rim of fat in the nerve sheath appears hyperintense while the fascicles appear as dots, hypointense to the surrounding muscles. Epineurial or perineurial fat remains bright on T 2 -weighted imaging (T 2 WI) which can mask pathological changes in the nerves. Fat suppression is thus needed for identification of pathological segment of nerve on T 2 and PD sequences [19, 20]. Focal enlargement, hyperintensity and altered fascicular patterns are signs of pathology in the nerve. Nerve hyperintensity may be seen secondary to autoimmune or <b>multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathies</b> and requires clinical co-relation. The denervated muscles begin to appear hyperintense on T 2 -weighted images  48  h after nerve injury. These changes are seen in axonotmetic and neurotmetic injuries. MRI may not clearly differentiate between disruption injuries and contusion of the nerve [21]. Muscle atrophy and persistent hyperintensity is seen in failure of regeneration [20]. Fatty infiltration is seen in chronic denervation. Orthopaedic implants may limit the use of MRI due to susceptibility artefacts.|$|R

50|$|<b>Multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> (MMN) is a {{progressively}} worsening condition where {{muscles in}} the extremities gradually weaken. The disorder, a pure motor neuropathy syndrome, is sometimes mistaken for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) because of the similarity in the clinical picture, especially if muscle fasciculations are present.

50|$|Viral {{infectious}} {{diseases such as}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), Lyme disease, syphilis and tick-borne encephalitis can in some cases cause ALS-like symptoms.

40|$|The {{conduction}} block (CB) of {{the nerve}} impulses in the {{peripheral nervous system}} induces a partial or complete loss of the nerve function, usually more marked on the motor fibers. The CB {{is due to a}} focal loss of the electrical properties of the nerve fibers. The underlying mechanisms include paranodal and segmental demyelination, and physical or chemical dysfunction of the ionic channels. The electrophysiological study allows distinction of axonal lesion from dysfunction due to CB. Recognition and quantification of the CB requires criteria that are not yet widely accepted. The different modalities of the examination are detailed and the criteria are discussed. The peripheral neuropathies with CB have different aetiologies; physical (electrical, thermal, percussion, compression or constriction injuries, radiation-induced), toxic (acting either on the axon or the myelin), more rarely ischaemic (arteriopathy or vasculitis), but frequently inflammatory (acute or chronic, primary or secondary) or related to dysimmune states (<b>multifocal</b> sensory-motor and <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathies</b> with persistent CB).

50|$|PMA is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion, there is no specific test which can conclusively establish whether a patient has the condition. Instead, {{a number of other}} possibilities have to be ruled out, such as <b>multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> or spinal muscular atrophy. Tests used in the diagnostic process include MRI, clinical examination, and EMG. EMG tests in patients who do have PMA usually show denervation (neurone death) in most affected body parts, and in some unaffected parts too.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> is {{normally}} treated by receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which can {{in many cases}} be highly effective, or immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Steroid treatment (prednisone) and plasmapheresis are no longer considered to be useful treatments; prednisone can exacerbate symptoms. IVIg is the primary treatment, with about 80% of patients responding, usually requiring regular infusions at intervals of 1 week to several months. Other treatments are considered in case of lack of response to IVIg, or sometimes {{because of the high}} cost of immunoglobulin. Subcutaneous immunoglobulin is under study as a less invasive, more-convenient alternative to IV delivery.|$|E
5000|$|Immunoglobulin {{therapy is}} used {{in a variety of}} conditions, many of which involve {{decreased}} or abolished antibody production capabilities, which range from a complete absence of multiple types of antibodies, to IgG subclass deficiencies (usually involving IgG2 or IgG3 [...] ), to other disorders in which antibodies are within a normal quantitative range, but lacking in quality - unable to respond to antigens as they normally should - resulting in an increased rate or increased severity of infections. In these situations, immunoglobulin infusions confer passive resistance to infection on their recipients by increasing the quantity/quality of IgG they possess. Immunoglobulin therapy is also used for a number of other conditions, including in many autoimmune disorders such as dermatomyositis in an attempt to decrease the severity of symptoms. Immunoglobulin therapy is also used in some treatment protocols for secondary immunodeficiencies such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), some autoimmune disorders (such as immune thrombocytopenia and Kawasaki disease), some neurological diseases (<b>multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy,</b> stiff person syndrome, multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis) some acute infections and some complications of organ transplantation.|$|E

50|$|An {{experiment}} analyzed {{gene expression}} pattern in muscles from patients with {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) and <b>multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> (MMN) compared to controls. Biopsied skeletal muscles from three ALS, three MMN and three control subjects had total RNA extracted and subjected to genome-wide gene expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST array. The most significant expression pattern differences were confirmed with RT-PCR in four additional ALS patients. Results showed that over 3000 genes were identified across the groups using q < 10%. Among 50 genes that were overexpressed only in the ALS group were: leucine-rich repeat kinase-2, follistatin, collagen type XIX alpha-1, ceramide kinase-like, sestrin-3 and CXorf64. No genes were significantly overexpressed in MMN alone. Underexpressed genes only in ALS included actinin αα3, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-2 and homeobox C10; whereas only in MMN: hemoglobin A1 and CXorf64. Ankyrin repeat domain-1 was overexpressed in both groups. Underexpressed genes in both groups included myosin light chain kinase-2, enolase-3 and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase-1. Validation analysis using RT-PCR confirmed the data for leucine-rich repeat kinase-2, follistatin, collagen type XIX alpha-1, ceramide kinase-like, sestrin-3 and CXorf64. In conclusion, there is differential tissue-specific gene expression in patients with ALS relative to MMN and controls. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the identified genes in larger patient groups and different tissues.|$|E

Results At age 44 years, there was weakness and wasting of the left biceps with conduction block in the left musculocutaneous and right ulnar nerves. The left median nerve was inexcitable. The right median, ulnar, and left peroneal nerves developed axonal change (loss of distal compound muscle action potential amplitude) at years 5, 12, and 13.

40|$|Abstract: Intravenous {{immunoglobulins}} (IVIg) {{have been}} shown {{in a number of}} trials, to be an effective treatment for the three main types of inflammatory neuropathies: Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and <b>multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> (MMN). IVIg is thought to exert its immunomodulatory effects by affecting several components of the immune system including B-cells, T-cells, macrophages, complement, cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> is a rare, {{probably}} {{immune mediated}} disorder characterised by slowly progressive, asymmetric, distal weakness {{of one or}} more limbs with no objective loss of sensation. It may cause prolonged periods of disability. The treatment options for <b>multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> are sparse. Patients with <b>multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> do not usually respond to steroids or plasma exchange, and may even worsen with these treatments. Many uncontrolled studies have suggested a beneficial effect of intravenous immunoglobulin. OBJECTIVES: To review systematically the evidence from randomised controlled trials concerning the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin in <b>multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> SEARCH STRATEGY: We used the search strategy of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Review Group to search the Disease Group register (searched September 2003), MEDLINE (January 1990 to September 2003), EMBASE (January 1990 to September 2003) and ISI (January 1990 to September 2003) databases for randomised controlled trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies examining the effects of any dose of intravenous immunoglobulin versus placebo in patients with definite or probable <b>multifocal</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> Outcome measures had to include one of the following: disability, strength, or conduction block. Studies which reported the frequency of adverse effects were used to assess safety. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors reviewed literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials, scored their quality and extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks, and for continuous data, effect sizes and weighted pooled effect sizes. Statistical uncertainty was expressed with 95 % confidence intervals. MAIN RESULTS: Four randomised controlled trials including a total of 34 patients were suitable for this systematic review. Strength improved in 78 % of patients treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and only 4 % of placebo-treated patients. Disability improved in 39 % of patients after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment and in 11 % after placebo (statistically not significantly different). Mild, transient side effects were reported in 71 % of intravenous immunoglobulin treated patients. Serious side effects were not encountered. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that intravenous immunoglobulin has a beneficial effect on strength. There was a non-significant trend towards improvement in disability. More research is needed to discover whether intravenous immunoglobulin improves disability and is cost-effectiv...|$|E
