In this study, we have compared gene editing by different ONs on two new target sequences, the eBFP and the rd 1 mutant photoreceptor betaPDE cDNAs, which were integrated as single copy transgenes {{at the same}} genomic site in 293 T cells. Interestingly, antisense ONs were superior to sense ONs for one target only, showing that target sequence can by itself impart strand-bias in gene editing. The most efficient ONs were short 25 nt ONs with flanking locked nucleic acids (LNAs), a chemistry that had only been tested for targeted nucleotide mutagenesis in yeast, and 25 nt ONs with phosphorothioate linkages. We showed that LNA-modified ONs mediate dose-dependent target modification and analyzed the importance of LNA position and content. Importantly, when using ONs with flanking LNAs, targeted gene modification was stably transmitted during cell division, which allowed reliable cloning of modified cells, a feature essential for further applications in functional genomics and gene therapy. Finally, we showed that ONs with flanking LNAs aimed at correcting the rd 1 stop mutation could promote survival of photoreceptors in retinas of rd 1 mutant mice, suggesting that they are also active in vivo...|$|E

40|$|CONSPECTUS: The {{understanding}} of gene regulation {{and the structure}} and function {{of the human genome}} increased dramatically {{at the end of the}} 20 th century. Yet the technologies for <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> have been slower to develop. For instance, the field of gene therapy has been focused on correcting genetic diseases and augmenting tissue repair for more than 40 years. However, with the exception of a few very low efficiency approaches, conventional genetic engineering methods have only been able to add auxiliary genes to cells. This has been a substantial obstacle to the clinical success of gene therapies and has also led to severe unintended consequences in several cases. Therefore, technologies that facilitate the precise modification of cellular genomes have diverse and significant implications in many facets of research and are essential for translating the products of the Genomic Revolution into tangible benefits for medicine and biotechnology. To address this need, in the 1990 s, we embarked on a mission to develop technologies for engineering protein−DNA interactions with the aim of creating custom tools capable of targeting any DNA sequence. Our goal has been to allow researchers to reach into genomes to specifically regulate, knock out, or replace any gene. To realize these goals, we initially focused on understanding and manipulating zinc finger proteins. In particular, we sought to create a simple an...|$|E

However, the genetic approach, which can result in lineage conversion up to ground pluripotent embryonic state, will certainly face strict regulatory constraints and consequently translation to the clinic may be difficult. Manipulating stem cell fate without altering the genome of adult stem cells is a promising alternative. My laboratory has demonstrated that non hairy squamous epithelia e. g. the cornea, the oral cavity, the oesophagus, the vagina, contain clonogenic stem cells that can respond to skin morphogenetic signals and form epidermis, cycling hair follicles and sebaceous glands. This capacity is maintained in serial transplantation, crosses primary germ line boundaries and is intrinsic to the stem cells, as cells which have never been exposed to cell culture behave in a similar fashion. Even more surprising, the thymus contains a population of clonogenic epithelial cells of endodermal origin that maintain a thymic identity in culture and {{have the capacity to}} incorporate into a thymic network, but can acquire the functionality of bona fide multipotent stem cells of the skin when exposed to proper developmental signals. Thymic epithelial cells exposed to a skin microenvironment exhibit a down-regulation or silencing of transcription factors important for thymic function. Hence, it is possible to reveal unsuspected potency and even to robustly reprogram stem cells by solely manipulating the microenvironment...|$|E
40|$|One major {{classical}} {{justification of}} using a model metazoan species for experimentation has been that discoveries of biological phenomena in that species could be extrapolated to other multicellular species. Because the chances that this extrapolation is valid in humans depend on the phylogenetic distance between humans and the model species, many researchers have somewhat sacrificed the major benefits of small size, short generation time and ease of manipulation that characterise some invertebrates {{in order to use}} species that humans can more readily relate to, such as the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus). However, the community of biologists has continued to use additional model species because each of the selected taxa have specific features that make experimental manipulation easier (e. g. easy-to-score morphological variation and giant polytene chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster, or accurate description of the largely invariant complete cell lineage and full neural connectivity in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans). Ever since the molecular genetic revolution, a constant concern has been the possibility of <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> of model species. For example, generations of Drosophila scientists have developed and applied ingenious approaches that allow, in principle, screening for any phenotype at any stage of development (reviewed in St Johnston 2002). Even for the mouse model, multiple techniques, such as homologous recombination, tissue-specific activation/inactivation techniques, cloning and RNA interference (RNAi), have been developed for performing genotype- or phenotype-driven experiments. Furthermore, recent access to full genome sequences makes genome engineering of some model species easier. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

We have characterized TMP as a mutagen for mouse ES cells regarding death rates, mutation frequencies, and mutation spectrum. Allowing for 12. 5 % of cell survival, the mutation frequency at the mouse hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) locus was 3. 5 x 10 (- 5) on average. The characterization of a non-redundant set of 17 Hprt-deficient ES clones revealed that only 12 % of clones contained genomic deletions and almost 50 % were point mutations. Base substitutions were mostly transversions and all affected AT base pairs. We conclude that the mutation spectrum of TMP in mouse ES cells is different from that observed in C. elegans and E. coli.

Realizing these goals will require the extensive reengineering of cells, which will be a formidable task due both to our incomplete understanding of the cell at the systems level and to the technical difficulty of <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>genome</b> on a large scale. In Chapter 1, we begin by discussing the potential of directed evolution approaches to overcome the challenges of cell engineering. We then cover the methodologies that are emerging to adapt the mutagenesis and selection steps of directed evolution for in vivo, multi-component systems. Yeast hybrid assays provide versatile systems for coupling a function of interest to a high-throughput growth selection for directed evolution. In Chapter 2, we develop an experimental framework to characterize and optimize the performance of yeast two- and three-hybrid growth selections. Using the LEU 2 reporter gene as a model selectable marker, we show that quantitative characterization of these assay systems allows us to identify key junctures for optimization. In Chapter 3, we apply the same systematic characterization to the yeast three-hybrid counter selection, beginning with our previously reported URA 3 reporter. We further develop a screening approach to identify effective new yeast three-hybrid counter selection reporters. Installing customized multi-gene pathways in the cell is arguably {{the first step of}} any cell engineering endeavor. Chapter 4 describes the design, construction, and initial validation of Reiterative Recombination, a robust in vivo DNA assembly method relying on homing endonuclease-stimulated homologous recombination. Reiterative Recombination elongates constructs of interest in a stepwise manner by employing pairs of alternating, orthogonal endonucleases and selectable markers. We anticipate that Reiterative Recombination will be a valuable tool for a variety of cell engineering endeavors because it is both highly efficient and technically straightforward. As an initial application, we illustrate Reiterative Recombination's utility in the area of metabolic engineering in Chapter 5. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can build functional biosynthetic pathways and generate large libraries of pathways in vivo.

C. burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen that is able to gain entry into and replicate within the host cell phagolysosome. How the bacterium is able to adapt to this harsh, acidic environment is not well understood, and is the focus of our laboratory. Many of the methods used for the elucidation of genetic information about organisms, including homologous recombination, transposon mutagenesis, and the use of reporter expression systems have not been feasible for intracellular bacteria {{because of the lack of}} genetic exchange techniques. Because of these limitations, researchers have used E. coli as a surrogate host for gene expression to characterize C. burnetii proteins. The generation of efficient and effective methods to introduce DNA into C. burnetii would enable definition and characterization of various genetic factors, such as key virulence mechanisms, gene expression and regulation, and promoter function. First, we attempted to construct a shuttle vector using the putative origin of replication for the endogenous plasmid, QpH 1. The second aspect of this work was to adapt the published methods of transformation and selection into our lab in order to test the applicability of this method. Third, to improve this transformation strategy, and to provide a more efficient shuttle vector, we tried to add a visual screenable marker to the plasmid, pSKO(+) 1000, to facilitate early detection and selection of transformed organisms. The fourth component was to develop a practical application of the transformation system.

This has exciting implications {{for the study of}} inflammatory diseases. We have established a model of inflammation in the zebrafish tail, in which caspase dependent cell death is required for resolution. For example, addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVD added at 4 hours after tailfin injury increases the number of neutrophils present from 6. 0 +/- 1. 0 to 28. 9 +/- 3. 3 (mean +/- s. e. m. p, 0. 001 n 53). The transparency of the larvae makes these an ideal model for the study of in vivo inflammation, and we have generated fluorescent systems for the easy visualisation of neutrophilic inflammation and resolution in vivo. We are also performing an unbiased forward genetic screen for mutants with defective resolution of inflammation, and to date have identified 38 putative mutants. These techniques allow new approaches to understanding the molecular controls of inflammation resolution...|$|R
