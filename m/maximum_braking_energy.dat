25|$|Still-larger discs {{are used}} for {{railroad}} cars and some airplanes. Passenger rail cars and light rail vehicles often use disc brakes outboard of the wheels, which helps ensure a free flow of cooling air. However, on some modern passenger rail cars, such as the Amfleet II cars, inboard disc brakes are used. This reduces wear from debris, and also provides protection from rain and snow, which would make the discs slippery, and unreliable. However, there is still plenty of cooling for reliable operation. In contrast, some airplanes have the brake mounted with very little cooling and the brake gets quite hot in a stop, but this is acceptable as there is then time for cooling, and where the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> is very predictable.|$|E

In this paper, a control for recovery of braking energy in Electric Vehicles (EVs) with electro hydraulic brake (EHB) is proposed, which makes the recovery transfer to the electric hydraulic pump of EHB directly, rather than being stored statically in the battery. An energy flow strategy was designed for the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> recovery based on this control.

40|$|Transport-category or FAR/CS 25 {{certified}} airplanes may occasionally become {{braking energy}} capacity limited. Such limitation may exist when heavy airplanes are departing airports at high-density altitudes, on relatively long runways, and/or possibly with some tailwind component. A <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> VMBE speed exists which may limit the maximum allowable takeoff decision/action speed V 1. The ever-existing possibility of high-speed rejected takeoff in such conditions may also limit the airplane gross weight for declared available distances. To gain deeper insights and acquire {{better understanding of}} the topic, a theoretical model of the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> and the related VMBE speed for T-category airplanes was developed. The total kinetic energy of an airplane includes translational and rotary kinetic energy and the potential height-energy component for sloped runways. Time-dependent airplanes’ mechanical power expression has been derived. Weight transfer during dynamic braking has been implemented in the full nonlinear model. Added mass due to rotary inertia of spinning components has been incorporated and assumed constant. The brakes thermal model is based on a lumped-parameter analysis of ventilated brake rotors and stators; the thermal model is based on a small Biot-number approximation and sufficiently well describes the physics of friction braking. The nonlinear differential equations of motion and the differential thermal model are coupled. A nonlinear model incorporating a set of ordinary differential equations with tire slip can be solved numerically. This model enables determination of the entire history of translational and angular accelerations and speeds, longitudinal distance, forces, torque, and disc temperature during braking. A simpler model assuming constant physical and thermodynamic parameters is solved analytically for constant negative acceleration. This linear analytical model {{has been used as a}} workhorse method in our calculations. A new semi-empirical expression of temperature-dependent friction coefficient on brake rotor-stator pairs has been proposed. A theoretical model of <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> speed VMBE, which includes density-altitude, runway slope, and wind effects as parameters, has been developed for the first time to the best of our knowledge. A comparison of the theoretical VMBE model showed good agreement with measured and approved data for the B 737 - 400 airplane at different density altitudes with and without, individual and combined, runway slope and tailwind effects. Results for new and fully worn brakes were obtained showing the effect of elevated temperatures on brake fade and consequently braking time and distance...|$|E

40|$|The major {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to propose a Fuzzy Logic Global Power Management Strategy for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) that are driven by the PM-EVT (PM machine—Electric Variable Transmission) powertrain, such that the PM-EVT will have superior advantages over other types of powertrains, including the current Toyota Prius powertrain for series-parallel HEVs. This has been investigated throughout three aspects. The first is the optimum power splitting between the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and the PM-EVT. The second is maximizing the vehicle’s energy capture during the braking process. Finally, sustaining the State of Charge (SOC) of the battery is adopted by a robust ON/OFF controller of the ICE. These goals have been accomplished by developing three fuzzy logic (FL) controllers. The FL controllers are designed based on the state of charge of the battery, vehicle’s velocity, traction torque, and the vehicle’s requested power. The integration of the studied system is accomplished via the Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) simulation model strategy based on the software Matlab/Simulink. The PM-EVT based HEV system with the proposed power management strategy is validated by comparing to the Toyota Prius HEV. The vehicle’s performances have been analyzed throughout a combined long-trip driving cycle that represents the normal and the worst operating conditions. The simulation results show that global control system is effective to control the engine’s operating points within the highest efficiency region, exploiting of EVT machines for capturing <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>energy,</b> as well as to sustain the SOC of the battery while satisfy the drive ability. The proposed control strategy for the studied HEVs sounds interesting and feasible as supported by a large amount of simulation results...|$|E
40|$|As {{people have}} begun to pay more {{attention}} to energy conservation and emission reduction in recent years, anti-idling has become a growing concern for automobile engineers due to the low efficiency and high emissions caused by engine idling, i. e., the engine is running when the vehicle is not moving. Currently, different technologies and products have emerged in an effort to minimize engine idling. By studying and comparing most of these methods, the conclusion can be drawn that there is still much room to improve existing anti-idling technologies and products. As a result, the optimized Regenerative Auxiliary Power System (RAPS) is proposed. Service vehicles usually refer to a class of vehicles that are used for special purposes, such as public buses, delivery trucks, and long-haul trucks. Among them, there are vehicles with auxiliary devices such as air conditioning or refrigeration (A/C-R) systems that are essential to be kept running regardless of the vehicle motion. In addition, such auxiliary systems usually account for a large portion of fuel from the tank. Food delivery trucks, tourist buses, and cement trucks are examples of such service vehicles. As a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, these vehicles sometimes have to frequently idle to for example keep people comfortable, and keep food fresh on loading and unloading stops. This research is intended to develop and implement a novel RAPS for such service vehicles with the A/C-R system as the main auxiliary device. The proposed RAPS can not only electrify the auxiliary systems to achieve anti-idling but also use regenerative braking energy to power them. As the main power consuming device, the A/C-R system should be treated carefully in terms of its efficiency and performance. Thus, the developments of an advanced controller for A/C-R system to minimize energy consumption and an optimum power management system to maximize the overall efficiency of the RAPS are the primary objectives of this thesis. In this thesis, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed based on a new A/C-R simplified model to minimize the power consumption while meeting the temperature requirements. The controller is extensively validated under both common and frosting conditions. Meanwhile, after integrating the RAPS into a service vehicle, its powertrain turns into a parallel hybrid system due to the addition of an energy storage system (ESS). For the sake of maximizing the overall efficiency, RAPS requires a power management controller to determine the power flow between different energy sources. As a result, a predictive power management controller is developed to achieve this objective, where a regenerative iv braking control strategy is developed to meet the driver’s braking demand while recovering the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> when vehicles brake. For the implementation of the above controllers, a holistic controller of the RAPS is designed to deal with the auxiliary power minimization and power management simultaneously so as to maximize the overall energy efficiency and meet the high nonlinearities and wide operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new braking torque {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative braking system. The braking torque distribution strategy is proposed based on the required braking torque and the regenerative braking system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required braking torque, a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque required for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as the emergency braking and the normal braking. In the case of emergency braking, the required braking torque is to be equal to the overall <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque. In the case of normal braking, the command braking torque {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required braking torque is chosen as the smaller one between the overall <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque and the command braking torque. To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good braking performance when the required braking torque is smaller than the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative braking system, the whole braking torque can be provided by the regenerative braking system; when the required braking torque is bigger than the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative braking system, the whole braking torque can be provided by both the hydraulic braking system and the regenerative braking system, while the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative braking system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time.
