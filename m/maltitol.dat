25|$|Sugar alcohols, such as <b>maltitol,</b> erythritol, sorbitol, {{mannitol}} and hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, are sweeteners made {{by reducing}} sugars.|$|E
25|$|Sugar-free gum {{sweetened}} with xylitol {{has been}} shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as <b>maltitol,</b> aspartame and acesulfame K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of Streptococcus mutans, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits Streptococcus mutans in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.|$|E
25|$|Flavor {{delivery}} is extended throughout the mastication process by timed release of different flavor components {{due to the}} physical-chemical properties of many of chewing gum’s ingredients. Entropy is {{a key player in}} the process of flavor delivery; because some gum components are more soluble in saliva than gum base and because over time flavor components desire to increase their entropy by becoming dispersed in the less ordered system of the mouth than in the more ordered system of the gum bolus, flavor delivery occurs. During the first three to four minutes of the chew, bulking agents such as sugar or sorbitol and <b>maltitol</b> have the highest solubility and, therefore, are chewed out first. As these components dissolve in the consumers’ saliva and slide down the esophagus, they are no longer retained in the gum base or perceived by the chewer. During the next phase of the chew in the four to six minute range, intense sweeteners and some acids are dissolved and chewed out. These components last slightly longer than the bulking agents because they have a slightly lower solubility. Next, encapsulated flavors are released during either 10-15 minute into the chew or after 30–45 minutes. Encapsulated flavors remain incorporated in the gum base longer because the molecules that they are encapsulated in are more easily held within the gum matrix. Finally, during the last phase of the chew, softeners such as corn syrup and glycerin and other textural modifiers are dissolved, resulting in a firming up of the gum {{and the end of the}} chew.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three primary}} {{compounds}} used as sugar substitutes in the United States are saccharin (e.g., Sweet'N Low), aspartame (e.g., Equal, NutraSweet) and sucralose (e.g., Splenda, Altern). <b>Maltitol</b> and sorbitol are often used, frequently in toothpaste, mouth wash, and in {{foods such as}} [...] "no sugar added" [...] ice cream. Erythritol is gaining momentum {{as a replacement for}} these other sugar alcohols in foods as it is much less likely to produce gastrointestinal distress when consumed in large amounts. In many other countries, xylitol, cyclamate, and the herbal sweetener stevia are used extensively.|$|E

50|$|<b>Maltitol</b> is a {{disaccharide}} {{produced by}} hydrogenation of maltose obtained from starch. <b>Maltitol</b> syrup, a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, {{is created by}} hydrogenating corn syrup: a mixture of carbohydrates produced from the hydrolysis of starch; this product contains between 50% and 80% <b>maltitol</b> by weight. The remainder is mostly sorbitol, with a small quantity of other sugar-related substances.|$|E

50|$|Some {{examples}} of toothfriendly sweeteners are: sorbitol, <b>maltitol,</b> isomalt, xylitol, sucralose, stevia, isomaltulose, tagatose and erythritol.|$|E
5000|$|Sugar alcohols, such as <b>maltitol,</b> erythritol, sorbitol, {{mannitol}} and hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, are sweeteners made {{by reducing}} sugars.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other sugar}} {{alcohols}} (with {{the exception of}} erythritol), large quantities of <b>maltitol</b> can have an extremely potent laxative effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Maltitol</b> in its {{crystallized}} form {{measures the}} same (bulk) as table sugar and browns and caramelizes {{in a manner}} {{very similar to that}} of sucrose after liquifying by exposure to intense heat. The crystallized form is readily dissolved in warm liquids (120 °F/48.9 °C and above); the powdered form is preferred if room temperature or cold liquids are used. Due to its sucrose-like structure, <b>maltitol</b> is easy to produce and made commercially available in crystallized, powdered, and syrup forms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Maltitol</b> is a {{sugar alcohol}} (a polyol) {{used as a}} sugar substitute. It has 75-90% of the {{sweetness}} of sucrose (table sugar) and nearly identical properties, except for browning. It is used to replace table sugar because it is half as caloric, does not promote tooth decay, and has a somewhat lesser effect on blood glucose. In chemical terms, <b>maltitol</b> is known as 4-O-α-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol. It is used in commercial products under trade names such as Lesys, Maltisweet and SweetPearl.|$|E
50|$|Fit's is a Japanese {{brand of}} gum {{produced}} by Lotte Group. It contains twelve units of gum in each pack (box). It contains sugar alcohols <b>Maltitol,</b> Mannitol, Erythritol and also Isomaltulose.|$|E
50|$|Both disaccharides and monosaccharides {{can form}} sugar {{alcohols}}; however, sugar alcohols derived from disaccharides (e.g. <b>maltitol</b> and lactitol) {{are not entirely}} hydrogenated because only one aldehyde group is available for reduction.|$|E
50|$|When {{compared}} with other sugar alcohols, it is also {{much more difficult for}} intestinal bacteria to digest, so it is less likely to cause gas or bloating than other polyols, such as <b>maltitol,</b> sorbitol, or lactitol.|$|E
50|$|The only {{sweetening}} agents {{permitted in}} chocolate in Canada {{are listed in}} Division 18 of the Food and Drug Regulations. Artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame potassium, and sugar alcohols (sorbitol, <b>maltitol,</b> etc.) are not permitted.|$|E
50|$|Calorie Control Ice Cream series, {{which uses}} lower-calorie {{sweetening}} agents <b>maltitol</b> and sucralose {{in place of}} sugar and starch syrup often used in ice cream. Tofu {{is also used to}} replace dairy products to lower the amount of calories.|$|E
5000|$|Cape Sweeteners, {{based in}} Durban, is a {{subsidiary}} of Tongaat Hulett Sugar, producing artificial sweeteners including; aspartame, neotame, acesulfame-K, fructose, sodium saccharin, sodium cyclamate, polydextrose, <b>maltitol</b> and lactitol. It is the exclusive South African agent of Nutrasweet's aspartame and neotame ...|$|E
50|$|Maltitol's high {{sweetness}} {{allows it}} to be used without being mixed with other sweeteners. It exhibits a negligible cooling effect (positive heat of solution) in comparison with other sugar alcohols, and {{is very similar to}} the subtle cooling effect of sucrose.It is used in candy manufacture, particularly sugar-free hard candy, chewing gum, chocolates, baked goods, and ice cream. The pharmaceutical industry uses <b>maltitol</b> as an excipient, where it is used as a low-calorie sweetening agent. Its similarity to sucrose {{allows it to}} be used in syrups with the advantage that crystallization (which may cause bottle caps to stick) is less likely. <b>Maltitol</b> may also be used as a plasticizer in gelatin capsules, as an emollient, and as a humectant.|$|E
50|$|FODMAPs {{are short}} chain {{carbohydrates}} that are poorly {{absorbed in the}} small intestine. They include short chain oligo-saccharide polymers of fructose (fructans) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS, stachyose, raffinose), disaccharides (lactose), monosaccharides (fructose), and sugar alcohols (polyols), such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and <b>maltitol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Polyols {{are found}} {{naturally}} in some fruit (particularly stone fruits), including apples, apricots, avocados, blackberries, cherries, lychees, nectarines, peaches, pears, plums, prunes, watermelon and some vegetables, including cauliflower, mushrooms and mange-tout peas. They {{are also used}} as bulk sweeteners and include isomalt, <b>maltitol,</b> mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol.|$|E
5000|$|Sugar-free Jelly Belly jelly {{beans are}} {{sweetened}} with Splenda and <b>Maltitol.</b> The flavors are Buttered Popcorn, Very Cherry, Green Apple, Juicy Pear, Lemon, Licorice, Pineapple, Sizzling Cinnamon, Strawberry, and Tangerine. The Sour Sugar-Free Jelly Belly jelly bean flavors are Sour Apple, Sour Cherry, Sour Grape, Sour Lemon and Sour Orange.|$|E
50|$|Maltisorb is {{a natural}} {{sweetening}} alcohol made by Roquette of France. It {{can be used in}} baking, especially in making fillings for cakes and cookies. It is available in a number of grades, labelled M59, M200 and M40. Maltisorb is a brand name for crystalline <b>maltitol,</b> the formula for which Roquette licenses from Towa Chemical Industry of Japan.|$|E
5000|$|In {{countries}} such as Australia, Canada, Norway, Mexico and New Zealand, <b>maltitol</b> carries a mandatory warning such as [...] "Excessive consumption may have a laxative effect." [...] In the United States, it is a {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) substance, with a recommendation of a warning about its laxative potential when consumed at levels above 100 grams per day.|$|E
5000|$|Lactitol, erythritol, sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, and <b>maltitol</b> are all sugar {{alcohols}}. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies sugar alcohols as [...] "generally {{recognized as}} safe" [...] (GRAS). They are approved as food additives, and {{are recognized as}} not contributing to tooth decay or causing increases in blood glucose. Lactitol is also approved for use in foods in most countries around the world.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their sweetness, some sugar alcohols can produce a noticeable cooling sensation in the mouth when highly concentrated, for instance in sugar-free hard candy or chewing gum. This happens, for example, with the crystalline phase of sorbitol, erythritol, xylitol, mannitol, lactitol and <b>maltitol.</b> The cooling sensation {{is due to the}} dissolution of the sugar alcohol being an endothermic (heat-absorbing) reaction, one with a strong heat of solution.|$|E
50|$|The forty-ninth {{report was}} {{released}} as World Health Organization Technical Report Series No. 884 in 1999. Evaluations {{are presented in}} this report for one antioxidant (tert-butylhydroquinone), two emulsifiers (microcrystalline cellulose and sucrose esters of fatty acids and sucroglycerides), two enzyme preparations (alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase and maltogenic amylase), one flavoring agent (trans-anethole), one glazing agent (hydrogenated poly-1-decene), one sweetening agent (<b>maltitol</b> syrup), and the reduced calorie replacement for conventional fats and oils, salatrim.|$|E
50|$|In the body, most {{erythritol}} {{is absorbed}} into the bloodstream in the small intestine, and then {{for the most part}} excreted unchanged in the urine. About 10% enters the colon. Because 90% of erythritol is absorbed before it enters the large intestine, it does not normally cause laxative effects, as are often experienced after consumption of other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol and <b>maltitol),</b> although extremely large doses can cause nausea and borborygmi (stomach rumbling).|$|E
50|$|Sugar alcohols, a {{class of}} polyols, are {{commonly}} added to foods because of their lower caloric content than sugars; however, they are also, in general, less sweet, and are often combined with high-intensity sweeteners. They are also added to chewing gum {{because they are not}} broken down by bacteria in the mouth or metabolized to acids, and thus do not contribute to tooth decay. <b>Maltitol,</b> sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol, and isomalt are some of the more common types. Sugar alcohols may be formed under mild reducing conditions from their analogue sugars.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three primary}} {{compounds}} used as sugar substitutes in the United States are saccharin (e.g., Sweet'N Low), aspartame (e.g., Equal, NutraSweet) and sucralose (e.g., Splenda, Altern). <b>Maltitol</b> and sorbitol are often used, frequently in toothpaste, mouth wash, and in {{foods such as}} [...] "no sugar added" [...] ice cream. Erythritol is gaining momentum {{as a replacement for}} these other sugar alcohols in foods as it is much less likely to produce gastrointestinal distress when consumed in large amounts. In many other countries, xylitol, cyclamate, and the herbal sweetener stevia are used extensively.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates {{are similar}} to sorbitol: if the starch is {{completely}} hydrolyzed so that only single glucose molecules remain, then after hydrogenation the result is sorbitol. Because in HSHs the starch is not completely hydrolyzed, a mixture of sorbitol, <b>maltitol,</b> and longer chain hydrogenated saccharides (such as maltotriitol) is produced. When no single polyol is dominant in the mix, the generic name hydrogenated starch hydrosylates is used. However, if 50% {{or more of the}} polyols in the mixture are of one type, it can be labeled as [...] "sorbitol syrup", or [...] "maltitol syrup", etc.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} sugars {{can be used}} as {{the fuel}} for rocket candy, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose; however, sucrose is the most common. Sorbitol, a sugar alcohol commonly used as a sweetener in food, produces a less brittle propellant with a slower burn rate. This reduces the risk of cracking propellant grains. Sugars with a double bonded oxygen, such as fructose and glucose, are less thermally stable and tend to caramelize when overheated, but have a lower melting point for ease of preparation. Sugars that only have alcohol groups, like sorbitol, are much less prone to this decomposition. Some other commonly used sugars include erythritol, xylitol, lactitol, <b>maltitol,</b> or mannitol.|$|E
5000|$|Lycasin is a {{trade name}} given by Roquette for {{hydrogenated}} glucose syrup (hydrolysed starch). [...] One {{of the major}} components of Lycasin is <b>maltitol,</b> derived from the hydrogenation of maltose. Depending on the dextrose equivalent (DE) of the syrup used in the hydrolysis, a variety of products can be made, with the name [...] "lycasin" [...] normally being reserved for lycasin 80/55 (80 referring to the dry content and 55 to the dextrose equivalent). The other grades (e.g. 75/60 and 80/33) {{are referred to as}} Polysorb, but {{should not be confused with}} the polyglycolic acid suture of the same name which is produced by a different company.|$|E
50|$|Persipan is a similar, yet less {{expensive}} product, {{in which the}} almonds are replaced by apricot or peach kernels. Many confectionery products sold as marzipan are made from {{less expensive}} materials, such as soy paste and almond essence. To control and detect the authenticity of marzipan, polymerase chain reaction methods can differentiate almonds from substitutes and adulterants at concentrations less than 1%. German marzipan is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste, and French marzipan (called 'massepain') is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup. Some marzipan is flavoured with rosewater. Spanish marzipan is made without bitter almonds. Sugar free marzipan {{can be made by}} replacing sugar with polyols such as <b>maltitol.</b>|$|E
