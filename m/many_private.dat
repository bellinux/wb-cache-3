5|$|After {{ordering}} {{almost all}} civilians {{to leave the}} city in September, Sherman gave instructions that all military and government buildings in Atlanta be burned, although <b>many</b> <b>private</b> homes and shops were burned as well.

2500|$|In the United States Marine Corps, a Lance Corporal is {{sometimes}} referred to jokingly as a [...] "Lance Coolie", due to their often being picked for work details or chosen to perform menial tasks not related to their actual Military Occupational Specialty, especially in units {{that do not have}} <b>many</b> <b>Privates</b> or Privates First Class.|$|R
5|$|Conchology is the {{scientific}} study of mollusc shells, but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe a collector of shells. Many people pick up shells on the beach or purchase them and display them in their homes. There are <b>many</b> <b>private</b> and public collections of mollusc shells, but the largest one in the world is at the Smithsonian Institution, which houses in excess of 20 million specimens.|$|E
5|$|The Clal Center {{enjoyed a}} high {{occupancy}} rate from government offices, businesses, and private companies until the mid-1980s. The construction of Malha Mall and government facilities at Givat Ram precipitated {{the exodus of}} <b>many</b> <b>private</b> and government firms in the 1990s, leaving entire floors of the office tower unoccupied. Stores on the commercial level also began closing {{due to lack of}} customers; as of 2010, many stores were being used as storerooms by Mahane Yehuda Market merchants.|$|E
5|$|The {{other related}} issue {{concerned}} advance-care planning consultation: {{a section of}} the House reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing patient-requested consultations for Medicare recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is covered by <b>many</b> <b>private</b> plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wished to receive. The provision was not included in ACA.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, {{the suburb}} began {{to expand rapidly}} with the {{construction}} of <b>many</b> <b>private</b> homes. Yarralumla's image as a lower-class suburb would persist into the 1960s and 1970s. This general perception began to alter once Lake Burley Griffin had been created and its surrounds landscaped into parklands; the area soon gained a reputation for its attractive lakeside location. During the 1980s, house prices began to rise coincident with a rejuvenation of the suburb. Many of the original government-built monocrete, brick, and weatherboard houses have been demolished and replaced by larger dwellings of a variety of more modern styles and materials.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it had its}} own {{branch line}} into Brookwood Cemetery, most of {{the route of the}} London Necropolis Railway ran on the {{existing}} London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Consequently, a site was selected in Waterloo, near the LSWR's recently opened London terminus at Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo). The building was specifically designed for the use of mourners. It had <b>many</b> <b>private</b> waiting rooms, which could also be used to hold funeral services, and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level. Existing railway arches were used for the storage of bodies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only about}} half of Volubilis has been excavated, a number of {{prominent}} public buildings are still visible and some, notably a basilica and a triumphal arch, have been reconstructed. <b>Many</b> <b>private</b> buildings, including the mansions of the city's elite, have also been uncovered. They are especially notable for the fine mosaics that have been discovered in a number of buildings and which are still in situ in the houses where they were laid. The buildings were mostly made from locally quarried grey-blue limestone. Very little remains of the original Punic settlement, as it lies under the later Roman buildings.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, {{the state}} of New York began {{to take control of}} <b>many</b> <b>private</b> {{highways}} across the state {{under the terms of the}} new highway law developed in 1908. One of these highways was the old north–south stagecoach road from Albany to Canada. Most of the highway north of modern NY8 in Chester became the northern half of Route22, an unsigned legislative route, under the text of the highway law. In 1913, the New York State Legislature created Route22-b, a spur route connecting Route22 in Schroon to the then-village of Ticonderoga. On March1, 1921, Route22-b became part of Route48, a new route created as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative route system. The path of the former Albany–Canada stagecoach route was largely designated as US9 in 1927.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, public schools and <b>many</b> <b>private</b> schools closed, Although no {{mandatory}} evacuations were ordered, multiple shelters were opened in schools and churches and government offices shut down in anticipation of Harvey's onslaught. Several counties issued a state of emergency. Residents prepared individually by, for example, securing boats and lawn furniture. Free sand and sandbags were {{made available to the}} general public and inmates filled bags for those physically unable to do so themselves. Officials at Lake Manatee began lowering the water level to help avoid flooding. In Hillsborough County the threat of the storm forced the cancellation of local football programs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{institutes of}} higher {{education}} teach music in Italy. About 75 music conservatories provide advanced training for future professional musicians. There are also <b>many</b> <b>private</b> music schools and workshops for instrument building and repair. Private teaching is also quite common in Italy. Elementary {{and high school students}} can expect to have one or two weekly hours of music teaching, generally in choral singing and basic music theory, though extracurricular opportunities are rare. Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E

5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. <b>Many</b> <b>private</b> businesses closed as well.|$|E
5|$|The most {{competitive}} undergraduate programs are Medicine with a 0.5% acceptance rate, Architecture and Urbanism with 0.6%, and Communication with 2%. Such high competitivity leads many {{students to take}} preparatory courses during or after the last regular high school year called cursinhos in Portuguese, generally privately offered or managed by some association or organization. <b>Many</b> <b>private</b> cursinhos have special classes focused on highly competitive programs like medicine, making them very expensive. It is common to find students admitted in Medicine, Engineering and other programs {{after several years of}} preparatory courses.|$|E

5|$|Tirunelveli {{is a major}} {{area for}} wind-power generation. Most wind-power-generation units in Tamil Nadu are located in Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari Districts. In 2005 they contributed 2036.9 MW to the state power-generation capacity. <b>Many</b> <b>private,</b> {{multinational}} wind companies are located {{on the outskirts of}} the city. In June 2007 the Tata Group signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government to open a titanium dioxide plant, with an estimated value of 25billion, in Tirunelveli District and Thoothukudi District. However, the state government put the project on hold after increasing protests against it.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty painted <b>many</b> <b>private</b> {{portraits of}} his friends and acquaintances, he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Portraiture was seen as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class. Other than Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E
