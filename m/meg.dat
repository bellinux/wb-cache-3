40|$|Stored {{maternal}} {{factors in}} oocytes regulate oocyte differentiation into embryos during early embryonic development. Before zygotic gene ac-tivation (ZGA), these early embryos are mainly dependent on maternal factors for survival, such as macromolecules and subcellular organelles in oocytes. The genes encoding these essential maternal products {{are referred to}} as maternal effect genes (<b>MEGs).</b> <b>MEGs</b> accumulate maternal factors during oogenesis and enable ZGA, progression of early embryo development, and the initial establishment of embryonic cell lineages. Disruption of <b>MEGs</b> results in defective embryogenesis. Despite their important functions, only a few mammalian <b>MEGs</b> have been identified. In this review we summarize the roles of known <b>MEGs</b> in mouse fertility, with a particular emphasis on oocytes and early embryonic develop-ment. An increased knowledge of the working mechanism of <b>MEGs</b> could ultimately provide a means to regulate oocyte maturation and sub-sequent early embryonic development...|$|R

After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, <b>Meg</b> goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends <b>Meg</b> to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but <b>Meg</b> returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, <b>Meg</b> threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} three decades, Kilburn led the {{development}} of a succession of innovative Manchester computers.

This permitted an order of magnitude increase in the clock rate. To add further speed, Kilburn provided for 10-bit parallel CRT memory. It {{was also one of the}} first computers, if not the first, to have floating point arithmetic. <b>Meg</b> operated for the first time in 1954, and nineteen were sold by Ferranti, six of them to customers overseas.|$|E
