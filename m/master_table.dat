The referential action CASCADE modifies the [...] "behavior" [...] of the (child) table itself where the word CASCADE is used. For example, ON DELETE CASCADE effectively says [...] "When the referenced row is deleted from the other table (<b>master</b> <b>table),</b> then delete also from me". However, the referential action RESTRICT modifies the [...] "behavior" [...] of the <b>master</b> <b>table,</b> not the child table, although the word RESTRICT appears in the child table and not in the <b>master</b> <b>table!</b> So, ON DELETE RESTRICT effectively says: [...] "When someone tries to delete the row from the other table (<b>master</b> <b>table),</b> prevent deletion from that other table (and of course, also don't delete from me, but that's not the main point here)." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{first is}} the 'fan trap'. It occurs {{when you have a}} (<b>master)</b> <b>table</b> linking to {{multiple}} tables in a one-to-many relationship. The issue derives its name from the way the model looks when you draw it in an entity-relationship diagram: the linked tables 'fan out' from the <b>master</b> <b>table.</b> This type of model looks similar to a star schema, a type of model used in data warehouses. When trying to calculate sums over aggregates using standard SQL over the <b>master</b> <b>table,</b> you get unexpected (and incorrect) results. The solution is to either adjust the model or the SQL. This issue occurs mostly in databases for decision support systems, and software that queries such systems sometimes includes specific methods for handling this issue.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{consider}} a database with two tables: a CUSTOMER table that includes all customer data and an ORDER table that includes all customer orders. Suppose the business requires that each order must {{refer to a}} single customer. To reflect this in the database, a foreign key column {{is added to the}} ORDER table (e.g., CUSTOMERID), which references the primary key of CUSTOMER (e.g. ID). Because the primary key of a table must be unique, and because CUSTOMERID only contains values from that primary key field, we may assume that, when it has a value, CUSTOMERID will identify the particular customer which placed the order. However, this can no longer be assumed if the ORDER table is not kept up to date when rows of the CUSTOMER table are deleted or the ID column altered, and working with these tables may become more difficult. Many real world databases work around this problem by 'inactivating' rather than physically deleting <b>master</b> <b>table</b> foreign keys, or by complex update programs that modify all references to a foreign key when a change is needed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently {{the main}} trend in {{providing}} software services has been shifting from an ASP (application service provider) -oriented to a SaaS (software as a service). ASP is a software service {{model in which}} the service is provided on a one by one basis according its ownership, while SaaS is a software service model in which the service is provided virtually on a one by one basis, but physically all at once. In a SaaS environment, all users can access the system via Internet without any software installation—examples include Google and Amazon. Now, more companies are shifting their business software service from ASP to SaaS. However effecting the transition of the existing software and data from ASP to SaaS {{is not an easy}} task. First, we have {{to solve the problem of}} the integration of data for different forms of software, because each data set consists of different data types. Second, the software integration must support a user customizing interface for various users on the Web. Almost all users want customized services, but those require high costs. In this paper we propose a novel method for transferring the existing business software to integrated software that can be used in the SaaS environment. We use a <b>master</b> <b>table</b> and master code to implement the integrated system. The <b>master</b> <b>table</b> is based on the project <b>master</b> <b>table,</b> and other user information tables are connected to collect the necessary information. All information about the project is stored in each column of the project <b>master</b> <b>table.</b> The <b>master</b> <b>table</b> can integrate various software databases. By using this novel methodology, the existing ASP-based software and data can be effectively transferred to the SaaS environment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid sorted table design for {{minimizing}} electronic trading latency, with three main contributions.

40|$|Small {{nucleolar}} RNAs (snoRNAs) {{are involved}} in cleavage of rRNA, modification of rRNA nucleotides and, perhaps, other aspects of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. Scores of snoRNAs have been discovered in recent years from various eukaryotes, and the total number is predicted {{to be up to}} 200 different snoRNA species per individual organism. We have created a comprehensive database for snoRNAs from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which allows easy access to detailed information about each species known (almost 70 snoRNAs are featured). The database consists of three major parts: (i) a utilities section; (ii) a master table; and (iii) a collection of tables for the individual snoRNAs. The utilities section provides an introduction to the database. The <b>master</b> <b>table</b> lists all known S. cerevisiae snoRNAs and their major properties. Information in the individual tables includes: alternate names, size, family classification, genomic organization, sequences (with major features identified), GenBank accession numbers, occurrence of homologues, gene disruption phenotypes, functional properties and associated RNAs and proteins.

40|$|A new {{semi-automatic}} {{method is}} presented to standardize or codify addresses, {{in order to produce}} bibliometric indicators from bibliographic databases. The hypothesis is that this new method is very trustworthy to normalize authors' addresses, easy and quick to obtain. As a way to test the method, a set of already hand-coded data is chosen to verify its reliability: 136, 821 Spanish documents (2006 - 2008) downloaded previously from the Web of Science database. Unique addresses from this set were selected to produce a list of keywords representing various institutional sectors. Once the list of terms is obtained, addresses are standardized with this information and the result is compared to the previous hand-coded data. Some tests are done to analyze possible association between both systems (automatic and hand-coding), calculating measures of recall and precision, and some statistical directional and symmetric measures. The outcome shows a good relation between both methods. Although these results are quite general, this first overview of the address at the institutional sector level {{is a good way to}} develop a second approach for the selection of particular centers. This system has some new features because it provides a method based on the previous non-existence of <b>master</b> <b>tables</b> and it has a certain impact on the automation of tasks.

The implementation is done at primary care level. The input to the model is health care data and output is a decision based on the collaborative approach model. Primary health care centers in a geographical area are transformed into Hub & Spoke type networks.

40|$|Many web {{databases}} {{can be seen}} {{as providing}} partial and overlapping information about entities in the world. To answer queries effectively, it is required to integrate the information about the individual entities that are fragmented over multiple tables. At first blush this is just the inverse of a traditional database normalization problem- the universal relation is to be reconstructed from the given tables (sources). However, the tables maybe missing Primary Key- Foreign Key relations, which leads to technical challenges. It is clear that reconstruction and retrieval of relevant entities will have to involve joining the tables. While tables do share attributes, direct joins over these shared attributes can result in reconstruction of many spurious entities thus seriously compromising precision. This work is aimed at addressing the problem of data integration in such scenarios. To make-up for the missing primary key-foreign key relations, this approach mines and uses attribute dependencies. Such dependencies can both be intra-table and inter-table. Given a query, these dependencies are used to piece together a tree of relevant tables and schemes for joining them. For experimental evaluation, a <b>master</b> <b>table</b> was fragmented horizontally and vertically to generate a set of overlapping tables. A set of randomly generated queries wer...|$|E
40|$|We present multi-wavelength (VRIJHK) {{observations}} of KH 15 D obtained in 2012 / 13, {{as well as}} a <b>master</b> <b>table</b> of standard photometry spanning the years 1967 to 2013. The system is a close, eccentric T Tauri binary embedded in an inclined precessing circumbinary (CB) ring. The most recent data show the continued rise of star B with respect to the trailing edge of the occulting horizon as the system's maximum brightness steadily increases. The wealth of data in time and wavelength domains allows us to track the long-term CCD color evolution of KH 15 D. We find that the V-I behavior is consistent with direct and scattered light from the composite color of two stars with slightly different temperatures. There is no evidence for any reddening or bluing associated with extinction or scattering by ISM-sized dust grains. Furthermore, we probe the system's faint phase behavior at near-infrared wavelengths in order to investigate extinction properties of the ring and signatures of a possible shepherding planet sometimes invoked to confine the CB ring at ~ 5 AU. The wavelength independence of eclipse depth at second contact is consistent with the ring material being fully opaque to 2. 2 microns.
