6000|$|... 'I am la petite Rayonette,' she said, with puzzled {{dignity and}} gravity; 'and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> I have a {{beautiful}} long name of my own besides.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Oh no, she {{is another}} kind of woman altogether,’ <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says,</b> and then spoils the {{compliment}} by adding naîvely, ‘She had but two rooms and I have six.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What we've been {{speaking}} of--his hair. I've heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say,</b> {{when she first}} married him--just shake up my pillow a bit, will you, Mat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{appears to}} be a {{thoroughly}} nice, well-conducted establishment. What would <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say</b> if she could see her Rupert in the midst of these reckless youths!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! {{let me go}} to my own room,' murmured Ferdinand, in a faint voice. 'That {{room where}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> said the day would come--oh! what did <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say?</b> Would there were only mother's love, and then I should not be here or thus.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You couldn't look nicer, miss, if you {{was to try}} ever so. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> as it's housifery as {{recommends}} a girl to the young men. What do you say, John?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Edward, [...] "that cannot be, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says,</b> {{while my}} father is so weakly and ill. But there are the trumpets! you will soon see what will befall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My sister may not visit us, [...] <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> her nay: [...] 265 [...] O Edward! {{you are all}} to me, [...] I {{wish for}} your sake I could be [...] More lifesome and more gay.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{summer day}} that dawned held Claremore as a possibility. And such was my {{capacity}} for joy that my appetite would depart completely when I heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say,</b> questioningly and with proper wifely respect-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Thus did <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say,</b> {{and kissed}} me, [...] And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black, and he from white cloud free, [...] And round the tent of God like lambs we joy, ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I should fear not,' said Arthur. 'I had {{not seen}} or heard of her for some time before I left home, and that is now three years since. She looked very old then, and I {{remember}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>saying</b> she was not fit to come her rounds.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{may as well}} go on with {{it since}} I have begun it,’ <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says,</b> so slyly that my sister and I shake our heads at each other to imply, ‘Was there ever such a woman!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you ought}} not to, and you miss lots of {{pleasant}} times. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> {{we ought to}} be kind and patient and respectful to all old folks just because they are old, and I always mean to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, {{everybody}} does. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> she is {{so sweet}} and so lovely {{that she is not}} like any other child. She says she will be the pride of the village when she grows up; and its idol, too, just as she is now." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{the night}} {{advanced}} the fires became redder and brighter by contrast, the light shone and glittered on the decks, and, as we plied our dirty work, I {{could not help}} thinking, [...] "what would <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say,</b> if she could get a peep at me now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Elizabeth-Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling. [...] "He {{knew your}} disposition--you always were so trusting, father; I've heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say</b> so {{hundreds}} of times--and {{he did it}} to wrong you. After weaning me from you these five years by saying he was my father, {{he should not have}} done this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{call that}} a {{handsome}} thing to do!" [...] said Frank, warmly, for noble actions always pleased him. [...] "I heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say</b> that making good or useful men was the best sort of sculpture, so I think David German may be proud of this piece of work, whether the big statue succeeds or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘But {{those days}} are gone,’ <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> solemnly, ‘gone to come back no more. You’ll put by your work now, man, and have your supper, and then you’ll come up and sit beside your mother for a whiley, for soon you’ll be putting her away in the kirk-yard.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will tell}} you. When we bring the goats {{back to the}} house, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> to you, [...] "I am sure you must be hungry: get a few dates out of the cask," [...] just say to me, [...] "I am not feeling very well, Mohammed, you go and get them for me."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, sir," [...] said Luke, as he {{gave his}} arm to his master, [...] "you'll {{make up your mind}} to't a bit better when you've seen iverything; you'll get used to't. That's what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> about her {{shortness}} o' breath,--she says she's made friends wi't now, though she fought again' it sore when it just come on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{good to be}} alone, [...] I've {{often heard}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say.</b> [...] It makes one selfish, grouchy, cross, [...] And quite unhappy all the day. [...] One needs to think of other folks, [...] And not of just one's self alone, [...] To find the truest happiness, [...] And joy and real content to own.|$|R
5000|$|Gulick {{was born}} in Kansas City, Missouri. According to his autobiography, his {{grandmother}} {{wanted him to be}} named after his father, as Grover Cleveland Gulick, Jr.; but his mother resisted fiercely, and they eventually compromised with Grover C. (only) Gulick, [...] "with <b>my</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>saying</b> I could choose my own middle name when I became old enough to do so." [...] He later acquired the nickname 'Bill'.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I daresay there are,’ <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would <b>say</b> with conviction, ‘but if you {{try that}} plan you will never need to try another.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye'll be gaun yonder, Mr. Patrick; feind o' me will mistryst you for a' <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says.</b> I {{thought it}} best to slip out quietly though, in case she should mislippen {{something}} of what we're gaun to do--we maunna vex her at nae rate--it was amaist the last word my father said to me on his deathbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible," [...] exclaimed Lewis, [...] "the Captain {{is right}} when he observes that we must not part company. As <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says,</b> we are a giddy crew, and will be the better of a little {{scientific}} ballast {{to keep us from}} capsizing into a crevasse. Do come, my dear sir, if it were only out of charity, to keep us in order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! my dear sir, as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says,</b> {{our friends}} are only {{too good to}} us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We may well say that 'our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you {{actually}} saw the letter; well--" ...|$|E
5000|$|They {{used to come}} to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and <b>say,</b> [...] "Oh {{you have}} a {{beautiful}} daughter," [...] and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> used to <b>say</b> [...] "That's my son," [...] and I used to get angry. And I have always been attracted to men. When I was 11 I met someone who's gay and start {{talking to me about}} hormones, which I got very interested in.|$|R
5000|$|At no {{time was}} she forced. She worked in Spain {{with my brother}} in a {{transport}} company. She has lied about me, about <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>saying</b> that she forced her to work.eldest daughter was in Buenos Aires <b>saying</b> that her <b>mother</b> had been mistreated and forced into prostitution in Spain, and that never happened. I can give names of the companies in which she worked and I have a thousand witnesses.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was a most}} disagreeable child, perverse,--cantankerous--I {{can hear}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>saying</b> it! As for the gardens--they have given me {{something}} to do, they have kept me out of mischief. I suppose I ought to be thankful, but I still have the rebellious streak when I see what others have done, what others are doing, and I sometimes wonder what right I ever had to think that I might create something worth while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My father thinks I {{might have}} been a little more careful, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> she thinks it is Mr. Sanderson's fault that he let me get such an amount of money in cash and carry it on such a lonely road. But dad is all right, and in his last letter he said he could let Mr. Sanderson have a {{thousand}} dollars if that would help matters out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, not at all. All {{the good}} ladies are taking it up, I believe. Mrs Grantley, of Poppleby, is great at it, and I see {{no harm in}} it; but you'll have to reckon with my father. He says there will soon be no ploughmen, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> {{there will be no}} more cooks or housemaids. You'd better write to old Fogram, he'll back you up." ...|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY [preserving his dignity]. I don't {{know about}} it's {{being a great}} war, sir. It's a big war; but that's not the same thing. Father Quinlan's new church is a big church: you might take the little old chapel {{out of the middle}} of it and not miss it. But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>says</b> there was more true {{religion}} in the old chapel. And the war has taught me that maybe she was right.|$|E
60|$|And while Eustace marveled if {{this were}} a passing tumult or the {{beginning}} of a civil war, my most immediate wonder was what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would <b>say</b> to this adventure.|$|R
60|$|Ah, {{you would}} think so, I should have thought so, but I know myself now. When I reached London I did hear how my sister died, but still I was afraid. I saw myself in <b>my</b> <b>mother’s</b> room telling her why {{the door of the}} next room was locked, and I was afraid. God had done so much, and yet I could not look {{confidently}} to Him for the little that was left to do. ‘O ye of little faith!’ These are the words I seem to hear <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>saying</b> to me now, and she looks at me so sorrowfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was born}} on the 8th of December, 1394, and shall be {{therefore}} seventeen in a fortnight's time. I was born {{a few minutes after}} midnight, for I have heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>say</b> that the castle bell had sounded but a few minutes before I was born. She said that she had been anxious about it, because an old woman had predicted that if she ever had a child born on the 7th day of the month, it would be in every way unfortunate; so <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was greatly pleased that I had escaped the consequences predicted." ...|$|R
