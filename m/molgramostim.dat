40|$|Hypothesis: The {{addition}} of <b>molgramostim</b> (recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) to antibiotic therapy for nontraumatic and generalized abdominal sepsis is effective {{and has a}} significant impact on length of hospitalization, direct medical costs, and mortality. Design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting Tertiary referral center. Patients Fifty-eight patients with abdominal sepsis. Interventions Patients were allocated to receive, in addition to ceftriaxone sodium, amikacin sulfate, and metronidazole, <b>molgramostim</b> in a daily dosage of 3 5 g/kg for 4 days (group 1) or placebo (group 2). Antibiotics were administered for at least 5 days and discontinued after clinical improvement had occurred and white blood cell count had been normal for 48 hours. Main Outcome Measures Time to improvement, duration of antibiotic therapy, hospital stay, complications, mortality, and adverse reactions to drugs. Results: Median time to improvement was 2 days in group 1 and 4 days in group 2 (P<. 005). Median length of hospitalization was 9 and 13 days, respectively (P<. 001), and median duration of antibiotic therapy was 9 and 13 days, respectively (P<. 001). Numbers of infectious complications in the 2 groups were, respectively, 6 and 16 (P = 3 D. 02); of residual abscesses, 3 and 5; and of deaths, 2 and 2.

This study was conducted {{from the perspective of the}} National Health Service (NHS) hospital sector. Design: We used our previously reported trial as the clinical basis for the analysis (see Participants and interventions). These data were combined with resource utilisation data, enabling us to construct a decision tree model of the treatment paths attributable to managing patients in each arm of the trial. The model was used to calculate the cost effectiveness of using amphotericin B plus G-CSF compared to amphotericin B monotherapy in neutropenic patients with a presumed deep-seated fungal infection.

We investigated whether a vaccine targeting the BCR-ABL-derived p 210 fusion protein was an active and specific immunotherapy. METHODS: We recruited 16 patients who had chronic myeloid leukaemia (with the b 3 a 2 fusion point of p 210), stable residual disease, a minimum treatment of 12 months of imatinib or 24 months of interferon alfa, and no further reduction of residual disease for at least 6 months preceding enrollment.

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the safety and efficacy of a short-term subcutaneous-only granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) protocol for coronary collateral growth promotion. BackgroundThe safety and efficacy of an exclusively systemic application of GM-CSF in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and collateral artery promotion has not been studied so far. MethodsIn 14 men (age 61 ± 11 years) with chronic stable CAD, the effect of GM-CSF (<b>molgramostim)</b> on quantitatively assessed collateral flow was tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion. The study protocol consisted of an invasive collateral flow index (CFI) measurement in a stenotic as well as a normal coronary artery before and after a two-week period with subcutaneous GM-CSF (10 μg/kg; n = 7) or placebo (n = 7). Collateral flow index was determined by simultaneous measurement of mean aortic, distal coronary occlusive, and central venous pressure. ResultsCollateral flow index in all vessels changed from 0. 116 ± 0. 05 to 0. 159 ± 0. 07 in the GM-CSF group (p = 0. 028) and from 0. 166 ± 0. 06 to 0. 166 ± 0. 04 in the placebo group (p = NS). The treatment-induced difference in CFI was + 0. 042 ± 0. 05 in the GM-CSF group and − 0. 001 ± 0. 04 in the placebo group (p = 0. 035). Among 11 determined cytokines, chemokines, and their monocytic receptor concentrations, the treatment-induced change in CFI was predicted by the respective change in tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration. Two of seven patients in the GM-CSF group and none in the placebo group suffered an acute coronary syndrome during the treatment period. ConclusionsA subcutaneous-only, short-term protocol of GM-CSF is effective in promoting coronary collateral artery growth among patients with CAD. However, the drug’s safety regarding the occurrence of acute coronary syndrome is questionable...|$|E

40|$|Collection of {{adequate}} hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) {{is necessary for}} successful autologous transplantation; however, a proportion of patients fail to collect the minimum number of cells required. We summarized the efficacy and safety of HSC mobilization strategies. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing HSC mobilization strategies before autologous transplantation for hematologic malignancies. The primary outcome was CD 34 + cell yield. Secondary outcomes included number of aphereses, proportion of failures, rate of count recovery, and adverse events. We identified 28 articles within 3 broad strategies. Using a cyclophosphamide with growth factor strategy (10 articles), CD 34 + cell yield is improved by addition of <b>molgramostim</b> to cyclophosphamide (1. 4 vs 0. 5 × 106 /kg; P =. 0165), addition of cyclophosphamide to filgrastim (7. 2 vs 2. 5 × 106 /kg; P =. 004), and addition of ancestim to cyclophosphamide and filgrastim (12. 4 vs 8. 3 × 106 /kg; P =. 007). Within a growth factor-based strategy (6 articles), addition of plerixafor improves CD 34 + cell yield over filgrastim alone in multiple myeloma (MM; 11. 0 vs 6. 2 × 106 /kg; P <. 001) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (5. 69 vs 1. 98 × 106 /kg; P <. 01).

40|$|The tumor-associated antigen EpCAM (epithelial cell-adhesion molecule) (C 017 - 1 A) is over {{expressed}} by various human carcinomas, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC). This antigen {{can be used}} as a target structure for specific immunotherapy with vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (MAb). Addition of cytokines to MAb therapy may augment immune effector functions and chemotherapeutic agents may also add to therapeutic efficacy. In this thesis, we have analysed clinical and immunological responses of patients with advanced CRC treated with either the murine anti-EpCAM MAb (anti-EpCAM mMAb) or its chimeric counterpart (antiEpCAM cMAb) in combination with cytokines and chemotherapeutics. Additionally, sequential analysis of cytokeratin positive (CK+) cells in the bone marrow (BM) were made in CRC patients receiving MAb based therapy for advanced disease or as adjuvant therapy. Pretreatment natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity in vitro of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and progression free survival (PFS) in patients receiving anti-EpCAM MAb based therapy as first-line therapy. The results from this study might be used for future patient selection and indicate that agents that activate NK cells should be considered to MAbbased treatment regimens. The addition of GM-CSF, alpha-interferon and 5 -fluorouracil to anti-EpCAM mMAb seemed to improved the antitumor response rate compared to historical control patients treated with anti-EpCAM mMAb alone (54 % vs 15 %) as well as PFS (15 vs 7 weeks). Clinical effects were mainly stable disease > 3 months (11 of 14 responders) and responding patients survived longer than non-responders. The clinical efficacy of antiEpCAM cMAb and GMCSF was not better than in a historical control group who had received the antiEpCAM mMAb and GM-CSF (overall response rates= 21 % vs 27 %, respectively). Anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab 2) concentrations as well as the frequency of patients mounting an Ab 2 response in antiEpCAM eMAb treated patients were lower as compared to anti-EpCAM mMAb-treated patients (69 % vs 100 %). Following repeated daily subcutaneous (s. c.) injections of exogenous non-glycosylated E. coli-derived GM-CSF (<b>molgramostim),</b> the peak serum GM-CSF concentrations declined days 5 and 10 as compared to day 1. A dose-dependent increment in total white blood cell count was observed, the total numbers of GM-CSF receptor expressing cells increased during treatment while a transient decline in expression intensity was observed at day 5. The majority of patients developed binding but not neutralizing antiGM-CSF antibodies. These results might support a receptor-mediated clearance of GM-CSF from the circulation. Importantly, high dose of GM-CSF resulted in lower antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity that may reflect immune suppression. Further studies are required to establish the optimal biological dose of different cytokines. CK+ cells in BM were examined by immunohistochemistry on routinely processed BM clots, and CK+ cells were divided into different subtypes; Group A (CK+ probably malignant epithelial cells), Group B (CK+ morphologically non-epithelial cells) and Group C (CK+ contaminating cells). The presence of Group A cells did not adversely affect the prognosis while the presence of Group B cells probably indicates a poor prognosis in patients receiving adjuvant therapy. Sequential BM aspirations do not seem to add to the existing methods to follow the effect of treatment in CRC. These results might provide further clinical studies with MAbs, combined with other agents with different modes of action to increase the clinical efficacy of MAb. Ideally, patients with a well preserved immune system and low or minimal tumor burden should be selected to MAb-based therapy...|$|E
