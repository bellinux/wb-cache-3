5|$|Gregory {{would strike}} the Muslims' right flank, {{approaching}} Emesa {{from the northeast}} via <b>Mesopotamia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 637, the Arabs, {{after a long}} siege {{captured}} Jerusalem, {{which was}} surrendered by Patriarch Sophronius. In the summer of 637, the Muslims conquered Gaza, and, during the same period, the Byzantine authorities in Egypt and <b>Mesopotamia</b> purchased an expensive truce, which lasted three years for Egypt and one year for <b>Mesopotamia.</b> Antioch fell to the Muslim armies in late 637, and by then the Muslims occupied the whole of northern Syria, except for upper <b>Mesopotamia,</b> which they granted a one-year truce.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} <b>Mesopotamia,</b> {{the original}} Ubaid culture {{evolved into the}} Uruk period. The people of the southern Uruk period used military and commercial means to expand the civilization. In Northern <b>Mesopotamia,</b> the post Ubaid period is designated Late Chalcolithic / Northern Uruk period, during which, Tell Brak started to expand.|$|E
5|$|Thus Hammurabi {{ascended to}} the throne as the king of a minor kingdom {{in the midst of}} a complex geopolitical situation. The {{powerful}} kingdom of Eshnunna controlled the upper Tigris River while Larsa controlled the river delta. To the east of <b>Mesopotamia</b> lay the powerful kingdom of Elam which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern <b>Mesopotamia.</b> In northern <b>Mesopotamia,</b> the Assyrian king Shamshi-Adad I, who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor, had expanded his territory into the Levant and central <b>Mesopotamia,</b> although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire.|$|E
5|$|According to the Life of St. Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus {{fell into}} a Persian ambush but was able to escape. In 604/605, he also {{surrounded}} Narses and his troops, and persuaded him to surrender on guarantees of his personal safety. Phocas, nonetheless, had Narses executed by burning him alive. At about the same time, Dara, an important Byzantine city in <b>Mesopotamia,</b> fell to the Persians. Khosrau was encouraged to cease simply raiding the Byzantine provinces, instead attempting to conquer them. In 607, he launched concurrent invasions on <b>Mesopotamia</b> and Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture began {{independently}} {{in different}} parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Some of the earliest known domestications were of animals. Pigs were domesticated in <b>Mesopotamia</b> around 11,000 BC. Sheep were domesticated in <b>Mesopotamia</b> between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. Camels were domesticated late, perhaps around 3,000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Bahrain {{was home}} to the Dilmun civilization, an {{important}} Bronze Age trade centre linking <b>Mesopotamia</b> and the Indus Valley. Bahrain was later ruled by the Assyrians and Babylonians.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{nearly all}} of lower <b>Mesopotamia,</b> (the {{northern}} Euphrates region), was under Khalid's control. Meanwhile, Khalid received a call for relief from northern Arabia at Daumat-ul-Jandal, where another Muslim Arab general, Iyad ibn Ghanm, was being surrounded by rebel tribes. August 633, Khalid went to Daumat-ul-jandal and defeated the rebels in the Battle of Daumat-ul-jandal, capturing the city fortress. On his journey back to <b>Mesopotamia,</b> Khalid {{is said to have}} made a secret trip to Mecca to participate in Hajj.|$|E
5|$|Conflict resumed {{shortly after}} the {{overthrow}} of Parthian rule and Ardashir I's foundation of the Sasanian Empire. Ardashir raided <b>Mesopotamia</b> and Syria in 230 and demanded the cession of all the former territories of the Achaemenid Empire.* DodgeonGreatrexLieu (2002), I, 16 After fruitless negotiations, Alexander Severus set out against Ardashir in 232 and finally repulsed him.* DodgeonGreatrexLieu (2002), I, 2428; Frye (1993), 124 In 238240, {{towards the end of}} his reign, Ardashir attacked again, taking several cities in Syria and <b>Mesopotamia,</b> including Carrhae and Nisibis.|$|E
5|$|Enna-Dagan also {{received}} tribute, and his reign fell entirely within {{the reign of}} Irkab-Damu of Ebla, who managed to defeat Mari and end the tribute. Mari defeated Ebla's ally Nagar in year seven of the Eblaite vizier Ibrium's term, causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern <b>Mesopotamia</b> via upper <b>Mesopotamia.</b> The war reached a climax when the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish made an alliance with Nagar and Kish to defeat Mari in a battle near Terqa. Ebla itself suffered its first destruction {{a few years after}} Terqa in c. 2300 BC, during the reign of the Mariote king Hidar.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with <b>Mesopotamia</b> and Egypt, professional musicians {{did not exist}} in Israel between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in <b>Mesopotamia</b> and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned from the Bible and the Talmud. The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with Jubal: the ugab (pipes) and kinnor (lyre). Other instruments of the period included the tof (frame drum), pa'amon (small bells or jingles), shofar, and the trumpet-like hasosra.|$|E
5|$|Little {{history is}} {{available}} in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the Kassites destroy the Babylonian empire in <b>Mesopotamia</b> and the Hyksos destroy the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to <b>Mesopotamia</b> were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures. Under their new cultural influences, the people of the New Kingdom began using oboes, trumpets, lyres, lutes, castanets, and cymbals.|$|E
5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian <b>Mesopotamia.</b> The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid art, as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of <b>Mesopotamia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Solachon {{was fought}} in 586 CE in {{northern}} <b>Mesopotamia</b> between the East Roman (Byzantine) forces, led by Philippicus, and the Sassanid Persians under Kardarigan. The engagement {{was part of}} the long and inconclusive Byzantine–Sassanid War of 572–591. The Battle of Solachon ended in a major Byzantine victory which improved the Byzantine position in <b>Mesopotamia,</b> but it was not in the end decisive. The war dragged on until 591, when it ended with a negotiated settlement between Maurice and the Persian shah KhosrauII (r. 590–628).|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{exploited}} Persian disarray {{as general}} Justinian invaded deep into Persian territory and raided Atropatene. Khosrau sought peace but abandoned this initiative after Tamkhusro won {{a victory in}} Armenia, where Roman actions had alienated local inhabitants. In the spring of 578 the war in <b>Mesopotamia</b> resumed with Persian raids on Roman territory. The Roman general Maurice retaliated by raiding Persian <b>Mesopotamia,</b> capturing the stronghold of Aphumon, and sacking Singara. Khosrau again opened peace negotiations but he died early in 579 and his successor Hormizd IV (r. 578-590) preferred to continue the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{areas of}} <b>Mesopotamia</b> and the Arabian Peninsula {{experiences}} rapid growth and sharing of musical instruments {{once they were}} united by Islamic culture in the seventh century. Frame drums and cylindrical drums of various depths were immensely important in all genres of music. Conical oboes {{were involved in the}} music that accompanied wedding and circumcision ceremonies. Persian miniatures provide information on the development of kettle drums in <b>Mesopotamia</b> that spread as far as Java. Various lutes, zithers, dulcimers, and harps spread as far as Madagascar to the south and modern-day Sulawesi to the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} <b>Mesopotamia</b> {{includes}} {{the provinces of}} Misiones, Entre Ríos and Corrientes. It lies between the Uruguay and Paraná rivers, which serve as natural borders for the region.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} of this truce in 638639, the Arabs overran Byzantine <b>Mesopotamia</b> and Byzantine Armenia, and terminated {{the conquest of}} Palestine by storming Caesarea Maritima and effecting their final capture of Ascalon. In December 639, the Muslims departed from Palestine to invade Egypt in early 640.|$|E
5|$|During his campaign, Trajan {{was granted}} the title Parthicus by the Senate and coins were minted proclaiming {{the conquest of}} Parthia. However, only the 4th-century AD historians Eutropius and Festus allege that he {{attempted}} to establish a Roman province in lower <b>Mesopotamia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Galerius was reinforced, {{probably}} {{in the spring of}} 298, by a new contingent collected from the empire's Danubian holdings. Narseh did not advance from Armenia and <b>Mesopotamia,</b> leaving Galerius to lead the offensive in 298 with an attack on northern <b>Mesopotamia</b> via Armenia. It is unclear if Diocletian was present to assist the campaign; he might have returned to Egypt or Syria. Narseh retreated to Armenia to fight Galerius' force, to Narseh's disadvantage; the rugged Armenian terrain was favorable to Roman infantry, but not to Sassanid cavalry. In two battles, Galerius won major victories over Narseh. During the second encounter, Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife. Galerius continued moving down the Tigris, and took the Persian capital Ctesiphon before returning to Roman territory along the Euphrates.|$|E
5|$|Halab's {{location}} {{has always}} been a factor in its prominence as an economic center. Yamhad's economy was based on trade with the Iranian Plateau, <b>Mesopotamia,</b> Cyprus and Anatolia, with the city of Emar as its port on the Euphrates, and Alalakh with its proximity to the sea as its port on the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius soon {{experienced}} a new event, the Muslim conquests. Emerging from the Arabian Peninsula, the Muslims quickly conquered the Sasanian Empire. In 634 the Muslims marched into Roman Syria, defeating Heraclius's brother Theodore. Within {{a short period}} of time, the Arabs conquered <b>Mesopotamia,</b> Armenia and Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Images {{of musical}} {{instruments}} begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division of labor and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in <b>Mesopotamia.</b> Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct {{the early history of}} musical instruments in <b>Mesopotamia.</b> Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E
5|$|In 197 AD, Emperor Septimius Severus waged a {{brief and}} {{successful}} {{war against the}} Parthian Empire {{in retaliation for the}} support given to a rival for the imperial throne Pescennius Niger. The Parthian capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the Roman army, and the northern half of <b>Mesopotamia</b> was restored to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{another small}} group of Australian volunteers also served {{in a number of}} {{operations}} in <b>Mesopotamia</b> as part of Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission, although these missions were mainly aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India, and they also did little fighting.|$|E
5|$|Nagar was {{defeated}} by Mari in year seven of the Eblaite vizier Ibrium's term, causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern <b>Mesopotamia</b> via upper <b>Mesopotamia.</b> Later, Ebla's king Isar-Damu concluded an alliance with Nagar and Kish against Mari, and the campaign was headed by the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish, who led the combined armies to victory in a battle near Terqa. Afterwards, the alliance attacked the rebellious Eblaite vassal city of Armi. Ebla was destroyed approximately three years after Terqa's battle, and soon after, Nagar followed in c. 2300 BC. Large {{parts of the city}} were burned, an act attributed either to Mari, or Sargon of Akkad.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{driven by}} the will to take revenge for the {{destruction}} of Palmyrene trade centers and discourage Shapur from initiating future attacks, Odaenathus launched an invasion against the Persians. In the spring of 262, the king marched north into the occupied Roman province of <b>Mesopotamia,</b> driving out the Persian garrisons and freeing Edessa and Carrhae. The first onslaught was aimed at Nisibis, which Odaenathus regained but sacked since the inhabitants were sympathetic toward the Persian occupation. The Palmyrene monarch destroyed the Jewish city of Nehardea, 45km west of the Persian capital Ctesiphon, as he deemed the Jews of <b>Mesopotamia</b> loyal to Shapur. By late 262 or early 263, Odaenathus stood at the walls of the Persian capital.|$|E
5|$|The Sinai and Palestine Campaign was fuelled by {{criticism}} of the policy of a static defence of the Suez canal, which employed six infantry divisions and five mounted brigades. After the repulse of the Turkish First Suez Offensive, nine divisions {{were sent to the}} Western Front and one to <b>Mesopotamia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{cultures}} of <b>Mesopotamia,</b> Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China, among others, produced renowned surgeons {{and students of}} the natural sciences such as Susruta and Zhang Zhongjing, reflecting independent sophisticated systems of natural philosophy. However, the roots of modern biology are usually traced back to the secular tradition of ancient Greek philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The {{founders of}} the first city may have been Sumerians or more {{probably}} East Semitic speaking people from Terqa in the north. I. J. Gelb relates Mari's foundation with the Kish civilization, which was a cultural entity of East Semitic speaking populations, that stretched {{from the center of}} <b>Mesopotamia</b> to Ebla in the western Levant.|$|E
5|$|The {{hegemony of}} Yamhad {{affected}} Qatna's economy; the trade route connecting <b>Mesopotamia</b> and Mari to Qatna through Palmyra lost its importance, while the trade routes from the Mediterranean to <b>Mesopotamia</b> {{came under the}} full control of Aleppo, contributing to Qatna's loss of wealth. Following the destruction of Mari by Hammurabi of Babylon around 1761 BC, information about Qatna becomes scarce; in the late 17th century BC, Yamhad invaded and defeated Qatna {{during the reign of}} Yarim-Lim III. The political and commercial importance of Qatna declined quickly during the Late Bronze Age (LB I), around 1600 BC, as a result of growing Egyptian and Mitannian influences. Numerous small states appeared in the region and detached from Qatna.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the city}} {{can be traced to}} Mer, an ancient storm deity of {{northern}} <b>Mesopotamia</b> and Syria who was considered the patron deity of the city, Georges Dossin noted that the {{name of the}} city was spelled identically like the name of the storm god and concluded that Mari was named after him.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{accurately}} dated {{star chart}} {{was the result}} of ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC. The earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient Babylonian astronomers of <b>Mesopotamia</b> in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period (ca. 1531–1155 BC).|$|E
5|$|This {{string of}} Muslim {{victories}} curtailed Persian efforts to recapture lower <b>Mesopotamia</b> {{and left the}} Persian capital Ctesiphon unguarded and vulnerable to Muslim attack. Before assaulting the Persian capital, Khalid decided to eliminate all Persian forces {{from the south and}} west, and thus marched against the border city of Firaz, where he defeated a combined force of Sassanid Persians, Byzantine Romans and Christian Arabs and captured the city's fortress during the Battle of Firaz in December 633. This was the last battle in his conquest of lower <b>Mesopotamia.</b> While Khalid {{was on his way to}} attack Qadissiyah, a key fort on the way to Ctesiphon, he received a letter from Abu Bakr and was sent to the Byzantine front in Syria to assume the command of Muslim armies with the intent of conquering Roman Syria.|$|E
5|$|Trajan's {{successor}} Hadrian (r.117–138AD) {{reaffirmed the}} Roman-Parthian border at the Euphrates, {{choosing not to}} invade <b>Mesopotamia</b> due to Rome's now limited military resources. Parthamaspates fled after the Parthians revolted against him, yet the Romans made him king of Osroene. Osroes I died during his conflict with Vologases III, the latter succeeded by Vologases IV of Parthia (r. c.147–191AD) who ushered {{in a period of}} peace and stability. However, the Roman–Parthian War of 161–166AD began when Vologases invaded Armenia and Syria, retaking Edessa. Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.161–180AD) had co-ruler Lucius Verus (r.161–169AD) guard Syria while Marcus Statius Priscus invaded Armenia in 163AD, followed by the invasion of <b>Mesopotamia</b> by Avidius Cassius in 164AD.|$|E
5|$|When Roman emperor Septimius Severus (r.193–211AD) invaded <b>Mesopotamia</b> in 197AD {{during the}} reign of Vologases V of Parthia (r. c.191–208AD), the Romans once again marched down the Euphrates and {{captured}} Seleucia and Ctesiphon. After assuming the title Parthicus Maximus, he retreated in late 198AD, failing as Trajan once did to capture Hatra during a siege.|$|E
