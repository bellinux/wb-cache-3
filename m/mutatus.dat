The genus {{of a newly}} formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a mother cloud. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after {{the appearance of the}} new genus, it is termed a genitus cloud. One example of this is stratocumulus cumulogenitus, a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. If the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it {{is considered to be a}} <b>mutatus</b> cloud.|$|E
2500|$|The genitus and <b>mutatus</b> {{categories}} {{have been}} {{expanded to include}} certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term flammagenitus (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level [...] "pyrocumulus" [...] or [...] "fumulus" [...] clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus homogenitus (Latin for 'man-made'). Contrails formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling any of the high cloud genus-types and are now officially designated as cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus homogenitus. If a homogenitus cloud of one genus changes to another genus type, it is then termed a homomutatus cloud. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls. [...] Silvagenitus (Latin for 'forest-made') is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor {{is added to the}} air above a forest canopy.|$|E

Once back, Falco hastily returns into town to attend Theopomous' wake, presided over by Rhodope. As usual, things get out of hand once Rhodope identifies a suspect for Theopomous' death at his wake, sparking a gang war which results in a three-way melee between the Illyrians, Cilicians and the vigiles. Falco, his family as well as Petro' manage to rescue Rhodope from the fight and take refuge in a mausoleum, where she finally reveals that during her captivity she was drugged (possibly by Pullia) and held in a sacrificial vault in a temple.

The second is to speak to Holconius and <b>Mutatus,</b> but they are out. Nevertheless, a slave in the columnists' office tells Falco the reason Deiocles went back to Ostia - to see his aunt Vestina. En route, Falco meets his father, who tells Falco that he knows Damagoras as a {{business}} partner. Falco's father also reveals that Aline wasn't the first victim [...] - [...] previously, a young girl named Rhodope had also been abducted. Speaking to Rhodope, Helena manages to discover that she was seduced by one of her former captors, named Theopompus.

This causes her to have a heated {{argument}} with Falco, but he backs down in the end and following Helena's plan, he asks the vigiles to trail the scribes, but the scribes are assaulted by unknown assailants who take the ransom money, and the vigiles lose the trail. Dejected and disgusted, Falco goes for a walk and bumps into Caninus, who tries to convince Falco that his uncle Fulvius is [...] "the Illyrian", but Falco doesn't believe him and tells Caninus to leave Fulvius alone. Much later, however, Falco catches sight of the alleged kidnappers with the ransom chest, and tails them to a military dock, where they are planning to board a liburna, but is spotted and attacked. Falco, outnumbered, is defeated in the ensuing scuffle and realises that Caninus is connected with the pirates operating in Ostia.|$|E
5000|$|Marx's {{critique}} of {{the ideology of the}} human rights thus departs from the counterrevolutionary critique by Edmund Burke, who dismissed the [...] "rights of Man" [...] in favour of the [...] "rights of the individual": it is not grounded on an opposition to the Enlightenment's universalism and humanist project on behalf of the right of tradition, as in Burke's case, but rather on the claim that the ideology of economism and the ideology of the human rights are the reverse sides of the same coin. However, as Étienne Balibar puts it, [...] "the accent put on those contradictions can not not ring out on the signification of 'human rights', since these therefore appears both as the language in which exploitation masks itself and as the one in which the exploited class struggle express itself: more than a truth or an illusion, it is therefore a stake". Das Kapital ironizes on the [...] "pompous catalogue of the human rights" [...] in comparison to the [...] "modest Magna Charta of a day work limited by law": The creation of a normal working-day is, therefore, the product of a protracted civil war, more or less dissembled, between the capitalist class and the working-class... It must be acknowledged that our labourer comes out of the process of production other than he entered. In the market he stood as owner of the commodity [...] "labour-power" [...] face to face with other owners of commodities, dealer against dealer. The contract by which he sold to the capitalist his labour-power proved, so to say, in black and white that he disposed of himself freely. The bargain concluded, it is discovered that he was no [...] "free agent," [...] that the time for which he is free to sell his labour-power is the time for which he is forced to sell it, that in fact the vampire will not lose its hold on him [...] "so long as there is a muscle, a nerve, a drop of blood to be exploited." [...] For [...] "protection" [...] against [...] "the serpent of their agonies," [...] the labourers must put their heads together, and, as a class, compel the passing of a law, an all-powerful social barrier that shall prevent the very workers from selling, by voluntary contract with capital, themselves and their families into slavery and death. In place of the pompous catalogue of the [...] "inalienable rights of man" [...] comes the modest Magna Charta of a legally limited working-day, which shall make clear [...] "when the time which the worker sells is ended, and when his own begins. Quantum <b>mutatus</b> ab illo!changed from what he/it was!" [...] But the communist revolution does not end with the negation of individual liberty and equality ("collectivism"), but with the [...] "negation of the negation": [...] "individual property" [...] in the capitalist regime is in fact the [...] "expropriation of the immediate producers." [...] "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor... The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labor of the proprietor. But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It is the negation of negation. This does not re-establish private property for the producer, but gives him individual property based on the acquisition of the capitalist era: i.e., on co-operation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production.|$|E
40|$|Megaplatypus <b>mutatus</b> (Chapuis) (Coleoptera, Platypodidae) is an {{ambrosia beetle}} native to South America. It builds {{internal}} galleries that weaken the tree trunks, causing them severe stem breakage and mortality in commercial poplar plantations. The host selection by male M. <b>mutatus</b> {{has previously been}} correlated with the increasing diameter.

40|$|Megaplatypus <b>mutatus</b> Chapuis (Coleoptera: Platypodidae) (Fig. 1), {{an exotic}} insect {{introduced}} from the neotropical region, is an emerging pest in Southern Italy (Tremblay et al., 2000; Allegro & Griffo, 2008). The platypodid beetle {{is a primary}} and polyphagous pest infesting only healthy standing trees of several botanical species (Corylus, Prunus, Juglans, Pyrus, Malus, Populus, etc.); cut wood or “sick” trees are not colonized. M. <b>mutatus</b> is a xylomicetophagous species (=Ambrosia beetle). In Campania it may cause dramatic damages, especially in commercial plantations of Populus nigra. Male platypodid infest new trees primarily in late spring: coarse boring dust can be observed on attacked trees, which usually exude sap through the entrance holes. Females join the males soon after a successful attack and complete most of the typical galleries, excavated on a transversal plane through the xylem, as they lay eggs. The young larvae feed on symbiontic fungus and the last instant also on wood, boring each a vertical pupal chamber. Economic losses in poplar woods are due to stem fracture caused {{by the presence of}} parental gallery systems, the massive diffusion of the fungi in the xylem and wood alteration (Fig. 2). From a poplar wood infested by M. <b>mutatus</b> in Campania (Fig. 3), a fungus responsible of a chromatic wood alteration has been identified. Wall tissues from M. <b>mutatus</b> galleries coated with a firm mycelium were sampled (Fig. 4, 5). Several fungal colonies with a red mycelium and a strong coloration on PDA have been isolated. All the red strains belong to the genus Verticillium spp. (Fig. 6). The fungus establish a physical contamination with the platypodid and are massively present in the brood galleries. To our knowledge, this is a new association and up to now the possible role of this relationship is unknown. A typical symbiontic species recorded for M. <b>mutatus</b> in Argentina is an ascomycota of the genus Raffaelea (Jones & Blackwell, 1998; Gebhardt & Oberwinkler, 2005). Differences in environmental conditions and in ecological interactions may explain the presence of Verticillium spp. in the galleries of M. <b>mutatus</b> on poplar in Campania. Biological investigations in order to characterize the beetle-fungus association are in progress...|$|E

40|$|In wells of {{the islands}} of Barbados and Aruba (West Indies) two new species of Metacyclops were found. One, {{belonging}} to the minutus-group, is described as Metacyclops agnitus n. sp. and {{is closely related to}} Metacyclops minutus (Claus, 1863). In absence of complete descriptions of M. minutus, especially concerning absolute measurements, these are completed with observations on a West-German population. The other species, called Metacyclops <b>mutatus</b> n. sp., may have evolved from mendocinus-like ancestors, but differs obviously in comparison with the morphologically similar species M. aequatorialis Dussart, 1977 and M. chelazzi Dumont, 1981. A key for Metacyclops is provided, mainly based on the literature, as an aid for future investigations...|$|E
