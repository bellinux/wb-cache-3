5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for first test flights in 2011, the independent {{analysis by the}} Augustine Commission found in late 2009 that due to technical and financial problems Ares I was not likely to have had its first crewed launch until 2017–2019 under the current budget, or late 2016 with an unconstrained budget. The Augustine Commission also stated that Ares I and Orion would have an estimated recurring cost of almost $1 billion per flight.

25|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{inefficiency}} in the MC market structure. First, at its optimum output the firm charges {{a price that}} exceeds <b>marginal</b> <b>costs,</b> The MC firm maximizes profits where marginal revenue = marginal cost. Since the MC firm's demand curve is downward sloping {{this means that the}} firm will be charging a price that exceeds <b>marginal</b> <b>costs.</b> The monopoly power possessed by a MC firm means that at its profit maximizing level of production there will be a net loss of consumer (and producer) surplus. The second source of inefficiency is the fact that MC firms operate with excess capacity. That is, the MC firm's profit maximizing output is less than the output associated with minimum average cost. Both a PC and MC firm will operate at a point where demand or price equals average cost. For a PC firm this equilibrium condition occurs where the perfectly elastic demand curve equals minimum average cost. A MC firm’s demand curve is not flat but is downward sloping. Thus in the long run the demand curve will be tangential to the long run average cost curve at a point to the left of its minimum. The result is excess capacity.|$|E

With a diminishing threat from Russia, the navy decided that it would downplay the military role of the Coast Guard. This would allow the Norwegian Fleet and the Coastal Artillery to focus on training while the Coast Guard would focus entirely on its core tasks. In line with the trend of new public management, the government was eager to introduce user payment for the Coast Guard. This would have involved the various civilian agencies, such as the JCRRs, having to pay for Coast Guard services. The Navy argued that a key role of the Coast Guard was a constant presence and that invoicing for use would decrease its efficiency since it had low <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> with participating in SAR missions.

25|$|In economics, {{marginal}} cost {{is the change}} in the opportunity cost that arises when the quantity produced is incremented by one unit, that is, it is the cost of producing one more unit of a good. Intuitively, {{marginal cost}} at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. At each level of production and time period being considered, <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered fixed. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the fixed costs of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, marginal analysis is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including fixed costs) become marginal.|$|E

2500|$|Martin Shubik {{developed}} the Bertrand–Edgeworth model [...] {{to allow for}} the firm to be willing to supply only up to its profit maximizing output at the price which it set (under profit maximization this occurs when <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> equals price). [...] He considered the case of strictly convex <b>costs,</b> where <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> is increasing in output. Shubik showed that if a Nash equilibrium exists, it must be the perfectly competitive price (where demand equals supply, and all firms set price equal to <b>marginal</b> <b>cost).</b> However, this can only happen if market demand is infinitely elastic (horizontal) at the competitive price. In general, as in the Edgeworth paradox, no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist. Huw Dixon showed that in general a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium will exist when there are convex costs.

2500|$|Coase (1960) (referred to by Toth et al.., 2001; and Helm, 2005, p.4) {{argued that}} social costs could be {{accounted}} for by negotiating property rights according to a particular objective. Coase's model assumes perfectly operating markets and equal bargaining power among those arguing for property rights. For climate change, the property rights are for emissions (permits or quotas). However, {{it should be noted that}} other factors affect the climate other than just emissions, e.g., the ocean, forests, etc. (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, pp.28–29). In Coase's model, efficiency, i.e., achieving a given reduction in emissions at lowest cost, is promoted by the market system. This can also be looked at from the perspective of having the greatest flexibility to reduce emissions. Flexibility is desirable because the <b>marginal</b> <b>costs,</b> that is to say, the incremental costs of reducing emissions, varies among countries. Emissions trading allows emission reductions to be first made in locations where the <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> of abatement are lowest (Bashmakov et al.., 2001). Over time, efficiency can also be promoted by allowing [...] "banking" [...] of permits (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.30).

2500|$|<b>Marginal</b> <b>costs</b> are not {{affected}} by changes in fixed cost. <b>Marginal</b> <b>costs</b> can be expressed as ∆C(q)∕∆Q. Since fixed costs do not vary with (depend on) changes in quantity, MC is ∆VC∕∆Q. Thus if fixed cost were to double, the cost of MC would not be affected, and consequently the profit maximizing quantity and price would not change. [...] This can be illustrated by graphing the short run total cost curve and the short run variable cost curve. The shape of the curves are identical. Each curve initially increases at a decreasing rate, reaches an inflection point, then increases at an increasing rate. The only difference between the curves is that the SRVC curve begins from the origin while the SRTC curve originates on the y-axis. The distance {{of the origin of}} the SRTC above the origin represents the fixed cost – the vertical distance between the curves. This distance remains constant as the quantity produced, Q, increases. MC is the slope of the SRVC curve. A change in fixed cost would be reflected by a change in the vertical distance between the SRTC and SRVC curve. Any such change would have no effect on the shape of the SRVC curve and therefore its slope at any point – MC.|$|E

We next show that countercyclical markup variation may, depending upon how costs are modeled, account for a substantial fraction of cyclical output movements. We also show that the observed procyclical variations in productivity and profits are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclical variations in output are primarily due to markup variations than to shifts in the real <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> schedule. Finally, we survey theories of endogenous markup variation. These include both models of sticky and models in which firms' desired markup varies over time. ...|$|R
