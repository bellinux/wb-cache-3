5|$|Ancient stone {{structures}} {{testify to}} the presence of Stroma's earliest residents, while a Norse presence around 900–1,000 years ago is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga. It has been politically united with Caithness since at least the 15th century. Although Stroma lies only a few <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, causing them to be largely self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E
5|$|As the Ju 87s {{reached the}} coast, the {{respective}} groups split off {{and headed for}} their assigned targets. By this time, some 15 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Wight, the Bf 109s had caught up and were now zigzagging around the dive-bombers. Bode led III./StG 77 to attack from the northwest, dead into wind in order to bomb accurately. Usually the Ju 87s attacked in line astern, but Bode chose to attack in groups of three to split the anti-aircraft fire. To keep the enemy's heads down, he fired his machine guns in an 80-degree dive. He soon left an altitude of 13,000feet, releasing his bombs and pulling out at 2,275feet. The rest of his unit followed.|$|E

5|$|Exeter {{had been}} badly damaged {{in the battle}} with Admiral Graf Spee, and Dorsetshire escorted her back to Britain in January 1940, before {{returning}} to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter Wakama twelve <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. Dorsetshire {{arrived on the scene}} shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank Wakama to prevent her from being a navigational hazard. The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a formal complaint to the British government protesting against Dorsetshires violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the Wakama incident.|$|E
5|$|Ferris and {{his friends}} collect the Ferrari and depart for home, but shortly {{discover}} many miles {{have been added to}} the odometer, and Cameron becomes catatonic. Back at Cameron's garage, Ferris sets the car on blocks and runs it in reverse to try to take <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> odometer without success. Cameron finally snaps, and lets out his anger against his controlling father by repeatedly kicking the car. This causes it to fall off the blocks and race in reverse through the back of the garage and into the ravine below. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron asserts he will stand up against his father.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a list}} of the Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) on the Isle of Wight, England. The Isle of Wight is {{an island}} and county three <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> south coast of England in the English Channel. Its geology is complex, with a chalk downland ridge running east to west through its centre and {{important}} fossil beds from the Lower Cretaceous to the Lower Tertiary around the coast. This geology gives rise to many distinct habitats, with strong maritime influences, including chalk grassland, neutral meadows, and broad-leaved woodland. The Isle of Wight has a population of 140,000, {{making it one of the}} country's smaller counties in terms of population.|$|E
5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} tow New Mexico for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines {{made it an}} ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the tow lines. Running lights were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship. New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast. The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|E
5|$|On , 1896 the leaking Sissoi Veliky reached Algiers. The captain {{planned to}} stay there for at least 20 days to {{complete}} the most urgent repairs, but five days later a telegram from Saint Petersburg forced him to leave for Piraeus. There the crew managed to seal the seams between the armour plates and repair the electrical systems. In February 1897 Sissoi Veliky steamed for Crete and she had her first gunnery exercise ten <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> shore of Souda Bay, Crete {{at the end of}} the month. The second exercise, held on , ended in disaster when the rear turret exploded after an hour of target practice. The explosion blew the roof of the turret over the mainmast so that it struck the base of the foremast, crushing one 37mm gun and a steam cutter. The explosion killed 16 men and wounded another 15; 6 of these later died of their wounds. The badly damaged Sissoi Veliky headed to Toulon for repairs.|$|E

5|$|Spain {{entered the}} war in 1761 as an ally of France. The British high command {{believed}} that capturing Havana would destroy {{the lines of communication}} from Spain to its colonial empire. On June 6, the assaulting British forces arrived seven <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> shore of Havana. The 17th Foot, including Montgomery's company, was to capture Moro Fort, the key to the Spanish defense of the city. British battleships bombarded the fort, silencing all but two Spanish guns. On July 30, Montgomery and the 17th Foot stormed and captured the fort. In late August 1762, Montgomery and the 17th Foot were sent to New York, where they remained {{for the rest of the}} war. The conflict was ended by the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January 1942 U-105 left Lorient on {{her fifth}} patrol. On 31 January she sank the British warship , part of Convoy SL-98, {{south-west}} of Ireland, and, on 5 February 1942, she rescued seven men from a crashed German Dornier Do 24 350 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of France. U-105 returned to Lorient on 8 February. Seventeen days later, on 25 February, U-105 left Lorient. Between 25 and 27 March, she sank the British merchant ship Narragansett and the Norwegian merchant ship Svenør off {{the east coast}} of the United States. U-105 returned to Lorient on 15 April after spending 50 days in the North Atlantic, and left on another patrol on 7 June. While crossing the Bay of Biscay, she was attacked by an Australian Short Sunderland aircraft from No. 10 Squadron RAAF. U-105 sought shelter in Ferrol, Spain and did not leave until 28 June, when she departed for Lorient, which she reached on the 30th. The attack apparently caused serious damage, as she did not sail again until 23 November. During this period, Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Adolf Schweichel was put in command of the boat, but did not undertake any patrols and was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See Jürgen Nissen, under whose command U-105 left Lorient.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Tropical Storm Juliette {{can be traced}} back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on September12. After interacting with a secondary wave over the central Atlantic a few days later, it entered the eastern Caribbean, becoming steadily better defined. Convective activity was enhanced as the wave passed into the West Caribbean on September22 and it moved inland over Central American shortly thereafter. A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September27 and convection steadily increased; around 0000UTC on September19, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Juliette. Turning northwest as a result of an upper-level trough, the system attained its peak with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mb (hPa; 29.44inHg) at 1200UTC on September30. Strong wind shear began to affect the storm thereafter, causing it to steadily weaken to tropical depression strength by 0000UTC on October2. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low. The low meandered several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Baja California before degenerating into a trough on October5.|$|E

5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached {{two-thirds of the way}} down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway. On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway. On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered off {{to the left of the}} runway, and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of the runway. On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of the runway after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers.
