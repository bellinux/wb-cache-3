40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to deliver}} a feminist critique of <b>Much</b> <b>Ado</b> <b>about</b> <b>Nothing’s</b> heroine Beatrice, {{in relation to the}} first stage of feminist literary criticism. In depth textual analysis of the Shakespearean comedy’s leading lady, alongside a feminist theoretical framework endeavours to examine the central theme of the thesis; whether or not Beatrice sold out to convention by adhering to a life of conventional matrimony. This study also discusses the timelessness of <b>Much</b> <b>Ado’s</b> heroine, exploring the notion of whether, as her contemporary attitudes suggest, she was a woman before her time. The examination of various depictions and receptions of Beatrice on page, stage and screen throughout history endeavours to act as an illustrative vehicle, representing the significant shift {{in the way in which}} women have been represented in theatre. Society’s reactions to both the written character as well as the performative representations of Beatrice are inevitably influenced by the historical and social context of the period. The exploration of the character of Beatrice from <b>Much</b> <b>Ado’s</b> creation in the late sixteenth century until the present day aims to discuss society’s changing attitudes towards the heroine, endeavouring to explore the question, ‘“Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand” ‘Did Beatrice sell out to convention?’...|$|R
5|$|Tracy and Hepburn reunited {{on screen}} {{for the first}} time in five years for the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's {{spinster}} persona, but it performed poorly at the box-office. That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice in <b>Much</b> <b>Ado</b> <b>About</b> <b>Nothing.</b> The shows were positively received.|$|E
5|$|Gielgud {{continued}} to try, without much success, {{to find new}} plays that suited him as an actor, but his direction of Peter Shaffer's first play, Five Finger Exercise (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived <b>Much</b> <b>Ado</b> <b>About</b> <b>Nothing,</b> this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice. Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter's A Day by the Sea for ITV. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television {{over the next four}} decades.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent names, {{rather than}} {{continuing}} the airy spirits theme (only Puck and Mab continued the trend), {{have focused on}} Herschel's source material. In 1949, the fifth moon, Miranda, was named by its discoverer Gerard Kuiper after a thoroughly mortal character in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The current IAU practice is to name moons after characters from Shakespeare's plays and The Rape of the Lock (although at present only Ariel, Umbriel, and Belinda have names drawn from the latter; all the rest are from Shakespeare). At first, the outermost moons were all named after characters from one play, The Tempest; but with Margaret being named from <b>Much</b> <b>Ado</b> <b>About</b> <b>Nothing</b> that trend has ended.|$|E
