In {{order to}} obtain the {{machining}} requirements of the machining features, {{it is necessary to}} develop a proper fixture locating scheme to constrain correctly the degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a workpart. In this paper, a machining-requirement-based design approach to locating scheme is for the first time created. Firstly, the relationship is established between the <b>machining</b> <b>dimensions</b> and the DOFs to be constrained theoretically. Secondly, the fixture locating scheme is established to characterize practical constrained DOFs of a workpiece in terms of the locator number and positions. As a result, locating correctness is defined according to the relationship between the theoretical constrained DOFs and the practical constrained DOFs, and then the determination algorithm of locating parameters is proposed quantitatively {{for the first time to}} design the fixture locating scheme...|$|E
