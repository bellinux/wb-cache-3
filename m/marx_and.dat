5|$|On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, {{beginning}} a lifelong friendship. Engels showed Marx his recently published The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, convincing Marx that {{the working class}} would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history. Soon, <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as The Holy Family. Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by {{the ideas of the}} Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.|$|E
5|$|The music, however, was {{not written}} by Fordham, {{but rather by}} several composers, {{including}} Paul Perry (a member of The Worthless Peons), Scrubs composer Jan Stevens, and Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman, each of whom helped write and arrange several songs. But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Robert Lopez, the writers of hit Broadway musical Avenue Q. <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Lopez's involvement came {{at the suggestion of}} Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if {{it would be possible to}} get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode. Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of musical genre suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were almost never in the same room.|$|E

5|$|Comte's {{positivism}} {{established the}} initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and social research. Durkheim, <b>Marx,</b> <b>and</b> Weber are more typically {{cited as the}} fathers of contemporary social science. In psychology, a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in behaviourism. Positivism has also been espoused by 'technocrats' {{who believe in the}} inevitability of social progress through science and technology.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{follows the}} story of Patti Miller, (Stephanie D'Abruzzo), a patient who mysteriously starts hearing everyone's speech as singing. It was written by Debra Fordham, who also wrote most of the lyrics. The episode's music was {{composed}} by Fordham, Scrubs resident composer Jan Stevens, The Worthless Peons' Paul Perry, Tony Award-winning Broadway orchestrator Doug Besterman, and the Avenue Q writing team of Jeff <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Robert Lopez. The episode was directed by Will Mackenzie.|$|E
5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim, <b>Marx,</b> <b>and</b> the German theorist Max Weber (1864–1920) are {{typically}} {{cited as the}} three principal architects of sociology. Herbert Spencer, William Graham Sumner, Lester F. Ward, W. E. B. Du Bois, Vilfredo Pareto, Alexis de Tocqueville, Werner Sombart, Thorstein Veblen, Ferdinand Tönnies, Georg Simmel and Karl Mannheim are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Curricula also may include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Marianne Weber and Friedrich Engels as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology. Each key figure {{is associated with a}} particular theoretical perspective and orientation.|$|E
5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|German {{philosophy}} is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; {{the establishment of}} classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; {{the development of the}} Frankfurt School by Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse and Jürgen Habermas have been particularly influential.|$|E
50|$|In January 1965, Joske's {{purchased}} rival Wolff <b>and</b> <b>Marx</b> {{with its}} downtown flagship and North Star Mall locations. Joske's stated {{that there would}} be no immediate changes in operation of Wolff <b>and</b> <b>Marx,</b> however, in less than a month the seven-story downtown Wolff <b>and</b> <b>Marx</b> store was closed because the store did not have escalators and the building had passed its useful life as a modern department store. Joske's sold the downtown Wolff <b>and</b> <b>Marx</b> building in 1968, and the building is now known as the Rand Building. The North Star Mall Wolff <b>and</b> <b>Marx</b> location was replaced in 1969 with a new five-level Joske's, its third San Antonio-area store.|$|R

5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of the Nice Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, Groucho <b>Marx,</b> <b>and</b> Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend and colleague Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. The street that they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July 1845, <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Engels left Brussels for England {{to visit}} {{the leaders of the}} Chartists, a socialist {{movement}} in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842 to August 1844. Not only did Engels already know the English language, he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders. Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers. Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Manchester has {{a notable}} {{place in the}} history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester, and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The {{economics}} books Marx was reading at the time {{can be seen in the}} library, as can the window seat where <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.|$|E

5|$|<b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> von Westphalen {{had seven}} {{children}} together, but partly {{owing to the}} poor conditions in which they lived whilst in London, only three survived to adulthood. The children were: Jenny Caroline (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); Jenny Laura (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy ("Guido"; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances ("Franziska"; 1851–1852); Jenny Julia Eleanor (1855–1898) and one more who died before being named (July 1857). There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son, Freddy, out of wedlock by his housekeeper, Helene Demuth.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1882 Shaw {{attended}} {{a meeting at}} the Memorial Hall, Farringdon, addressed by the political economist Henry George. Shaw then read George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl <b>Marx,</b> <b>and</b> thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{either to}} stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, {{to stay in}} Belgium he had to pledge not to publish {{anything}} {{on the subject of}} contemporary politics. In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels. Later, Mary Burns, Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.|$|E

5|$|Weber's most {{influential}} work was on economic sociology, political sociology, and {{the sociology of}} religion. Along with Karl <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Émile Durkheim, he is commonly {{regarded as one of}} the founders of modern sociology. But whereas Durkheim, following Comte, worked in the positivist tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition in the social sciences. In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, and Wilhelm Dilthey, who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, he photographed sites {{associated}} with the prominent Marxists Karl <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> Vladimir Lenin. He also photographed the signs erected by landowners and religious groups, believing that in doing so he was documenting the traces of capitalist society before they would be swept away by socialism. Both in Britain and {{on a visit to}} Germany he photographed pro-fascist and anti-fascist propaganda and graffiti. Like many leftists at the time, he believed that fascism was a temporary, extreme expression of capitalist society that would soon be overcome by socialism. He nevertheless expressed admiration for the German archaeological establishment under the Nazi government, highlighting that the British state lagged far behind in terms of funding excavations and encouraging the study of archaeology in universities; he refrained from commenting on the political agenda that the Nazis had in promoting archaeology.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Marx's childhood. The third of nine children, he became the oldest son when his brother Moritz died in 1819. Young <b>Marx</b> <b>and</b> his {{surviving}} siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie and Caroline were baptised into the Lutheran Church along with their mother in August 1824. Young Marx was privately educated by his father until 1830, when he entered Trier High School, whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, {{was a friend of}} his father. By employing many liberal humanists as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx's attendance.|$|E
