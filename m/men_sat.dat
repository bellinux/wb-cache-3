5|$|Members {{who would}} become famous {{included}} George Burns and Bucharest-born Edward G. Robinson, who had his Bar Mitzvah there in 1906. Robinson would later laugh that his propensity for taking the stage was demonstrated when he gave the longest Bar Mitzvah speech {{in the history of}} the congregation—"but the <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> still and listened".|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 {{went into}} {{orbit around the}} moon. Only ten years earlier, Kraft had joined Gilruth's newly founded Space Task Group. Now, the two <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> {{together}} in Mission Control, reflecting on how far they had come. Around them, the room was filled with cheers, but Kraft and Gilruth celebrated more quietly.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 1970, the two <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> {{down for}} lunch. With a red {{felt-tip}} pen, Osborn began to scrawl a Saint Andrew's cross circumscribed inside a chalice on his placemat.|$|E

25|$|The meeting itself {{took place}} on 21 July 1858, with a first four-hour session {{starting}} at 11.00 and a second session running from 16.00 till 20.00. It was a Tuesday. The venue was a moving one: the two <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> together, without support staff, in a small horse-drawn carriage as it undertook a slow passage round and round the little town.|$|E
25|$|Operation Killer was a counter-offensive by the United Nations {{forces to}} push Communist Chinese and North Korean Armies {{back behind the}} Han River and recover the South Korean capital. The {{operation}} began on February 21, 1951. The 900 Canadians of the 2PPCLI set off to the front on 15 February, 240km away. It was cold and <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> in trucks for 48 hours before arriving. They suffered frostbite and numbed limbs, and the lubricants on their weapons froze during the journey.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of his successful Atlanta Campaign, Sherman occupied the city of Atlanta on September 2, 1864, and Hood, who was forced to evacuate the city, regrouped at Lovejoy's Station. For almost a month, the normally aggressive Sherman took little action while his <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> about idly, and many left the army {{at the end of}} their enlistments. On September 21, Hood moved his forces to Palmetto, Georgia, where on September 25, he was visited by Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The two men planned their strategy, which called for Hood to move toward Chattanooga, Tennessee, and operate against Sherman's lines of communications. They hoped that Sherman would follow and that Hood would be able to maneuver Sherman into a decisive battle on terrain favorable to the Confederates.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} praised as {{genuinely}} funny, {{with a range}} of different kinds of humour. Praise was also directed at Morales, with both Louisa Mellor (Den of Geek) and Owen commenting on his ability to give the impression of movement, even while the episode revolved mostly around four <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> at a table. Critics commended the performances; Dessau called the cast [...] "uniformly excellent", and Owen said that the script was [...] "brilliantly performed". Ellen E Jones, writing for the London Evening Standard, praised both Glenister and Watkins; Hogan did likewise, but argued that Watkins [...] "stealthily stole the show". Owen suggested that, in the episode, [...] "Watkins again proved why he's one of the most underrated comic actors around right now". Mellor identified Watkins and White as offering the strongest performance. Hogan praised White for offering [...] "estimable support", while Billen identified White as the performer who [...] "stole the half-hour".|$|E
500|$|In 1925, Earp {{began to}} {{collaborate}} on a biography {{with his friend}} and former mining engineer John Flood to get his story told {{in a way that}} he approved. Flood volunteered his time and attempted to write an authorized biography of Earp's life, based on Earp's recollections. The two <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> together every Sunday in the kitchen of Earp's modest, rented bungalow. While Wyatt sipped a drink and smoked a cigar, they tried to tell Earp's story, but Josephine was always present. She often interrupted and insisted, [...] "You can't write that! It needs to be clean." [...] She also demanded that they add more [...] "pep" [...] to the manuscript, which in her mind meant including the word [...] "CRACK!" [...] in all capitals. In the chapter about the shootout, the manuscript includes 109 uses of [...] "CRACK". She thought Earp needed to be shown as a hero, and the manuscript includes a chapter titled [...] "Conflagration" [...] in which Earp saves two women, one a cripple, from a Tombstone fire.|$|E
500|$|The next day, McClellan {{began his}} attack with several {{advances}} by the Union right flank, {{far from the}} position of the 21st. For much of the day, the IX Corps could hear the fighting and awaited orders to take the bridge in their front. The 21st even was fortunate enough to have a mail call that morning, and the <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> down to read letters from home while fighting raged around the Dunker Church two miles (3km) away. Finally, orders came at noon and Ferrero's brigade was moved closer to the bridge. It was a difficult target. On the opposite bank, a wooded bluff rose [...] above the creek. Concealed there was a small force of 400 Confederates who would successfully hold thousands of Union troops at bay for hours. The men of the 21st watched several successive charges on the bridge by brigades of the IX Corps, all of which were repulsed. Finally, Ferrero's brigade was ordered forward. Reaching the bridge at a run, the 21st was ordered to take up a position next to the left abutment, supplying covering fire, while the 51st New York Infantry and the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry finally carried the position. As the Confederates retreated, Ferrero's brigade was soon stationed {{at the top of the}} bluff. Later in the afternoon, around sunset, a Confederate counterattack nearly drove the IX Corps back across Antietam Creek. Ferrero's brigade held the bluff, however, playing a key role in checking the counterattack, and taking severe casualties in the process. The 21st listed 10 killed and 35 wounded, casualties of 30 percent.|$|E

2500|$|In the 18th century, {{the chapel}} {{was called the}} hall. It was unlit and unheated. Hard benches {{surrounded}} a pulpit and communion table in {{the centre of the}} north wall. The sisters sat on the east side, near their house; and the brethren on the west side, next to theirs. When the married choir came to church, <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> with the single brethren and women with the sisters. [...] This practice continued until the late 19th century. On the wall opposite the pulpit was a gallery with an organ and a musical choir assembled to sing the responses in the liturgy.|$|E
2500|$|The Orchid Pavilion Gathering (353 CE) of 42 literati {{included}} Xie An and Sun Chuo at the Orchid Pavilion near Shaoxing, Zhejiang, {{during the}} Spring Purification Festival to compose poems {{and enjoy the}} wine. The gentlemen had engaged in a drinking contest: wine cups were floated down a small winding creek as the <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> along its banks; whenever a cup stopped, the man closest to the cup was required to empty it and write a poem. In the end, twenty-six of the participants composed thirty-seven poems. The [...] "Preface (Lantingji Xu)" [...] to the poems is particularly famous {{in regard to the}} art of calligraphy.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} 1990s [...] until January 2011, Egged {{operated}} gender-segregated lines, commonly called Mehadrin bus lines mainly running in and/or between major Haredi population centers. In these buses <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> {{at the front}} and women were expected to wear “modest dress.” The “mehadrin” lines were criticized after a woman, Miriam Shear, was allegedly assaulted for refusing {{to give up her}} seat to a male passenger and move {{to the back of the}} bus. In January 2011, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that forced separation of men and women on buses was illegal but allowed voluntary separation [...] for a one-year experimental period. The court, accepting the recommendations of an investigation committee, ordered the removal of signs designating buses as segregated and the installation of new signs informing passengers of their right to sit wherever they wanted.|$|E

2500|$|The Montreal Screwjob has {{garnered}} {{a notorious}} legacy both on-screen and off, and was partly chronicled {{in the documentary}} film [...] (1998). The far-reaching impact of the incident led to its adoption as a theme in matches and storylines of the WWF's [...] "Attitude Era" [...] {{and the creation of}} the character, [...] "", the evil boss. Many wrestling fans, and several within the business, believe the entire incident was an elaborate work executed in collaboration with Hart. Nonetheless, Hart was ostracized from the WWF while McMahon and Michaels continued to receive angry responses from audiences for many years in Hart's home country of Canada. Hart and McMahon later reconciled, and Hart was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006. On the January 4, 2010 episode of WWE Raw, Hart, in his first appearance on live WWE television since the Montreal Screwjob, had a lengthy on-screen discussion with Michaels about the Montreal Screwjob and other events in their past, and agreed to call a truce, bringing closure to the incident after more than 12 years. Both <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> side-by-side and discussed the Montreal Screwjob in detail on the 2011 WWE Home Video release, Greatest Rivalries: Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart. Longtime industry writer Mike Johnson referred to their 1997 Survivor Series bout as [...] "arguably the most talked-about match in the history of professional wrestling".|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, one of the <b>men</b> <b>sat</b> in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst {{part of this is}} that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E
