500|$|As Ferraro was {{the first}} woman to run on a major party {{national}} ticket in the United States, and the first Italian American, her [...] nomination at the 1984 Democratic National Convention {{was one of the most}} emotional moments of that gathering, with female delegates appearing joyous and proud at the historic occasion. In her acceptance speech, Ferraro said, [...] "The daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for vice president in the new land <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> to love." [...] Convention attendees were in tears during the speech, not just for its significance for women but for all those who had immigrated to America. The speech was listed as number 56 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century.|$|E
2500|$|Clapton's {{mother was}} a nurse who {{died when he was}} ten; his father was a doctor who died in 1999. Clapton has pterygiums and his eye surgeon {{recommended}} he wear dark glasses. Clapton met Susie, a fashion model, in the mid-1980s. They married and had twin daughters, Saskia and Montana. In March 2008 he appeared on ABC-TV's Talking Heads where he told Peter Thompson about his early life. He described the impact of his mother's erratic lifestyle prior to her suicide when he was ten; he then met his father {{for the first time and}} was enrolled in a private boarding school: [...] "My mother was sort of the antithesis of my father, because she had always aspired to... more the Bohemian artistic side of life" [...] and [...] "it was a bit of a shock when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> to collect me... we just never got on. It was a fiery clash from the very start. My father obviously wanted me to become a doctor or some similar sort of career".|$|E
60|$|At last {{we heard}} the front door shut behind them, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> upstairs, his usually serene face wearing a {{disturbed}} expression.|$|E

6000|$|... "When <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>comes</b> home," [...] I answered, {{with great}} dignity, [...] "I shall {{tell him the}} truth. I shall say I am going to marry your daughter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ay, I {{know the}} Punjab. My {{mother was a}} pahareen, but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> from Amritzar--by Jandiala,' said Kim, oiling his ready tongue {{for the needs of}} the Road.|$|E
6000|$|Just then <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> in {{and began}} making {{preparations}} to depart with me. Ernest returned some books he had borrowed, and went away first. But {{just as he}} was going, he turned and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{great many}} years ago, {{in the time}} of my father, when you [...] were driven from your throne by your enemies, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> [...] to your aid, {{defeated}} your enemies, and restored you.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's well. I ask you not {{to mention}} this to <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> <b>Come</b> in, now. You need food and rest. Later I'll hide Bolly and Silvermane in the arbor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Till <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>comes,</b> {{unless the}} foolish wench should go and die. She brought it on me, the peevish girl. She is always after me when I want her least." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps the sum is not enough," [...] she said; [...] "he {{has to get}} to France. Perhaps {{we could}} borrow more until <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>comes</b> home." [...] She looked questioningly at us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to get}} to {{the bottom}} of what has all along been a mystery to me, and that is how <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> to take those shares, just at the moment when the bank was so shaky." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] {{she said}} disdainfully. [...] "I know Budmouth better than you. I was born there. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> to be a {{military}} musician there from abroad. Ah, my soul, Budmouth! I wish I was there now." ...|$|E
6000|$|I murmured, 'Your {{life seemed}} to require it,' {{but she did}} not hear me. She sank down in a chair, covered her face, and then <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> in. 'O, here you are!' he said. 'I could not find you. And Caroline!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My secrecy {{was perhaps}} an error of judgment,' she said sadly. 'But I had reasons. Why {{did you and}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>come</b> here at all {{if you did not}} want to see me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{trust to}} a surprise," [...] Walter said. [...] "We can get round {{to the back}} of the house without being seen. If we burst in there suddenly, we can clear the house and hold it till <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>comes</b> up with the whole troop." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mir. I fear I have {{offended}} you, and yet [...] I {{meant no}} harm: But, {{if you please}} to hear me,-- [...] [A noise within. [...] Hark, sir! now I am sure <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>comes,</b> [...] I know his steps: Dear love! retire a while; [...] I fear I've staid too long.|$|R
60|$|We were yet {{at work on}} {{the breakfast}} when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> aboard, the barge to which he was drafted having been the third to arrive, and it made me feel mighty good when he complimented us on our smartness in {{handling}} the Avenger.|$|E
6000|$|Wyllard laughed. [...] "No," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{was born}} in Western Canada, but I think I'm as English as you are, in some respects, though I never quite {{realized}} it until to-night. It isn't exactly because <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> from this country, either." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{a matter}} of course I was proud of being thus {{received}} by my elders, but when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> up hurriedly, taking me in his arms and kissing me on the cheek as if I had been a mere child, truly was my cup of happiness running over! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> had <b>come</b> {{down one}} {{morning with the}} weight of a great {{determination}} upon his brow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Irish name, yes; so {{are half}} the names in <b>my</b> country. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>comes</b> from the United States. And he is {{strongly}} {{impressed with the}} necessity of putting down the horrid injustice with which the poor Irish are treated by the monstrous tyranny of you English aristocrats. You are very nice to look at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In the {{darkness}} of the night, O my friends,' he said presently, 'the white spirits of <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>came</b> upon me and spoke, saying: [...] "Get thee hence, Makoma, for thou shalt have no rest until thou hast found and fought with Sakatirina, who had five heads, and is very great and strong; so take leave of thy friends, for thou must go alone."' ...|$|R
6000|$|But it was Slim who {{was really}} excited. He caught at the other. [...] "I know what this is. It's a space-ship. That must be why <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> here. He's {{one of the biggest}} astronomers in the world and your father would have to call him if a space-ship landed on his estate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just then <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> in {{and asked}} {{what all the fuss}} was about. I told him that we had caught a young white baboon, and he was angry, and said that it must be let go. But when he looked at it through the bars of the window he nearly fell down with astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Here I {{was left}} {{seated on the}} ground {{under the care of}} {{one of the men who}} had {{captured}} me, until a full hour passed, and then to my great relief of mind and wondrous joy, none other than <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> up, welcoming me with all the love which I knew full well he had in his heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know." [...] The {{moisture}} {{gathered in}} Helen's eyes. [...] "I am grateful, very grateful--as I said, ashamed, too; but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>comes</b> first. I {{tried to warn}} Geoffrey, {{but he would not}} take no. I feel almost frightened sometimes lest he will force me to yield against my will, but you know that would be a wrong to him--and what can I do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Just one {{fragment}} {{of a letter}} written by Mathinna reveals what the transition from living with her family at Flinders Island to living at Government House must have been like: [...] "I am good little girl, Ihave pen and ink cause I am a good little girl [...] [...] [...] [...] I have a got a red frock like <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> <b>Come</b> here to see <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> I have got sore feet and shoes and stockings and I am very glad." ...|$|R
6000|$|He did not answer, and {{a moment}} {{afterwards}} Grace burst into tears in spite of herself. [...] "Oh, why does not <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>come</b> home and explain," [...] she sobbed, [...] "and let me know clearly what I am? It is too trying, this, to ask me to--and then to leave me so long in so vague a state that I {{do not know what}} to do, and perhaps do wrong!" ...|$|R
60|$|Some of {{the women}} began to cry. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> out into the hall, closing the room door behind him, and ordered them to be quiet, so sternly that they were stunned into silence. The furious ringing was repeated; and, this time, threats mingled among the hoarse shouts. My mother's arm {{tightened}} around me, and I could hear the beating of her heart.|$|E
60|$|When <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> in to tea, I {{began to}} feel some curiosity about the lady who had called on him. Visitors of that sort, in general, never appear to dwell on his mind after they have gone away; he sees too many of them, and is too well {{accustomed}} to {{what they have to}} say. On this particular evening, however, I perceived appearances that set me thinking; he looked worried and anxious.|$|E
6000|$|One day, {{soon after}} the death of my sister Harriet, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>came</b> home from a meeting of the Grange with a message which shook our home with the force of an earth-quake. The {{officers}} of the order had asked him to become the official grain-buyer for the county, and he had agreed to do it. [...] "I am to take charge of the new elevator which is just being completed in Osage," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stop a minit,' replied Sam, {{running over}} the letter again, and pausing here and there, to reflect, {{as he did}} so. 'You've hit it. The gen'l'm'n as wrote it wos a-tellin' all about the misfortun' in a proper vay, and then <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>comes</b> a-lookin' over him, and complicates the whole concern by puttin' his oar in. That's just the wery sort o' thing he'd do. You're right, Mary, my dear.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My uncle's obstinacy {{must not}} be {{permitted}} to occasion this disaster. Go once more on deck, Jasper; and ask <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to <b>come</b> into the cabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you have}} spoken; {{now you have}} told me of your sisters and your father. Now I know it all! Now <b>my</b> <b>father</b> may <b>come</b> in." ...|$|R
