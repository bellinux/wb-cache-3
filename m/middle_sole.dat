In American service, it replaced the Russet Marching Shoe. The boot was made of tanned cowhide with a half <b>middle</b> <b>sole</b> covered by a full sole, studded with five rows of hobnails.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the gait pattern of healthy subjects with simulated hemiplegia. Eighteen occupational therapy students (13 females, 5 males) were asked to wear orthosis on right knee joints to demonstrate a simulated hemiplegic gait pattern. The relative impulses under 6 plantar areas (great toe, inside forefoot, middle forefoot, outside forefoot, <b>middle</b> <b>sole</b> of foot, and heel), and the duration of foot contact to the ground were measured using a plantar pressure distribution measurement system (GP multisense, Beltec Japan), and compared between right and left foot of each subject. The results showed all participants demonstrated a hemiplegic gait pattern.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Defects in the {{weight-bearing}} {{region of}} the foot sole can represent a substantial restriction in {{quality of life and}} pose a challenge for reconstructive plastic surgery. The {{purpose of this article is}} to report our experience with the use of medial plantar artery perforator (MPAP) flap for reconstruction of defects of the foot sole in 3 different regions: heel, <b>middle</b> foot <b>sole</b> and plantar forefoot. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2003 to May 2016, 28 patients (13 males and 15 females) with an average age of 54 years (range 12 to 84 y. o.) received reconstruction with 28 MPAP flaps. 26 flaps were harvested as pedicle perforator flaps and 2 as free perforator flaps. All flaps were raised from the ipsilateral instep area. The defect locations included the heel (20 cases), <b>middle</b> foot <b>sole</b> (4 cases) and forefoot (4 cases).

40|$|This paper investigates how {{the firm}} adjusts its {{internal}} structure and alters its incentive contracts {{in response to}} the market environment. Specifically, it is concerned with the firm’s optimal hierarchical struc-ture and the corresponding incentive contracts for the managers as a function of variables which are related to the degree of market com-petition, when the <b>middle</b> manager’s <b>sole</b> function is information-gathering. Consistent with recent empirical literature, we show that under one measure of market competitiveness, an increase in com-petitiveness leads the firm to flatten its hierarchy and offer stronger incentives to its agents. However, under another measure, the reverse is true. The paper therefore not only offers a theoretical rationale for some of the recent empirical findings regarding the relation between market competition and the internal structure of firms, but also pro-vides theoretical qualifications for these findings...|$|R

50|$|After The Judge's death, the Batenburger sect {{fragmented}} {{into several}} tiny groups, one of which, the Children of Emlichheim, {{was active in}} the <b>middle</b> 1550s.
