25|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
500|$|Hitchens first {{referred}} to The Rage Against God in August 2009, {{in one of}} his weekly columns: [...] "Above all, I seek to counter the assertion, central to my brother's case ... that the Soviet regime was in fact religious in character. This profound misunderstanding {{of the nature of the}} USSR is the key to finding another significant flaw in what is in general his circular argument". Then, a week before the book's publication, Hitchens wrote: [...] "...it is obvious <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say [...] arises out of my attempt to debate religion with him , it would be absurd to pretend that <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say here is not intended to counter or undermine arguments he presented in his book, God Is Not Great...".|$|E

Her natural poise and dynamism transcended all typical props and accessories. We've made great use here of our easy rapport." [...] Minogue commended the photo shoot at the time, saying [...] "So <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing at this time had a tiny budget so I {{brought a lot of}} pieces, including the pink glitter stick roll, from home [...] It was a great, simple shoot with a lot of heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "In 1929 I {{attended}} the Columbia School of Engineering for postgraduate study in electrical engineering. Columbia {{was the first}} institution that encouraged me to think rather than memorize. My teachers were notable in that many had gained practical engineering experience outside the university {{and were able to}} share their experience with their students. I am grateful, among others, to Professors Morecroft, Hehre, and Arendt. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have subsequently learned and accomplished in engineering is based on the solid foundation of principles I learned from them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taupin on his art: [...] "I don’t feel {{brighter}} colors necessarily constitute upbeat feelings although without contradiction {{they can}} accomplish the job if the emotion {{is one of}} simple joy. However, in much of my work darker colors such as blacks and deep blues might convey the depth of musical genres such as the Blues and Jazz or old school Folk and Country. These musical forms are the blueprint of <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> create {{so it could be}} said that their emotion and passion, which is exhilarating, brings a deeper style of muted exuberance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin {{repeatedly}} interrupted a major {{speech by}} U.S. President Barack Obama regarding United States {{policy in the}} War on Terror at the National Defense University on May 23, 2013. After Benjamin was removed for her actions, Mr. Obama then went off script. [...] "The voice of that woman is worth paying attention to," [...] he said. [...] "Obviously I {{do not agree with}} much of what she said. And obviously she wasn't listening to me and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said. But these are tough issues. And the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong." ...|$|E

I didn’t have that <b>much</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing, and I think if I had then it wouldn’t have been as good a track. I love the naiveté <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing back then, and I miss that a little bit now." ...|$|R
5000|$|King and Hatlen {{remained}} {{personally and}} professionally close throughout Hatlen's life. Hatlen's helped King develop his own writing style through his workshops. King often sent his unpublished manuscripts to Hatlen for his review and perusal. King told the Bangor Daily News that, [...] "He (Hatlen) saw so <b>much</b> more <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing than I did." [...] In turn, Hatlen wrote several scholarly essays and critiques of Stephen King's works.|$|R
2500|$|Although his {{journals}} clarify {{some aspects}} of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In December 1849, he wrote: [...] "Were I to die now the effect of {{my life would be}} exceptional; <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance and have a great effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amy Sherman-Palladino, {{who came}} from a {{background}} of writing for half-hour sitcoms, had Gilmore Girls approved by The WB after several of her previous pitches were turned down. On a whim, she suggested a show about a mother and daughter but had put little thought into the idea. Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show's setting of [...] "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" [...] after making a trip to Washington Depot, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: [...] "If I can make people feel this <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> felt walking around this fairy town, I {{thought that would be}} wonderful ... At the time I was there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie ... There was a longing for that in my own life, and I thought—that's something that I would really love to put out there." ...|$|E

6000|$|This exposé being made, {{it will be}} seen at once how <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> follows <b>I</b> {{claim to}} be my own writing; and {{it will also be}} {{understood}} that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were written by Mr. Poe. Even to those readers who have not seen the [...] "Messenger," [...] it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of style will be readily perceived.|$|R
6000|$|Thus {{the work}} of trading went on for three days, and, during that time, there was <b>much</b> fraternising <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> may call our home--Indians with the newcomers, and a great deal, I regret to say, of gambling. We found that this evil prevailed {{to a great extent}} among them, insomuch that one or two of them gambled away all that they possessed, and came to us with very {{penitent}} looks, asking for a small quantity of goods on credit to enable them to face the winter! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Madam Budd," [...] he answered, [...] "it {{is quite}} as you say, and I am only {{surprised}} {{where you have}} picked up so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call useful nautical knowledge." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, your Majesty. I {{have seen}} your great city, {{and it is}} a {{wonderful}} one. And my friend has shown me this palace, with its woods and its grounds.

6000|$|... "Think of that so priceless vintage drink like hogwash, as Mr. Bearsley say, {{by those}} god-dammed French swine, not a drop--not a spoonful remain. But the monks at Tavora still have <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they buy, <b>I</b> am told. They {{treasure}} it for they know good wine. All priests know good wine. Ah yes! Goddam!"

6000|$|Two {{or three}} of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps of their {{conversation}} across the room. At first I could not make <b>much</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the stranger; they both called him [...] "a beautiful man." [...] Louisa said he was [...] "a love of a creature," [...] and she [...] "adored him;" [...] and Mary instanced his [...] "pretty little mouth, and nice nose," [...] as her ideal of the charming.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly--excellent even; and I am much {{disposed}} {{to believe that}} you are one of that class." [...] Lowiny looked delighted; and I felt less reluctance at administering this flattery than might otherwise have been the case, from the circumstance that so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said was really merited.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like {{to praise}} him too much," [...] I rejoined, [...] "lest I should appear to praise myself; {{he reminds me}} so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was at his age. If your {{beautiful}} mother were to come to life for an hour she would see the resemblance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all {{you know}} about it!" [...] said Jock. [...] "She is not that sort. The poverty is nothing, but there's a fitness in things. Women, the best of them, think <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> suppose you call the row. It fits in with all their chivalry and romance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to all that, I have {{my opinion}} {{and you have}} yours. Can it be right that you should hold to your own and {{sacrifice}} me who have thought so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it is <b>I</b> want myself,--if in truth you love me? Let your opinion stand against mine, and neutralize it. Let mine stand against yours, and in that we shall be equal. Then after that let love be lord of all. If you love me, Marion, I think that I {{have a right to}} demand that you shall be my wife." ...|$|R
60|$|Lucy made {{no answer}} to this indiscreet and foolish speech. Why it was made, I scarce knew myself; but the heart has its bitter moods, when it prompts sentiments and {{declarations}} that are very little in accordance with its real impulses. I was so <b>much</b> ashamed <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had just said, and, in truth, so much frightened, that, instead of attempting to laugh it off, as a silly, unmeaning opinion, or endeavouring to explain {{that this was not}} my own way of thinking, I walked on some distance in silence, myself, and suffered my companion to imitate me in this particular. I have since had reason to think that Lucy was not pleased at my manner of treating the subject, though, blessed creature! she had another matter to communicate, that lay too heavy on her heart, to allow one of her generous, disinterested nature to think <b>much</b> <b>of</b> anything else.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{and a good}} {{translation}} it is, I {{have been}} told by one whom most people would think {{too young to be}} a judge. You must know that this Mr Hutchins has a son named William, who is considerably younger than I am, but he is such a clever, precocious fellow, that before he left home for college I used to find him a most interesting companion. Indeed, I owe to him <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> little <b>I</b> have learned, for he is a wonderful linguist, being able to read Hebrew and Greek about as easily as Latin or English. He is at Oxford now--at least he was there when I last heard of him. Moreover, it was through the Hutchins' family, in a roundabout way, that your mother, Olly, came to learn to write such letters as you have got so carefully stowed away there in your breast-pocket." ...|$|R
60|$|It was on Friday {{last that}} we finally {{resolved}} {{to make the}} experiment of awakening or attempting to awaken him; {{and it is the}} (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles--to so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.|$|E
60|$|I {{might have}} seen a great deal more, had there been time; and I have {{forgotten}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did see; {{but it is an}} exceedingly interesting place.

"Some {{people think}} that to be Indian, {{you have to do}} certain things, but I'm saying that you're Indian no matter what you do, but you have to decide {{what you want to do}} and you have to ask questions, like, am I doing {{something}} because it's expected of me to do, or am I doing it because I really believe this and it's really a part of me.

40|$|Plagiarism is {{a problem}} for a lot of International Foundation Programme {{students}} at London Metropolitan University, maybe because they are dealing with both a new concept and a new language. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the modules <b>I</b> teach on are concerned with is developing student academic writing and one session per semester is dedicated to helping students understand how to cite sources, paraphrase and avoid plagiarism. Nevertheless, when it comes to assessing written work, plagiarism is often still there.

40|$|In short, Cooper {{tells us}} {{not to worry about}} our current account or its {{underlying}} causes. I have a much darker and, I believe, more accurate view of our current account deficit. While <b>I</b> agree with <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Cooper says, <b>I</b> disagree most strongly with his central thesis that the current account portends no major problem. To the contrary, the current account is symptomatic of a longterm generational policy that has been slowly, but surely driving our nation broke. When the last straw hits the camel’s back, which could happen any day now, we’re going to see the bond and stock markets crash, interest rates soar, the dollar plunge, and inflation take off notwithstanding the Fed’s supposed independence.
