50|$|Another {{landmark}} {{application of}} scientific ideas to practical uses was the innovation {{of the brothers}} Wilbur and Orville Wright. In the 1890s they became fascinated with accounts of German glider experiments and began their own investigation into the principles of flight. Combining scientific knowledge and mechanical skills, the Wright brothers built and flew several gliders. Then, on December 17, 1903, they successfully flew the first heavier-than-air, <b>mechanically</b> <b>propelled</b> airplane.|$|R
