5|$|Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is {{visited by}} Mindy O’Dell (Jamie Ray Newman), who {{tells him to}} {{investigate}} Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) death. Mac (Tina Majorino) is called in for tech support when an animal research lab is raided and a valuable monkey is stolen, and Mac asks Veronica for help. The researchers believe that a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, {{but there is no}} reason to think that they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle of scotch unopened. At the next PHAT meeting, Veronica is asked to take action for animal rights in any way she sees fit. Keith presents the bottle of scotch as evidence of a murder of Dean O’Dell. Back at the lab, Veronica notices a coworker being <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monkey researchers. After a slight hazing ritual, Veronica and Mac are accepted into the group. In order to impress the leader of the group, Veronica, Mac, and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) participate in a party.|$|E

25|$|Angles, {{times of}} day, and other {{cyclical}} quantities require modular arithmetic to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, {{there will not}} be a unique mean. For example, the times an hour before and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It is also possible that no mean exists. Consider a color wheel -- there is no <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks when I think what it all may <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> College & this house”. He may have felt that Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E

500|$|Literary scholar Karl Kroeber (1926–2009) {{argues that}} Lucy [...] "possesses a double existence; her actual, {{historical}} existence and her idealised {{existence in the}} poet's mind. In the poem, Lucy is both actual and idealised, but her actuality is relevant only insofar as it makes manifest the significance implicit in the actual girl." [...] Hartman holds the same view; to him Lucy is seen [...] "entirely from within the poet, so that this modality may be the poet's own", but then he argues, [...] "she belongs to the category of spirits who must still become human... the poet describes her as dying at {{a point at which}} she would have been humanized." [...] The literary historian Kenneth Johnston concludes that Lucy was created as the personification of Wordsworth's muse, and the group as a whole [...] "is a series of invocations to a Muse feared dead. As epitaphs, they are not sad, a very inadequate word to describe them, but breathlessly, almost aware of what such a loss would <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> speaker: 'oh, the difference to me!'" ...|$|E
500|$|From {{early in}} his England career, D'Oliveira and his {{supporters}} saw the MCC tour of South Africa in 1968–69 as potentially being a key moment in his career. Guy Fraser-Sampson suggests: [...] "Nobody could be in any doubt {{that the possibility of}} D'Oliveira being chosen {{as a member of the}} England touring party would raise massive political complications". When D'Oliveira visited South Africa to work as a [...] coach in 1966, the subject was raised continually. People speculated whether D'Oliveira would be selected and, if so, whether the South African government would allow him to play. Some of his supporters worried that his acceptance of a place on a tour to South Africa might be interpreted as approval of the political situation there, but D'Oliveira was determined to play, aware of what it would <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-white people of South Africa. In 1967, Griffith flew to South Africa to discuss the forthcoming tour and to seek a solution to any potential problems—the MCC wanted the tour to go ahead without any political trouble. Little came of the meetings; Oborne suggests that both sides simply [...] "agreed to hope that the whole issue went away".|$|E

500|$|An {{official}} {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, {{and he and his}} wife and little daughter {{are on the verge of}} starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [...] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth." ...|$|E
500|$|The diaries {{of writers}} and journalists such as William Camden, Celia Fiennes, Daniel Defoe, John Byng and William Cobbett {{illustrate}} {{the decline of}} Ely after the 14th century plague and the 16th century reformation {{which led to the}} dissolution of the monastery in 1539. In the 1607 edition of Britannia, chorographic surveyor William Camden records that [...] "as for Ely it selfe, it is no small Citie, or greatly to be counted off either for beauty or frequency and resort, as having an unwholsome aire by reason of the fens round about". In 1698, Celia Fiennes was writing [...] "the Bishop [...] does not Care to stay long in this place not being for his health… they have lost their Charter… and its a shame [...] does not see it better ordered and ye buildings and streetes put in a better Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but ye takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle wch is of vast advantage". Daniel Defoe, when writing in the Eastern Counties section of A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1722), went [...] "to Ely, whose cathedral, standing in a level flat country, is seen far and wide… that some of it is so antient, totters so much with every gust of wind, looks so like a decay, and seems so near it, that when ever it does fall, all that 'tis likely will be thought strange in it, will be, that it did not fall a hundred years sooner". On his way to a Midlands tour, John Byng visited Ely on 5July 1790 staying at the Lamb Inn. In his diary he writes that [...] "the town [...] is <b>mean,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extreme… those withdrawn, their dependancies must decay". Recording in his Rural Rides on 25March 1830, William Cobbett reports that [...] "Ely is what one may call a miserable little town: very prettily situated, but poor and mean. Everything seems to be on the decline, as, indeed, is the case everywhere, where the clergy are the masters".|$|E

2500|$|Derby matches, [...] {{which are}} matches between two {{neighbouring}} rival clubs, are often fiercely competitive. Sometimes there are underlying political or sectarian tensions. The term often applies to matches between two {{teams from the}} same city or region, but it is sometimes {{used to refer to}} matches between big clubs from the same country. Derbies are usually treated as the most important matches by the fans, players and clubs, regardless of position in the league table, et cetera. The film Green Street embodies the spirit of derbies when one of the characters refers to the West Ham United versus Millwall Football Club rivalry as that of Israel against Palestine. Of course this film does focus on the mostly past era of hooliganism, however its depiction of matchday passion shows just how important derby day is to fans. When it comes to derbies, the culture of football thrives and shines in all its colours. How Soccer Explains the World is a perfect source into how derbies emerged and what they <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> community.|$|E
