50|$|Earliest uses of Ephedra spp. (<b>mahuang)</b> for {{specific}} illnesses {{date back to}} 5000 BC. Ephedrine and isomers were already isolated in 1881 from Ephedra dystachia and characterized by the Japanese organic chemist Nagai Nagayoshi of the 19th century. His work to access Ephedra drug materials to isolate a pure pharmaceutical substance, and the systematic production of semi-synthetic derivatives thereof is relevant still today as the three species Ephedra sinica, Ephedra vulgaris {{and to a lesser}} extent Ephedra equisetina are commercially grown in Mainland China as a source for natural ephedrines and isomers for use in pharmacy. E. sinica and E. vulgaris usually carry six optically active phenylethylamines, mostly ephedrine and pseudoephedrine with minor amounts of norephedrine, norpseudoephedrine as well as the three methylated analogs. Reliable information on the total alkaloid content of the crude drug is difficult to obtain. Based on HPLC analyses in industrial settings, the concentrations of total alkaloids in dried Herba Ephedra ranged between 1 and 4%, and in some cases up to 6%.|$|E

40|$|According to WHO global {{estimates}} from 2008, more than 1. 4 billion adults were overweight and among them, over 200 million men and 300 million women were obese. Although the main treatment modalities for overweight and obese individuals remain dieting and physical exercise, the synthetic anti-obesity medications have been increasingly used {{due to their}} perceived convenience. Generally, anti-obesity medications are classified as appetite suppressants or fat absorption blockers. In the present study, we examined the adverse side-effects in respect of behavior changes of phentermine and Ephedra sinica (<b>mahuang)</b> that are anti-obesity drugs currently distributed to domestic consumers. Phentermine is mainly classified as an anorexing agent and <b>mahuang</b> a thermogenic agent. Because phentermine and <b>mahuang</b> are considered to display effectiveness through the regulation of nerve system, their potential influences of on behavioral changes were examined employing animal experiments. From the results of experiments testing locomotor activity {{through the use of}} treadmill, rota-rod, and open field system, phentermine and <b>mahuang</b> were commonly revealed to induce behavioral changes of rats by reducing a motor ability, an ability to cope with an external stimulus, and a sense of balance or by augmenting wariness or excitement. These adverse effects of phenternime and <b>mahuang</b> in behavioral changes need to be identified in humans and anti-obesity medications such as phentermine and <b>mahuang</b> should be prescribed for only obesity where it is anticipated that the benefits of the treatment outweigh their potential risks...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>Mahuang</b> Zhisou Capsule (MHZSC), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, in treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infection of wind-cold syndrome. Methods: A multi-center, double-blind, double dummy, randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 240 patients were randomized into treatment group (120 cases, treated with MHZSC) and control group (120 cases, treated with <b>Mahuang</b> Zhisou Pill). The therapeutic course was 3 days. Results: Seven cases were excluded and three cases lost to follow-up. Two hundred and thirty-three cases entered intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 230 cases fitted in per-protocol population set (PPS) analysis. After treatment, the therapeutic effect of upper respiratory tract infection was calculated by ITT and PPS analysis respectively. The significant response rate and total response rate in the treatment group were 78. 07 % and 98. 25 ％ (ITT and PPS), while the significant response rates {{in the control group}} were 70. 59 % (ITT) and 70. 69 ％ (PPS), and the total response rates were 95. 80 ％ (ITT) and 95. 69 ％ (PPS) respectively. There {{were no significant differences in}} clinical efficacy between the two groups (P＞ 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} explore the {{dose-response}} patterns of Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae) in Shanghan Lun (Treatise on Febrile Diseases), all prescriptions containing Gancao in Shanghan Lun were analyzed by frequency and hierarchical clustering analysis. The doses of Gancao used in Shanghan Lun ranged from six zhu (Chinese unit, and one zhu is equal to 0. 65 g) to four liang (Chinese unit, and one liang is equal to 15. 625 g). Doses of one, two, three or four liang were commonly used. One liang Gancao as juvantia was usually matched with <b>Mahuang</b> (Herba Ephedrae), Xingren (Semen Armeniacae) and Guizhi (Ramulus Cinnamomi) for restricting the excessive diaphoresis of <b>Mahuang.</b> Two liang Gancao was often matched with some couple drugs, such as Guizhi and Shaoyao (Radix Paeoniae), Shigao (Gypsum Fibrosum) and Zhimu (Rhizoma Anemarrhenae), Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis) and Ganjiang (Rhizoma Zingiberis), for warming yang to supplement qi, nourishing yin, detoxifying Fuzi, and preventing qi impairment from heat evil. Three liang Gancao was mainly matched with Banxia (Rhizoma Pinelliae) or Renshen (Radix Ginseng) for treating middle energizer emesis. Four liang Gancao was matched with Ganjiang or tonifying herbs for invigorating vital qi and relieving spasm in deficiency syndromes with contraction, palpitation or diarrhea. Gancao is used for treating many syndromes in Shanghan Lun. It is frequently used to treat excess or heat syndromes {{with one or two}} liang in a dose and deficiency or cold syndromes with three or four liang in a dose...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the mechanisms of}} Chinese herbal medicine, much {{work has been done}} based on chemical constituent-target in the molecular system. It cannot comply with the holistic efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine. Thus, the authors of this paper proposed to study the functional target adopted from Western medicine. The data of Chinese herbal function were collected from 2005 edition of The People’s Republic of China Pharmacopoeia. A total of 135 functional targets were found, and a network about functional target and mode of action was built. The authors also explored the applications of functional target and the network combined with Sijunzi Decoction and <b>Mahuang</b> Decoction. The results, reflecting the feature of Chinese herbal medicine, will not only be helpful to elucidate the holistic mechanisms of Chinese herbal medicine, but also beneficial to studying the theory of Chinese formulas and developing new formulas...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the ephedrine alkaloid [(-) -ephedrine and (+) -pseudoephedrine] composition ratio of a crude Chinese herbal drug {{described in the}} Japanese Pharmacopoeia 'Ephedra herb (Chinese name: <b>Mahuang)</b> '. There were marked changes in the alkaloid composition ratio of wild plants in areas where {{both male and female}} clusters coexisted. However, in genetically homogeneous areas with the growth of male or female clusters alone, all of the coefficients of the regression lines were positive, but each gradient varied. This suggests that the alkaloid composition ratio has a clear tendency in each individual. Based on this, we cultivated individuals for vegetative propagation, and evaluated the alkaloid content ratio. Those propagated by separating the roots showed a specific tendency regardless of the cultivation area (Wakayama, Tanegashima). Those propagated by separating the herbaceous stem showed a specific tendency regardless of the soil or harvest time. In addition, we surveyed the (-) -ephedrine content ratio of 3 - to 6 -year-old strains. There was a high positive correlation coefficient between the previous and subsequent years. These findings suggest that the ephedrine alkaloid composition ratio of Ephedra herb depends on genetic factors, but not on environmental factors or the growth period...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mahuang</b> Gancao Ganjiang Decoction (MGGD) can {{effectively}} alleviate {{the symptoms of}} the patients suffering from exogenous cold stress. However, the curative mechanism has not been fully clarified. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the effect of MGGD on the apoptosis of lymphocytes induced by cold stress in mice. The model mice were randomly divided into four groups: the normal control group (no handling mice), cold stress group, MGGD + cold stress group, and MGGD group. Lymphocytes of the mice were isolated from the peripheral blood. Electron microscopy analysis revealed cold stress resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation. Accompanied with the change of morphology of mitochondria, ATP production and the activity of respiratory chain complex decreased in these cells. Western blot analysis showed that these cells expressed decreased fusion-related proteins Mitofusin 1 (Mfn 1), Mitofusin 2 (Mfn 2), and optic atrophy protein- 1 (Opa- 1) and increased fission-related proteins dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp 1) and fission 1 (Fis- 1); our results also show that decreased mitochondrial fusion induces cell apoptosis during cold stress. Meanwhile, we found MGGD can inhibit cell apoptosis induced by cold stress through regulating expression level of Mfn 1, Mfn 2, Drp 1, Fis- 1, and Opa- 1. These findings are very significant for understanding how MGGD regulates cold-stress-induced cell apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} (AR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common allergic diseases, which adversely affect patients’ quality of life. <b>Mahuang</b> Fuzi Xixin decoction (MFXD) has been widely used to treat AR in clinics in Asian countries. This study investigated the effect and possible therapeutic mechanisms of MFXD in the treatment of AR. A Wistar rat model of ovalbumin- (OVA-) induced AR was established and then treated with three doses of MFXD; AR symptoms, serum total immunoglobulin E, histamine, histopathological features, and release and expression of factors related to type 1 helper T (Th 1) and type 2 helper T (Th 2) responses were analyzed. Our study demonstrated that MFXD has a good therapeutic effect on OVA-induced allergic inflammation in an AR rat model as manifested in reduced frequencies of sneezing and nasal scratching and in reduced serum levels of total IgE and HIS. In addition, MFXD regulates imbalance in Th 1 /Th 2 cells caused by AR by simultaneously attenuating Th 1 and Th 2 responses, such as by reducing the serum levels of IFN-γ and IL- 4 and mRNA expression levels of IFN-γ, IL- 4, GATA- 3, and STAT- 6. This study provided valuable information on the immunoregulatory effect of MFXD for the treatment of AR in future clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} laws in {{syndrome}} differentiation of Taiyang {{disease and the}} prescriptions and herbs used in its treatment in Shanghan Lun (Treatise on Febrile Diseases). Methods: The occurrence rates of main syndromes of Taiyang disease, and the usage frequency of the prescriptions and herbs in its treatment were calculated, and the laws in syndrome differentiation and herbal medication were analyzed by hierarchical clustering analysis. Results: Fever and aversion to cold {{were found to be}} the main symptoms of Taiyang disease and usually accompanied with headache, absent sweating, neck stiff, floating and tight pulse, and body ache. The accompanying or aggravated symptoms could be classified into lung system syndrome with the manifestations of sweating and asthma, spleen-deficiency syndrome with the manifestations of gastric fullness and diarrhea, stomach syndrome with vomit and constipation. Guizhi decoction was the main prescription used in the treatment of Taiyang disease. <b>Mahuang</b> (Herba Ephedrae) matching Xingren (Semen Armeniacae), Dahuang (Radix et Rhizoma Rhei) matching Mangxiao (Natrii Sulfas), Baizhu (Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae) matching Fuling (Poria), Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis) matching Ganjiang (Rhizoma Zingiberis), Chaihu (Radix Bupleuri) matching Huangqin (Radix Scutellariae), Banxia (Rhizoma Pinelliae), and Renshen (Radix Ginseng) as the main compatibilities were used in treating lung diseases, stomach diseases, spleen-deficiency diseases, kidney-deficiency diseases and Shaoyang diseases respectively. Conclusion: Exterior syndrome, as a common syndrome in Taiyang disease, is usually treated with Guizhi decoction. The change in syndromes from upper-energizer to lower-energizer in exterior disease can be found from the change of symptoms and the use of herbs. And the development from defending stage to qi stage in exterior disease {{can be found in the}} use of prescriptions in Shanghan Lun...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Mahuang</b> {{decoction}} (MHD), {{a famous}} classic traditional Chinese formula, {{has been extensively}} applied for treating cold, influenza, asthma, acute bronchitis, and other pulmonary diseases. However, the interaction among four drugs of MHD has not been clearly deciphered from the aspect of molecular composition. Objective: To assess the quality of MHD and explore the interplay among different prescription drugs. Materials and Methods: A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled with diode array detector (DAD) method for the simultaneous separation and determination of nine bioactive components was developed. A somatomedin A (SMA) -phenyl column (4. 6 mm Χ 250 mm, 5 μm) was eluted by a gradient mobile phase contained acetonitrile and 0. 05 % formic acid- 0. 05 % triethylamine aqueous solution. Four detection wavelengths (210, 252, 278, and 291 nm) were utilized for the quantitative analysis due to the different ultraviolet (UV) spectra of these compounds. Results: Satisfactory separation was obtained for all the components, and the assay was fully validated in respects of linearity, precision, stability, and accuracy. It {{was found that the}} calibration curves for all analytes showed good linearity (R 2 ≥ 0. 9991) within the test ranges. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for intra- and interday repeatability were not more than 1. 70 and 2. 66 %, respectively. The spike recoveries of nine components varied from 97. 50 ± 1. 69 to 99. 27 ± 1. 37 %. Conclusion: The established method was successfully applied to analyze nine active compounds in decoction samples of various drug compatibilities of MHD. The variations of contents were obvious for different combinations, which hinted the mutual promotion or inhibition of componential dissolution among four herbs of MHD...|$|E

Methods: Ninety Wistar rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, model group, hydrocortisone group, Herba Ephedra Sinicae group, Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis group and Herba Ephedra Sinicae plus Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis group. There were 16 rats {{in each group}} except the sham operation group (10 rats). Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by a single intratracheal injection of bleomycin A 5. Hematoxylin and eosin straining and immunohistochecical method were used after 7 - and 28 -day treatment to observe the pathology of lung injury, measure the inner diameter of pulmonary arterioles and the density of nuclear membrane. Results: Compared with the sham operation group at 7 and 28 d, alveolar inflammation level was significantly increased in the model group (P＜ 0. 01). Alveolar inflammation level was decreased obviously in the hydrocortisone group (P＜ 0. 05) after 7 - and 28 -day treatment {{as compared with the}} model group, and that in Herba Ephedra Sinicae plus Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis group was also decreased obviously (P＜ 0. 05) at 28 d. Compared with the sham operation group, nuclear density of the model group was increased, while its inner diameter was decreased (P＜ 0. 05). In the Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis group, Herba Ephedra Sinicae plus Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis group and hydrocortisone group, the nuclear density was decreased (P＜ 0. 05) as compared with the model group. Inner diameter in the Herba Ephedra Sinicae group, Herba Ephedra Sinicae plus Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis group and hydrocortisone group was higher than that in the model group (P＜ 0. 05). Microvessel density of the model group was obviously higher than that of the sham operation group (P＜ 0. 05).
