40|$|Abstract Background Surveys {{of doctors}} are an {{important}} data collection method in health services research. Ways to improve response rates, minimise survey response bias and item non-response, within a given budget, have not previously been addressed in the same study. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare the effects and costs of three different modes of survey administration in a national survey of doctors. Methods A stratified random sample of 4. 9 % (2, 702 / 54, 160) of doctors undertaking clinical practice was drawn from a national directory of all doctors in Australia. Stratification was by four doctor types: general practitioners, specialists, specialists-in-training, and hospital non-specialists, and by six rural/remote categories. A three-arm parallel trial design with equal randomisation across arms was used. Doctors were randomly allocated to: online questionnaire (902); simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> (a paper questionnaire and login details sent together) (900); or, sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> (online followed by a paper questionnaire with the reminder) (900). Analysis was by intention to treat, as within each primary mode, doctors could choose either paper or online. Primary outcome measures were response rate, survey response bias, item non-response, and cost. Results The online mode had a response rate 12. 95 %, followed by the simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> with 19. 7 %, and the sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> with 20. 7 %. After adjusting for observed differences between the groups, the online mode had a 7 percentage point lower response rate compared to the simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode,</b> and a 7. 7 percentage point lower response rate compared to sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode.</b> The difference in response rate between the sequential and simultaneous modes was not statistically significant. Both <b>mixed</b> <b>modes</b> showed evidence of response bias, whilst the characteristics of online respondents were similar to the population. However, the online mode had a higher rate of item non-response compared to both <b>mixed</b> <b>modes.</b> The total cost of the online survey was 38 % lower than simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> and 22 % lower than sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode.</b> The cost of the sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> was 14 % lower than simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode.</b> Compared to the online <b>mode,</b> the sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> was the most cost-effective, although exhibiting some evidence of response bias. Conclusions Decisions on which survey mode to use depend on response rates, response bias, item non-response and costs. The sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> appears to be the most cost-effective mode of survey administration for surveys of the population of doctors, if one is prepared to accept a degree of response bias.

40|$|AbstractThe {{failure of}} cracked rock masses is mainly {{due to the}} {{influence}} of both opening (mode I) and sliding (mode II) of deformation. In this paper, <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> I/II fracture toughness of an Iranian white marble (Harsin marble) was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Several <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> fracture tests were conducted on Harsin marble using cracked semi circular bend (SCB) specimens to obtain the <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> fracture resistance envelope in the complete range from pure mode I to pure mode II. However, the experimental results were not consistent with the classical <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> brittle fracture criteria. It was demonstrated that the low fracture resistance of the tested rock was mainly due {{to the influence of}} large positive T-stresses that exist in the SCB specimen when the specimen is subjected to <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> loading. It was also shown that the GMTS criterion which uses three fracture parameters i. e.

40|$|Many {{different}} {{failure criteria}} {{have been suggested}} for <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> delamination toughness, but few sets of <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> data exist that are consistent over the full mode I opening to mode II shear load range. The <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> bending (MMB) {{test was used to}} measure the delamination toughness of a brittle epoxy composite, a state of the art toughened epoxy composite, and a tough thermoplastic composite over the full <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> range. To gain insight into the different failure responses of the different materials, the delamination fracture surfaces were also examined. An evaluation of several failure criteria which {{have been reported in the}} literature was performed, and the range of responses modeled by each criterion was analyzed. A new bilinear failure criterion was analyzed. A new bilinear failure criterion was developed based on a change in the failure mechanism observed from the delamination surfaces. The different criteria were compared to the failure criterion. The failure response of the tough thermoplastic composite could be modeled well with the bilinear criterion but could also be modeled with the more simple linear failure criterion. Since the materials differed in their <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> failure response, <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> delamination testing will be needed to characterize a composite material. A critical evaluation is provided of the <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> failure criteria and should provide general guidance for selecting an appropriate criterion for other materials...|$|R

Via a standard procedure of field quantization, the Fröhlich Hamiltonians of electron-(IO-PR) mixing phonons interaction are obtained. The orthogonal relations of polarization eigenvectors for these IO-PR <b>mixing</b> <b>modes</b> are also displayed. Numerical calculations for a wurtzite GaN cylindrical QD are focused on the quantum size effect on the dispersive properties of IO-PR <b>mixing</b> <b>modes.</b> The results reveal that both the radial-direction size and the axial-direction size have great effect on the dispersive frequencies of the IO-PR <b>mixing</b> phonon <b>modes.</b> The limiting features of dispersive curves of these phonon modes are discussed in depth. The phonon modes "reducing" the behavior of wurtzite quantum confined structures have been explicitly observed in the systems. Moreover, the behaviors that the IO-PR <b>mixing</b> phonon <b>modes</b> in wurtzite Q 0 D QDs reduce to the IO modes and PR modes in wurtzite Q 2 D QW and Q 1 D QWR systems are profoundly analyzed both from the viewpoint of physics and mathematics.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The double cantilever beam (DCB) fracture problem has been studied by many researchers for several decades. Many analytical theories, numerical and experimental methods {{have been developed for}} understanding the fracture initiation and propagation, however considerable confusion has arisen in calculating the mode I and II energy release rates (ERR) of <b>mixed</b> <b>modes.</b> In this work, new analytical <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> partition theories are developed for DCBs with rigid and non-rigid interfaces based on Euler beam theory, Timoshenko beam theory and 2 D elasticity theory. Most of the confusion is cleared up. Based on Wang-Harvey's <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> partition theories for straight DCB, two sets of pure modes are successfully and clearly proven by analytical derivations for curved DCB with rigid interface. From these two sets of pure <b>modes,</b> two new <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> partition theories are developed for curved DCB with rigid interface based on both Euler beam theory and Timoshenko beam theory respectively. Two sets of pure <b>modes</b> and the <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> partition theories are validated against numerical simulations and excellent agreements are achieved. Then these <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> partition theories for rigid interfaces are extended to non-rigid cohesive interfaces for DCBs within the contexts of 2 D elasticity theory based on Wang-Harvey's work which is within the contexts of Euler beam theory and Timoshenko beam theory. A new <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> partition theory is developed and axial forces are taken into consideration in this <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> partition theories for non-rigid interface DCBs. Within the context of 2 D elasticity, a <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> partition theory is developed using the two sets of orthogonal pure modes from Euler beam theory with rigid interfaces and a powerful orthogonal pure mode methodology. Fully analytical partition theories are developed to calculate the ERR of the bending moment and axial force loading contribution, and empirical formulas are developed to calculate the ERR of the shear force loading contribution with any interface stiffness and geometry. So with any loading conditions, interface stiffness and geometry, total ERR and its partitions can be calculated without any FEM simulations.

40|$|Context. There are {{now more}} than 22 months of long-cadence data {{available}} for thousands of red giants observed with the Kepler space mission. Consequently, we are able to clearly resolve fine details in their oscillation spectra and see many components of the <b>mixed</b> <b>modes</b> that probe the stellar core. Aims. We report {{for the first time a}} parametric fit to the pattern of the ℓ = 1 <b>mixed</b> <b>modes</b> in red giants, which is a powerful tool to identify gravity-dominated <b>mixed</b> <b>modes.</b> With these modes, which share the characteristics of pressure and gravity modes, we are able to probe directly the helium core and the surrounding shell where hydrogen is burning. Methods. We propose two ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequencies of the <b>mixed</b> <b>modes.</b> Firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describe the main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a quasi-asymptotic mixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations and the stellar interior structure. We used period échelle diagrams to emphasize the detection of the gravity-dominated <b>mixed</b> <b>modes.</b> Results. The asymptotic relation for <b>mixed</b> <b>modes</b> is confirmed. It allows us to measure the gravity-mode period spacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. The identification of the gravity-dominated <b>mixed</b> <b>modes</b> allows us to complete the identification of all major peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences for the true identification of ℓ = 3 modes, of ℓ = 2 <b>mixed</b> <b>modes,</b> for the mode widths and amplitudes, and for the ℓ = 1 rotational splittings. Conclusions. The accurate measurement of the gravity-mode period spacing provides an effective probe of the inner, g-mode cavity. The derived value of the coupling coefficient between the cavities is different for red giant branch and clump stars. This provides a probe of the hydrogen-shell burning region that surrounds the helium core.

Many industrial examples show the presence of <b>mode</b> II and <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> I + II loading in machine/structural components. In the present study, an emphasis is laid to study {{the size and shape}} of the plastic zone at the crack tip under mode I, <b>mode</b> II and <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> I + II loading conditions. The shape and size of crack-tip plastic zones have been estimated in a Compact tensile shear (CTS) specimen under <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> loading according to von Mises yield criteria. The results obtained are analyzed with reference to loading angle and effective stress intensity factor. Index Terms—plastic zone size, <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> I/II, finite element analysis, CTS specimen I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Grounding {{forms an}} inseparable {{part of all}} {{electronic}} and electrical designs, from circuit through system up to installation design. All the ground pins of the system should be tied to the analog ground plane, separated from the system’s digital logic ground, to achieve optimum performance in a <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> circuit. The ESD indirect discharge test is carried out to predict the effect of ESD on data in a <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> circuit when the analog and digital grounds are common and separate. The Indirect discharge is done for different voltages and distances. The susceptibility of a circuit to ESD can be greatly reduced by properly grounding it which is observed in the <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> circuit. In the <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> circuit the data is affected more by the ESD transients based on the discharge voltage given when the analog and digital grounds are common than {{when compared with the}} grounds being separate...|$|R
40|$|Since few decades, asteroseismology, {{the study}} of stellar oscillations, enables us to probe the {{interiors}} of stars with great precision. It allows stringent tests of stellar models and can provide accurate radii, masses and ages for individual stars. Of particular interest are the <b>mixed</b> <b>modes</b> that occur in subgiant solar-like stars since they can place very strong constraints on stellar ages. Here we measure {{the characteristics of the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>modes,</b> particularly the coupling strength, using a grid of stellar models for stars with masses between 0. 9 and 1. 5 M_. We show that the coupling strength of the ℓ = 1 <b>mixed</b> <b>modes</b> is predominantly a function of stellar mass and appears to be independent of metallicity. This should allow an accurate mass evaluation, further increasing the usefulness of <b>mixed</b> <b>modes</b> in subgiants as asteroseismic tools.
