50|$|Tarkiln Bayou Preserve State Park is a 4290 acre preserve, {{a unit of}} Florida State Park located 10 mi {{southwest}} of Pensacola, in northwestern Florida.

The rare, carnivorous white-top <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant</b> is unique to the Gulf Coast and found only between the Apalachicola and Mississippi rivers. Almost 100 other rare plants and animals depend on the wet prairie habitat, including the alligator snapping turtle, <b>sweet</b> <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant,</b> and Chapman's butterwort. Tarkiln Bayou Preserve State Park is located in Escambia County about 1.5 mi south of the intersection of U.S. Hwy. 98 and State Road 293.|$|R

40|$|The {{leaves of}} the {{carnivorous}} Sarracenia purpurea (Purple <b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant)</b> provide habitat for obligate insects. Within the <b>pitchers</b> of this <b>plant,</b> Metriocnemus knabi (<b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant</b> Midge) larvae coexist with Wyeomyia smithii (<b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant</b> Mosquito) larvae. No other mosquito species {{has been reported to}} utilize this habitat {{in the presence of the}} midge. We tested whether the midge larvae were responsible for the elimination of other mosquito species. We introduced 1 Aedes triseriatus (Eastern Treehole Mosquito) larva, into each of 90 different pitchers. After 45 – 75 minutes, we extracted the fluid from the Purple <b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant</b> and counted mosquito and midge larvae. Although 98 % of <b>pitchers</b> contained <b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant</b> Mosquito larvae, we did not detect 61 of the Eastern Treehole Mosquito larvae. Of the 29 surviving introduced larvae, we found 13 (45 %) in pitchers that had no midge larvae. Drier than normal conditions in 2012 provided the opportunity to investigate Purple <b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant</b> leaves devoid of water and obligate insect larvae, and the potential for foreign mosquito larvae to colonize unoccupied pitchers. We found <b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant</b> Midge or <b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant</b> Mosquito larvae within 13 days following the addition of water. We observed no foreign mosquito larvae. The inquiline larvae did not develop when we added water to dry pitchers in the laboratory, suggesting that oviposition by <b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant</b> Midge and Pither Plant Mosquito adults occurred after a rainfall event. During dry conditions, shaded Purple <b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plants</b> retained some fluids, and adults likely completed their life cycle in these plants. However, severe, prolonged drought may eliminate Purple <b>Pitcher</b> <b>Plant</b> inquilines and potentially make the pitchers available for exotic mosquito larvae...|$|R

5000|$|Embedded {{within the}} {{longleaf}} pine ecosystem are countless varieties of microhabitats. Among the more unique of these habitats are <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant</b> bogs. <b>Pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> and their companion plants are specialized {{to exist in}} a narrow set of conditions. Soil moisture is critical and many [...] "bog" [...] communities are actually {{the result of a}} hard, impermeable clay layer beneath porous sand. Rainwater seeps through the sand but runs into a clay layer where it is either trapped (like a pool) or seeps out the side of a hill. These nutrient-poor, moist sites are ideal for the carnivorous <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants.</b> Bogs common to many [...] "flatwood" [...] longleaf areas are called [...] "wet prairies" [...] while other bogs found on hillsides are called [...] "seepage slopes". The transition from forest to an open bog is not immediate. Forests usually grade into a wetland bog habitat. This transition area is called an ecotone and hosts a rich variety of plant and animal species. [...] <b>Pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> have modified leaves shaped into hollow tubes (that look like a water pitcher), which attract insects. Downward pointing hairs and slippery walls make escape difficult and the insects are dissolved and digested by enzymes {{in the bottom of the}} <b>pitcher.</b> Other <b>plants</b> trap small insects on flat sticky leaves before slowly digesting them.Several types of <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> as well as other carnivorous plants grow in the longleaf pine ecosystem. Species include the hooded <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant,</b> trumpet <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant,</b> white-topped <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant,</b> and parrot <b>pitcher</b> <b>plant.</b> Other bog plants include colic-root; goldcrest; meadow-beauty (also called deerflower); white-topped sedge; orange milkwort (also called bog [...] "Cheetos" [...] because of their resemblance to that treat); bog-buttons (also called [...] "hatpins"); several species of orchids; and many other wildflowers. [...] Both soil moisture conditions and full sun are critical to these plants. Most of these bog plants have little shade tolerance. <b>Pitcher</b> <b>plant</b> bogs are fire dependent habitats. The frequent fires common to the longleaf ecosystem keep woody shrubs from encroaching on bogs. Without fire, moisture-loving shrubs invade drying up bogs and shading out the herbaceous plants.|$|R
40|$|Natural History & EvolutionSarracenia purpurea, {{commonly}} known as purple <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants,</b> are carnivorous plants found in wetlands with low nutrients. We compared <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> between {{two different types of}} wetlands, a bog and a swale, to determine if the different habitats affected their phenotypic characteristics. We hypothesized that the <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> at Grass Bay would be, on average, larger than the <b>pitcher</b> <b>plants</b> at Mud Lake Bog due to less environmental stress, and that plants with more red colored pitchers would have a higher mass of insect catch than <b>plants</b> with greener <b>pitchers.</b> Height, width, color, number of <b>pitchers</b> per <b>plant,</b> and density of insect catch were recorded at each site, and compared between the two sites. We found that Mud Lake Bog had plants with a higher average insect catch density and also higher average proportion of red <b>pitchers</b> to <b>plants</b> at Grass Bay. Our results suggest that environmental pressures do have an impact on phenotypic traits of S. purpurea...|$|R
