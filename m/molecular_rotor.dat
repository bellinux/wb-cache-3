Many disease states have associated blood viscosity changes. <b>Molecular</b> <b>rotors,</b> fluorescent molecules with viscosity sensitive quantum yields, have recently been investigated as a new method for biofluid viscosity measurement. Biofluid viscosity measurements by conventional methods are complicated by protein adherence to surfaces and formation of air-surface layers.

40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{dynamics}} of polymerization are critical in many medical applications; for instance, polymers used to fill aneurysms must be timed accurately. Two distinct methods were examined {{for their ability}} to probe the polymerization kinetics of different polymers and to predict the onset of polymerization. <b>Molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> are a class of fluorophores with two de-excitation pathways: fluorescence emission and intramolecular rotation. Highly viscous solvents provide a constrained environment in which intramolecular rotation is inhibited, and radiation is the preferred pathway. It is hypothesized that during polymerization steric hindrance of the intramolecular rotation leads to increased fluorescence emission intensity. Magnetoelastic (ME) sensors have been used to measure fluid viscosity. In a time varying magnetic field, a magnetoelastic strip oscillates at its viscosity-dependent resonant frequency creating a magnetic flux that is detected. Subsequently, viscosity can be analyzed by measuring quantities such as resonance frequency, signal voltage, and Q-factor. In this study, fluorescent <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> and magnetoelastic sensors were evaluated for their efficacy in monitoring the polymerization {{dynamics of}} acrylamide gels, collagen, and sol-gels. The ME sensor was effective in characterizing the polymerization dynamics of acrylamide and sol-gel, where a reduced Q-factor indicated mechanical dampening of the oscillation in the polymerized state. For unknown reasons, the ME sensor was unable to characterize the polymerization of collagen. However, the <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> sensed the polymerization of collagen and sol-gel though a marked increase of emission intensity. <b>Molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> deteriorate from ammonium persulfate (APS), a strong oxidant and catalyst for cross-linking in the acrylamide system. While ME sensors are effective in characterizing several polymerization reactions, <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> are more effective in monitoring the polymerization of proteins such as collagen.

The goal {{of this study was}} to test the idea that increasing the chain length of the <b>molecular</b> <b>rotor</b> increases its viscosity sensitivity. Molecular rotors of varying chain length were selected for experimentation; DCVJ, a thoroughly studied <b>molecular</b> <b>rotor,</b> was chosen as the control. Mixtures of differing ratios of ethylene glycol and glycerol were created to vary viscosity. Fluorescence emission intensity data for the six molecular rotors was measured with a Jobin Yvon Fluoromax- 3 spectrofluorometer.

However, the slopes for the various molecular rotors were not significantly different.

Visualization {{and the ability to}} predict the real contact area between touching objects is a subject of a considerable interest, because the real contact area {{plays an important role in}} friction. In this thesis, a method that enables us to visualize mechanical contacts by using fluorescent <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> is described, and photophysical characterization of such molecules is examined in detail by means of steady-state, time-resolved fluorescence and transient spectroscopy techniques. To visualize the real contact area between solid surfaces, we developed a method based on fluorescent <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> immobilized on a solid glass substrate. Fluorescent <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> are weakly fluorescent in low-viscosity solvents, because internal rotational motions result in a rapid decay of the excited state, such that the emission of a fluorescence photon is not fast enough to compete effectively. In high viscosity liquids and polymer matrices, however, such motions become severely hindered. Therefore, the molecules can remain in the excited state much longer, and become strongly fluorescent.

40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{purpose of}} this project is to {{determine}} the binding properties of <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> with macromolecules, specifically plasma proteins. This is to aid {{in the development of a}} viscometer based on <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> that could be used on blood plasma by determining to what effect the presence of these proteins will affect the measurements of the viscometer so that it may be put into use in the medical field. <b>Molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> are a class of florescent molecules that form a twisted internal charge transfer complex upon excitation, they have a preferred de-excitation pathway of rotation about a C=C double bond. When molecular free volume is limited, rotation about this bond is hindered and fluorescence probability increases. The intensity of the fluorescence of these molecules can be used as a measure of the viscosity of the solvent. Intensity and viscosity are related by the following equation: log F = C + x log h where F is the fluorescent yield, h is the viscosity, and x and C are constants. The rotors in this study are CCVJ (9 -[(2 -Cyano- 2 -hydroxy carbonal) vinyl] julolidine) and CCVJ-TEG (9 -[(2 -Cyano- 2 -hydroxy carbonal) vinyl] julolidine triethyleneglycol). The affinity of these <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> to various plasma proteins is determined by comparing the solubility of the <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> in proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous solutions. The <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> are allowed to diffuse through a dialysis membrane until the equilibrium between the two solutions is reached. The concentration of the rotors in the solutions was determined by measuring the absorbance of these solutions according to the Beer-Lambert law: A= e * c where A is absorbance, e is the extinction coefficient of the specific substance at the specific wavelength, and c is the concentration of that substance. The proteins tested in this manner were albumin, fibrinogen, and IgG. Bovine proteins were used because all mammalian proteins are very similar and bovine proteins are easier to obtain than human proteins. The results show that CCVJ and CCVJ-TEG are very strongly attracted to Albumin, and weakly attracted to fibrinogen. This attraction may affect the fluorescence of the rotor molecules, meaning that in developing these <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> as viscosity sensors for blood plasma, further studies must be performed to determine the effect of the proteins on the fluorescent behavior of the rotors so that the protein composition of the plasma can be accounted for.

40|$|Abstract—Molecular rotors are {{fluorescent}} molecules with a viscosity-sensitive {{quantum yield}} {{that are often}} used to measure visc-osity changes in cell membranes and liposomes. However, commercially available <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors,</b> such as DCVJ (1) do not localize in cell membranes but rapidly migrate into the cytoplasm leading to unreliable measurements of cell membrane viscosity. To overcome this problem, we synthesized <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> covalently attached to a phospholipid scaffold.

Moreover, these new rotors enabled the monitoring of phospholipid transition temperature. However, attachment of the rotor groups to the hydrophilic head of the phospholipid led to a partial loss of viscosity sensitivity.

Previously, we have demonstrated that viscosity sensitive fluorophores termed ‘molecular rotors’, when freely mixed with monomers of interest, are able to report on changes in microrheology accompanying amyloid formation, and measured an increase in rigidity of approximately three orders of magnitude during aggregation of lysozyme and insulin. Here we extend this strategy by covalently attaching <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> to several proteins capable of assembly into fibrils, namely lysozyme, fibrinogen and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ(1 – 42)).

40|$|Abstract only availableAn {{empirical}} {{relationship between}} molecular free volume and viscosity {{has been established}} (Doolittle AK, J Appl. Phys. 1952; 23 : 236 - 9). Non-Newtonian fluids hold much importance to scientific study because of their ubiquity in nature - from gelatins to starches to blood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the relationship between molecular free volume and viscosity in non-Newtonian fluids under shear-thinning conditions. <b>Molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> are fluorescent probes for free volume. After photoexcitation, these molecules can decay from their singlet state either through radiation (fluorescence) or torsional relaxation (intramolecular rotation). In environments with low free volume, intramolecular rotation is hindered, and the radiative deexcitation pathway becomes dominant. This behavior is accompanied by a measurable increase in fluorescence intensity. <b>Molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> have been used successfully as viscosity probes in various fluids and polymers. Two <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors,</b> CCVJ (9 -(2 -carboxy- 2 -cyano) -vinyl-julolidine) and CCVJ-TEG (CCVJ-triethyleneglycol ester), were dissolved at 10 µM in an aqueous solution of KelcoGelF (gellan gum) and subjected to shear forces both in a tube shear apparatus for fluorescence measurements and in a Haake VT- 550 rheometer to determine the shear-thinning behavior. The gellan solution exhibited power-law behavior with an exponent n= 0. 48. In spite of this strong shear-thinning behavior, no change in rotor emission intensity was observed. Additionally, a novel behavior of some <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors,</b> a sensitivity towards fluid flow (Haidekker MA et al, Sensor Lett. 2005; 3 : 42 - 8), was exploited to observe shear-thinning behavior by probing flow velocity in a tube. Under application of sufficiently high shear rates to cause shear thinning, <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> revealed no change in free volume as observed with fluorescence intensity.

IgG formulations with polysorbate 20 or 80 were stressed below the aggregation temperature and analyzed by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence and by HP-SEC with UV and fluorescent dye detection (Bis-ANS and CCVJ). Furthermore, commercial protein preparations of therapeutic proteins (Enbrel® 50 mg, Humira® 40 mg and MabThera® 100 mg) were aggregated accordingly and analyzed with CCVJ fluorescence and HP-SEC.

50|$|The {{appearance}} of rotational fine structure {{is determined by}} the symmetry of the <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> which are classified, {{in the same way as}} for pure rotational spectroscopy, into linear molecules, spherical-, symmetric- and asymmetric- rotor classes. The quantum mechanical treatment of rotational fine structure is the same as for pure rotation.|$|R
40|$|A modular {{molecular}} kit for {{the preparation}} of crystalline <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> was devised from a set of stators and rotators to gain simple access to {{a large number of}} structures with different dynamic performance and physical properties. In this paper, we have accomplished this with crystalline <b>molecular</b> <b>rotors</b> self-assembled by halogen bonding of di-azabicylo[2. 2. 2]octane (DABCO), acting as a rotator, and a set of five fluorine-substituted iodobenzenes that take the role of the stator. Using variable temperature 1 H T 1 spin lattice relaxation measurements, we have shown that all structures display ultrafast Brownian rotation with activation energies ranging from 2. 4 to 4. 9 kcal/mol and a pre-exponential factors of the order of 1 - 9 x 1012 s- 1. Lineshape analysis of quadrupo-lar echo 2 H NMR measurements in selected examples indicated rotational trajectories consistent with the 3 -fold or 6 fold symmetric potential of the rotator...|$|R
