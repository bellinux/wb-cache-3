25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical <b>maximum</b> <b>displacement</b> is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.|$|E

This method is based on the limitation of stresses in the steel profile below the yield limit, and on the use of a simple relationship to account for the connection flexibility.

40|$|An {{analytical}} study {{investigating the}} performance of seismically isolated bridge structures subjected to earthquake excitation is summarized. Here, performance is assessed using the following descriptors: <b>maximum</b> isolator <b>displacement</b> and energy demand imposed on individual seismic isolators. Nonlinear response-history analysis is employed considering twenty different isolation systems and three bins of earthquake ground motions. Results of these analyses are used to: (1) review {{the accuracy of the}} current AASHTO equation for the calculation of displacements in seismically isolated bridge structures, (2) determine the increase in <b>maximum</b> horizontal <b>displacement</b> of a seismic isolator due to bidirectional seismic excitation, and (3) review the current AASHTO prototype testing requirements for seismic isolators under seismic loading conditions. The current AASHTO equation for calculating <b>maximum</b> isolator <b>displacements</b> is shown to underestimate median <b>maximum</b> horizontal <b>displacements</b> determined from bidirectional nonlinear response-history analysis. <b>Maximum</b> isolator <b>displacements</b> determined from bidirectional seismic excitation are shown to be significantly larger than those considering unidirectional seismic excitation. Two factors contributing to the increase in <b>maximum</b> isolator <b>displacement</b> are identified; additional displacement demand from a second (orthogonal) component, and the coupled response of seismic isolators. The current prototype testing requirements for seismic loading specified by AASHTO are shown to result in energy demands that are inconsistent with those determined from numerical simulation of maximum earthquake shaking. An improved prototype testing protocol for seismic isolators subjected to seismic loading is proposed...|$|R

[...] Despite later rumors that Studebaker had copied the Cadillac OHV V8 design, Cadillac OHV V8s {{were not available}} to the public until 1949, and therefore, not available for Studebaker to study until Studebaker's own engine was well into development. [...] The Studebaker engine also had features not found in the Cadillac design. [...] Testing was well under way by early 1950, and the first production units were installed in late 1950 model-year Commanders, thereby becoming the first OHV V8 available in a low-priced American sedan. [...] The engine was officially available in 1951 model-year Commanders and Commander Land Cruisers. [...] The engine displaced 232.6 cubic inches with a bore of 3.375 inches and stroke of 3.250 inches. [...] It produced 120hp at 4000 rpm, and 190lb. ft. torque at 2000 rpm.
