Data showed that young people recognise existing traditional gender norms as well as changing and flexible gender roles in Ghanaian society. Data from the field also revealed largely negative attitudes to homosexuality from both <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> <b>students</b> <b>and</b> non-students.
