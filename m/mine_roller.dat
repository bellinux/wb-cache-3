25|$|<b>Mine</b> <b>rollers</b> and <b>mine</b> flails. The <b>roller</b> method {{originated}} during World War I and the flail method during World War II {{but both}} are still used. Neither system is completely reliable and both will leave undetonated mines, requiring the minefield to be rechecked by another method. Mine flail effectiveness can approach 100% in ideal conditions, but clearance rates {{as low as}} 50–60% have been reported. This is well below the 99.6% standard set by the United Nations for humanitarian demining.|$|R

50|$|A <b>mine</b> train <b>roller</b> coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} whose trains often depict {{a set of}} mine carts, with the forward-most car or {{portions}} of it sometimes resembling a small steam locomotive.
