50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} is {{the need}} of a special preamplifier that supplies a steady current (typically 5mA) to the semiconductor elements and handles a special equalization than the one needed for <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Famous brands for <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges</b> are: Grado, Stanton/Pickering (681EE/EEE), B&O (MM types for its two, non-compatible {{generations of}} {{parallel}} arm design), Shure (V15 Type I to V), Audio-Technica, Nagaoka, Dynavector, Koetsu, Ortofon, Technics, Denon and ADC.|$|R
50|$|The {{second step}} {{involves}} transcription {{of a record}} using a suitable turntable and a suitable cartridge-stylus combination. More often than not, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridge</b> and stylus combination is used because of its superior sound characteristics and signal-to-noise ratio over other pickup systems. The output of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridge</b> is of a very low volume (typically ~5mV) so the signal must be amplified with a preamplifier {{to bring it up}} to line level before being routed into the line-in jack of a computer's sound card. Sound cards made specifically for digitally recording vinyl (as well as those designed for DJing with timecode vinyl) have phono preamplifiers built in, eliminating the need for two separate devices.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{is a type}} of {{transducer}} used in the playback of analog {{sound recordings}} called records on a record player, now commonly called a turntable because of its most prominent component but formally known as a phonograph in the US and a gramophone in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1950s to 1970s, ceramic {{cartridge}} became {{common in}} low quality phonographs, but better high-fidelity (or [...] "hi-fi") systems used <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges,</b> {{and the availability}} of low cost <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges</b> from the 1970s onwards made ceramic cartridges obsolete for essentially all purposes. At the seeming end of the market lifespan of ceramic cartridges, someone accidentally discovered that by terminating a specific ceramic mono cartridge (the Ronette TX88) not with the prescribed 47 kΩ resistance, but with approx. 10 kΩ, it could be connected to the moving magnet (MM) input too. The result, a much smoother frequency curve extended the lifetime for this popular and very cheap type.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of the Iomega Zip drive, which stored data on {{removable}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges</b> with 100MB nominal capacity, the company developed and released the Jaz drive with 1GB capacity per removable disk, increased to 2GB in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, most high-fidelity [...] "component" [...] systems (preamplifiers or receivers) that {{accepted}} {{input from}} a phonograph turntable had separate inputs for both ceramic and <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges</b> (typically labeled [...] "CER" [...] and [...] "MAG"). One piece systems often had no additional phono inputs at all, regardless of type.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{the crystal}} and ceramic pickups, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridge</b> usually gives {{improved}} playback fidelity and reduced record wear by tracking the groove with lighter pressure. Magnetic cartridges use lower tracking forces and thus reduce {{the potential for}} groove damage. They also have a lower output voltage than a crystal or ceramic pickup, {{in the range of}} only a few millivolts, thus requiring greater amplification.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} playing a vinyl {{record with a}} stylus is {{by its very nature}} to some degree a {{destructive}} process. Wear to either the stylus or the vinyl results in diminished sound quality. Record wear can be reduced to virtual insignificance, however, by the use of a high-quality, correctly adjusted turntable and tonearm, a high-compliance <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridge</b> with a high-end stylus in good condition, and careful record handling, with non-abrasive removal of dust before playing and other cleaning if necessary.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by {{engineers}} Arnold Poulsen and Axel Petersen in 1918. Initially focusing on sound film technology, Ortofon began to diversify into gramophone record playback and cutting equipment {{towards the end of}} World War II. The firm pioneered the use of moving coil technology in phonograph equipment; the first cutting head based on this technology was introduced in 1945. Ortofon's first moving coil <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridge,</b> the AB model, was launched in 1948, and similar variations of that product are still manufactured today due to demand from enthusiasts.|$|E
50|$|Most systems today, if {{they accept}} input from a {{turntable}} at all, are configured for use only with <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Manufacturers of high-end systems often have in-built moving coil amplifier circuitry, or outboard head-amplifiers supporting either moving magnet or moving coil cartridges {{that can be}} plugged into the line stage.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} designs for <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges,</b> moving magnet (MM) and moving coil (MC) (originally called dynamic). Both {{operate on the}} same physics {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction. The moving magnet type {{was by far the}} most common and more robust of the two, though audiophiles often claim that the moving coil system yields higher fidelity sound.|$|R
50|$|Stanton Magnetics, {{founded in}} 1946, is a {{manufacturer}} of professional and consumer audio equipment. Most of its products are aimed at DJs. It is a wholly owned subsidiary company of the privately owned Stanton Group who also own Cerwin-Vega and KRK Systems. The company has long been renowned for its line of <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges</b> and styli for phonographs.|$|R
50|$|The {{recording}} had to {{be played}} back with a fiber needle such as cut and pointed bamboo or a plant thorn, as an ordinary steel needle in a typical heavy pickup would severely damage the soft aluminum surface. Even when playing a bare aluminium disc with a modern lightweight <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridge,</b> a hard stylus that does not correctly fit the contour of the groove will score its surface and tend to skip and repeat, damaging the disc as well as degrading {{the quality of the}} recovered audio. Because the blunt recording stylus typically bore down on the aluminum at a substantial angle, it produced a disproportionately shallow groove, so that optimum playback with modern equipment requires a custom stylus with an unusually large tip radius.|$|E
5000|$|Voice warning systems {{included}} in cars {{of the late}} 1970s to early 1980s, such as the Datsun and Nissan Z-Car series, found in the 280ZX and 1984-1988 300ZX (optional in the base model and standard in the Turbo model), and the Datsun Maxima and Nissan Maxima of the early 1980s, were also known as Bitching Betty. The Datsun system issued commands such as [...] "lights are on," [...] or [...] "Left door is open." [...] The system used a small box located under the vehicle's dashboard that implemented a small, white plastic record disc that used a <b>Magnetic</b> <b>cartridge</b> to play spoken commands through the vehicle's audio system's speakers, {{similar to that of}} some Texas Instruments talking toys of the time period. Datsun's original name for the feature was [...] "Talking Lady." ...|$|E
50|$|When Audio Fidelity {{released}} its stereophonic demonstration disc, {{there was no}} affordable <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridge</b> on the market capable of playing it. After the release of other demonstration discs and the respective libraries from which they were culled, the other spur to the popularity of stereo discs was the reduction in price of a stereo cartridge, for playing the disks, from $250 to $29.95 in June 1958. The first four mass-produced stereophonic discs available to the buying public were released in March 1958—Johnny Puleo and his Harmonica Gang Volume 1 (AFSD 5830), Railroad - Sounds of a Vanishing Era (AFSD 5843), Lionel - Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra (AFSD 5849) and Marching Along with the Dukes of Dixieland Volume 3 (AFSD 5851). By the end of March, the company had four more stereo LPs available, interspersed with several Bel Canto releases.|$|E

Since the early 1990s, CDs have become the most common source of high-quality music. Nevertheless, turntables, tonearms, and <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridges</b> are still used, despite the difficulties of keeping records free from dust and the delicate set-up associated with turntables.|$|R

50|$|Several {{technologies}} {{were used}} to record the sounds, beginning with wax cylinders, {{almost half a century}} before the invention of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Nowadays mostly vinyl records are used. When playing the record, the stylus is placed in the grooves of the record. By then spinning the record, the stylus start to vibrate caused by the shape of the grooves. These vibrations are then converted by the cartridge. The harder the material used for the record, the harder the stylus has to be in order to increase the quality of the sound and to decrease the wear of the needle. For shellac records, a disposable stylus softer than the record was generally preferred for preservation of the recording. The styluses for playing vinyl records are made out of Sapphire or diamond. There are two common types of stylus: elliptical and spherical. Each contacts the groove differently than the other; the elliptical stylus allows for more groove contact, which increases fidelity, while the spherical stylus makes less contact with the groove, which yields a more sensitive stylus.|$|E
50|$|Stereophonic {{sound was}} not entirely new to the public. In 1952 sound {{engineer}} Emory Cook developed a stereophonic disk that used two separate grooves and playback needles; the following year he had a catalog of about 25 disks available for audiophiles. Multi-channel sound was integral to the widescreen motion picture processes Cinerama (1952) and CinemaScope (1953). Stereophonic audio tapes had been commercially available to audiophiles, although expensive, since the mid-1950s.
