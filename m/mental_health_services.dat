5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: While {{international}} {{research shows}} that receipt of welfare benefits is associated with poor <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> less {{is known about the}} relationship between welfare receipt and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. We investigate whether within-person change in welfare recipient status is associated with change in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. Methods: Analysis of two waves of data from an Australian national household survey. Random- and fixed-effect models considered the effect of change in welfare receipt status, and assessed whether change in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use differed by type of welfare benefit or the direction of welfare transition. Results: Individuals {{were more likely to report}} greater <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use at times of welfare receipt. These associations were attenuated, but remained significant, after adjusting for <b>mental</b> <b>health.</b> Increased <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use was not tied to specific types of welfare benefits. The increase in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use associated with a transition onto welfare benefits was much greater than the decline in service use associated with the transition off benefits. Conclusions: Within individuals, welfare receipt is associated with greater <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. While this does reflect poorer <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> at the time of welfare receipt, other factors seem to facilitate <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to explore the lived {{experience}} of sport and exercise for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users. There were three additional objectives; to investigate the effects of sport and exercise on <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and wellbeing; to investigate the perceptions of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> providers regarding service delivery and finally to investigate fundamental issues of session structure. The study looked at the experiences of sport and exercise from both <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> providers. Participants were recruited for the study from Leeds and York Partnership Foundation Trust and the lottery funded ‘Let’s Do This’ scheme. The <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users had a range of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> conditions, were from different ethnic backgrounds and aged over 18. <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> providers had a range of positions from management to direct service delivery. Semi structured interviews were conducted with five <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users and five <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> providers. The data was analysed using interpretive phenomenology which drew on the work of Van Manen’s methodology; this interpretive approach is utilised as both a research methodology and a method. A number of themes were highlighted including ‘The changing self image through sport and exercise’, ‘Am I valuable’ and ‘Salubriousness of sport and exercise’. Two essential themes ‘The cycle of recovery’ and ‘Intermittent health breaking through heavy clouds of illness’ led to the development of an essential statement that illuminates the essential structure of the lived experience of sport and exercise for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users. Sport and exercise can have an important role to play in the lives of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users. The way in which the service is delivered can impact this role. Structure is important both literally and mentally. The research found a number of strengths of the service currently being delivered. These included the contribution of the staff; both in the management of the scheme and the flexible delivery. Coaches were respected for their sport and exercise expertise and were able to change or modify sessions to best serve the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users. <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>service</b> users’ had trust in their coaches, they felt they were understanding of their conditions and cared. In some cases these relationships were potentially considered of greater importance than the content of the session. The way in which the scheme supported <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users in ‘bridging the gap’ between a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> setting and being back in the community was another important finding. This type of finding can prove useful for those designing and delivering sport and exercise schemes for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users. The findings also point to possible areas of future research and implications for practice and policy...|$|R

40|$|Background: People {{with mental}} illness suffer from various oral manifestations, {{including}} more caries experience, higher prevalence of deep periodontal pockets, temporomandibular disorders and dry mouth. Dental health care to this group of people has been neglected in Hong Kong. Objectives: The project aimed to impart basic dental knowledge to the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users and to improve their oral health. Methods: A total of 35 <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users, aged from 30 - 72, participated in the project. Participants underwent clinical oral examinations for assessment of their oral health conditions. Self-completed questionnaires were distributed to assess their oral health related quality of life, self-perceived oral conditions and oral health knowledge. Oral health talks and individualised oral hygiene instructions were provided. <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users were reassessed after two weeks. Visible plaque index (VPI) and gingival bleeding index (GBI) were recorded in both visits for comparison of the oral hygiene status. Another set of questionnaire was distributed to assess improvements, if any, in the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users‟ oral <b>health</b> knowledge. Subsequently, 35 of them received treatments. Results: Majority of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users (85 %) {{had not had a}} dental visit within one year. The baseline visit showed that <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users generally had more caries experience and more deep periodontal pockets. Misconceptions were found in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users‟ oral <b>health</b> knowledge (mean score = 24. 5 out of 44). Improvements had been shown after baseline visit (mean score = 26. 8, p= 0. 014). <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users showed significant reduction in VPI (from 42. 6 % to 23. 3 %, p< 0. 001) and GBI (from 39. 7 % to 29. 5 %, p= 0. 001) in the second visit. Treatments including 28 scaling, 27 topical fluoride applications and 10 simple restorations with atraumatic restorative technique were performed. Most <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> users gave positive feedback on the service provided with a mean score of 9 out of 10 in overall satisfaction. Conclusion: People {{with mental illness}} have more severe oral diseases and hence a greater treatment need.

40|$|Although {{immigrant}} {{adolescents are}} at least at equal risk of developing internalizing problems as their non-immigrant peers, immigrant adolescents {{are less likely to}} use <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care. The present study is the first to examine ethnic differences in problem identification to find explanations for this disparity in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. Specifically, the extent to which emotional problem identification mediates the relationship between immigrant status and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use for internalizing problems in three immigrant populations in the Netherlands (i. e., Surinamese, Turkish, and Moroccan) was investigated. A two-phase design was used to include adolescents at risk for internalizing problems. Data were used from the second phase, in which 349 parents and adolescents participated (95 native Dutch, 85 Surinamese, 87 Turkish, and 82 Moroccan). Results indicated that <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use for internalizing problems is far lower among immigrant adolescents than among native Dutch adolescents, although differences between immigrant groups were also substantive. A lack of emotional problem identification was identified as an essential mediator in the relationship between immigrant status and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. Since the results suggest the low levels of problem identification in our immigrant samples may serve an explanatory role in the relationship between immigrant status and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use, future research should aim at understanding these ethnic differences in problem identification.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{examined}} whether manic and depressive dimensions independently contribute to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use and determined {{the degree of}} comorbidity between manic and depressive dimensions in individuals with and without <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. If both depressive and manic episodes independently influence help-seeking behaviour, {{a higher level of}} comorbidity between these dimensions would be found in clinical as compared to nonclinical samples (i. e. Berkson's Bias). Data were derived from the Netherlands <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), a prospective epidemiological survey in a representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 7076). Dimensions of depression and mania and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use (MHSU) were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) at baseline, and prospectively one and three years later. Logistic regression was used to test whether depressive and manic dimensions both had independent effects on <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. The degree of mania-cornorbidity given the presence of depressive dimension was assessed as a function of MHSU, both retrospectively and prospectively. Manic and depressive dimensions contributed independently to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. Mania-comorbidity given the presence of depressive dimension was significantly higher in individuals with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use than in those without, both retrospectively (16. 7 % versus 7. 1 %, p = 0. 000) and prospectively (10. 8 % versus 6. 6 %, p = 0. 017). We conclude that the bipolar phenotype consists of manic and depressive dimensions that may be much more loosely associated than (Berkson) biased clinical observations Suggest. A dimension-specific approach may be more productive in clarifying the aetiology of mood dysregulation. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
