5|$|In 2017, {{part of the}} {{mezzanine}} {{was closed}} off so the MTA could build a <b>mockup</b> of the proposed R211 subway car. When completed, the model would be publicly accessible so riders could review it. The <b>mockup</b> contains features such as an open-gangway design proposed for this order; digital screens showing next stops and their station layouts; and a blue-and-gold-stripe paint design on its exterior.|$|E

30|$|During the {{planning}} stage, the moderators, who are preparing the <b>mockups</b> for inspection, can load their <b>mockups</b> {{in the tool}} and connect them by adding links (see FigureÂ  1 stage 1). Furthermore, they can visualize and simulate the interaction steps by clicking in the <b>mockups.</b> This feature allows the creation of clickable <b>mockups,</b> which are close to real finished applications.|$|R
40|$|Providing {{interactive}} <b>mockups</b> {{of mobile}} applications in designing phases introduces new challenges for interaction designers {{compared to the}} traditional way of static <b>mockups.</b> In particular, the complexity of this process increases {{when it comes to}} enabling the user to actually explore the intended user experience of the mobile environment by enhancing traditional handmade sketches or tool-generated wireframes with concrete mobile interaction elements. We introduce a framework, called i 2 ME (interactive Mockup-Building for Mobile Environment), for building interactive <b>mockups</b> with concrete mobile interaction elements. The framework enhances the static <b>mockups</b> (handmade or tool-generated) with screen transitions and multi-touch gestures, and enables the deployment of the resulting HTML 5 +JavaScript based interactive <b>mockups</b> to multiple platforms and device classes...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mockups</b> are an {{integral}} part of the military acquisition process. <b>Mockups</b> are often used to test human factors and aerodynamics, for example. [...] In this context, <b>mockups</b> include wire-frame models. They can also be used for public display and demonstration purposes prior to the development of a prototype, as with the case of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II mock-up aircraft.|$|R
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, pencil leads in wooden pencils {{have never been}} made from lead. When the pencil {{originated}} as a wrapped graphite writing tool, the particular type of graphite used was named plumbago (literally, act for lead or lead <b>mockup).</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{plutonium}} was not available, it was substituted {{with material}} with similar mechanical properties. Depleted uranium was used {{but was not}} optimal because of its opacity for radiation; iron, copper, or cadmium were other choices. Cadmium was the choice {{for most of the}} tests. The first shot was performed with an iron <b>mockup</b> of the plutonium pit.|$|E
30|$|Inspectors {{also stated}} {{advantages}} and suggestions {{of the evaluation}} of paper based prototypes. According to Inspector 4, <b>mockups</b> allow to directly point out the usability problems. Regarding suggestions {{for the evaluation of}} low fidelity prototypes, Inspector 3 indicated that colored <b>mockups</b> could make them more realistic and Inspector 2 said that the organization of the <b>mockups</b> is important for simulating the interaction between the system and the user.|$|R
50|$|When {{designing}} a functional piece of furniture, {{such as a}} desk or table, <b>mockups</b> {{can be used to}} test whether they suit typical human shapes and sizes. Designs that fail to consider these issues may not be practical to use. <b>Mockups</b> {{can also be used to}} test color, finish, and design details which cannot be visualized from the initial drawings and sketches. <b>Mockups</b> used for this purpose can be on a reduced scale.|$|R

5|$|The B-1A <b>mockup</b> review {{occurred}} in late October 1971. The first B-1A prototype (Air Force serial no. 74-0158) flew on 23 December 1974. Three more B-1A prototypes followed. As the program continued the per-unit cost {{continued to rise}} {{in part because of}} high inflation during that period. In 1970, the estimated unit cost was $40 million, and by 1975, this figure had climbed to $70 million.|$|E
5|$|While Glenn {{was on duty}} at Patuxent and in Washington, he read {{everything}} he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the <b>mockup</b> of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft <b>mockup</b> board.|$|E
5|$|To limit {{development}} costs, {{the program}} shared engine development with the North American XB-70 Valkyrie strategic bomber program, {{and used a}} number of elements of earlier interceptor projects. The program had progressed {{only as far as}} the construction of a single wooden <b>mockup</b> when it was cancelled in 1959, due to a shortage of funds and the Soviets' adoption of ballistic missiles as their primary means of nuclear attack. Had it flown, the F-108 would have been the heaviest fighter of its era.|$|E

5|$|A {{full-scale}} <b>mockup</b> of the Q-12 {{was ready}} by 7 December 1962, {{and had already}} undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.|$|E
5|$|A <b>mockup</b> of the cockpit, center {{fuselage}} and wing {{center section}} was built and was inspected by the BuAer {{in the fall}} 1944. However, the contract for the prototype XTSF-1s was terminated in January 1945. This was due {{to a variety of}} factors, including the Navy's belief that the Grumman engineers and factory were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat, the F7F, and the F8F Bearcat, that the XTSF-1 would be too large for practical operations from escort carriers, and because it was believed the Grumman G-70, to be built as the XTB3F, was a better prospect. In addition, the F7F was proving difficult to certify for operations from aircraft carriers, further prejudicing the Navy against the design.|$|E
5|$|Action Button Entertainment is a {{video game}} {{development}} studio consisting of Tim Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski that has produced five games: Ziggurat (2012), TNNS (2013), Ten by Eight (2013), Tuffy the Corgi (2014), and Videoball (2016). The group convened in 2010 as Rogers worked on Ziggurat based on an idea he had while playing Angry Birds {{that he could not}} complete on his own. Porter joined Action Button after responding to a call for artists Rogers made via Twitter, and Kerwin joined based on a connection he had with Rogers from producing a <b>mockup</b> of a game concept Rogers outlined in his Kotaku column.|$|E

5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a <b>mockup</b> began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{results were}} favorable, and a {{full-scale}} <b>mockup</b> was formally reviewed in March 1949. The prototype {{was completed by}} August 1949, but an incident involving the rival swept-wing Tupolev Tu-82 that broke an engine mount during a low-altitude flight led to delays as additional tests were demanded to determine {{the strength of the}} wings before the first flight was made. By the following year, the Il-30 program had lost momentum as the Ilyushin OKB was ordered to concentrate its resources on facilitating the service introduction of the Il-28. It was formally terminated by government order on 20 August 1950, and the prototype was eventually scrapped {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s. Aviation historian Bill Gunston quotes a maiden flight date of 9 September 1949, but Vaclav Nemecek says 1951.|$|E
5|$|As the TR-1 engines {{originally}} {{intended for the}} Su-9 were not yet ready for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale <b>mockup</b> {{was found to be}} acceptable on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer's flight testing was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and late delivery of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high at speed and it lacked enough directional stability. Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and hydraulic boosters were fitted for the control system.|$|E

5|$|Construction of a {{full-scale}} <b>mockup</b> {{was completed in}} June 1945 by Factory No. 81, but the order for five prototypes was given to Factory No. 381 as Factory No. 81 was already fully committed to other programs. Manufacturing drawings were delivered to Factory No. 381 {{by the end of}} August, but the prototypes were delayed because the plant had no experience building metal aircraft and lacked the necessary tooling. By the end of the year, the factory had only managed to complete a single airframe for static load testing. This showed that the rear fuselage, wings and tail needed to be reinforced, and the opportunity was taken to enlarge the vertical stabilizer as well. These tests and modifications required six months of work so that the first flying prototype was not completed until July 1946. Manufacturer's testing of the first prototype began on 27 August, after ground testing had required replacing the engine twice, and the first flight was made on 11 September.|$|E
5|$|Once interested, Soichiro Honda began {{developing}} the Super Cub {{on his return}} to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a <b>mockup</b> to Fujisawa that finally matched {{what he had in}} mind, Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, half again as many as the entire monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the United States. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.|$|E
