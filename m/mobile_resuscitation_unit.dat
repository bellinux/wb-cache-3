The incision most frequently employed at surgery was a median sternotomy (53 %), followed by left thoracotomy (40 %) and right thoracotomy (7 %).

Another objective is to determine whether and how the nurses are prepared and trained in the field of management of situations connected with the death of a patient in <b>Resuscitation</b> <b>Units</b> and Intensive Care Units. The third objective is, whether there is and what is the form of assistance to nurses in RU and ICU provided by the team and the management of the Department in case of deaths of patients, and the fourth objective is to determine what form and manner of support nurses expect and require.

Limited data is available on the patient population served by district-level emergency centres in South Africa. The objective {{of this study is to}} describe the case mix of adult patients managed in the <b>resuscitation</b> <b>unit</b> of a district-level hospital in the Western Cape. Methods: A six-month prospective observational study was conducted in the <b>resuscitation</b> <b>unit</b> of Khayelitsha Hospital. Data were collected by clinicians in the unit by means of a Smartphone application on their own devices. Variables collected included patient demographics, patient acuity, patient comorbidities, diagnosis made in the unit, interventions received, length of stay, and disposition. Summary statistics were used to describe all variables. Results: A total of 2324 patient admissions were analysed. The mean age was 36. 9  years with a male predominance (n =  1367, 58. 8 %). Most patients were triaged into high-acuity categories (n =  1626, 70 %). HIV infection was the most common comorbidity (n =  530, 22. 8 %). Acute medical (n =  1181, 50. 8 %) and trauma-related patients (n =  928, 39. 9 %) dominated the cohort. The median length of stay was 195 min and 502 (21. 6 %) patients were transferred to higher levels of care. There were 74 (3. 2 %) deaths. Conclusion: This study yields novel epidemiological data of emergency care in a district-level emergency centre. It highlights the burden of trauma and acute medical emergencies at the district level and can be used as a foundation for further research to provide targeted and effective healthcare to all citizens...|$|R
40|$|Ahospital {{pharmacist}} has two missions: {{participating in}} the quality of health care and keeping health costs under control. He/she, therefore, must ensure that the medications are being used under the optimal flow and safety conditions for the patient and must provide the medications under the best usage conditions to the caregiver in order to minimize all possible risks. However, medications in a hospital environment follow a complex circuit, since each care unit has its own specific needs, thus generating medication flows that can vary quite a bit (1) (2) (3). The Broussais Hospital pharmacy provides medications to the medical <b>resuscitation</b> <b>unit</b> twice a week, according to a global distribution method. Having analyzed the medication flow of this unit, we have researched a decentralized automated dispensing system that ensures 90 % of the medication needs of the care unit, representing a useful tool in the gathering process and perfectly adapted to frequent changes in prescription and to emergency prescriptions (4, 5, 6, 7). We selected the Sure-Med ® automated dispensing system (made by the Baxter Laboratories, who ceded their automated dispensing system branch to Omnicell, Inc.)

Prior to the HT, mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was 32 - 56 mmHg. In all cases, the hemodynamic study demonstrated PH reactivity (positive vasodilator test with nitric oxide). All 5 patients developed RVD with hemodynamic instability immediately after the HT, despite the administration of nitric oxide {{from the time of}} intubation prior to the implant, optimal medical treatment in all cases, and a ventricular assist in 2 cases. In all patients, IV sildenafil was initiated at 10 mg/ 8 h for 48 h and was subsequently increased to 20 mg/ 8 h. in its oral formulation until discharge from the hospital. The change in pulmonary pressure was assessed using a Swan-Ganz catheter. Ventricular function was assessed using echocardiography. Length of stay in the <b>Resuscitation</b> <b>Unit</b> and mid-term survival were also assessed. Average time of extracorporeal circulation was 200 ± 110 min and organ ischemic time was 210 ± 95 min.

40|$|Blast {{injury is}} a very serious lesion caused by the shock wave {{resulting}} from an explosion. Further secondary injuries can arise from burying under debris, pieces of shards from the explosive cover, at burning, poisonous gases created by chemical reactions during detonation. The injuries often happen to be fatal and the percentage of people who survive it depends on the fact how far from the epicentre they were situated. If the individual is very close, there is almost no chance to survive, if, however, the individual is situated further from the epicentre, a few tens of meters, the chance is higher. It is so called mass disaster, which includes more injured people at an explosion. Therefore it is necessary for nurses and the hospital staff to know what the procedures are at this incident and how to take medical and nursing care of higher number of such patients suffering from blast injury. The care itself is extremely demanding, since the injured are often in critical condition. The aim of this diploma thesis, the topic of which is multidisciplinary cooperation and the role of a nurse when taking care of the patients suffering from blast injury, was to find out the information based on the latest Czech and foreign literature and create a compact overview of the knowledge of this issue, for it is necessary to have this knowledge to carry out nursing care of such patients. The second aim of this diploma thesis was to map the role of a nurse in details when taking care of a patient suffering from blast injury. This aim was stated for the reason of the demanding character and complexity of nursing care at urgent reception and anaesthesiology and <b>resuscitation</b> <b>unit</b> because the nurses at these units are placed demands on high qualification and requirements. This diploma thesis was purely elaborated as theoretical thesis based on Czech and foreign sources. The given pieces of information were obtained from a great deal of professional and scientific publications, monographs, professional journals and internet sources for each chapter. The first part of the thesis was dedicated to the description of the given issue, pre-hospital care and classifying algorithms that are used at mass health losses in such way so that the injured people have a higher chance to survive. The crisis management at hospitals, the reception of the injured, the care at the urgent unit and finally the follow-up care at the anaesthesiology and <b>resuscitation</b> <b>unit</b> are worked out in the following part. Thereafter the theoretical part focuses on nursing care at the critical care department where the nursing care of a patient suffering from blast injury is described as well as the duties of a nurse. The needed competences of a nurse working at the urgent <b>unit,</b> anaesthesiology and <b>resuscitation</b> <b>unit</b> are also defined in this chapter. According to the valid Czech legislation, only specially trained nurses for intensive care should take care of the patients with blast injury because the extent of their competence for intensive care is many times higher than general nurses have. The last chapter deals with team and multidisciplinary cooperation among the doctors and hospital staff as well as the cooperation concerning the pre-hospital care of the emergency services at emergency incident, for their active and quality communication are the keys for good and well done work with the least consequences...|$|R

I discuss situations when doctors are forced to act more as good accountant managers than physicians, which might often be in conflict with the idea of good care, and I show how care is negotiated in these situations.
