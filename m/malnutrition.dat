5|$|Nutrition-related {{cutaneous}} {{conditions are}} caused by <b>malnutrition</b> due to an improper or inadequate diet.|$|E
5|$|As December began, the Japanese {{experienced}} considerable {{difficulty in}} keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of Allied air and naval {{attacks on the}} Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops, who by 7 December were losing about 50men each day from <b>malnutrition,</b> disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 of that number were still alive, and only about 12,000 remained more or less fit for combat duty, with the rest incapacitated by battle wounds, disease, or <b>malnutrition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gypsy {{prisoners were}} used {{primarily}} for construction work. Thousands died of typhus and noma due to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, and <b>malnutrition.</b> Anywhere from 1,400 to 3,000 prisoners {{were transferred to}} other concentration camps before {{the murder of the}} remaining population.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s a local doctor {{highlighted}} <b>malnutrition</b> on the island, {{and demanded}} that the Government triple rations for the islanders and that children be provided with fruit juice, but the request was denied.|$|E
5|$|Just under 29,000Australians {{were taken}} {{prisoner}} by the Axis during the war. Only 14,000 of the 21,467Australian prisoners {{taken by the}} Japanese survived captivity. The majority of the deaths in captivity were due to <b>malnutrition</b> and disease.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} and physical health status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of <b>malnutrition.</b> India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of <b>malnutrition</b> is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E
5|$|After 1939 {{the firm}} {{began to use}} forced labour {{extensively}} on its projects, as did many other German industrial concerns at the time. Hochtief's slave workers suffered from <b>malnutrition,</b> beating and constant abuse. The consortium-led nature of construction projects obscures the firm's exact involvement, as does the destruction of many records.|$|E
5|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, {{different}} medical issues can appear, such as oral and dental disease, pressure ulcers, <b>malnutrition,</b> hygiene problems, or respiratory, skin, or eye infections. Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed {{when they do}} arise. During {{the final stages of}} the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death, often with the help of hospice.|$|E
5|$|Carl {{served in}} the Austrian army during World War I after being drafted. Life was {{difficult}} following World War I, and Gerty suffered from xerophthalmia caused by severe <b>malnutrition</b> due to food shortages. These problems, {{in conjunction with the}} increasing anti-Semitism, contributed to the Coris' decision to leave Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of several {{high-profile}} reports about hunger and <b>malnutrition</b> in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chair. Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of hunger and <b>malnutrition</b> firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in England, Plagis {{was found to}} be suffering from <b>malnutrition,</b> scabies and physical and mental fatigue. He briefly convalesced in a nursing home, then spent a year as an instructor in England. He was promoted to probationary flying officer on 1 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is closely}} linked to both {{overcrowding}} and <b>malnutrition,</b> {{making it one of}} the principal diseases of poverty. Those at high risk thus include: people who inject illicit drugs, inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather (e.g. prisons and homeless shelters), medically underprivileged and resource-poor communities, high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health-care providers serving these patients.|$|E
5|$|Ulceration episodes usually occur about 3–6 {{times per}} year. However, severe disease is {{characterized}} by virtually constant ulceration (new lesions developing before old ones have healed) and may cause debilitating chronic pain and interfere with comfortable eating. In severe cases, this prevents adequate nutrient intake leading to <b>malnutrition</b> and weight loss.|$|E
5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at a {{large and}} important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though {{it was unclear whether}} it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering <b>malnutrition.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and <b>malnutrition.</b> There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese {{positions}} around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, <b>malnutrition</b> and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E
5|$|Arévalo {{took office}} on 15 March 1945, inheriting {{a country with}} {{numerous}} social and economic issues. Despite Ubico's policy of using unpaid labor to build public roads, internal transport was severely inadequate. 70% {{of the population was}} illiterate, and <b>malnutrition</b> and poor health were widespread. The wealthiest 2% of landowners owned nearly three quarters of agricultural land, and as a result less than 1% was cultivated. The indigenous peasants either had no land, or had far too little to sustain themselves. Three quarters of the labor force were in agriculture, and industry was essentially nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|Children {{arrived at}} the camp in an {{emaciated}} and weak condition from other camps within the Ustaše camp system, {{with a total of}} 3,336 children passing through the camp. Between 449 and 1500 children died there, mainly from disease and <b>malnutrition.</b> A sub-camp was established in nearby Donja Reka. The Yugoslav Partisans liberated about 350 children from the main camp inAugust 1942. In October 1942, about 500 of the surviving children were dispersed among local families by the Catholic aid group, Caritas; 1,637 boys and girls were taken in by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages, and another 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep are {{sometimes}} used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, {{in areas such}} as hypertension and heart failure. Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of <b>malnutrition</b> and hypoxia. In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.|$|E
5|$|Factors such as hypoxia and infection, or {{stress and}} <b>malnutrition</b> {{in the mother}} during fetal development, {{may result in a}} slight {{increase}} in the risk of schizophrenia later in life. People diagnosed with schizophrenia {{are more likely to have}} been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero. The increased risk is about five to eight percent. Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma gondi and Chlamydia.|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, <b>malnutrition,</b> physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the first few months of life.|$|E
5|$|Favourable {{macroeconomic}} {{performance has}} been a necessary but not sufficient condition for the significant reduction of poverty amongst the Indian population. The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991). The improvements in some other non-economic dimensions of social development have been even less favourable. The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child <b>malnutrition</b> (46% in 2005–6).|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe <b>malnutrition,</b> anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Hiddleston {{lives in}} the Belsize Park area of north-west London. He {{was one of the}} celebrities (alongside Benedict Cumberbatch, E. L. James and Rachel Riley, among others) to design and sign his own card for the UK-based charity the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children. The {{campaign}} was launched by crafting company Stampin' Up! UK and the cards were auctioned off on eBay during May 2014. He is also a UK ambassador of the humanitarian and developmental assistance fund group UNICEF. He travelled to Guinea in early 2013 to help women and children and raise awareness about hunger and <b>malnutrition.</b> Hiddleston is a self-described feminist.|$|E
5|$|In Nova Scotia, Governor Lawrence had easily {{captured}} Fort Beauséjour, and {{had then}} embarked {{on what has}} since {{become known as the}} Great Expulsion, the forcible removal of more than 12,000 Acadians from Nova Scotia. When some of the ships carrying the Acadians entered Boston Harbor in early December 1755, Shirley ordered that they not disembark. For three winter months, until March 1756, the Acadians remained on the ships, where half died from the cold weather and <b>malnutrition.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 1898, Hannah was {{committed}} to Cane Hill mental asylum – she had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and <b>malnutrition.</b> For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent {{to live with their}} father, whom the young boys scarcely knew. Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{elements}} of the 2nd Division reached the 17th Army headquarters area at Kokumbona, west of the Matanikau on 4 November. The same day, Shoji's unit reached Koli Point and made camp. Decimated by battle deaths, combat injuries, <b>malnutrition,</b> and tropical diseases, the 2nd Division was incapable of further offensive action and would fight as a defensive force {{for the rest of}} the campaign. Later in November, U.S. forces drove Shoji's soldiers from Koli Point back to the Kokumbuna area, with a battalion-sized Marine patrol attacking and harassing them almost the entire way. Only about 700 of Shoji's original 3,000 men ultimately returned to Kokumbuna.|$|E
5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, <b>malnutrition,</b> severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and <b>malnutrition,</b> suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{two billion}} {{people in the}} {{developing}} world are deficient in zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe <b>malnutrition</b> and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many {{in the developing world}} have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, <b>malnutrition,</b> and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E
5|$|Pediatricians {{are often}} the first health {{professionals}} to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with <b>malnutrition</b> or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. <b>Malnutrition</b> and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E
5|$|Sir Michael Francis Addison Woodruff, FRS, FRCS (3 April 1911– 10 March 2001) was an English {{surgeon and}} {{scientist}} principally remembered for his research into organ transplantation. Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in Australia, where he earned degrees {{in electrical engineering}} and medicine. Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. While there, he devised an ingenious method of extracting nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent <b>malnutrition</b> among his fellow POWs.|$|E
5|$|Sturdee's {{operations}} were effective. On Bougainville, {{at a cost}} of 516 Australian dead and 1,572 wounded, Savige's troops had occupied much of the island and killed 8,500 Japanese; another 9,800 died from <b>malnutrition</b> and disease. On New Britain, where 74 Australians died and 140 were wounded, the heavily outnumbered 5th Division had overrun central New Britain. Meanwhile, the 6th Division at Aitape and Wewak had lost 442 dead and 1,141 wounded while clearing the Japanese from the coast and driving them into the mountains, killing 9,000 and taking 269 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{carried out}} an {{unsuccessful}} general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive combats were the Battle of Tampere and Viipuri, {{won by the}} Whites, and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory of the Whites and the German forces. Both the Reds and Whites engaged in political terror. A high number of Red POWs died due to <b>malnutrition</b> and disease. Altogether, around 39,000 people – 36,000 Finns – perished in the conflict.|$|E
