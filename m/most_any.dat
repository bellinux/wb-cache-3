After the French scored their second try, giving them 8 pointsthe <b>most</b> <b>any</b> team had scored against the All Blacksthe New Zealanders responded with six unanswered tries to win 38–8. They then returned to London, where they learned that New Zealand's Prime Minister, Richard Seddon, had arranged for them to return home via North America.

He went on to score two goals in a 5–1 win against Cesena which allowed Totti to set a new record, as his second goal of the match brought his tally to 211 league goals– the <b>most</b> <b>any</b> player has ever scored for a single club in Serie A. Despite his inability to find the back of the net as the second half of the season began, he continued to perform well, as he notably assisted Juan's goal from a corner in Roma's 4–0 win over Inter on 5 February. On 12 April, Totti scored his fifth goal {{of the season in}} a 3–1 victory over Udinese. He scored again in a 2–1 loss against Fiorentina on 25 April, and two weeks later, on his 500th match in Serie A, he scored two goals in a 2–2 draw against Catania at the Stadio Olimpico.|$|E

5|$|Mumbai was lashed by torrential rains on 26–27 July 2005, {{during which}} the city was brought to a {{complete}} standstill. The city received 37inches (940 millimeters) of rain in 24 hours— the <b>most</b> <b>any</b> Indian city has ever received in a single day. Around 83 people were killed. On 11 July 2006, a series of seven bomb blasts took place {{over a period of}} 11 minutes on the Suburban Railway in Mumbai at Khar, Mahim, Matunga, Jogeshwari, Borivali, and one between Khar and Santa Cruz. 209 people were killed and over 700 were injured. According to Mumbai Police, the bombings were carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). In 2008, the city experienced xenophobic attacks by the activists of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) under Raj Thackeray on the North Indian migrants in Mumbai. Attacks included assault on North Indian taxi drivers and damage of their vehicles. There were a series of ten coordinated terrorist attacks by 10 armed Pakistani men using automatic weapons and grenades which began on 26 November 2008 and ended on 29 November 2008. The attacks resulted in 164 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several important buildings. The city again saw a series of three coordinated bomb explosions at different locations on 13 July 2011 between 18:54 and 19:06 IST. The blasts occurred at the Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar, and Dadar, which left 26 killed, and 130 injured.

25|$|Once transformed, Tuxedo Mask {{displays}} additional powers. In the anime shows {{these as}} mainly physical, while the manga depicts them as rare and magical. His iconic mainstay in the anime {{involves the use}} of roses, thrown like darts to injure or distract enemies. He can also twirl them or throw a wide array to block attacks, or can throw many at a time to pin an enemy down. He seems to have an unlimited supply of these roses, which are supernaturally strong and embed themselves in <b>most</b> <b>any</b> material, including concrete. In addition, when Mamoru takes on different forms or aspects, his roses change color accordingly. Tuxedo Mask's roses are red, the evil Prince Endymion's are black (and electrified), and the Moonlight Knight's are white.|$|E
25|$|Whenever possible, Mongol commanders {{found the}} highest ground available, {{from which they}} could make {{tactical}} decisions based on the best view of the battlefield as events unfolded. Furthermore, being on high ground allowed their forces to observe commands conveyed by flags more easily than if the ground were level. In addition, keeping the high command on high ground made them easier to defend. Unlike the European armies, which placed enormous emphasis on personal valor, and thus exposed their leaders to death from anyone bold enough to kill them, the Mongols regarded their leaders as a vital asset. A general such as Subutai, unable to ride a horse in the later part of his career due to age and obesity, would have been ridiculed out of <b>most</b> <b>any</b> European army of the time. But the Mongols recognized and respected his still-powerful military mind, who {{had been one of}} the Genghis' most able subordinates, so he was transported around in a cart.|$|E

25|$|In all <b>most</b> <b>any</b> of {{the methods}} in {{simulation}} of ion channels, the major computational cost comes from the calculation of electrostatic forces acting on the ions. In continuum models, for instance, where ionic density exist rather than explicit ions, the electrostatic potential is calculated in a self-consistent manner by solving the Poisson equation. In MD simulations, on the other hand, the electrostatic forces acting on the particles are calculated by explicit evaluation of the Coulombic force term, often splitting the short-range and long-range electrostatic forces {{so they could be}} computed with different methods. In our model as a reduced particle method, the longrange electrostatic forces are evaluated by solving the Poisson equation and augmenting the forces so obtained with a short-range component. By solving the Poisson equation it is possible to self-consistently include the forces arising from the bias to the system, while this is a difficult issue to be addressed in MD simulations.|$|E
25|$|Born in Oldham, Lancashire, Maynard {{was brought}} up {{on the island of}} Anglesey in North Wales where he first joined Glamorgan. His career started in fine fashion when he hit a century on his debut in 1985, hitting three {{consecutive}} sixes to reach the 100 and he became the youngest-ever player to score 1,000 runs for the country in 1986. The 54 centuries he scored for Glamorgan during his playing career is also a record - the <b>most</b> <b>any</b> player has scored for the club. These displays of skill did not go unnoticed by the England selectors and he earned a call-up against the West Indies at the Oval in 1988. He was picked again in 1989 but then ran foul of the cricketing authorities by agreeing to go with Mike Gatting, on the controversial rebel tour of South Africa when that country had been banned from international sport because of its policy of apartheid. He later justified his decision by saying that he was desperate for a taste of international cricket having just been dropped from the England team. Nevertheless, his conduct led to a three-year Test ban, but he was eventually granted a recall for the Ashes series in 1993 after he had hit a century for Glamorgan against the Australians, but he failed to make much of an impact with the bat.|$|E
25|$|Minor success came in 2008 when Ricardo Gareca led Universitario to an Apertura tournament. The {{last time}} they won an Apertura title was in 2002. They won the tournament on their twenty-second game 10 points ahead of Sporting Cristal and four games away {{from the end of}} the Apertura. They {{defeated}} Cienciano 3–1 to secure first place and accumulated 50 points to win the title. They qualified for the 2009 Copa Libertadores but did not finish in the top seven of the Clausura and consequently could not contest the season final for the national title against Universidad San Martín. In 2009, following the resignation of Ricardo Gareca the club hired Juan Reynoso as the new manager, a former player of the club in the 90s and with a long history in the Mexican football. Much of the 2008 squad remained for the 2009 season, but with the departure of some notable players like Héctor Hurtado, Mayer Candelo and Donny Neyra. The most important signing prior to the 2009 season was Nolberto Solano. Other players to arrive were Carlos Orejuela, John Galliquio, Piero Alva, Francisco Bazán, Rodolfo Espinoza, and Ronaille Calheira. Reynoso intelligently led Universitario to the season final which would be a repeat of the 1987 final in which they would face arch-rival Alianza Lima. Universitario won both legs; in the first leg they won 1–0 with a goal from Piero Alva in and in the second leg Nolberto Solano scored the defining goal from the penalty mark in the tenth minute of play. As of 2009, Universitario has twenty-five Primera División titles. The first seven titles won by Universitario were during the amateur era. The remaining eighteen titles were won during the professional era, the <b>most</b> <b>any</b> Peruvian club has.|$|E

The video alone could make the song {{one of the biggest}} of the coming year".

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Los Angeles Times {{review of the}} album, critic Todd Martens wrote: [...] "The song's first guitar crush arrives after a lengthy ambient intro, and brings an electrifying jolt to the striking piano melody. Martin brings a booming confidence to his vocals that has been more evident in Coldplay's live shows than on record." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "'Violet Hill' opens with a thin synth wash that's very Music for Airports, and proceeds from there to some droning, stabbing guitar textures that sound cooler than <b>most</b> <b>any</b> Coldplay tunes I can think of." [...] Kristina Feliciano of Paste magazine wrote: [...] "You know you're in for {{a different kind of}} Coldplay experience when Chris Martin ditches his anguished falsetto for a deep, doomy basso profundo, as he does on 'Violet Hill'". Mikael Wood of Spin magazine wrote: [...] "'Violet Hill' pulls a similar fake-out, bludgeoning a delicate Eno-style soundscape with big Black Sabbath guitars." [...] Darcie Stevens of the Austin Chronicle wrote: [...] "While the band's fourth LP begins light and pretty, its power breaks late-album with Old West tangent 'Violet Hill'". [...] The song appeared on Rolling Stones Hot List for May 2009, with the magazine calling it [...] "a (relatively) hard-rocking attack on Fox News' America".|$|E
500|$|The {{envelope}} {{that held}} the hydrogen gas of Myers' torpedo airship was made of red and yellow silk. One of its trips was a distance of 600 miles and it ran at an average speed of 12 miles an hour. It was powered forward by a propeller that spun at 5,000 revolutions per minute. The caloric engine that drove the propeller was a spontaneous combustion engine [...] "fed" [...] with nitroglycerin semi-translucent fuel pellets. This type of airship could hold up to 10 passengers {{or a combination of}} freight and crewmen. Myers' [...] "torpedo" [...] airships were built later in larger versions. Some were entered in airship contests and one was demonstrated at the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904. It was 74 feet long and 21 feet in diameter. It contained 14,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas and would lift 900 pounds of weight. Myers made several successful experimental test flights at his Frankfort [...] "balloon farm" [...] before delivering it to a Mr. Benbow, the purchaser. After that it was referred to as the Benbow airship. The airship had four 10 horse-power gasoline motors that ran propellers of 4 blades each. The four propellers could be manipulated in <b>most</b> <b>any</b> direction so the operator could steer the airship sideways right and left, go up and down, and forward and backwards as desired.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the music video was {{generally}} favorable. Entertainment Weeklys columnist Jim Farber gave the music video an A rating, and called the close-ups of D'Angelo's physique a [...] "measure of the video's smarm-free joy {{that even though the}} camera puts the viewer in the pleasure-giving position, we feel in no way manipulated or debased". Farber also lauded the video's depiction of sexuality, stating [...] "it feels like a privilege to be part of such a comfortable act of carnality. Was it good for you, too?". A columnist for Billboard magazine shared a similar sentiment about the video, writing that [...] "it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in <b>most</b> <b>any</b> woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year". However, David Thigpen of Time magazine criticized the vanity of the video, stating [...] "It's a good song, but I thought he was preening pretty heavily in the video". Thigpen also compared it to the music video for singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette's [...] "Thank U" [...] (1998), which features Morissette appearing nude, and stated [...] "Nakedness is usually an expression of vulnerability — that was the point of the Alanis Morissette video. But in this case, it's really about power, an in-your-face form of masculinity". Douglas Century of The New York Times called it [...] "the most controversial music video to air in years", and favored the video's unconventional concept, writing that [...] "'Untitled' breaks a long-established pattern in hip-hop and R videos in which male artists are often dressed in roughneck gear — baggy jeans, Timberland boots and baseball caps — surrounded by shimmying women in thong bikinis".|$|E
