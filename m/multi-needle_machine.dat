25|$|A <b>multi-needle</b> <b>machine</b> may {{consist of}} {{multiple}} sewing heads, {{each of which}} can sew the same design onto a separate garment concurrently. Such a machine might have 20 or more heads, each consisting of 15 or more needles. A head is usually capable of producing many special fabric effects, including satin stitch embroidery, chain stitch embroidery, sequins, appliqué, and cutwork.|$|E
5000|$|Machinery {{created during}} the 18th- and 19th-century Industrial Revolution changed garment {{production}} with technology such as power looms and sewing machines, making fabrics of more uniform quality and greatly increased production efficiency. Embroidery—once a time-consuming hand-made stitch-by-stitch process—was revolutionized by {{the introduction of}} the Schiffli embroidery machine, invented by Isaak Groebli of Switzerland in 1863. Like the game-changing sewing machine, it operated with a two-thread system. Early production from the <b>multi-needle</b> <b>machine,</b> powered by a hand-turned crank, wasn’t much quicker than handwork, but significantly, multiple copies of identical designs could be created. Groebli's machine utilized the combination of a continuously threaded needle and shuttle containing a bobbin of thread. The shuttle itself looked similar to the hull of a sailboat. [...] "Schiffli" [...] means [...] "little boat" [...] in the Swiss dialect of the German language, so his machine {{came to be known as}} a schiffli machine. [...] An automatic machine, refined by Isaak’s eldest son in 1898, simplified the mechanical system so it could be run by a single operator.|$|E

5000|$|This {{embroidery}} is nowadays typically {{done on a}} multi-head or <b>multi-needle</b> Schiffli <b>machine</b> or loom {{that has}} a very large, continuous and overlapping embroidery field. The lace pattern is designed such that the embroidery thread creates an interlocking series of threads that will, in essence, become a [...] "stand-alone" [...] piece of lace.|$|R
25|$|Depending on its capabilities, {{the machine}} will require {{varying degrees of}} user input to read and sew {{embroidery}} designs. Sewing-embroidery machines generally have only one needle and require the user to change thread colors during the embroidery process. <b>Multi-needle</b> industrial <b>machines</b> are generally threaded prior to running the design and do not require re-threading. These machines require the user to input the correct color change sequence before beginning to embroider. Some can trim and change colors automatically.|$|R
