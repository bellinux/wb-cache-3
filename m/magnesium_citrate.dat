40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the electrolyte alterations of submandibular/sublingual saliva in submandibular sialolithiasis patients compared with saliva from healthy controls. Design: Submandibular/sublingual saliva was collected from 10 submandibular sialolithiasis patients and from 10 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Ion chromatography was performed to determine the concentrations of inorganic cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sodium), inorganic anions (chloride, phosphate, nitrate, and sulphate) and organic anions (thiocyanate, lactate, acetate, and citrate). Results: The calcium concentration was significantly higher in sialolithiasis patients than in controls (P < 0. 05). In contrast, the levels of <b>magnesium</b> and <b>citrate</b> in the saliva of sialolithiasis patients were significantly reduced compared to the values obtained in controls (P < 0. 05). No significant differences were detected among other ions. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that saliva electrolyte composition of sialolithiasis patients is substantially altered with respect to crystallisation mechanisms. Increased calcium ion as a crystallisation substance and decreased <b>magnesium</b> and <b>citrate</b> ions as crystallisation inhibitors may be involved in the etiopathology of calculi formation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>citrate</b> {{works by}} {{attracting}} water through the tissues {{by a process}} known as osmosis. Once in the intestine, it can attract enough water into the intestine to induce defecation. The additional water stimulates bowel motility.

50|$|Hypocitraturia or low urinary citrate {{excretion}} (defined as {{lower than}} 320 mg/day) can cause kidney stones {{in up to}} 2/3 of cases. The protective role of citrate is linked to several mechanisms; in fact, citrate reduces urinary supersaturation of calcium salts by forming soluble complexes with calcium ions and by inhibiting crystal growth and aggregation. The therapy with potassium <b>citrate,</b> or <b>magnesium</b> potassium <b>citrate,</b> is commonly prescribed in clinical practice {{in order to increase}} urinary citrate and to reduce stone formation rates.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the antiurolithiatic effect of standardized methanolic extract of Biophytum sensitivum (MBS) against calcium oxalate urolithiasis in rats. Methods: The MBS was standardized for amentoflavone content by HPLC method. Calcium oxalate urolithiasis was induced in rats by ethylene glycol–ammonium chloride feeding in drinking water. Antiurolithiatic activity of MBS was evaluated at three doses (100, 200 and 400  mg/kg) in curative and preventive regimen by estimating histological changes in kidney and biochemical changes in urine, serum and kidney homogenate. Cystone (500  mg/kg, p. o.) was used as reference standard drug. Results: Ethylene glycol–ammonium chloride feeding caused an increase in urinary volume, oxalate, total protein, phosphate and uric acid levels, along with a decrease in urinary excretion of calcium, <b>magnesium</b> and <b>citrate.</b> Supplementation with MBS significantly prevented change in the urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate, phosphate, total protein, uric acid, <b>magnesium</b> and <b>citrate.</b> The MBS supplementation prevented the elevation of serum creatinine, uric acid and blood urea nitrogen levels. The increased calcium, oxalate and phosphate levels in the kidney of lithiatic control rats were significantly reduced by the MBS supplementation. The MBS supplementation caused {{a significant decrease in}} the lipid peroxidation of kidney tissue. Histological study revealed minimum damage and less number of calcium oxalate deposits in the kidneys of MBS-treated rats. Conclusions: These results indicated that the MBS reduced and prevented the growth of urinary stones.

40|$|Normocalciuric and hypercalciuric {{patients}} with idiopathic recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis {{were compared with}} healthy individuals without such a history to examine the factors that predispose normocalciuric patients to stone formation. The urine calcium excretion rate was higher in the normocalciuric patients than in the control subjects (227 v. 183 mg/ 24 h; P less than 0. 01), but the urine calcium concentration was not significantly different. The urine <b>magnesium</b> and <b>citrate</b> excretion rates and concentrations were lower in the normocalciuric patients than in the control subjects (P less than 0. 001), while the urine uric acid and oxalate excretion rates and concentrations and the urine saturation with brushite (CaHPO 4 - 2 H 2 O) were not significantly different. These results suggest the importance of slight increases in the urine calcium excretion rate together with decreased urine <b>magnesium</b> and <b>citrate</b> excretion rates in normocalciuric persons with recurrent calcium stone formation. The urine of the hypercalciuric patients was more highly saturated with brushite than the urine of the normocalciuric patients and the control subjects, and the excretion rates of uric acid and oxalate were increased in the hypercalciuric patients. The hypercalciuric patients had a higher urine creatinine excretion rate than the normocalciuric patients and a higher daily urine volume than the control subjects, which suggests that differences in lean body mass or fluid and food intake, or both, may be important determinants of these differences in crystalloid excretion.

30|$|Discussion This study {{pinpoints}} three interesting findings. First, it is {{well known}} that hypernatremic metabolic alkalosis may occur under CBA-CRRT in case of using trisodium citrate, which contains a high sodium load (408  mmol/L) as compared to 18 / 0 citrate (140  mmol/L of sodium), but the mild risk of alkalosis due to hypochloremia using dilute citrate (86  mmol/L in 18 / 0) is mostly unrecognized. However, no patient presented severe metabolic alkalosis, but natremia was significantly higher in group A and chloremia lower in group B. Second, hypophosphoremia rate, which has been diagnosed in as many as 65  % of the patients undergoing CRRT when using dialysis or replacement solutions without phosphate, is effectively decreased by using phosphate containing solutions. Finally, attention must be drawn on the high proportion of hypomagnesaemia, even if dialysis and replacement solutions contain <b>magnesium,</b> as <b>citrate</b> creates complex with magnesium as well as calcium.|$|R
50|$|As a {{laxative}} syrup with {{a concentration}} of 1.745 g of <b>magnesium</b> <b>citrate</b> per fluid ounce, a typical dose for adults and children twelve years or older is between 7 and 10 fl oz, followed immediately with a full 8 fl oz glass of water. Consuming an adult dose of 10 oz of laxative syrup (@ 1.745 g/oz) implies a consumption of 17.45 g of <b>magnesium</b> <b>citrate</b> in a single 10 oz dose resulting in a consumption of approximately 2.0 g of elemental magnesium per single dose. Given that this laxative dose contains five times the recommended nutritional dose for magnesium, caution {{should be taken to}} avoid prolonged usage (i.e., over five days) and to follow the manufacturer's instructions strictly. For children between three and twelve years of age, the typical dose is roughly half that, based on physician recommendation. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>citrate</b> is not recommended for use in children and infants two years of age or less.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Citrate, potassium, {{and calcium}} levels in Viburnum opulus (V. opulus) {{and lemon juice}} were {{compared}} to evaluate the usability of V. opulus in mild to moderate level hypocitraturic stone disease. Materials and Methods: V. opulus and lemon fruits were squeezed in a blender and 10 samples of each of 100 ml were prepared.

Results: Potassium {{was found to be}} statistically significantly higher in V. opulus than that in lemon juice (p = 0. 006) whereas sodium (p = 0. 004) and calcium (p = 0. 008) were found to be lower. There was no difference between them in terms of the amount of <b>magnesium</b> and <b>citrate.</b> Concusions: Because V. opulus contains citrate as high as lemon juice does and it is a potassium-rich and calciumand sodium-poor fluid, it can be an alternative to pharmaceutical treatment in mild-to-moderate degree hypocitraturic stone patients. These findings should be supported with clinical studies...|$|R

40|$|The role of citrate washing on the {{physical}} and chemical characteristics of magnesium-substituted apatites (HAMgs) was performed.
