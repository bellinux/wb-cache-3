5|$|On 21 July 2007 Fowler {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} {{to play for}} Cardiff City. He missed the season's opening fixtures {{due to a lack}} of fitness, making his debut in a League Cup tie on 28 August. He scored his first two Cardiff goals on 22 September against Preston North End, scoring with two headers. Fowler scored twice in his next game, a third round League Cup tie against West Brom, which Cardiff won 4–2. This led to a fourth round tie against Fowler's former club Liverpool, at Anfield, to which even the Liverpool faithful crowd urged Fowler to score seeing that it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time he would play in Anfield but Cardiff were knocked out in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E
5|$|The dust is {{constantly}} being {{removed from the}} main ring {{by a combination of}} Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to 1000years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1cm to 0.5km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about 1000km—and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by New Horizons spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from HST and Cassini observations, was near 4km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> remnant of a past population of small bodies near Jupiter.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} realities {{made for}} a precarious diplomatic situation. The international politics of brinkmanship led leaders to exclaim their willingness {{to participate in a}} nuclear war rather than concede any advantage to their opponents, feeding public fears that their generation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last.</b> Civil defense programs undertaken by both superpowers, exemplified by the construction of fallout shelters and urging civilians about the survivability of nuclear war, did little to ease public concerns.|$|E
25|$|Within the Cardamone et al. paper, {{comparisons}} {{are made with}} other compact galaxies, namely Blue Compact Dwarfs Galaxies and UV-luminous Galaxies, at local and much higher distances. The findings show that GPs form a different class of galaxies than Ultra Blue Compact Dwarfs, but may {{be similar to the}} most luminous members of the Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy category. The GPs are also similar to UV-luminous high redshift galaxies such as Lyman-break Galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitter. It is concluded that if the underlying processes occurring in the GPs are similar to that found in the UV-luminous high redshift galaxies, the GPs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> remnants of a mode of star formation common in the early Universe.|$|E
25|$|Following the incident, Jacob's sister Evie Frye arrives from India, {{having been}} summoned by Jacob some time before, {{where she is}} greeted by police {{inspector}} Frederick Abberline, who informs her that Jacob is missing and presumed dead. He also tells her that she <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Assassin in London, {{and the only one}} capable of stopping the Ripper. After finding Jacob's lodgings, Evie takes some non-lethal fear tools used by the Indian Brotherhood. She also deduces that the Ripper is in fact one of Jacob's Assassin Initiates. Afterwards, she kills the Ripper's lieutenants who have been aiding in his crimes and frees a number of prisoners he had been keeping hostage. All the while, the Ripper stalks Evie.|$|E

25|$|The Kirkwall scroll is a floor cloth which {{contains}} many masonic symbols, many more opaque images, and cryptic writing which may either be a code or badly painted Hebrew. It {{hangs on the}} west wall of the temple of Lodge Kirkwall Kilwinning No. 38(2) in Orkney, but is too long to be completely displayed. It is 18ft 6in long and 5ft 6in wide, and is composed of a full-width central strip stitched at each side to two half-width side strips. The left border appears to show the wanderings of the Israelites before they arrived in Egypt, and reads from top to bottom. The right shows their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus, with the route marked in years from 1 to 46, and branching many times at the end. The central cloth contains seven painted scenes and tableaux. The bottom scene shows an altar flanked by two pillars, all surrounded by more or less familiar masonic symbols. Working upwards, the second has an altar surrounded by {{a different set of}} symbols, the third has the altar and pillars together with the cherubim present on the arms of the Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Ireland and the United Grand Lodge of England. Above this is a schematic of the tabernacle of the Ark of the Covenant, followed by what <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> judgement. The sixth shows a cross atop a pyramid, surmounted by a rainbow, surrounded by masonic and alchemical symbols, and at the top a naked woman, assumed by early authors to be Eve, sitting under a tree surrounded by animals. In the distance is a sea or lake full of fish, and beyond this are mountains. The whole is painted in oil, mainly in pale blue. In the top tableau the woman, fish and animals are pink, the sea green, and the tree and mountains brown.|$|E

500|$|By autumn 1963, Jagger {{had left}} the London School of Economics in favour of his {{promising}} musical career with the Rolling Stones. The group continued to play songs by American rhythm and blues artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but with the strong encouragement of manager Andrew Loog Oldham, Jagger and Richards soon began to write their own songs. This core songwriting partnership took some time to develop; one of their early compositions, [...] "As Tears Go By", was a song written for Marianne Faithfull, a young singer Loog Oldham was promoting at the time. For the Rolling Stones, the duo would write [...] "The Last Time", the group's third No. 1 single in the UK (their first two UK No. 1 hits had been remakes of songs {{that had previously been}} recorded by other artists [...] "It's All Over Now" [...] by Bobby Womack and [...] "Little Red Rooster" [...] by Willie Dixon) [...] based on [...] "This <b>May</b> <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> Time", a traditional Negro spiritual song recorded by the Staple Singers in 1955. Jagger and Richards also wrote their first international hit, [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". It also established the Rolling Stones' image as defiant troublemakers in contrast to the Beatles' [...] "lovable moptop" [...] image.|$|E

2500|$|The Finnish Air Force was {{the last}} to use the Gloster biplane in combat. It was under Finnish {{insignia}} that the Gladiator achieved its last air victory. During the Continuation War, against the Soviets, Glosters supported the advance of the Karelian Army around Lake Ladoga. On 15 February 1943, 1st Lt Håkan Strömberg [...] of LLv 16, during a reconnaissance mission along the Murmansk railway, between the White Sea and the Lake Onega, spotted, on Karkijarvi, a Soviet Polikarpov R-5 taking off. Stromberg dived on it and shot it down into the forest near its airfield with two bursts. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> confirmed biplane victory in the aviation history.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, many West Coast {{resorts and}} hotels were {{taken over by}} the U.S. {{government}} for use as housing and hospitals. The Hotel del Coronado housed many pilots, who were being trained at nearby North Island Naval Air Station on a contract basis, but it was never commandeered. General manager Steven Royce convinced the Navy to abstain from taking over the hotel, because most of the additional rooms were being used to house the families of officers. He pointed out that [...] "the fathers, mothers and wives were given priority to the rooms because it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time they will see their sons and husbands." [...] Ultimately the Navy agreed, and the hotel never was appropriated.|$|E
