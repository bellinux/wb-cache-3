This variation of the residual stress has never been measured and, therefore, imposes new experimental challenges. The objective of this work is to correlate the variation of the residual stresses along the cutting path with {{the frequency of the}} surface geometrical defect generated by the vibration of the tool holding system. In order to perform such correlation a hybrid experimental/analytical approach was applied for an austenitic stainless steel, AISI 316 L. Residual stresses were analyzed in the <b>machined</b> <b>specimen</b> along the cutting path using neutron diffraction. The results show a cyclic variation of the residual stresses, which can be detected when considering the frequency of the tool vibration. The frequency of the tool vibration is also correlated with the topology of the surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Different {{methods of}} cutting fluid {{application}} are used on turning of a difficult-to-machine steel (SAE EV- 8). A semi-synthetic cutting fluid was applied using a conventional method, minimum quantity of cutting fluid (MQCF), and pulverization. By the minimum quantity method was also applied a lubricant of vegetable oil (MQL). Thereafter, a cutting fluid jet under high pressure (3. 0 MPa) was singly {{applied in the}} following regions: chip-tool interface; top surface of the chip; and tool-workpiece contact. Two other methods were used: an interflow between conventional application and chip-tool interface jet and, finally, three jets simultaneously applied. In order to carry out these tests, {{it was necessary to}} set up a high pressure system using a piston pump for generating a cutting fluid jet, a Venturi for fluid application (MQCF and MQL), and a nozzle for cutting fluid pulverization. The output variables analyzed included tool life, surface roughness, cutting tool temperature, cutting force, chip form, chip compression rate and <b>machined</b> <b>specimen</b> microstructure. It can be observed that the tool life increases and the cutting force decreases with the application of cutting fluid jet, mainly when it is directed to the chip-tool interface. Excluding the methods involving jet fluid, the conventional method seems to be more efficient than other methods of low pressure...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{quadratic}} models for Material Removal Rare (MRR) and Tool Wear Rate (TWR) {{have been developed}} for inter-relating the machining parameters: current, pulse on-time, pulse off-time, tool material and powder particles in the PMEDM process for Inconel- 800. The box-Behnken method of RSM has been considered for the design the experiments. From the analysis, current, pulse on-time and tool material have found to be the most decisive factors for MRR, while current, pulse on-time, tool material and powder particles for TWR. Pulse off-time has a trifling effect on both the responses while powder particles on MRR. The MRR varied from 4.033 to 35.788 mm 3 /min and TWR from 0.002 to 1.957 mm 3 /min. The error between experimental and expected values for material removal rate and tool wear rate within[*]±[*] 9.8 % and[*]±[*] 8.5 %, respectively. This confirms an outstanding reproducibility of the experimental results. From multiple response optimizations, the optimal combination of parameters are current 1 amp, pulse on-time 0.98 μs, pulse off-time 0.03 μs, tool material 0.31 and the powder (suspended particles) 0.64. It is clear from SEM micrographs that the current, pulse on-time and tool material affects the integrity of <b>machined</b> <b>specimen</b> resulting in the formation of debris, deep craters, micro cracks and pock marks. Residuals of carbon and copper have also been identified on the machined surface during the EDS and XRD analysis.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experimental investigations on determination of pressure force of power fluid-jet stream on plane surfaces of specimens having various shape. The results permit efficiently to realize {{a number of}} technological processes which directly depend on quality of surface cleaning from corrosion. A principle diagram has been developed for a dynamometer {{in order to measure}} a force F acting on the <b>machined</b> <b>specimen</b> with measuring range from 0 to 50 N and an error which constitutes 2 % of maximum value of the measured load. Two diagrams for jet stream flow after its interaction with the specimen have been proposed for a comparative analysis while measuring force F, namely: radial fluid spreading at angle β = 90 ° and reversible stream flow due to one-eighty stream turn after its interaction with plane surface of the specimen. Methodology has been established for registration of force F on plane specimens having various shape. Pressure at the nozzle input р в х, i and distance L i from the nozzle to the machined surface of the specimen have been taken as variable parameters for both loading diagrams (β = 90 ° and 180 °). Investigation results have made it possible to determine that usage of reversible stream flow ensures maximum force action on plane surface of the specimen in the investigated range of pressures р в х   = 3. 5 – 10. 0 MPa and distances from nozzle to the machined surface L = 8 – 30 mm. In this case maximum action force (irrespective of pressure at input р в х  and distance from nozzle to the machined surface L) is observed at stream squeezing ratio λ = 0. 063 and this effect is attributed to optimum ratio of cavity diameter D 0 and stream diameter d c тр. The obtained results allow reasonably to select pump equipment and efficiently execute technology for cleaning plane surfaces from corrosion with due account of stream squeezing ratio λ which is taken as a criterion. </p...|$|E

40|$|White {{layer is}} a generic {{term for a}} light etching surface layer on metal alloys that can result under extreme {{deformation}} conditions in wear, sliding or machining. While {{there has been some}} characterization of white layer due to abusive machining, the specific effect on fatigue crack initiation life has not been well documented. This study aimed to establish a relationship between the presence of white layer due to abusive machining and fatigue crack initiation life in a wrought nickel based superalloy (Udimet ® 720). ^ Low cycle fatigue testing was conducted on large specimens containing through holes drilled with parameters aimed at creating holes with and without white layer. Initially, Acoustic Emission monitoring technologies were used to monitor for acoustic events associated with crack initiation, however, this technology was deemed unreliable for this testing. Instead, cycles to crack initiation was determined using striation density measurements on each fracture surface to estimate the number of cycles of crack propagation, which was subtracted from the total number of cycles for the specimen. A total of sixteen specimens were tested in this manner. ^ The results suggested that the crack initiation lives of holes machined with good machining parameters were statistically longer than crack initiation lives of holes machined with poor machining parameters. The mean initiation life of the poorly <b>machined</b> <b>specimens</b> was a factor of approximately 2 times shorter than the mean initiation life of the well <b>machined</b> <b>specimens.</b> The holes <b>machined</b> with good machining parameters exhibited subsurface initiations which suggested that no anomalies affected crack initiation for these specimens. It was also shown that some of the poorly machined holes exhibited subsurface initiations rather than initiations at white layer damage. These holes had better surface finish than the poorly <b>machined</b> <b>specimens</b> that did fail at white layer. The mean initiation life of the poorly machined holes with subsurface initiation was 7 times longer than the mean initiation life of the holes that exhibited white layer at the crack origins.
