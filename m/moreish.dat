Sabrina specialises in cooking up colourful, <b>moreish</b> dishes with Eastern flavours in an abundant ‘Mezze’ style with unique recipes and techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Patrick Sproull from Den of Geek {{said that}} [...] "Scream Queens remains engrossing {{television}} and Haunted House greatly improves things by spicing up the core mystery. episode was <b>moreish</b> and had me itching {{for the next}} instalment more than ever before. Caralynn Lippo from TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.75/5.0 stars and said that Haunted House [...] "was {{a bit of an}} uneven hour but had its share of laugh-out-loud moments and memorable performances", and praised the performances of Keke Palmer and Glen Powell.|$|E
5000|$|James Kidd of The Independent has {{reservations}} :"Watson's take on {{the material}} is clever, convincing and <b>moreish.</b> Christine's life is mundane, but filled with tantalising possibilities: the early chapters fly by as you wonder exactly who to trust. The fun comes from spotting the plot holes that Watson later exploits for all they're worth." [...] and he concludes [...] "The ending feels hurried; a sentimental postscript to the meticulously plotted main event. But these are minor gripes. Before I Go to Sleep is an enjoyable and impressive first novel." ...|$|E
5000|$|Digital Spy music {{reporter}} Robert Copsey gave [...] "One Touch" [...] {{five out}} of five stars, stating:After a quivering, '80s-ish intro, Britt and Frankee get straight down to the dirty, teasing: [...] "Do you want a candy? Hey baby! / With a different taste?" [...] {{without so much as}} a flinch or giggle from either of them. Thankfully, the cheeky lyrics are backed by a typically infectious Xenomania production boasting struttable synths, loads of [...] "whooosh!" [...] effects and a chorus as <b>moreish</b> as a bag of Haribo Tangfastics. We may have waited five months for it, but the result is a fool-proof pop stomper that should return the pair to their rightful place at the top of the charts.|$|E
5000|$|Stadium Arcadium {{received}} generally favorable reviews, with Rolling Stone stating {{it was the}} band's best album yet {{and giving}} it a rating of 4/5. Rolling Stone also declared {{it to be the}} second-best album released in 2006, behind Modern Times by Bob Dylan. Rolling Stone critic Brian Hiatt also noted Kiedis' growth as a singer and songwriter: [...] "the guy Kiedis who once yelped, 'I want to party on your pussy!' whisper-sings a gentler, though not unrelated, proposition: 'All I want is for you to be happy/And take this moment to make you my family.' The delicate 'Hard to Concentrate' is the most vulnerable Peppers tune ever—a full-on marriage proposal from Anthony Kiedis, with Flea's muted bass and John Frusciante's layered guitars slow-dancing over Afrobeat hand drums." [...] Q magazine said {{it was one of the}} year's best albums and rated it at 5/5, whilst Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic called it over-produced and self-indulgent and thus gave it 3.5/5. The Observer stated it was [...] "relentless, purposeful, as <b>moreish</b> as McDonald's - is mainstream America in excelsis." [...] Josh Kun of Los Angeles Times observes [...] "...they've never sounded this good as musicians. The use of analog tape lends a raw, organic touch to the whole album and the Chili Peppers come off more assured and confident than they ever did back when they made a career out of bragging." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Jon O'Brien from Allmusic said that: [...] " [...] The lead single [...] "On a Mission," [...] a gloriously camp retro-fueled anthem, manages {{to evoke the}} spirit of Olivia Newton-John's [...] "Xanadu," [...] Toni Basil's [...] "Mickey," [...] and the Bangles' [...] "Walk Like an Egyptian," [...] all in one Hi-NRG three-minute song. It's a bold statement of intent that indicates from the offset that far from the half-expected tortured singer/songwriter vibe, Ten is only concerned with having fun". Nick Levine from Digital Spy reviewed the song positively, stating that [...] "it's a proper pop stomper that sounds like something the Pointer Sisters {{could have had a}} hit with in 1982. Well, kind of. There are Casio-ish synths on the verses, the bridges take the song into disco territory, and it's got a big, guitar-driven chorus that grabs you on first listen." [...] Later, he gave to the song 4 stars (out of 5) and completes the review, saying that the song is [...] "instantly satisfying, <b>moreish</b> too and just as cheesy as it needs to be". Popjustice named [...] "On a Mission" [...] their Song of the Day on 6 January 2010, further commenting that the song sounds like [...] "a chart-friendly mix of Blondie, Joan Jett, Van Halen and Lil' Chris." [...] It also was ranked the 45th best single of 2010 by Popjustice.|$|E
