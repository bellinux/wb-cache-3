5|$|Thick haze {{and smoke}} {{originating}} from burning biomass in northwestern India {{and air pollution}} from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin. Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols along the southern <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the sheer-faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal. Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the air over the Tibetan Plateau. The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of moisture in the mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.|$|E

50|$|Elections in Missouri have {{historically}} always been rather close, and the Democratic Primary of 2008 proved no exception to that trend as Barack Obama of neighboring Illinois just barely nipped Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has roots in neighboring Arkansas, by fewer than 12,000 votes. The popular vote was so close, however, that both candidates ended up evenly splitting the state’s 72 delegates. According to exit polls, 76 {{percent of voters}} in the Missouri Democratic Primary were Caucasians and they opted for Clinton by a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> 57-39 compared to the 17 percent of African Americans who backed Obama by a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> 84-15.

Pertaining to socioeconomic class, Clinton won extremely poor voters making less than $15,000 a year by a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> 52-45 while Obama won voters making $15,000-$30,000 by a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> 55-42.

As it relates to educational attainment, Clinton won less educated voters (those who did not graduate high school backed her by a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> 55-42 compared to those who at least graduated high school who went for her 53-44) while Obama won more educated voters (those who had some college and/or an associate’s degree backed him 52-45; college graduates went for him 64-30, and those who had a postgraduate degree supported him 67-32). Self-identified Democrats, who made up 73 percent of the total turnout in the Democratic Primary, backed Clinton by a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> 50-47 compared to the 22 percent of Independents who supported Obama by a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> 67-30 and self-identified Republicans, who comprised 6 percent of the electorate, who supported Obama by a <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> 75-21.
