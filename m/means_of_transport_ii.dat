At first this paper describes the chosen centers Brno and Karlovy Vary and districts where the centers are placed.

The <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> are described from the prize angle and the time angle. <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> chosen for this paper are train, bus and car. Other <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> or combination <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> was not coceded. Results from this analysis show, that the selection <b>of</b> the best <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> is not single valued. It is because the best <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> from the prize angle are not in all cases the best <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> from the time angle...|$|R

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of methods for the {{environmental}} evaluation <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> are currently in use. Many of them focus on direct environmental effects related to the use <b>of</b> a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b> Some <b>of</b> them use idealized conditions. Others evaluate the real-life effects. The former may be useful for environmental categorization <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> the latter have an obvious advantage in the determination of real-life impacts. For this purpose both direct measurements and model-based approaches are available. There are also evaluations that {{take into account the}} life cycle <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> starting with the extraction of raw materials and ending with disposal. As yet no full Life Cycle Assessment has been published for a complete <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b> However several Life Cycle Assessments, concentrating on major environmental impacts and/or the most important parts of the automobile have been done. In view of the limited availability of reliable data it is argued that such approaches are not a bad choice...|$|R

40|$|The choice <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> {{for regular}} {{commuting}} {{is an issue}} which concerns {{a wide range of}} working and student population. The aim of the thesis is to explain on a representative sample of the population this choice <b>of</b> different <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> for regular commuting to work and school from a small town in a relatively peripheral position. This thesis deals with some aspects that influence the choice <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> in Zruc nad Sazavou for regular commuting. The results are also supported by a questionnaire survey. Analyses are conducted on the basis of quasi-experimental approach assessment of individual indicators. The next part of the thesis deals with the specifics of the choice <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> on the selected routes from Zruc nad Sazavou. The research has demonstrated the validity of the hypotheses. The most common <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> used for commuting to selected towns is a car for its flexibility and speed <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b> For certain groups <b>of</b> people public <b>transport</b> is still playing its role in providing transport services...|$|R
