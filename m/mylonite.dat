5|$|The Barranca Blanca and Carachi Ignimbrites {{are covered}} by lavas from Volcán Carachipampa and are thus older than 0.75 mya. They contain pumices of various colours and lithic fragments, {{including}} <b>mylonite</b> and schist. The Barranca Blanca ignimbrite is white in colour and contains rhyodacitic white pumice with subordinate amounts of grey trachyandesitic pumice. The Carachi Ignimbrite overlies the Barranca Blanca ignimbrite. It is weakly welded and contains white pumice and crystals with fiamme. Both of these are pyroclastic density currents that were still hot {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{runs through}} {{an area with}} complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsnøy Basement Rock on the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the {{creation}} of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to <b>mylonite.</b> In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro. At the lowest point, the tunnel runs through a section of phyllite, which continues to be the dominant species until the tunnel reaches Otterøya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises again through more phyllite.|$|E
25|$|The {{area had}} {{undergone}} polyphase deformation. The planar S0, {{is defined by}} the layering within chemogenic precipitate (BIF). The earliest folds F1, apart from being tight and appressed occur in intrafolial positions and also constitute the rootless folds. This folding has given rise to an axial planar penetrative foliation and is defined mainly by hornblende and to a lesser extend by chlorite and is co-parallel to the lithoboundaries identified as S0. S1 schistosity is defined by hornblende and chlorite, and this mineralogical association suggests that the deformation occurred under upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies conditions. The subsequent F2 resulted in refolding of S1 and transposition of S1 subparallel to the F2 axial trace. The most prominent planar structures are the discrete mylonitic foliation S2 attributed the regional NE-SW trending Bhavani shear. <b>Mylonite</b> development, biotitization, chloritization and microgranulation are found associated with these surfaces.|$|E
40|$|Grey {{and white}} {{carbonate}} <b>mylonites</b> were collected along thrust planes of the Helvetic Alps. They are characterised by very small grain sizes and non-random grain shape (SPO) and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Presumably they deformed {{in the field}} of grain size sensitive flow by recrystallisation accommodated intracrystalline deformation in combination with granular flow. Both <b>mylonites</b> show a similar mean grain size, but in the grey <b>mylonites</b> the grain size range is larger, the grain shapes are more elongate and the dynamically recrystallised calcite grains are more often twinned. Grey <b>mylonites</b> have an oblique CPO, while the CPO in white <b>mylonites</b> is symmetric with respect to the shear plane. Combustion analysis and TEM investigations revealed that grey <b>mylonites</b> contain a higher amount of highly structured kerogens with particle sizes of a few tens of nanometers, which are finely dispersed at the grain boundaries. During deformation of the rock, nano-scale particles reduced the migration velocity of grain boundaries by Zener drag resulting in slower recrystallisation rates of the calcite aggregate. In the grey <b>mylonites,</b> more strain increments were accommodated by individual grains before they became refreshed by dynamic recrystallisation than in white <b>mylonites,</b> where grain boundary migration was less hindered and recrystallisation cycles were faster. Consequently, grey <b>mylonites</b> represent ‘deformation’ microfabrics while white <b>mylonites</b> are characterised by ‘recrystallisation’ microfabrics. Field geologists must utilise this different deformation behavior when applying the obliquity in CPO and SPO of the respective <b>mylonites</b> as reliable shear sense indicators...|$|R
50|$|<b>Mylonites</b> are ductilely {{deformed}} rocks {{formed by}} the accumulation of large shear strain, in ductile fault zones. There are many different views on the formation of <b>mylonites,</b> but it is generally agreed that crystal-plastic deformation must have occurred, and that fracturing and cataclastic flow are secondary processes {{in the formation of}} <b>mylonites.</b> Mechanical abrasion of grains by milling does not occur, although this was originally thought to be the process that formed <b>mylonites,</b> which were named from the Greek μύλος mylos, meaning mill.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mylonites</b> {{start to}} occur {{with the onset}} of semibrittle {{behaviour}} in the alternating zone characterised by adhesive wear. Pseudotachylites can still be encountered here.

Striped gneisses are high-grade <b>mylonites</b> and occur at the very bottom of ductile shear zones.|$|R

40|$|Microstructures {{and textures}} of calcite <b>mylonites</b> from the Morcles nappe {{large-scale}} shear zone in southwestern Switzerland develop principally {{as a function}} of 1) extrinsic physical parameters including temperature, stress, strain, strain rate and 2) intrinsic parameters, such as mineral composition. We collected rock samples at a single location from this shear zone, on which laboratory ultrasonic velocities, texture and microstructures were investigated and quantified. The samples had different concentration of secondary mineral phases (< 5 up to 40 vol. %). Measured seismic P wave anisotropy ranges from 6. 5 % for polyphase <b>mylonites</b> (~ 40 vol. %) to 18. 4 % in <b>mylonites</b> with < 5 vol. % secondary phases. Texture strength of calcite is the main factor governing the seismic P wave anisotropy. Measured S wave splitting is generally highest in the foliation plane, but its origin is more difficult to explain solely by calcite texture. Additional texture measurements were made on calcite <b>mylonites</b> with low concentration of secondary phases (≤ 10 vol. %) along the metamorphic gradient of the shear zone (15 km distance). A systematic increase in texture strength is observed moving from the frontal part of the shear zone (anchimetamorphism; 280 °C) to the higher temperature, basal part (greenschist facies; 350 – 400 °C). Calculated P wave velocities become increasingly anisotropic towards the high-strain part of the nappe, from an average of 5. 8 % in the frontal part to 13. 2 % in the root of the basal part. Secondary phases raise an additional complexity, and may act either to increase or decrease seismic anisotropy of shear zone <b>mylonites.</b> In light of our findings we reinterpret the origin of some seismically reflective layers in the Grône–Zweisimmen line in southwestern Switzerland (PNR 20 Swiss National Research Program). We hypothesize that reflections originate in part from the lateral variation in textural and microstructural arrangement of calcite <b>mylonites</b> in shear zones...|$|R
