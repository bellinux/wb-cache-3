5|$|In the 1st {{millennium}} BC, typical ancient Chinese writing <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> bronzewares, animal bones, and bamboo slips or wooden boards. By {{the beginning}} of the Han dynasty, the chief writing <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> clay tablets, silk cloth, and rolled scrolls made from bamboo strips sewn together with hempen string; these were passed through drilled holes and secured with clay stamps.|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} {{ejected from}} the volcano mainly consisted of water vapor, along with smaller amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} sulfur dioxide.

5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she enjoyed {{the prospect of}} rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens {{as a champion of}} black people was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E

5|$|In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild {{began work}} on Waddesdon Manor, a short {{distance}} south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill {{to provide access to}} the construction site. Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and Westcott stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails up the hill to a gully close to the building site. <b>Materials</b> <b>were</b> hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> hauled along the branch by horses.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, it was {{proposed}} to list Loring on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List. This {{was due to}} the presence of waste oil, fuel, solvents, and pesticides in the soil. Additionally, the burning of waste also created problems, in addition to the use of landfills in old gravel pits on site. The fire training area also needed clean up, as <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> burned until 1974 on that site. Loring was officially added to the list in February 1990.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{after the}} field of the hoard find was ploughed, the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service {{surveyed}} the field, finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins, all {{considered part of the}} same hoard.

5|$|Indiana {{participated in}} the {{mobilization}} of the nation's economy and resources. Domestically, the state produced munitions in an army plant near Sellersburg. The P-47 fighter-plane was manufactured in Evansville at Republic Aviation. The steel produced in northern Indiana was used in tanks, battleships, and submarines. Other war-related <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> produced throughout the state. Indiana's military bases were activated, with areas such as Camp Atterbury reaching historical peaks in activity.|$|E

50|$|If χ <b>is</b> positive, a <b>material</b> can <b>be</b> para{{magnetic}}. In this case, {{the magnetic}} field in the <b>material</b> <b>is</b> strengthened by the induced magnetization. Alternatively, if χ <b>is</b> negative, the <b>material</b> <b>is</b> diamagnetic. In this case, {{the magnetic field}} in the <b>material</b> <b>is</b> weakened by the induced magnetization. Generally, non-magnetic <b>materials</b> <b>are</b> said to be para- or diamagnetic {{because they do not}} possess permanent magnetization without external magnetic field. Ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, or antiferromagnetic materials have positive susceptibility and possess permanent magnetization even without external magnetic field.|$|R
5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials. These <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{palatial}} {{control over}} resources {{appears to have}} been highly selective in spatial terms and in terms of how different industries were managed. Thus, sectors like the production of perfumed oil and bronze <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> directly monitored from the palace, but the production of ceramics was only indirectly monitored. Regional transactions between the palaces are also recorded on a few occasions.|$|E
5|$|Only about 1300 {{cartridges}} of {{the estimated}} 700,000 {{were removed from the}} burial, as the remaining <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> deeper than expected, and made them more difficult to access, according to Alamogordo mayor Susie Galea. The burial was refilled following this event. Joseph Lewandowski, who had worked to arrange the unearthing with the city, said that this was a one-time shot to recover materials from the site, as they do not expect the city to agree to a similar event again.|$|E

In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to decorating the walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects. There were some painters of Serb heritage living outside Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction <b>materials</b> <b>were</b> to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E
