60|$|My thirty-third lies {{now before}} <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>finished,</b> and I {{am going to}} seal and send it, so let me know whether you would have me add anything: I gave you my journal of this day; {{and it is now}} nine at night, and I am going to be busy for an hour or two.|$|R
60|$|It {{opened into}} the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs. Heathcliff, {{kneeling}} on the hearth, reading a book by {{the aid of the}} blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her eyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog, now and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire, his back towards <b>me,</b> <b>just</b> <b>finishing</b> a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and heave an indignant groan.|$|R

2500|$|My brother, Buddy Wootten, also a bassist, {{called me}} from Atlanta to tell <b>me</b> he had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> working the Fox Theater with Les Paul and Mary Ford. Mary {{also told me}} this later. This was while I was holding forth with Woody Herman Orchestra. So, later when I had married her sister (Eva), we worked with her other sister and Bob Summers (her brother) on guitar (sounds like Les Paul too) and Mary's other sister Carol.

At 3:45pm Maden telephoned the 999 emergency services number and said: [...] "Hi, I would like to report a murder." [...] He then gave his name and address and when asked by the operator what had happened he replied: [...] "My niece has been murdered by <b>me</b> ...

6000|$|The {{disclosure}} of her powers, {{as he told}} Dr. Britt--after they were both involved in the curious case--came violently, without warning, {{a few days after}} Adele's death. [...] "I was sitting with Mrs. Lambert in sad conversation, seeking her aid and comfort. Viola occupied a low chair beside the shaded lamp, a book upon her knee. She was listening to <b>me.</b> I had <b>just</b> <b>finished</b> saying, in deeply passionate tones, 'I would give all my hope of life for one whisper from the lips of my Adele,' when the room began to darken. At first I thought the effect lay in my own brain, but a moment later I perceived that the light had actually begun to fail. We all watched it in silence for a moment, then Mrs. Lambert remarked, 'Viola, Mary forgot to fill the lamp.' ...|$|R
