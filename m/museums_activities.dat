50|$|The qualities {{which had}} made for Solbert's {{successful}} career as an officer and a business executive proved to be equally applicable to this career as the first Director of the George Eastman Museum (then George Eastman House). Supported by curator Beaumont Newhall, Oscar Solbert was the guiding spirit behind many of the <b>museums</b> <b>activities</b> and responsible in large part for important additions to the physical plant of the institution. The Dryden Theatre, the Strong film vaults, and other important additions to the institution, were given by their generous donors in response to Solbert's eloquent presentation of the contribution these addition would make {{to the work of}} the museum. His friends were world wide and a reflection of his varied interests. Solbert had living quarters {{on the third floor of}} George Eastman's mansion until the day of his death, and continued to be an amazingly young appearing and vigorous individual, completely belying his seventy three years. No one had a greater zest for living and few were able to enjoy it as he did right up to the end. This was the happy Warrior; he whom every man in arms should wish to be.|$|E
