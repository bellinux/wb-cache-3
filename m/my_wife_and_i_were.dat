2500|$|In April 1995, the McCombs {{sold the}} house to a local real estate agent, Christopher Shellabear: [...] "“Our family all left home and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{rattling}} around in this huge house”, Harold McComb explained. On 30 June 1995, following receipt of petition from local residents worried about the potential redevelopment of the site, the Heritage Council of Western Australia issued a Stop Work (or Conservation) order under Section 59 of the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990. On 17 July 1995, Chris Shellabear sold the now-encumbered property to Sharon Creasy, wife of prospector Mark Creasy, for $2.7 million. On 10 October 1995, the Heritage Council of Western Australia added the property to the State Register of Heritage Places on an [...] "interim" [...] basis. The Creasys contested the interim listing for nine years, and in 2004 the Heritage Council removed the dwelling from the interim listing {{and placed it on}} the permanent register. [...] There was a legal dispute as to whether the listing was done correctly, resulting in the Heritage Council re-registering it on the permanent list in May 2005. The Creasys estimate that the dispute has cost them $225,000 in legal fees and claim that the house is now uninhabitable, estimating it would cost at least $2.8 million to make it liveable and much more to renovate it completely.|$|E
60|$|On {{the last}} {{occasion}} when I made a lengthened stay in London, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> surprised and amused one morning by {{the receipt of}} the following note, addressed {{to me in a}} small, crabbed, foreign-looking handwriting.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> both so fond {{of country}} life and country pursuits that month after month passed by at our little farm in a {{succession}} of delightful days. Time flew like a [...] "limited express" [...] train, and it was September before we knew it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Some {{time ago}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hatched out twelve little tadpoles. They were the sweetest {{children}} parents ever looked on. Their heads {{were all very}} large and round, and their tails were long and feathery, while their skins were as black and shiny as could be. We were proud of them, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> took great pains to train our children properly, that they might become respectable frogs, in time, and be a credit to us.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{could not}} forbear exchanging a glance of intelligence, which Mrs. Hasketh intercepted.|$|R
60|$|About noon on the {{following}} day, when <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> laughing and arguing over some little domestic detail of our meagre establishment--so soon are great griefs forgotten in an overwhelming joy, of a sudden I saw her face change, and asked what was the matter.|$|E
60|$|By the {{afternoon}} of the next day the abodes of those two most energetic and capable housewives, Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, were fully prepared for the reception of their visitors, and the Dusante family were ensconced beneath the roof of the one, while <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> most warmly welcomed at the gaily adorned door of the other.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{sitting at}} the open bow-window of my study, {{watching}} the tuft of bright-red leaves on our favorite maple, which warned us that summer was over. I was solacing myself, like all the world in our days, with reading the [...] "Schönberg Cotta Family," [...] when my wife made her voice heard through the enchanted distance, and dispersed the pretty vision of German cottage life.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> opened the portfolio, {{and read the}} strange story of George Germaine's marriage.|$|R
60|$|MANY {{years have}} passed since <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> left the United States to pay our first visit to England.|$|R

60|$|Whilst I, busied with my fiction, kept to my study, Zulime was ecstatically rearranging furniture. During our absence in Colorado, {{father had}} moved to another house, relinquishing all claim on the Homestead, {{and for the first}} time in our lives <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{authentic}} householders in full possession of every room. We had a door-bell, and our clock was our own. Our meal-times conformed to our will, and not to another's. We went to bed when we pleased, and rose when we got ready.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll not gainsay that, Frank," [...] said Stanley, {{with a quiet}} smile; [...] "and I {{think we}} {{are not likely to}} err much when we apply censure to ourselves. It is curious that you and I should have been {{thinking}} of the very same subject. A few days ago, while <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> conversing together about the Esquimaux, we agreed to devote a good deal of our leisure time next winter to reading and explaining the Bible to our Esquimau interpreters, in the hope that they may afterwards be the means of much good among their poor countrymen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a hop {{merchant}} myself, and as I have {{an income}} of seven or eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was very countrified, considering {{that it is so}} close to town. We had an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at {{the other side of the}} field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you got half way to the station. My business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in our country home <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> just as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, sir," [...] he said, [...] "excuse me. This {{woman is}} <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feared {{that she was}} drowned. You have brought me back to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{through the}} land at eve we went, [...] And pluck'd the ripen'd ears. We fell out, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> [...] <b>And</b> kissed again with tears: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is inconceivable," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "that any {{one should}} attempt the descent! We have rugs, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> We stay here till the clouds pass." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the trial}} the whole case was very clearly proved against him, and my innocence was fully {{established}} before {{the face of}} all my fellow-countrymen. A fortnight later <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> among the rocks and woods at Ambleside; and when I returned to London, it was to take a place in the department of coins at the British Museum, which the superintendent begged of me to accept as some further proof in the eyes of everybody that the suspicion he had formed in the matter of the Wulfric was a most unfounded and wholly erroneous one. The coin itself I kept as a memento of a terrible experience; but I have given up collecting on my own account entirely, and am quite content nowadays to bear my share in guarding the national collection from other depredators of the class of Mactavish.|$|E
60|$|The partial {{restraint}} and embarrassment, caused at {{first by the}} strange terms on which <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> living together, gradually vanished before the frequency of my visits to North Villa. We soon began to speak with all the ease, all the unpremeditated frankness of a long intimacy. Margaret's powers of conversation were generally only employed to lead me to exert mine. She was never tired of inducing me to speak of my family. She listened with every appearance of interest, while I talked of my father, my sister, or my elder brother; but whenever she questioned me directly about any of them, her inquiries invariably led away from their characters and dispositions, to their personal appearance, their every-day habits, their dress, their intercourse with the gay world, the things they spent their money on, and other topics of a similar nature.|$|E
6000|$|During the {{two years}} which {{immediately}} preceded the cessation of my official life, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> working together at the [...] "Liberty." [...] I had first planned and written it as a short essay in 1854. It was in mounting {{the steps of the}} Capitol, in January, 1855, that the thought first arose of converting it into a volume. None of my writings have been either so carefully composed, or so sedulously corrected as this. After it had been written as usual twice over, we kept it by us, bringing it out from time to time, and going through it de novo, reading, weighing, and criticizing every sentence. Its final revision was to have been a work of the winter of 1858-9, the first after my retirement, which we had arranged to pass in the south of Europe. That hope and every other were frustrated by the most unexpected and bitter calamity of her death--at Avignon, on our way to Montpellier, from a sudden attack of pulmonary congestion.|$|E
6000|$|We {{were seated}} at breakfast one morning, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> when the maid {{brought in a}} telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{then you}} cannot quite {{understand}} it. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{have been married}} for nearly fifty years, and we have never been parted, never at all, until now." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>Wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was a British {{television}} comedy which {{aired on}} ITV in 1958. It {{was produced by}} Associated-Rediffusion Television. It starred Mai Zetterling, Rex Garner and Joan Benham.|$|R
60|$|They {{were gone}} to bed at the log Inn, which was the only house of {{entertainment}} in the place, but soon answered to our knocking, and got some tea for us {{in a sort of}} kitchen or common room, tapestried with old newspapers, pasted against the wall. The bed-chamber to which <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> shown, was a large, low, ghostly room; with a quantity of withered branches on the hearth, and two doors without any fastening, opposite to each other, both opening on the black night and wild country, and so contrived, that one of them always blew the other open: a novelty in domestic architecture, which I do not remember to have seen before, and which I was somewhat disconcerted to have forced on my attention after getting into bed, as I had a considerable sum in gold for our travelling expenses, in my dressing-case. Some of the luggage, however, piled against the panels, soon settled this difficulty, and my sleep would not have been very much affected that night, I believe, though it had failed to do so.|$|E
6000|$|The {{circumstance}} of Clive's legacy {{he never}} understood: {{but more than}} once spoke of Barnes to Ethel, and sent his compliments to him, and said he should like to shake him by the hand. Barnes Newcome never once offered to touch that honoured hand, though his sister bore her uncle's message to him. They came often from Bryanstone Square; Mrs. Hobson even offered to sit with the Colonel, and read to him, and brought him books for his improvement. But her presence disturbed him; he cared not for her books; the two nurses whom he loved faithfully watched him; and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> admitted to him sometimes, both of whom he honoured with regard and recognition. As for F. B., {{in order to be}} near his Colonel, did not that good fellow take up his lodging in Cistercian Lane, at the Red Cow? He is one whose errors, let us hope, shall be pardoned, quia multum amavit. I am sure he felt ten times more joy at hearing of Clive's legacy, than if thousands had been bequeathed to himself. May good health and good fortune speed him! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{somewhat}} advanced housekeepers, and our dwelling {{was first}} furnished by her father, in the old-fashioned jog-trot days when furniture {{was made with}} a view to its lasting from generation to generation. Everything was strong and comfortable,--heavy mahogany, guiltless of the modern device of veneering, and hewed out with a square solidity which had not an idea of change. It was, so to speak, a sort of granite foundation of the household structure. Then we commenced housekeeping with the full idea that our house was a thing to be lived in, and that furniture was made to be used. That most sensible of women, Mrs. Crowfield, agreed fully with me that in our house there was to be nothing too good for ourselves,--no room shut up in holiday attire to be enjoyed by strangers for three or four days in the year, while we lived in holes and corners; no best parlor from which we were to be excluded; no silver plate to be kept in the safe in the bank, and brought home only in case of a grand festival, while our daily meals were served with dingy Britannia. [...] "Strike a broad, plain average," [...] I said to my wife; [...] "have everything abundant, serviceable, and give all our friends exactly what we have ourselves, no better and no worse;" [...] and my wife smiled approval on my sentiment.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{will think}} it over. I am {{fond of the}} sea, but shall {{certainly}} be fonder of <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel that your wishes in the matter should weigh with me.” ...|$|R
60|$|Left in the dark, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sought each other's arms again, {{and stood}} {{together}} {{for a few moments}} heart to heart, tightly clasping each other, and kissed each other fervently.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I {{will get}} to my {{business}} without delay. I thought it might interest {{you to know that}} I propose to bring a counter-petition against <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall make you co-respondent.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{staying at}} {{a small town in}} {{northern}} Italy; and on a certain pleasant afternoon in spring we had taken a walk of six or seven miles to see the sun set behind some low mountains {{to the west of the}} town. Most of our walk had been along a hard, smooth highway, and then we turned into a series of narrower roads, sometimes bordered by walls, and sometimes by light fences of reed or cane. Nearing the mountain, to a low spur of which we intended to ascend, we easily scaled a wall about four feet high, and found ourselves upon pasture-land, which led, sometimes by gradual ascents, and sometimes by bits of rough climbing, to the spot we wished to reach. We were afraid we were a little late, and therefore hurried on, running up the grassy hills, and bounding briskly over the rough and rocky places. I carried a knapsack strapped firmly to my shoulders, and under my wife's arm was a large, soft basket of a kind much used by tourists. Her arm was passed through the handles and around the bottom of the basket, which she pressed closely to her side. This was the way she always carried it. The basket contained two bottles of wine, one sweet for my wife, and another a little acid for myself. Sweet wines give me a headache.|$|E
6000|$|We {{first met}} Glendenning on the Canadian boat which carries {{you down the}} rapids of the St. Lawrence from Kingston and leaves you at Montreal. When we saw a {{handsome}} young clergyman across the promenade-deck looking up from his guide-book toward us, now and again, as if in default of knowing any one else he would be very willing to know us, we decided that I must make his acquaintance. He was instantly and cordially responsive to my question whether he had ever made the trip before, and he was amiably grateful when in my quality of old habitué of the route I pointed out some characteristic features of the scenery. I showed him just where {{we were on the}} long map of the river hanging over his knee, and I added, with no great relevancy, that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> renewing the fond emotion of our first trip down the St. Lawrence in the character of bridal pair which we had spurned when it was really ours. I explained that we had left the children with my wife's aunt, so as to render the travesty more lifelike; and when he said, [...] "I suppose you miss them, though," [...] I gave him my card. He tried to find one of his own to give me in return, but he could only find a lot of other people's cards. He wrote his name on the back of one, {{and handed it to me}} with a smile. [...] "It won't do for me to put 'reverend' before it, in my own chirography, but that's the way I have it engraved." ...|$|E
60|$|As soon as I left, {{it seems}} the king called for a Winchester and strolled outside the palisade, {{awaiting}} the defaulter. That day Tembinok' wore the woman's frock; as like as not, his make-up was completed by a pith helmet and blue spectacles. Conceive the glaring stretch of sand-hills, the dwarf palms with their noon-day shadows, {{the line of the}} palisade, the crone sentries (each by a small clear fire) cooking syrup on their posts--and this chimæra waiting with his deadly engine. To him, enter at last the cook, strolling down the sandhill from Equator Town, listless, vain and graceful; with no thought of alarm. As soon as he was well within range, the travestied monarch fired the six shots over his head, at his feet, and on either hand of him: the second Apemama warning, startling in itself, fatal in significance, for the next time his majesty will aim to hit. I am told the king is a crack shot; that when he aims to kill, the grave may be got ready; and when he aims misses by so near a margin that the culprit tastes six times the bitterness of death. The effect upon the cook I had an opportunity of seeing for myself. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> returning from the sea-side of the island, when we spied one coming to meet us at a very quick, disordered pace, between a walk and a run. As we drew nearer we saw it was the cook, beside himself with some emotion, his usual warm, mulatto colour declined into a bluish pallor. He passed us without word or gesture, staring on us with the face of a Satan, and plunged on across the wood for the unpeopled quarter of the island and the long, desert beach, where he might rage to and fro unseen, and froth out the vials of his wrath, fear, and humiliation. Doubtless in the curses that he there uttered to the bursting surf and the tropic birds, the name of the Kaupoi--the rich man--was frequently repeated. I had made him the laughing-stock of the village in the affair of the king's dumplings; I had brought him by my machinations into disgrace and the immediate jeopardy of his days; last, and perhaps bitterest, he had found me there by the way to spy upon him in the hour of his disorder.|$|E
60|$|I did not wonder, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{agreed to}} go with him that very evening to old Mr. Scott's house. The old gentleman {{received}} us very cordially in his little parlor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Croyden," [...] I answered, [...] "Edith--it means this. I {{have never}} {{found the courage}} to tell you. I am a married man. The woman seated there is <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> love you." ...|$|R
60|$|We both {{thank you}} greatly for the Edinburgh papers which you sent. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> join in affectionate remembrances and {{greetings}} to {{yourself and your}} aunt, and in the sincere tender of our sympathies.|$|R
