5|$|Despite these {{individual}} designations, the Mont Blanc massif {{as a whole}} is still regarded by conservationists as representing an important <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> in the wider network of protected areas of the western Alps.|$|E
5|$|Downloadable content (DLC) was {{initially}} {{not part of}} the development team's plans. The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> began development later in development, when the main game's visual theme had been finalized. Only the core developers were involved in creating The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link,</b> though development on the DLC did not take a high priority for some time as it would take resources away from the development of Human Revolution. Director Jean-François Dugas, producer David Anfossi, and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête all returned to their previous roles. The main designer was Antoine Thisdale. Main writer Mary DeMarle returned to write the scenario, alongside supplementary writer and author James Swallow. Additional music was composed for The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> by the game's composer Michael McCann. He wanted to include music from the DLC in the game's , but recording for the release was already complete, and scheduling conflicts prevented him from including any music in the soundtrack. Despite this, he still wished to release the DLC soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The DLC was {{included}} {{as part of}} Feral Interactive's port for OS X, released on April 26, 2012. The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> was subsequently included with other additional content in the director's cut edition of the base game, released on its original platforms and Wii U. The port's developers applied the technical and gameplay enhancements first developed for The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> to Human Revolution. The director's cut was released on October 25, 2013 for PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii U. An OS X port, again handled by Feral Interactive, was released on April 16, 2014.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> is a 1987 {{compilation}} album by The Monkees. While [...] "Apples, Peaches, Bananas And Pears" [...] and [...] "If You Have the Time" [...] both {{featured in}} the reruns of their 1960s television series, http://monkeestv.tripod.com/SaturdayAfternoon/CBS_71-72.html none of the tracks had ever been issued commercially. <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> is {{the first volume of}} a three-volume set (followed by <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 2 and <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 3).|$|R
50|$|First {{released}} on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> in 1988. The mix presented here is slightly different than on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links.</b> The opening and ending dialogues are removed, {{and the song}} fades out at the end, whereas the mix on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> does not fade. The moog also doesn't appear in this mix until after the interlude, whereas in the mix on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links,</b> the moog can be heard during all verses, and the interlude. The moog is also more restrained in this mix than in the mix on <b>Missing</b> <b>Links.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume Three is {{the third}} and final volume in a series of <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> {{compilations}} by The Monkees. Like the original (<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> and <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 2), the album is composed of unreleased material. The release marks the first time the television edit of the series' opening theme song was made available. Previous releases featured the album version, which is twice as long but lacks the television version's final verse.|$|R
5|$|This freeway {{has long}} been {{considered}} to be the <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> by the region's planners, who hope to better move regional traffic and provide a better option for vehicles to avoid metro Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to the relatively small size of the DLC environment, developers {{did not need to}} focus on a raised concern in the main game about repeating character faces and voices. An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced to Grip Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of the}} game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link,</b> it was entirely developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E
50|$|<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume Two is {{the second}} of three rarity albums by the Monkees (<b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 1 and <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> Volume 3). It was {{released}} in 1990. The album contains several tracks that had been featured in the television series but {{had never before been}} available commercially.|$|R
40|$|In most of {{the link}} {{prediction}} methods, all predicted <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> are ranked according to their scores. In the practical application of prediction results, starting from the first link that has {{the highest score in}} the ranking list, we verify each link one by one through experiments or other ways. Nevertheless, how to find an occurrence pattern of true <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> in the ranking list has seldomly reported. In present study, I proposed a mathematical model for relationship between cumulative number of predicted true <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> (y) and cumulative number of predicted <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> (x) : y=K(1 -e^(-rx/K)), where K is the expected total number of true <b>missing</b> <b>links,</b> and r is the intrinsic (maximum) occurrence probability of true <b>missing</b> <b>links.</b> It can be used to predict the changes of occurrence probability of true <b>missing</b> <b>links,</b> assess the effectiveness of a prediction method, and help find the mechanism of <b>link</b> <b>missing</b> in the network. The model was validated by six prediction methods using the data of tumor pathways. ...|$|R
40|$|In present study, I {{proposed}} a node degree dependent random perturbation algorithm for prediction of <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> in the network. In the algorithm, I {{assume that a}} node with more existing <b>links</b> harbors more <b>missing</b> <b>links.</b> There are two rules. Rule 1 means that a randomly chosen node tends to connect to the node with greater degree. Rule 2 means that a link tends to be created between two nodes with greater degrees. <b>Missing</b> <b>links</b> of some tumor related networks (pathways) are predicted. The results prove that the prediction efficiency and percentage of correctly predicted <b>links</b> against predicted <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> with the algorithm increases as the increase of network complexity. The required number for finding true <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> in the predicted list reduces as the increase of network complexity. Prediction efficiency is complexity-depedent only. Matlab codes of the algorithm are given also. Finally, prospect of prediction for <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> is briefly reviewed. So far all prediction methods based on static topological structure only (represented by adjacency matrix) seems to be low efficient. Network evolution based, node similarity based, and sampling based (correlation based) methods {{are expected to be}} the most promising in the future. ...|$|R
5|$|In 2008, Gerobatrachus hottoni, a temnospondyl {{with many}} frog- and salamander-like characteristics, was {{discovered}} in Texas. It dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a <b>missing</b> <b>link,</b> a stem batrachian close to the common ancestor of frogs and salamanders, consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that frogs and salamanders are {{more closely related to}} each other (forming a clade called Batrachia) than they are to caecilians. However, others have suggested that Gerobatrachus hottoni was only a dissorophoid temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Initially unplanned, The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> was {{developed}} by Human Revolutions core staff, including producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, writer Mary DeMarle, and composer Michael McCann. The story {{was designed as a}} standalone experience, partially due to the technical and aesthetic improvements the team had made. A boss battle was designed to allow for multiple solutions, in contrast to the limited action-based approaches of the main game's boss fights. Reception was generally positive: despite some mixed opinions on the story, praise was given to the improved visuals and gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Plans for DLC {{were first}} {{announced}} in August 2010, with it being planned {{as an extension}} of the game. The developers initially did not plan for DLC, with it beginning development later in the game's production when the visual theme was finalized. Despite using only core team members, development was slow due to the main focus being on Human Revolution. For The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link,</b> the team improved the lighting, gameplay mechanics, player freedom, and character animation. The DLC was developed entirely at Eidos Montréal, and this gave the team the opportunity of developing a boss fight with multiple solutions, something they regretted not being able to do with the main game.|$|E
50|$|On March 30, 1964, <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> {{moved to}} ABC {{to replace the}} {{cancelled}} The Object Is with Clark replacing McMahon as host. Its place on NBCs schedule was taken by Jeopardy!, which quickly grew in popularity. Shortly after this, CBS began counterprogramming <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> with reruns of The Jack Benny Program and the ratings for the game show slid even further. ABC cancelled <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> almost nine months later and the show {{came to an end}} on December 25, 1964.|$|R

5|$|Plans for a DLC {{were first}} {{announced}} in 2010 at that year's Gamescom event, {{where it was}} stated {{that it would be}} an extension to the main narrative. It was later teased by Eidos Montréal through cryptic clues on their website, eventually revealing the DLC one month after the main game's release. The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> was released on October 18, 2011 on Steam for Microsoft Windows personal computers(PC), Xbox Live for Xbox 360, and October 19 on PlayStation Network (PSN) for PlayStation 3. In Japan, the console versions of the DLC were released on March 7, 2012 for PSN and March 20 for Xbox Live.|$|E
5|$|Portions of SR 20 {{are built}} near the routing {{of what was}} first a wagon road and later a turnpike {{in the late nineteenth}} century. This road was {{extended}} through the state highway system all the way to Ukiah in the early twentieth century, and the <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> near Clear Lake was completed in 1932 before the official designation of this highway as SR 20 in 1934. There have been subsequent improvements to the road, such as the conversion of the Grass Valley portion of the route to freeway standards.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and strong voice acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot undermined by the villain and some poor dialogue. Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Writer and series creator Chris Carter {{decided that}} {{rather than trying to}} present a typical Bigfoot-like creature, he would present the Jersey Devil as a <b>missing</b> <b>link.</b> Carter was {{inspired}} to write the episode by an essay by E. O. Wilson regarding ants and a story he wrote that posed whether mankind was hellbent on its own extinction. The concept of mankind being carnivores and eating its own tail evolved into the idea of using an evolutionary mutation that was a throwback to the Neanderthal. A Greg Cannom werewolf outfit from a previous project was used for the costume of the creature.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E

5|$|In {{his review}} of the Director's Cut, IGN's Brian Albert, despite noting {{inconsistencies}} in enemy behavior, shared much of his praised with the original version {{in addition to the}} added gameplay mechanics and improved boss battles. GameSpot's VanOrd again noted dated facial animations and poor AI, but generally praised other aspects of the Director's Cut, particularly pointing out the improvements to boss battles. Bramwell, again writing for Eurogamer, particularly praised the revamped boss battles and the inclusion of additional content such as The <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> that did not function properly as a standalone release. He also echoed much of his praise for the original game. Michael Gapper of Official Nintendo Magazine stated that all the changes made to the game for the Director's Cut had improved it for the better, praising its gameplay balance and freedom of choice in addition to the new features.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} the Shooter again, who {{tells him that}} Gibson is a <b>missing</b> <b>link.</b> Mulder {{believes}} that Gibson has genes that are dormant in most humans. The Smoking Man dismisses the Well-Manicured Man's concerns about Mulder's actions. At the prison, the guard kills the Shooter. Diana Fowley, protecting Gibson in a hotel room, is shot shortly afterwards, and Gibson is captured by the Smoking Man's minions. Skinner tells Mulder of the Shooter's death, and that a flattened Morley cigarette box was found in his cell. Mulder confronts Spender, accusing him {{of working with the}} Smoking Man. The Smoking Man turns Gibson over to the Well-Manicured Man. Scully is informed by Skinner that the Justice Department is seeking to have the X-Files shut down. Mulder realizes that this was all part of a plan. The Smoking Man takes Samantha's X-File from Mulder's office, and lights the room on fire. As he leaves, he meets Jeffrey, and tells him that he's his father. By the time Mulder and Scully arrive, the X-Files are completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The French book, Le Buste de Nefertiti– une Imposture de l'Egyptologie? (The Bust of Nefertiti– a Fraud in Egyptology?) by Swiss art {{historian}} Henri Stierlin {{and the book}} <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> in Archaeology by Berlin author and historian Erdogan Ercivan both claimed that the Nefertiti bust was a modern fake. Stierlin claims that Borchardt may have created the bust to test ancient pigments and that when the bust was admired by Prince Johann Georg of Saxony, Borchardt pretended it was genuine to avoid offending the prince. Stierlin argues that the missing left eye of the bust {{would have been a}} sign of disrespect in ancient Egypt, that no scientific records of the bust appear until 11 years after its supposed discovery, and while the paint pigments are ancient, the inner limestone core has never been dated. Ercivan suggests Borchardt's wife was the model for the bust, and both authors argue that it was not revealed to the public until 1924 because it was a fake. Another theory suggested that the existing Nefertiti bust was crafted in the 1930s on Hitler's orders, and that the original was lost in World War II.|$|E
