5|$|In 1933, Lancashire County Council reorganised {{districts in}} the county, with {{reference}} to the Local Government Act 1929. A new Tyldesley Urban District was formed by amalgamating Tyldesley with Shakerley Urban District and the civil parish of Astley from the abolished Leigh Rural District. The urban district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, when the area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, a local government district of the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>county</b> of Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 {{parts of}} the Limehurst Rural District {{were added to the}} County Borough of Oldham, and in 1954 further {{parts of the}} same {{district}} added to it on its abolition. Since 1961, Oldham has been twinned with Kranj in Slovenia. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the town's autonomous county borough status was abolished, and Oldham has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, within the <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>county</b> of Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 the City and County Borough of Salford was {{abolished}} {{under the}} Local Government Act 1972, {{and was replaced}} by the metropolitan borough of City of Salford, a local government district of the new <b>metropolitan</b> <b>county</b> of Greater Manchester, with triple the territory of the former City of Salford, taking in neighbouring Eccles, Swinton and Pendlebury, and Worsley and Irlam. Both Salford and the wider City of Salford are unparished areas.|$|E

5000|$|Like other <b>{{metropolitan}}</b> <b>counties,</b> the West Midlands {{is divided}} into districts called metropolitan boroughs. There are seven boroughs in the West Midlands, which are named after the largest settlement in their administrative area. The West Midlands is unusual amongst the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>counties</b> in that three of its boroughs have city status; Coventry is a city by ancient prescriptive usage, Birmingham was granted city status in 1889, and Wolverhampton in 2000 as a [...] "Millennium City".|$|R

5|$|The West Midlands legally {{exists to}} this day as a {{metropolitan}} and ceremonial county, with countywide functions such as West Midlands Police, West Midlands Fire Service and the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (known as Centro). Most of the original metropolitan counties are now combined authorities, which are 'top tier' statutory bodies resembling the former <b>metropolitan</b> <b>county</b> councils. However 'Non-Metropolitan Authority' groupings are also becoming involved with the combined authority process.|$|E

Ashton-under-Lyne is divided into four wards: Ashton Hurst, Ashton St. Michaels, Ashton St Peters and Ashton Waterloo. As of the 2012 local elections, all twelve seats are held by Labour councillors.|$|E
5|$|By 1764, Didsbury was {{described}} as a township in its own right. It became a civil parish in 1866, and in 1876 was incorporated into the Withington Urban Sanitary District, superseded in 1894 by the creation of Withington Urban District. Withington Urban District was a subdivision of the administrative county of Lancashire, created as part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1894. In 1904, Withington Urban District was amalgamated into the city and county borough of Manchester, and so Didsbury was absorbed into Manchester, although it remained a civil parish until 1910. Following the Local Government Act 1972, Manchester became a metropolitan borough of the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>county</b> of Greater Manchester.|$|E

5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming <b>metropolitan</b> <b>county.</b> The highest priority was {{to increase the}} quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the Second World War {{there was a}} significant economic and population decline in Salford. In 1961 a small part of Eccles was added to the city. On 1 April 1974, the City and County Borough of Salford was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, and was replaced by the metropolitan borough of City of Salford, one of ten local government districts in the new <b>metropolitan</b> <b>county</b> of Greater Manchester. The city status of the new district was confirmed by additional letters patent issued on the same day. Since the early 1990s, the decline has slowed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>metropolitan</b> <b>county</b> of Greater Manchester is {{composed}} of 10 metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. Rochdale has no scheduled monuments; those in the other boroughs are listed separately. They range from prehistoric structures– the oldest of which date from the Bronze Age– to more modern structures such as the Astley Green Colliery, from 1908. Greater Manchester has seven prehistoric monuments (i.e. Bronze or Iron Age), found in Bury, Oldham, Salford, Stockport, and Tameside. The Bronze Age sites are mainly cairns and barrows, and both the Iron Age sites are military in nature, promontory forts.|$|E

50|$|Local {{government}} in England was re-organised in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972. The re-organisation created the six <b>metropolitan</b> <b>counties,</b> and the existing four English PTEs were named after, {{and made to}} match {{the borders of the}} new counties (for example West Midlands PTE was expanded to take on Coventry and Tyneside PTE expanded to include Sunderland becoming Tyne and Wear PTE in the process). In addition to this, two new PTEs were created for the newly established <b>metropolitan</b> <b>counties</b> of South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire.|$|R
25|$|The <b>metropolitan</b> <b>{{counties}}</b> are Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire. The counties {{typically have}} populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million.|$|R
5|$|The <b>{{metropolitan}}</b> <b>county</b> of Greater Manchester {{is made up}} of 10 metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. The Grade I {{buildings in}} each borough are listed separately. Manchester, the world's first industrialised city, has 15 of Greater Manchester's 45 Grade I listed buildings, the highest number of any borough. Oldham is the only borough to have no listed buildings with a Grade I rating. The River Irwell forms the boundary between Manchester and Salford, so one listed structure, the railway bridge over the Irwell, has been listed under both Manchester and Salford.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton was {{the second}} most populous urban {{district}} in the United Kingdom by the 1930s, and the district council took initial steps to obtain municipal borough status, {{but this was not}} achieved. In 1926 and 1931, two Oldham Extension Bills for the County Borough of Oldham to amalgamate with Chadderton Urban District were rejected by the House of Lords, following objections from neighbouring councils. A twinning arrangement was made in 1966 by Chadderton Urban District Council with Geesthacht, West Germany. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Chadderton Urban District was abolished, and Chadderton has, since 1April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, a local government district of the <b>metropolitan</b> <b>county</b> of Greater Manchester. Chadderton has three of the twenty wards of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham: Chadderton North, Chadderton Central and Chadderton South., with some small perhipheral areas lying in the neighbouring wards of Royton North, Coldhurst, Hollinwood, Werneth and Failsworth East.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester is a {{ceremonial}} county {{with its own}} Lord-Lieutenant who is the personal representative of the monarch. The Local Government Act 1972 provided that {{the whole of the}} area to be covered by the new <b>metropolitan</b> <b>county</b> of Greater Manchester would also be included in the Duchy of Lancaster– extending the duchy to include areas which were formerly in the counties of Cheshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Until 31 March 2005, Greater Manchester's Keeper of the Rolls was appointed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; they are now appointed by the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. The first Lord Lieutenant of Greater Manchester was Sir William Downward who held the title from 1974 to 1988. The current Lord Lieutenant is Warren James Smith. As a geographic county, Greater Manchester is used by the government (via the Office for National Statistics) for the gathering of county-wide statistics, and organising and collating general register and census material.|$|E
