In this work, a study of the effect of both gate and cavity geometries on gate solidification time was conducted, using a commercial polymer, injection molded with constant holding pressure into a rectangular cavity. Three cavity lengths were used, and for each, two cavity thicknesses were adopted. Spe- cial dies containing different gates were assembled in the <b>mold.</b> <b>Gate</b> thickness was found {{to be the most important}} factor determining gate sealing time. However, the cavity geometry is also quite important. A clear indication on gate solidification could be drawn by analyzing time evolution of pressure distribution inside the mold. The solidification phenomenon leading to gate sealing was analyzed by a sim- ple model, which also takes into account the effect of cavity geometry, by compar- ing the heat flow through the gate walls and the energy required to solidify the packing flow rate. Model results satisfactorily describe the main features of the ex- perimental data...|$|E

The mold with two cavities, differing in thickness (1 and 3 mm), and a cold direct runner was used. Isotactic polypropylene homopolymer was utilized to produce parts. Mold temperature was set at 22 °C and controlled by a water chiller. Five measuring points were determined: SP 1, SP 2 (placed in the 3 mm cavity), SP 3, SP 4 (located in the 1 mm cavity) and SP 5 around an injection <b>molding</b> <b>gate.</b> Our investigations showed that the highest temperature is localized around SP 2 point and the lowest at SP 4.

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{mechanical}} performance of injection-molded starch-based copolymers, 60 / 40 (mol/mol) starch/poly(ethylene vinyl alcohol), {{and the possibility}} of improving material properties through deliberately induced anisotropy during processing. Different types of samples were produced by conventional and shear-controlled injection molding (Scorim) and tested under tensile and impact loading. The behavior of three distinct grades is discussed in terms of the respective fracture morphology (evaluated by scanning electron microscopy). A comparison is made between the behavior of conventional and Scorim samples. The results show that the mechanical properties of the materials used were significantly improved by the employment of the Scorim process. The stiffness values of the conventional moldings were doubled, without reducing the ductility of the polymer. The impact data showed a material sensitivity, and consequent loss of properties, to the localized shear imposed to the melt during processing. This situation is attributed to very narrow <b>mold</b> <b>gates</b> (in the case of pingated systems) and leads to much reduced impact performance...|$|R

In an open system, emergence and an error cannot be specified distinctly, because they are dependent on the dis-equilibration process between local and global behaviors.

A Physarum (slime <b>mold)</b> Boolean <b>gate</b> could be an internally instable machine, while {{it has the potential}} for emergent computing. First, we examined whether Physarum Boolean gate works properly, and then examined its behaviors when the gate is collapsed in terms of hardware.

40|$|Semisolid metal {{processing}} of metallic alloys {{takes advantage of}} the thixotropic behavior of material with non-dendritic microstructure to produce near-net-shape components with improved mechanical properties. The much higher apparent viscosity of the semisolid billet limits the risk of oxide formed on the free surfaces to become incorporated into the easting during the process. But, the external-skin {{on the periphery of the}} billet, which is often partially solidified and contaminated with lubricants, should not be included into the casting as this can be a cause of reject for most structural parts. In this paper, a preliminary model is set-up using the LS-DYNA SPH formulation to follow the paths of the skin. Calculations carried out show that this approach appears to be very promising to predict the paths of contaminated skins into semisolid castings.

40|$|The {{flow pattern}} in the uphill teeming process {{has been found to}} be closely related to the quality of ingots and further to affect the yield of ingot production, which is crucial for the steel making process. The {{formation}} of non-metallic inclusion and entrapment of mold flux has been considered to be affected by the flow {{pattern in the}} <b>gating</b> system and <b>molds</b> by many previous researchers. The aim of this study is to investigate the flow pattern of steel in the <b>gating</b> system and <b>molds</b> during the initial filling stage. In addition, to study the utilization of swirl blade implemented at the bottom of the vertical runner on the improvement of initial filling condition in the mold. A three dimensional model of two <b>molds</b> <b>gating</b> system for 6. 2 ton ingots from Scana Steel was adopted in the present work. A reduced geometry model including one mold and a runner, based on the method from previous researchers, was also used for comparison with the current more extensive model. Moreover, a reduced geometry model including one swirl blade and a runner was simulated to find effects of an increased-length vertical runner on the flow pattern improvement at the vertical runner outlet. Flow pattern, hump height and wall shear stress were respectively studied. A reduced geometry with homogenous inlet conditions fails to describe the fluctuating conditions present as the steel enters the mold. However, the trends are very similar when comparing the (hump height-surface height) evolution over time. The implementation of swirl blades gives a chaotic initial filling condition with a considerable amount of droplets being created when steel enters the molds during the first couple of seconds. However, a more calm filling condition with less fluctuation is achieved at the molds after a short while. Moreover, the orientation of the swirl blades affects he flow pattern of the steel. A proper placement of a swirl blade improves the initial filling conditions. The utilization of swirl blades might initially result in larger hump height. However, it gives fewer fluctuations as the casting proceeds. In the model without swirl blades, the maximum wall shear stress fluctuates with a descending trend as the filling proceeds. An implementation of swirl blades can decrease and stabilize the wall shear stress in the gating system. A special attention should be made in choosing refractory at the center stone, the horizontal runner near center stone and the vertical runner at the elbow. This is where the wall shear stress values are highest or where the exposure times are long. QC 2012020...|$|R

40|$|Design {{revisions}} {{are expensive}} and time consuming. Yet, these are inevitable because product designers have limited knowledge about casting processes {{and have no}} means to evaluate the influence of design features on castability (costs, quality and productivity). Problems appear much later, at the tooling or manufacturing stage, when {{it is much more}} expensive to incorporate changes than at the design stage. Progressive engineering companies therefore rely on design review committees, which include tooling and casting engineers, to suggest early modifications to a product design for ease of manufacture.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a two-year}} project, DE-FC 07 - 011 D 13983 that concerns the gating of aluminum castings in permanent molds. The main {{goal of the}} project {{is to improve the}} quality of aluminum castings produced in permanent molds. The approach taken was to determine how the vertical type gating systems used for permanent mold castings can be designed to fill the mold cavity with a minimum of damage to the quality of the resulting casting. It is evident that somewhat different systems are preferred for different shapes and sizes of aluminum castings. The main problems caused by improper gating are entrained aluminum oxide films and entrapped gas. The project highlights the characteristic features of gating systems used in permanent mold aluminum foundries and recommends gating procedures designed to avoid common defects. The study also provides direct evidence on the filling pattern and heat flow behavior in permanent mold castings. Equipment and procedure for real time X-Ray radiography of molten aluminum flow into permanent molds have been developed. Other studies have been conducted using water flow and behavior of liquid aluminum in sand mold using real time photography. This investigation utilizes graphite molds transparent to X-Rays making it possible to observe the flow pattern through a number of vertically oriented grating systems. These have included systems that are choked at the base of a rounded vertical sprue and vertical gating systems with a variety of different ingates into the bottom of a mold cavity. These systems have also been changed to include gating systems with vertical and horizontal gate configurations. Several conclusions can be derived from this study. A sprue-well, as designed in these experiments, does not eliminate the vena contracta. Because of the swirling at the sprue-base, the circulating metal begins to push the entering metal stream toward the open runner mitigating the intended effect of the sprue-well. Improved designs of sprue-wells should be evaluated. In order for a runner extension to operate efficiently, it must have a small squared cross-section. If it is tapered, the first metal to enter the first metal to enter the system is not effectively trapped. If the cross section is large, there is less turbulence when the aluminum enters the mold cavity in comparison to the smaller cross sectioned, squared runner. However, a large runner reduces yield. In bottom-feeding gating systems, a filter can significantly improve the filling of the casting. The filter helps to slow the metal flow rate enough to reduce jetting into the mold cavity. In top feeding gating systems, a filter can initially slow the metal flow rate, but because the metal drops after passing the filter, high velocities are achieved during free fall when a filter is in place. Side feeding gating systems provide less turbulent flow into the mold cavity. The flow is comparable to a bottom-feeding gating system with a filter. Using properly designed side-gating system instead of a bottom-feeding system with a filter can potentially save the cost of the filter. Rough coatings promote better fill than smooth coatings. This conclusion seems at first counter intuitive. One tends to assume a rough coating creates more friction resistance to the flow of molten metal. In actuality the molten aluminum stream flows inside an oxide film envelope. When this film rests on top of the ridges of a rough coating the microscopic air pockets between the coating and the oxide film provide more thermal insulation than in a smooth coating. This insulation promotes longer feeding distances in the mold as demonstrated in the experiments. Much of this work is applicable to vertically parted sand molds as well, although the heat transfer conditions do vary from a metal mold generally used in permanent molding of aluminum. The flow measurements were conducted using graphite molds and real time X-Ray radiography recorded at a rate of 30 images per second through those molds. The facilities at Arrow Aluminum Foundry were used in the study. The results will be employed to demonstrate to the American Foundry Industry how molten aluminum flows in permanent molds of different designs and characteristics. The results of these experiments were compared with computer mold and simulation models. The Procast and Magmasoft flow and solidification simulation programs were employed to predict the flow behavior under the different conditions that can prevail in permanent <b>mold</b> <b>gating.</b> The development of a valid computer model that can correctly and accurately predict this flow is much more intricate than generally realized. To provide accurate predictions such programs require significant adjustments and verification with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Several design methodologies for {{automatically}} designing {{injection molds}} {{were developed to}} reduce warpage of injection molded parts. The part warpage was defined from warpage simulation, so as to represent various deformation behavior of the molded part. A concept for deliberately varying part wall thicknesses, within feasible dimensional tolerances to reduce the warpage, was introduced. The wall thicknesses, that minimized the effect of process fluctuation inherent to molding process, were obtained using the Taguchi method. The results of the example indicated that one can considerably reduce the warpage, and may also reduce material costs, by varying the wall thicknesses. A modified complex method was developed to optimize various domains in injection mold design. The modified complex method significantly reduced the part warpage with a moderate number of independent analysis evaluations for the proposed optimization of: part wall thicknesses; location and sizes of cooling channels; and process conditions. The runner system of multiple cavity molds was successfully balanced by adjusting the sizes of runners and gates using the iterative redesign method integrated with packing simulation in two case studies. A design technique for automatically determining the 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 gate location(s) of injection molds was presented {{in association with the}} three important parameters in gating design [...] the part warpage, the weld and meld line location at the critical areas, and the Izod impact strength at a specific region of the part. The difficulty in predicting accurate values of engineering property like Izod impact strength is that they vary throughout a part with respect to the thermomechanical history. Upon evaluating each gating design, the trained neural network computation predicts, regardless of part geometry, Izod impact strength by a non-parameteric modeling of the complex relation with thermomechanical processing histories. As the results, when the polymer resin and the part geometry were predetermined, the part warpage could be considerably reduced by the developed design tools for the part wall thicknesses, the <b>mold</b> systems including <b>gating,</b> runner, and cooling system, as well as the process conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Injection molding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and most {{important}} methods of processing thermoplastic polymers. Analysis of injection molding is difficult because of the non-Newtonian flow of the polymer melt. This non-Newtonian flow also influences the physical properties of the solidified part. An optical access mold was designed and built to allow viewing of the melt during the molding of a rectangular plaque. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the midplane velocity field of STYRON 615 APR during <b>mold</b> filling. The <b>gate</b> pressure, flow front shapes and front propagation velocities were also measured. These measurements were compared to Moldflow simulations. Moldflow was found to be accurate for the bulk of the flow, with an average vector orientation error of 1. 7 degrees. The ratio of cavity-averaged PIV velocity magnitudes to Moldflow average magnitudes had a mean of 0. 998 and a standard deviation of 0. 25. This deviation was due to problem areas near the cavity walls and the flow front. Moldflow also had difficulty predicting realistic flow front shapes. A power-law model of the flow was developed and was used to predict the gate pressure. The model and the measured gate pressure were used to estimate the power-law parameters of the melt. The power-law exponent was found to be 0. 4063, within 0. 4 % of the value measured by capillary rheometer. The power-law coefficient was found to be 2659 Pa-s^n, within 9. 5 % of the measured value. Velocity fields during packing were also measured. The random component of the flow was initially 10 - 20 % and grew to 60 - 80 % after 2. 5 seconds of packing. The random component increased as the packing pressure was decreased. The mass flow during packing was modeled analytically as a combination of compressibility and solidification effects. Two limiting cases of the model bracketed the experimental data within 20 %.
