Root explants were cultured on induction medium, supplemented with 4. 44 mu M 6 -benzyladenine. Roots {{at different stages of}} development were collected and processed for observation by light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Patterns of direct and indirect regeneration were observed in the explants. During direct organogenesis, the organogenic buds and nodules, formed from <b>meristemoids,</b> originated from the pericycle regions distant from the cut surface. Completely differentiated buds were observed after 20 days of culture. During indirect organogenesis, bud formation occurred via <b>meristemoids</b> at the periphery of the calli, which differentiated from the cortical region of the initial explant. Regardless of the regeneration pattern, the <b>meristemoids</b> had similar ultrastructural characteristics; however, differences were reported in the nuclear shape of the cells of the <b>meristemoids</b> formed directly and indirectly.

40|$|Since {{in tobacco}} thin layers {{exogenous}} putrescine alters the physiological and morphogenic responses induced by IAA (indole- 3 -acetic acid) and/or BA (benzyladenine), {{the effect of}} this polyamine on protease activity and on the formation of <b>meristemoids</b> and vegetative primordia was studied during morphogenesis. Superficial thin layer explants, excised from the stem of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Samsun) plants in the vegetative stage, were cultured under various hormonal conditions (IAA, IAA+BA, BA) and in a hormone-free medium, in {{the presence or absence of}} 100 mu M putrescine. Histological analysis showed that no <b>meristemoids</b> were formed on the control medium or with putrescine alone and only a few were formed on IAA-treated explants with or without putrescine. An increasing number of <b>meristemoids</b> was observed in IAA+BA and BA treatments during culture; in both cases this number was enhanced by the presence of exogenous putrescine. Protease activity was evaluated spectrophotometrically using two synthetic substrates, azocasein and N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA). In the former, maximum protease activity was observed in IAA+BA- and BA-treated explants on days 10 and 15, respectively, while with IAA activity was lowest, the maximum occurring on days 5 - 10. In this case exogenous putrescine enhanced protease activity in the presence of IAA alone or with BA, while it decreased it in the presence of BA. BAPNA-mediated proteolytic activity (serine-proteases) was highest in IAA+BA-treated explants, intermediate in BA- and not different from controls in IAA-treated explants. Putrescine only affected proteolytic activity in IAA+BA treatments. The use of specific inhibitors of protease activities indicated that these enzymes belong to two main classes of proteases, that is serine- and thiol-proteases. The pattern of proteolytic activities during culture appeared to be related to the differentiation of <b>meristemoids</b> into vegetative primordia. The effect of exogenous putrescine on protease activity was different depending on different synthetic substrates, developmental patterns, pH and ionic strength...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{ethylene}} in vegetative bud regeneration was {{studied in}} cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Samsun) thin-layer explants. The experimental approach consisted in supplementing the bud-inducing medium with an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), an ethylene antagonist, silver thiosulphate (STS), or an ethylene-releasing compound, 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid (CEPA), at various concentrations. The organogenic response was assessed both macroscopically (percentage of bud-forming explants, final number of buds per explant) and cytohistologically (number, characteristics, and localisation of meristemoids and bud primordia). The time course of ethylene production during culture was also evaluated. At {{the end of}} culture (day 27) all the explants treated with these compounds had a lower number of buds compared to controls. STS was detrimental to <b>meristemoid</b> initiation at all the concentrations tested. In contrast, 0. 5 mu M AVG, which strongly inhibited ethylene production, provoked a large increase {{in the formation of}} meristemoids early in culture and the appearance of anomalous ("twin") buds. CEPA reduced <b>meristemoid</b> formation but, at the lower concentrations (1 and 10 mu M) speeded up bud emergence. On the whole it mainly favoured disorganised growth and xylogenesis. The results of this work highlight the contrasting effects of ethylene in relation to the two critical stages of the organogenic process, i. e., <b>meristemoid</b> formation and bud primordium development...|$|E
40|$|Different {{concentrations}} of 6 -benzyladenine (6 -BA) {{were used in}} vitro to induce buds in three types of explants: leaf discs, root segments and the seedling itself obtained from in vitro seed germination of Passiflora cincinnata Mast.

Microcuttings from shoots raised in Murashige and Skoog's (1962) medium were transferred into a rooting medium containing IBA in the dark, then fixed 0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days after. Some cambial zone and adjacent phloem cells became dense cytoplasm, nuclei with prominent nucleoli {{and the first}} cell divisions were observed at day 3. <b>Meristemoids</b> became individualized, consisting of densely staining cells (with enlarged nucleoli) formed outside the xylem by day 5.

40|$|Control {{of organ}} size by cell {{proliferation}} and growth {{is a fundamental}} process, but the mechanisms that determine the final size of organs are largely elusive in plants. We have previously revealed that the ubiquitin receptor DA 1 regulates organ size by repressing cell proliferation in Arabidopsis. Here we report that a mutant allele of STERILE APETALA (SAP) suppresses the da 1 - 1 mutant phenotype. We show that SAP is an F-box protein that forms part of a SKP 1 /Cullin/F-box E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex and controls organ size by promoting the proliferation of <b>meristemoid</b> cells. Genetic analyses suggest that SAP may act in the same pathway with PEAPOD 1 and PEAPOD 2, which are negative regulators of <b>meristemoid</b> proliferation, to control organ size, but does so independently of DA 1.

40|$|Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key {{regulators}} of {{the cell}} cycle. In yeasts, only one CDK is sufficient to drive cells through the cell cycle, whereas higher eukaryotes developed a family of related CDKs.

We show that the CDKB 1; 1 gene of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is highly expressed in guard cells and stomatal precursor cells of cotyledons, suggesting a prominent role for B-type CDKs in stomatal development. In accordance, transgenic Arabidopsis plants with reduced B-type CDK activity had a decreased stomatal index because of an early block of <b>meristemoid</b> division and inhibition of satellite <b>meristemoid</b> formation.

40|$|Stomata are {{microscopic}} pores on {{the plant}} epidermis that act as a major passage for the gas and water vapor exchange between a plant and the atmosphere. A pair of specialized guard cells work in concert to adjust pore size to maintain gas exchange while minimizing the water loss. The formation of stomata requires a series of cell-fate transitions from an initial <b>meristemoid</b> mother cell (MMC), to a stem-cell-like precursor <b>meristemoid,</b> to a guard mother cell (GMC), and finally to terminally-differentiated guard cells. Three closely-related Arabidopsis basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes SPEECHLESS (SPCH), MUTE, and FAMA act sequentially at each key step to direct cell-fate transitions during stomatal development. In this addendum, we propose that a three-step relay of the three bHLHs establishes the molecular framework for stomatal differentiation.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effect of medium-pH on rooting using 1 -mm slices cut from stems of apple microshoots. Before autoclaving, the pH of the rooting medium was set at various pH values between 4. 5 and 8. 0. During autoclaving, the pH drifted in particular in the alkaline region. Additional changes occurred during culture and the range set at 4. 5 - 8. 0 had shifted to 5. 2 - 6. 0 after autoclaving and 3 weeks of culture. When 10 mM 2 -(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) had been added as buffering agent, the pH was stable when set at 5. 0 - 6. 5. Highest rooting was achieved at pH similar to 5. 3 with and without MES (pH measured after autoclaving). This maximum did not correlate with highest auxin uptake. MES inhibited adventitious root formation during the initial phase of root formation when the <b>meristemoids</b> are being formed (ca. 30 % reduction at 10 mM) but was promotive during outgrowth of the <b>meristemoids</b> to roots (30 % increase at 10 mM).

Enhanced proliferative growth was confirmed by northern analysis and in situ hybridisation using cDNA probes of the G 1 /S phase-specific genes ubiquitin carboxyl-extension protein (ubi-CEP), topoisomerase 1 (top 1) and ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). The formation of meristematic cell clusters on day 5 was also enhanced by 1 muM MJ, but subsequent development of these cell clusters into <b>meristemoids</b> and shoot primordia was reduced by all MJ concentrations in a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|Regulation of {{the number}} of cells is {{critical}} for development of multicellular organisms. During plant epidermal development, a protodermal cell fi rst makes a fate decision of whether or not to be the <b>meristemoid</b> mother cell (MMC), which undergoes asymmetric cell division forming a <b>meristemoid</b> and its sister cell. The MMC-derived lineage produces all stomatal guard cells and a large proportion of non-guard cells. We demonstrate that a small secretory peptide, EPIDERMAL PATTERING FACTOR 2 (EPF 2), is produced by the MMC and its early descendants, and negatively regulates the density of guard and non-guard epidermal cells. Our results suggest that EPF 2 inhibits cells from adopting the MMC fate in a non-cell-autonomous manner, thus limiting the number of MMCs. This feedback loop is critical for regulation of epidermal cell density. The amino acid sequence of EPF 2 resembles that of EPF 1, which is known to control stomatal positioning. Over-expression of EPF 1 also inhibits stomatal development, but EPF 1 can act only on a later developmental process than EPF 2. Overexpression and promoter swapping experiments suggested that the protein functions of EPF 1 and EPF 2, rather than the expression patterns of the genes, are responsible for the specifi c functions.

SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) genes are involved in embryogenesis and organogenesis in numerous species. In vitro culture of Cyclamen persicum immature ovules provides a system for investigating stem cell formation and maintenance, because lines forming either organs or embryos or callus without organs/embryos are available for the same cultivar and plant growth regulator conditions. The present aim was to exploit this property of cyclamen cultures to understand the role of SERK(s) in stem cell formation and maintenance in somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis in vitro, in comparison with expression in planta. CpSERK 1 and CpSERK 2 were isolated from embryogenic callus. CpSERK 1 and CpSERK 2 levels by RT-PCR showed that expression is high in embryogenic, moderate in organogenic, and null in recalcitrant calli. in situ hybridizations showed that the expression of both genes started in clumps of pluripotent stem cells, from which both pre-embryogenic aggregates and organ <b>meristemoids</b> derived, and continued in their trans-amplifying, meristem-like, derivatives. Expression declined in organ <b>meristemoids,</b> in parallel with a partial loss of meristematization. In mature somatic embryos, and in shoot and root primordia, CpSERK 1 and CpSERK 2 were expressed in meristems, and similar patterns occurred in zygotic embryo and primary meristems in planta. The results point to SERK 1 and SERK 2 as markers of pluripotency in cyclamen.

Taken together, these results show that an interplay between jasmonates and auxins regulates AR formation and xylogenesis in tobacco TCLs...|$|E
40|$|Epidermal {{differentiation}} in Arabidopsis thaliana aerial organs involves stomatal lineage development. Lineages {{derive from}} meristemoids, which arise from asymmetric divisions of protodermal cells. Each <b>meristemoid</b> divides repeatedly in an inward spiral before it transits to a guard mother cell (GMC) {{that produces the}} stoma, {{leaving a trail of}} surrounding stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) that eventually differentiate into endoreplicated pavement cells. MUTE is a bHLH transcription factor that is expressed in late meristemoids and drives their transition to GMCs. Loss-of-function mute mutants are stomata-less dwarf plants with arrested lineages, in which stunted putative SLGCs surround a halted <b>meristemoid.</b> We analysed MUTE functions using a chemically inducible system for mute- 3 complementation based on conditional MUTE expression in its normal domain. Continuous induction from germination produced stomata-bearing, normal-sized plants with viable mute- 3 seeds. In 2 -week-old mute- 3 cotyledons, meristemoids appeared to retain their identity and synchronously formed stomata in response to induced MUTE expression. However, arrested SLGCs were not complemented: many produced stomata, leading to stomatal clusters, and others remained unexpanded and diploid. In contrast, non-lineage pavement cells, which are under-endoreplicated in mute- 3, expanded and increased their ploidy level upon induction, showing that the lack of response of SLGCs is specific to this arrested cell type. Leaf phenotypic mosaics include wild-type lineages and adjacent mute- 3 lineages, whose meristemoids and putative SLGCs remained arrested, indicating that the role of MUTE in SLGC fate is strictly lineage-autonomous. These results show that timely MUTE expression is essential to prevent stomatal fate in SLGCs and to promote their differentiation as pavement cells. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

40|$|Plants, {{which are}} sessile unlike most animals, have evolved {{a system to}} reduce growth under stress; however, the molecu-lar {{mechanisms}} of this stress response are not well known. During programmed development, {{a fraction of the}} leaf epi-dermal precursor cells become <b>meristemoid</b> mother cells (MMCs), which are stem cells that produce both stomatal guard cells and epidermal pavement cells. Here we report that Arabidopsis plants, in response to osmotic stress, post-transcriptionally decrease the protein level of SPEECHLESS, the transcription factor promoting MMC identity, through the action of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The growth reduction under osmotic stress was lessened by inhibition of the MAPK cascade or by a mutation that disrupted the MAPK target amino acids in SPEECHLESS, indicating that Arabidopsis reduces growth under stress by integrating the osmotic stress signal into the MAPK– SPEECHLESS core developmental pathway...|$|E
40|$|Various {{juvenile}} explants from conifers have been, used to form shoot buds in vitro. The best explant must {{be selected}} empirically {{and the number}} of shoots formed varies with the explant. A comparative morpho-histological examination was made of the sites of shoot initiation arising from embryonic explants of Pinus contorta Loud, and Pinus rigida Mill., cotyledon explants of Pinus radiata. D. Don and P. contorta, and epicotyl explants of Picea glauca Voss, Picea mariana B. S. P., and Picea engelmanni Parry. The study revealed that despite the different sites and timing of initiation of shoot forma-tion, the patterns of shoot development were similar. In all species the formation of meristematic centres or <b>meristemoids</b> led to bud primordia and finally adven-titious shoots with apical domes and needle primordia. This developmental sequence occurred in the absence of concomitant callus formation on the cytokinin-containing medium...|$|R
40|$|Regenerants of Canna (Canna × hybrida hort.) cvs. Suevia, Dar Vostoka and Livadia {{have been}} obtained. Dependence of {{viability}} and regenerative capacity of Canna microshoots on genotype has been found. The optimal concentrations of growth regulators that influence on morphogenesis in vitro have been determined. At the micropropagation stage of different cultivars of Canna it needs {{the addition of}} 1. 24 – 1. 91 mg/l thidiazuron to culture medium. The active rooting of Canna microshoots cvs. Dar Vostoka and Suevia on the culture medium Murashige & Skoog and Pierik with auxins β-indol- 3 - acetic acid and α-naphthylacetic acid have been observed. The ability of Canna cv. Suevia microshoots to spontaneous root formation has been shown.

40|$|Callus tissue was induced on root tips of {{in vitro}} cultured {{seedlings}} of Allium commutatum Guss. on MS medium supplemented with 3 % sucrose, 0. 8 % agar, 4. 5 μM 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and 4. 6 μM kinetin. Pieces of developed calli {{were transferred to}} MS medium with different concentrations of 2, 4 -D (0. 02, 0. 05 and 0. 1 μM) and kinetin (0. 02, 0. 1 and 0. 5 μM) or without them. After five weeks of cultivation, callus proliferation and differentiation as well as adventitious shoot and root regeneration were analysed. The best callus proliferation and adventitious root induction were achieved on MS medium containing 0. 1 and 0. 5 μM kinetin; addition of 2, 4 -D had no significant influence. Higher concentrations of kinetin also favoured higher incidence of <b>meristemoids.</b> Adventitious shoot development was noticed only on three media tested...|$|R
