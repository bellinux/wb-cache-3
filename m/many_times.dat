5|$|Applications {{are often}} {{classified}} {{according to how}} often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate <b>many</b> <b>times</b> per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism {{if they do not}} communicate <b>many</b> <b>times</b> per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E

5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how <b>many</b> <b>times</b> that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; no matter how <b>many</b> <b>times</b> it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; {{it is one of the}} axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E

40|$|The {{implication}} of the <b>many</b> <b>time</b> formalism for the process Φ → K^ 0 + K̅^ 0 was discussed in a recent letter of B. Kayser and L.

Based on previous work (also using the <b>many</b> proper <b>times</b> formalism), we predicted a much larger correction ∼ 2. This correction factor is important in that it allows for a crucial future DA Φ NE experimental test of the <b>many</b> proper <b>times</b> amplitude formalism. Comment: Tex file, 4 page...|$|R
