With such a load, and without <b>mitigating</b> <b>control,</b> the MMC suffers from cell capacitor voltage imbalance between the converter arms which leads to distortion (fluctuation) of the absorbed AC power. This paper proposes an augmented modulation strategy, with a tailored distribution of the modulation signals between the arms within a phase, to ensure low AC power fluctuation.

40|$|Abstract — As wind {{turbines}} become {{larger and more}} flexible, {{the potential benefits of}} load <b>mitigating</b> <b>control</b> systems become more important to reduce fatigue and extend component life. In the last five years, there has been significant research activity exploring the effectiveness of preview control techniques that may be feasible using advanced wind measurement technologies like LIDAR (light detection and ranging). However, most control development tools use Taylor’s frozen turbulence hypothesis. The end result is that preview measurements made up-stream from the rotor can be obtained with unrealistic accuracy, because the same wind velocities eventually arrive at the turbine. In this study, we extend the spectral methods commonly used to generate turbulent wind fields for controls simulation, but in a way that emulates wind evolution. This changes preview measurements made upwind from the rotor, {{in such a way that}} the differences – between the preview measurements and speeds arriving at the turbine – increase with distance from the rotor. We then evaluate the degradation in load mitigation performance of a controller that uses preview measurements obtained at various distances in front of the rotor. I...|$|E
40|$|Sleep-wake {{protocols}} {{are critical}} in sensor networks to ensure long-lived operation. However, an open problem {{is how to}} develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both longlived operation and {{a high degree of}} security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and <b>mitigating</b> <b>control</b> and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic {{going in and out of}} its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic. We prove analytically that the security coverage is not weakened by the protocol. We perform simulations in ns- 2 to demonstrate that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged while listening energy saving of 30 to 129 times is achieved, depending on the network load...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{obstacles}} to building a quantum computer is gate error, where the physical evolution {{of the state of}} a qubit or group of qubits during a gate operation does not match the intended unitary transformation. Gate error stems from a combination of control errors and random single qubit errors from interaction with the environment. While great strides have been made in <b>mitigating</b> <b>control</b> errors, intrinsic qubit error remains a serious problem that sets the primary limit for gate fidelity in modern superconducting qubit architectures. Simultaneously, recent developments of small error-corrected logical qubit devices promise significant increases in logical state lifetime, but translating those improvements into increases in gate fidelity is a complex challenge. In this Letter, we propose a new formalism for implementing gates on and between small logical qubit devices which inherit the parent device's tolerance to single qubit errors which occur at any time before or during the gate. Using a standard phenomenological noise model for superconducting qubits, we demonstrate a universal one- and two-qubit gate set with error rates an order of magnitude lower than those for equivalent operations on single qubits or pairs of qubits, running for the same total duration. The effective logical gate error rate in these models displays superlinear error reduction with linear increases in single qubit lifetime, proving that passive error correction is capable of increasing gate fidelity. These developments further suggest that incorporating small logical qubits into a measurement based code could substantially improve code performance.
