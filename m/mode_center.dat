40|$|A {{systematic}} {{analysis of the}} problem of frequency shifts in piezoelectric resonators due to various effects is performed and reported in this dissertation based on the theory for small fields superposed on finite biasing fields in an electroelastic body. ^ This research includes the study of nonlinear effect of large accelerations on resonators that are mounted on moving objects and are under finite biasing fields. A second-order perturbation procedure is developed to estimate the frequency shifts. The effect of biasing fields on degenerate resonant frequencies is studied by a perturbation procedure. It is found that the degenerate frequency may split into different frequencies due to biasing fields. Stress induced frequency shifts in resonators made from langasite (La 3 Ga 5 SiO 14 or LGS), a new piezoelectric crystal promising for future resonator applications, are calculated and zero stress sensitivity orientations of the crystal are determined. The results have important applications in high accuracy resonator design. The frequency shifts due to intrinsic film stresses in asymmetric electrodes deposited on resonators are calculated. The result shows that frequency shifts are partially due to the <b>mode</b> <b>center</b> (nodal plane) shift in resonators with unequal thickness electrodes. The effects of a small curvature of the middle surface of a thickness-shear mode crystal resonator on its vibration frequencies, modes, and acceleration sensitivity are studied. The results have important applications in design of plano-convex resonators. Third-order nonlinear elastic constants are essential in calculating the frequency shifts of resonators. The PMN-PT electrostrictive ceramics, a new materials used for electromechanical transducers with the composition of (1 −x) [Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3]-(x) [PbTiO 3], are examined experimentally by studying the propagation of small amplitude ultrasonic waves in specimens under biasing stresses and their third-order elastic constants are determined. ^ In addition, a set of two-dimensional nonlinear equations for electroelastic plates in large amplitude thickness-shear vibrations are developed and are employed in the calculation of frequency-electric current amplitude behavior near nonlinear resonance of piezoelectric resonators. General expressions for the second-order frequency shifts and degenerate frequency shifts in an electroelastic body are obtained and the explicit forms of effective material constants at different orders are given. ^ The research results provide valuable information on minimizing the frequency shifts in crystal resonators due to environmental effects such as acceleration, temperature, stress or other biasing fields. They can also be used on various types of sensor and transducer designs, in which case it is desirable to maximize the frequency shifts. ...|$|E

40|$|The trapped-ion quantum {{computer}} is an atom-based {{implementation of a}} {{quantum computer}} that has successfully demonstrated numerous quantum algorithms {{and the potential for}} scalability. Fundamental to its operation is the short-range Coulombic interaction among its atomic ion registers, which has {{led to the development of}} local, single-chip devices. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of an optical-fiber with a planar ion trap, and show the physical interaction between fiber light and the trapped-ion qubit. As the single-mode fiber is well-suited to the transport of single photons, the fiber interface (when augmented by an optical cavity) represents a means to link distantly located quantum computers through a common optical network. Hence, this work represents a step towards the paradigm of distributed quantum computing: self-contained, technically-simple processors may be optically linked together to perform large-scale quantum computation. This thesis is divided into two parts. In the first, we provide a thorough review of ion trap design and a detailed numerical analysis of trapped-ion motion. This theoretical discussion culminates with the development of an electronic technique that permits the arbitrary, in situ positioning of a trapped atom in the ion trap. The positioning ability is an enabling technology for trap-integration as it allows for complete freedom in the alignment of the trapped atom with respect to the integrated element. In the second part, the construction of the experimental setup and the integrated "fibertrap" is described. In our experiment, a single 38 Sr+ is trapped 670 [mu]m above the end of an optical fiber in a cryogenic (8 K) surface-electrode ion trap. The fiber serves as an integrated source of laser light, which drives the quadrupole qubit transition of 88 Sr+. Using in situ translation of the ion, the Gaussian beam profile of the fiber output is imaged, and the fiberion displacement, in units of the mode waist at the ion, is optimized to within 0. 13 ± 0. 10 of the <b>mode</b> <b>center</b> despite an initial offset of 3. 30 ± 0. 10 arising from fabrication. We also quantify the perturbative effects of the fiber dielectric on ion trap operation. Light-induced charging by 125 [mu]W of 674 nm fiber light is measured as an induced electric field of ~ 10 V/m at the ion, with charging and discharging time constants of 1. 6 ± 0. 3 s and 4. 7 t 0. 6 s.

40|$|The {{emerging}} eld {{of molecular}} electronics, in which individual molecules {{play the role}} of active devices, is receiving great amount of attention due to its possible technological impact. Recent advances in nanoscale fabrication and engineering techniques have made possible to study the transport properties of devices on the molecular scale. At this level, one inherently probes the quantum mechanical nature of matter which manifests a number of e ects not well understood yet. One such e ect is the mutual interaction between electrical current and molecular vibrations. The coupling between mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom in nanoscale devices is also at the heart of NanoElectroMechanical Systems (NEMS) physics. Potential applications of these systems include ultrasensitive motion detection, mass sensing, bio-molecular studies and quantum enabled technologies. In the rst part of thesis, I focused my investigation on electronic transport properties of very short molecules connected between metallic leads taking into account electron-vibration interaction inside the device with a single vibrational mode. Within two models widely used in the literature, I implemented a computational scheme for the dynamics of the oscillator mode coupled with an out-of-equilibrium molecular junction providing also a novel and more physically sounding derivation. I concentrated my attention on the physical regime where the vibrational motion of the oscillator is 'slow' with respect to all electronic energy scales and can be considered classical. I exploited the Keldysh formalism within Non Equilibrium Green's Function theory (NEGF) for the electronic subsystem together with stochastic dynamics for the vibrational degrees of freedom. As main result, the inclusion of dynamical e ects of the oscillator motion strongly modi es the physical scenario which would be obtained by a static description, even if the oscillator dynamics is much slower than the electron tunneling rate. Motivated by recent experiments on single-electron-transistor made of a single suspended carbon nanotubes, I have further investigated the renormalization e ects of the bending mode oscillation frequency of the nanotube as function of the external charge injection (due to the applied bias and gate voltages). I also included in the model the e ects of an external antenna driving the oscillations of the nanotube. Interestingly, simulations of the stochastic Langevin equation for the vibrational degree of freedom developed in the rst part of the thesis, including the e ect of the external antenna, reproduce semi-quantitatively the experimental results. I have also shown that, even {{in the presence of a}} magnetic eld applied perpendicular to the nanotube device, the nanotube dynamics can be fruitful described by a Langevin equation. In this case, the main result is that the magnetic eld provides an additional damping mechanism to the resonator mechanical motion. In the last part of the thesis, I studied electron transport through molecular systems at high injected carrier densities, where the presence of the electron-electron interactions is not negligible. I have also considered the e ect of the interaction with an high frequency molecu- lar <b>mode</b> (<b>center</b> of mass motion of the molecule) inside the device, which cannot be treated semiclassically anymore. In order to investigate systems with strong electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions, I have used an approximation-free numerical technique, suita- ble for non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems: the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). I numerically investigated with DMRG the electronic transport proper- ties of a nanomechanical shuttling device in the Kondo regime. Nanomechanical shuttling systems (NMSS) and NEMS in general o er a unique platform for design of an electron transistor in which spin and charge transfer can be controlled mechanically. My study is motivated by recent contrasting experimental results found in the conductance measured through C 60 junctions in the low temperature and low bias regime, where very small or re- latively large conductance values are detected. I focused on the e ects of tunneling barrier modulation on the electronic conductance and on the static and dynamical properties of the center of mass phononic mode, clarifying the nature of a dip found in the conductance at particle-hole symmetric point...|$|E

Statistical significance is determined from confidence limits obtained by Monte Carlo simulations.

A systematic shift of size distribution parameters is observed with different atmospheric conditions, where higher aerosol loadings and Angstrom exponent correspond to more fine mode aerosols. The fine mode {{is found to be}} more closely correlated with this shift than the coarse mode. A higher fine mode volume fraction and smaller median fine radius correspond to a larger Angstrom exponent.
