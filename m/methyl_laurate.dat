40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} feasibility of <b>methyl</b> oleate-methyl <b>laurate</b> blend as a surrogate biodiesel system which represents jatropha-coconut oil biodiesel, a potentially suitable formulation for tropical climate, to quantify the efficacy of antioxidant additives {{in terms of their}} kinetic parameters. This blend was tested by the Rancimat EN 14112 standard method. The Rancimat tests results were used to determine the primary oxidation induction period (OIP) and first-order rate constants and activation energies. Addition of BHT and EcotiveTM antioxidants reduces the rate constants (k, h- 1) between 15 to 90 % in the 50 - 200 ppm dose range, with EcotiveTM producing significantly lower k values. Higher dose reduces the rate constant, while oleate/laurate ratio produces no significant impact. Antioxidants increase the oxidation activation energy (Ea, kJ/mol) by 180 to almost 400 % relative to the non-antioxidant value of 27. 0 kJ/mol. EcotiveTM exhibits lower Ea, implying that its higher efficacy stems from a better steric hindrance as apparent from its higher pre-exponential factors. The ability to quantify oxidation kinetic parameters is indicative of the usefulness of methyl oleate-laurate pure FAME blend as a biodiesel surrogate offering better measurement accuracy due to the absence of pre-existing antioxidants in the test samples.

30|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of alkanes as the main substrates for biotransformation processes, fatty acids and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) have received more attention recently because they are considered as renewable resources. Fatty acids are naturally produced by plants whereas FAMEs are produced from transesterification of vegetable oils (Fukuda et al. 2001; Berchmans and Hirata 2008). Therefore, their use as the main raw material for DCA production can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and would, thereby, prevent the aggravation of global warming. Recently, some researchers have elucidated the process of biotransformation of <b>methyl</b> <b>laurate</b> to dodecanedioic acid (Funk et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2017).

30|$|Apart from ethyl esters, {{considerable}} methyl esters {{were observed}} in this study (Fig.  2), likely {{to be due to}} the inductive agent (methanol) of the expression system, where the yeast had priority in utilizing methanol in place of ethanol if sufficient methanol was present. In particular, either of the recombinant strain resulted in significantly higher levels of methyl decanoate. Indeed, methyl and ethyl decanoate accounts for 50.4 and 54.2  % of the total volatile aroma esters generated by P. pastoris-EHT 1 and P. pastoris-EEB 1, respectively, indicating a high-availability of decanoyl-CoA as a substrate. Moreover, the two recombinant yeasts both produced methyl nonanoate but not ethyl nonanoate, further indicating the significance of substrate availability. More interestingly, <b>methyl</b> <b>laurate</b> was observed in both strains whereas ethyl laurate was only obtained in P. pastoris-EHT 1. Given the presence of ethyl laurate is relatively low level, it is proposed that the difference between P. pastoris-EHT 1 and P. pastoris-EEB 1 was little. Furthermore, the formation of methyl esters also provides an explanation for the absence of high level ethyl esters in the volatile products. In future research {{it would be interesting to}} compare affinity of both recombinant enzymes for methanol and ethanol using biochemical in vitro tests, which could provide insights on the production of either ethyl or methyl esters.|$|E

However, in addition to being an odorous food source and providing a possible site for oviposition, fermenting fruit also provides a physical substrate upon which flies can attract and court a potential mate. In this study, we demonstrate that Drosophila adults are able to recruit additional flies to a food source by covering the exposed surface area with fecal spots, and that this recruitment is mediated via olfactory receptors (Ors). Analyses of the deposited frass material demonstrates that frass contains several previously studied pheromone components, such as <b>methyl</b> <b>laurate</b> (ML), methyl myristate (MM), methyl palmitate (MP), and 11 -cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), in addition to several cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) that are known to be behaviorally active. Moreover, this study also demonstrates that adult feeding is increased in the presence of frass, although it appears that Ors are less likely to mediate this phenomenon. In summary, the frass deposited by the fly onto the fruit provides both pheromone and CHC cues that lead to increased feeding and aggregation in Drosophila.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of used cooking oil for synthesis of biodiesel has attracted many researchers, However, {{there is little}} attention focused {{on the use of}} ozone technologyfor synthesis of biodiesel from used palm cooking oil. Biodiesel in this research is a mixture of methyl esters derived from used cooking oil and methanol with the {{utilization of}} acid catalyst and the injection of ozone gas into the reactor. Response surface methodology was applied to determine the optimal operating condition in the biodiesel production. The influence of input variables temperature, ozone concentration, molar ratio of reactant and reaction time on methyl ester concentration was quantified and the optimal condition was indicated by high content of short chain and long chain methyl ester products. The synthesis of biodiesel/methyl esters was conducted in a batch reactor equipped with reflux condenser and potassium iodide trap. A central composite design with four independent variables and two response variables was performed to determine the influence of independent variables. There are two simultaneous reactions occurred, ozonolysis and transesterification reactions. Ozonolysis reaction produced short chain methyl esters consists of methyl hexanoate, methyl octanoatc and methyl nonanoate whereas transesterification reaction produced long chain methyl ester products which were methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, methyl rnyristate and <b>methyl</b> <b>laurate.</b> The optimal operating condition was identitied to be a reaction temperature of 35 °C; 4. 8...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{molecular}} structure and feedstock of biodiesel on its compatibility with an elastomer were investigated in this study. Nine fuels were tested {{to evaluate their}} compatibility with nitrile butandiene rubber (NBR). The tested fuels include diesel fuel, waste cooking oil methyl ester, palm oil methyl ester, soybean oil methyl ester, <b>methyl</b> <b>laurate</b> (C 12 : 0), methyl palmitate (C 16 : 0), methyl stearate (C 18 : 0), methyl oleate (C 18 : 1 M) and ethyl oleate (C 18 : 1 E). The change in weight, volume and mechanical properties of the NBR, after performing the immersion test, indicate that biodiesel has greater solvent power than diesel fuel. The sequence of compatibility of biodiesel with NBR {{is found to be}} in the order of soybean methyl ester (SME), waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCOME), palm methyl ester (PME), with SME being the least compatible. The carbon chain length, number of double bonds, and alcohol moiety chain length of the fatty acid ester also have great influence on its compatibility with the NBR. Fatty acid esters with shorter carbon chain or double bonds have higher solvent power. Thus, the composition of biodiesel could be modified and optimized during its production process through the use of new production techniques or adopting various feedstocks to improve its compatibility with an elastomer.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an efficient design method for DWC which can fractionate palm methyl esters (PME, biodiesel) into three more valuable product groups: {{a mixture of}} <b>methyl</b> <b>laurate</b> and methyl myristate as light-cut, pure methyl palmitate (a parts per thousand yen 99. 5 %) as middle cut, and the mixture of the remaining methyl esters (biodiesel), which has good low-temperature operability {{to such an extent}} as to come close to cold filter plugging point (CFPP) 0 A degrees C, as heavy cut. The first step of the design was to determine numbers of stages for four sub-sections of DWC, liquid split ratio, and initial reflux ratio by the shortcut design, based on the component net flow model and the method of Fenske, Underwood, and Gilliland (FUG method). Secondly, optimal reflux ratio, vapor split ratio, locations of stages for feed and side product were found out by sensitivity analysis in rigorous simulation. The results from the simulation model developed by the method show that the reboiler duty of a single DWC is about 24 % less than that of two simple columns in direct sequence and about 25 % less than in indirect sequence. These energy saving ratios are almost close to 30 %, which is popularly known as a typical value for energy saving of DWC.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed transformation {{system has been}} used to facilitate the sequential disruption of the Candida tropicalis chromosomal POX 4 and POX 5 genes, encoding distinct isozymes of the acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) oxidase which catalyzes the first reaction in the beta-oxidation pathway. The URA 3 -based transformation system was repeatedly regenerated by restoring the uracil requirement to transformed strains, either through selection for spontaneous mutations or by directed deletion within the URA 3 coding sequence, to permit sequential gene disruptions within a single strain of C. tropicalis. These gene disruptions revealed the diploid nature of this alkane- and fatty acid-utilizing yeast by showing that it contains two copies of each gene. A comparison of mutants in which both POX 4 or both POX 5 genes were disrupted revealed that the two isozymes were differentially regulated and displayed unique substrate profiles and kinetic properties. POX 4 was constitutively expressed during growth on glucose and was strongly induced by either dodecane or <b>methyl</b> <b>laurate</b> and {{to a greater extent than}} POX 5, which was induced primarily by dodecane. The POX 4 -encoded isozyme demonstrated a broad substrate spectrum in comparison with the narrow-spectrum, long-chain oxidase encoded by POX 5. The absence of detectable acyl-CoA oxidase activity in the strain in which all POX 4 and POX 5 genes had been disrupted confirmed that all functional acyl-CoA oxidase genes had been inactivated. This strain cannot utilize alkanes or fatty acids for growth, indicating that the beta-oxidation pathway has been functionally blocked...|$|E
40|$|Drosophila melanogaster detects odors using {{olfactory}} sensory neurons (OSNs), {{the primary}} neurons of the olfactory system, located on {{two types of}} head appendages, the antennae and the maxillary palps. These OSNs differ in their ligand specificities. Some of them are specific for signature chemicals of ecological interest to the fly. Others can be activated by {{a broad spectrum of}} odorants. In this dissertation we aimed at {{a deeper understanding of the}} contribution of individual OSN classes to the evaluation of odor signals. Using – among other methods – a high-resolution bioassay for assessing odor-guided behavior in flies, we were able to identify and behaviorally characterize hitherto unidentified Drosophila pheromones. <b>Methyl</b> <b>laurate,</b> one of the pheromones, activates two OSN classes, one of which exclusively mediates attraction towards this compound, while the other one contributes to male copulation success without affecting attraction. In this intra-specific communication system, the non-redundant behavioral relevance of two different OSN classes could be demonstrated by examining flies mutant for either of the two pheromone receptors. To allow for the examination of other OSN classes expressing less specific ORs, we aimed at establishing genetic tools to silence different OSN populations. Unfortunately, none of the tools we tested proved dependable enough for a large-scale investigation to assess valence weights of less specific OSN classes. In an alternative approach, we examined whether the hedonic valence of odor mixtures can be predicted on the basis of mixture constituent valences. Physiologically, binary odor mixtures often retain component information and my results show that the valence of a binary odor mixture can be even quantitatively predicted on the basis of component valences. Hence, our results support the idea that hedonic valence of a complex odor results from the integration of the valence weights of individual processing channels...|$|E
40|$|Transesterification {{reaction}} is a reaction between oils (triglycerides) with alcohol to produce fatty acid alkyl esters and glycerol as a byproduct. Biodiesel is obtained by reacting vegetable oils or fats with methanol. So that the resulting product {{is known as}} the methyl ester. Due to, production of petroleum fuels is limited, it is necessary to develop a vegetable oil to produce biodiesel. One of the vegetable oil that can be used is derived from CPO (Crude Palm Oil) by using a column centrifugal contactor. In this study, biodiesel obtained by transesterification of CPO (Crude Palm Oil), using KOH catalyst. The process is conducted by variation of temperature (50 ºC., 60 °C, and 70 ºC), and reaction time (0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 hours), with a fixed variable stirring speed of 300 rpm and a molar ratio of methanol / oil 6 : 1, the concentration of catalyst KOH 1 %wt. Based on the test results showed that the transesterification reaction time and temperature affected by the speed of reaction formation of biodiesel. The good operating conditions obtained in this study at temperature of 60 °C, and the reaction time of 1. 5 hours which resulted in the conversion reaction of 39, 47 %. The percentage of ester product area is 6. 37 % and 28, 894 % glycerol.

Characteristics of biodiesel produced in this study meets to the Indonesian Standards of biodiesel, with the value of the kinematic viscosity (40 °C) 3. 91 to 4. 15 cSt, Density (40 ºC) = 872. 95 to 886. 44 kg/m 3, and a flash point at 136 ºC (min. 100 ºC) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of formation of haemozoin, a detoxification by-product of several blood-feeding organisms including malaria parasites, {{has been a}} subject of debate; however, recent studies suggest that neutral lipids {{may serve as a}} catalyst. In this study, a model system consisting of an emulsion of neutral lipid particles was employed to investigate the formation of b-haematin, the synthetic counterpart of haemozoin, at the lipid–water interface. A solution of monoglyceride, either monostearoylglycerol (MSG) or monopalmitoylglycerol (MPG), dissolved in acetone and methanol was introduced to an aqueous surface. Fluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) imaging and dynamic light scattering analysis of samples obtained from beneath the surface confirmed the presence of homogeneous lipid particles existing in two major populations: one in the low micrometre size range and the other in the hundred nanometre range. The introduction of haem (Fe(III) PPIX) to this lipid particle system under biomimetic conditions (37 ◦C, pH 4. 8) produced b-haematin with apparent first-order kinetics and an average half life of 0. 5 min. TEM of monoglycerides (MSG or MPG) extruded through a 200 nm filter with haem produced b-haematin crystals aligned and parallel to the lipid–water interface. These TEM data, together with a model system replacing the lipid with an aqueous organic solvent interface using either <b>methyl</b> <b>laurate</b> or docosane demonstrated that the OH and C=O groups are apparently necessary for efficient nucleation. This suggests that b-haematin crystallizes via epitaxial nucleation at the lipid–water interface through interaction of Fe(III) PPIX with the polar head group. Once nucleated, the crystal grows parallel to the interface until growth is terminated by the curvature of the lipid particle. The hydrophobic nature of the mature crystal favours an interior transport resulting in crystals aligned parallel to the lipid–water interface and each other, strikingly similar to that seen in malaria parasites...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of biodiesel {{has been widely}} studied. There are many raw materials used for the synthesis either from edible or non-edible oil. In this study, we investigated the {{synthesis of}} biodiesel using two steps process. The synthesis at 60 oC and ozonation are running in consecutive ways. The waste cooking oil was prepared for synthesis at 60 oC for one hour. The mol ratio of waste cooking oil and methanol was 1 : 5 and 1. 5 % w/w NaOH was used as catalyst. The reaction involved in the synthesis is transesterification, the product was collected and then will be processed for ozonation. The ozonation was carried out at 20 oC for 2 hours with mol ratio of methanol to transesterification product was 7 : 1. The acid catalyst (H 2 SO 4) was used for 1. 5 % w/w and 2 % w/w. Sample from both synthesis at 60 oC and ozonation process have been analysed using Gas Chromatography. The composition of fatty acids (% w/w) in waste cooking oil used for the experiment were : lauric acid 0. 34 %; myristate acid 1. 32 %; palmitic acid 38. 7 %, stearic acid 4. 67 %, oleic acid 40. 1 %, linoleic acid 12. 7 % and others 2. 17 %. It has been proved that transesterification product from synthesis at 60 oC contained of long chain methyl esters, hence the reaction is esterification from long chain fatty acids to long chain methyl esters which consisted of saturated and unsaturated methyl esters. The dominants long chain methyl esters from synthesis at 60 oC were methyl palmitate, methyl oleat, methyl stearate. Other long chain methyl esters are <b>Methyl</b> <b>laurate,</b> Methyl myristate, Methyl pentadecanoate, Methyl palmitoleate, Methyl linoleate, Methyl heneicosanoate, and Methyl heptadecanoate. There were three unsaturated methyl esters have been produced which are methyl palmitoleate, methyl oleat and methyl linoleate. All these products were then ozonised by ozonation process at various temperature. Short chain methyl esters which were from cracking of unsaturated methyl esters and long chain methyl esters remained as product. The transesterification can occur though it is only running at 10, 20 and 30 oC. The short chain methyl esters are methyl nonanoate, methyl hexanoate, and methyl octanoate. Methyl nonanoate was a product from cracking of methyl oleate, whereas methyl hexanoate {{was a product of}} cracking of methyl linoleate. It was found that the best temperature used for ozonation was 20 oC...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{remains a}} major public health problem due to the {{emergence}} and spread of Plasmodium falciparum strains resistant to chloroquine. There is an urgent need to investigate new and effective sources of antimalarial drugs. This research proposed a novel method of fern-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using a cheap plant extract of Pteridium aquilinum, acting as a reducing and capping agent. AgNP were characterized by UV–vis spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Phytochemical analysis of P. aquilinum leaf extract revealed the presence of phenols, alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, proteins, carbohydrates, saponins, glycosides, steroids, and triterpenoids. LC/MS analysis identified at least 19 compounds, namely pterosin, hydroquinone, hydroxy-acetophenone, hydroxy-cinnamic acid, 5, 7 -dihydroxy- 4 -methyl coumarin, trans-cinnamic acid, apiole, quercetin 3 -glucoside, hydroxy-L-proline, hypaphorine, khellol glucoside, umbelliferose, violaxanthin, ergotamine tartrate, palmatine chloride, deacylgymnemic acid, <b>methyl</b> <b>laurate,</b> and palmitoyl acetate. In DPPH scavenging assays, the IC 50 value of the P. aquilinum leaf extract was 10. 04  μg/ml, while IC 50 of BHT and rutin were 7. 93 and 6. 35  μg/ml. In mosquitocidal assays, LC 50 of P. aquilinum leaf extract against Anopheles stephensi larvae and pupae were 220. 44  ppm (larva I), 254. 12  ppm (II), 302. 32  ppm (III), 395. 12  ppm (IV), and 502. 20  ppm (pupa). LC 50 of P. aquilinum-synthesized AgNP were 7. 48  ppm (I), 10. 68  ppm (II), 13. 77  ppm (III), 18. 45  ppm (IV), and 31. 51  ppm (pupa). In the field, the application of P. aquilinum extract and AgNP (10 × LC 50) led to 100  % larval reduction after 72  h. Both the P. aquilinum extract and AgNP reduced longevity and fecundity of An. stephensi adults. Smoke toxicity experiments conducted against An. stephensi adults showed that P. aquilinum leaf-, stem-, and root-based coils evoked mortality rates comparable to the permethrin-based positive control (57, 50, 41, and 49  %, respectively). Furthermore, the antiplasmodial activity of P. aquilinum leaf extract and green-synthesized AgNP was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of P. falciparum. IC 50 of P. aquilinum were 62. 04  μg/ml (CQ-s) and 71. 16  μg/ml (CQ-r); P. aquilinum-synthesized AgNP achieved IC 50 of 78. 12  μg/ml (CQ-s) and 88. 34  μg/ml (CQ-r). Overall, our results highlighted that fern-synthesized AgNP could be candidated as a new tool against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum and different developmental instars of its primary vector An. stephensi.
