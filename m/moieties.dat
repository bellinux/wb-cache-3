Danishefsky's {{synthesis}} of both (+) and (-) peribysin {{began with a}} Saegusa–Ito oxidation of the Diels-Alder adduct of carvone and 3-trimethylsilyloxy-1,3-butadiene to yield the enone below.

5|$|At dawn on {{the third}} day, ukukus grouped by <b>moieties</b> climb the glaciers on Qullqipunku to {{retrieve}} crosses set on top. Some ukukus traditionally spent the night on the glacier to combat spirits. They also cut and bring back blocks of the ice, which {{is believed to have}} sacred medicinal qualities. The ukukus are considered to be the only ones capable of dealing with condenados, the cursed souls said to inhabit the snowfields. According to oral traditions, ukukus from different <b>moieties</b> used to engage in ritual battles on the glaciers, but this practice was banned by the Catholic Church. After a mass celebrated later this day, most pilgrims leave the sanctuary. One group carries the Lord of Quyllurit'i in procession to Tayankani before taking it back to Mawallani.|$|E

Once a phosphoramidite has been coupled to the solid support-bound oligonucleotide and the phosphite <b>moieties</b> have been converted to the P(V) species, {{the presence of the}} phosphate protection is not mandatory for the successful conducting of further coupling reactions.|$|E

50|$|By contrast, the <b>moiety</b> classes {{encompass}} {{many different}} clans. <b>Moiety</b> classification {{is important in}} conflict resolution and in the organisation of authority. For a man to succeed his mother's brother as tsunono, the 'opposite' <b>moiety</b> (always either Nakaripa or Naboen) will hatsunono (make tsunono). During reconciliation ceremonies, the 'opposite' <b>moiety</b> will make speeches setting conditions on the reconciling parties and will preside over sacrifices.|$|R
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose <b>moieties</b> in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|Organoboron {{chemicals}} {{have been}} employed in uses {{as diverse as}} boron carbide (see below), a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron-carbon cluster anions and cations, to carboranes, carbon-boron cluster chemistry compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including carborane acid, a superacid. As one example, carboranes form useful molecular <b>moieties</b> that add considerable amounts of boron to other biochemicals in order to synthesize boron-containing compounds for boron neutron capture therapy for cancer.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} no therapeutic approaches targeting CASS4, {{and in the}} absence of a catalytic domain and no extracellular <b>moieties,</b> it may be challenging to generate such an agent. However, CASS4 may ultimately be relevant in clinical practice as a possible marker to assess prognosis and outcome in cases of NSCLC (and possibly other types of cancer). At present, its greatest clinical value is likely to be as a predictive variant for severity and onset of Alzheimer's disease and cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|Many ligand {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations {{in the body of}} a multicellular organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues. The canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar <b>moieties.</b> Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.|$|E

The {{specific set of}} reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose <b>moiety.</b> An adenylate <b>moiety</b> is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD).
