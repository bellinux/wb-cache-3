50|$|The {{funnelling}} of {{the water}} further up the river caused its level to rise even higher. The situation was worsened by capital dredging which had been carried out between 1909 and 1928, deepening the river channel by about 2 metres (6 ft) to allow access for deeper-draughted vessels to the Port of London. This had the side-effect of {{making it easier for}} sea water to flow up the Thames on a high tide, increasing the flow on a <b>mean</b> <b>tide</b> by about 4% and raising the tidal range by about 0.7 metres (2 ft).|$|E

5000|$|Yaquina Bay is a {{characteristic}} estuary, with freshwater {{input from the}} Yaquina River as well as open access to the Pacific Ocean introducing ocean saltwater.

The estuary is about 11.6 km2 [...] at <b>mean</b> <b>tide</b> and can decrease to 9.1 km2 at mean low tide. The North and South Yaquina Jetties, at the junction between the Pacific Ocean and Yaquina Bay, were constructed in 1888.|$|E
50|$|Basically, the Moray Firth is of tectonic origin, {{related to}} the Great Glen Fault. For some time during the glaciation, the whole of nowaday's Moray firth was a huge glacier. Nevertheless, the inner Part and its side-inlets, Cromarty Firth and Dornoch Firth, are true fjords themselves. Though there is a {{reasonable}} tide with <b>mean</b> <b>tide</b> ranges of about three metres (ten feet), {{only part of the}} rivers draining into the bay have estuaries. Masses of sediment from the adjacent mountains have formed spits around several mouths. Those of River Ness and River Carron have significantly narrowed the fjords they enter.|$|E
50|$|Pagurus bernhardus is {{the common}} marine hermit crab of Europe's Atlantic coasts. It is {{sometimes}} referred to as the common hermit crab or soldier crab. Its carapace reaches 3.5 cm long, and is found in both rocky and sandy areas, from the Arctic waters of Iceland, Svalbard and Russia as far south as southern Portugal, but its range does not extend as far as the Mediterranean Sea. It can be found in pools on the upper shore and at the <b>mean</b> <b>tide</b> level down to a depth of approximately 140 m, with smaller specimens generally found in rock pools around the middle shore and lower shore regions, with larger individuals at depth. P. bernhardus is an omnivorous detritivore that opportunistically scavenges for carrion, and which can also filter feed when necessary.|$|E
