5000|$|Lee Hunter, Jr., was a 23-year-old St. Louis {{architecture}} student, {{found himself}} frequently confronted with car battery failure in his Packard convertible automobile. In 1936, {{it took several}} days to recharge a car battery. Hunter sought to find a better, faster way to recharge batteries. With {{the help of a}} former Washington University electrical engineering professor, Hunter began developing a new design. His [...] "quickcharge" [...] battery recharger was based on a diverter pole generator. He put this new product on the market and during the Great Depression, the Lee Hunter, Jr., Manufacturing Co. sold the $497 Kwikurent charger as fast as the company could make them. After serving in both the U.S. Army Engineering Corps and Ordnance Corps during World War II, Hunter returned to St. Louis in 1946 and reopened his business under the name of Hunter Engineering. Lee Hunter also laid the foundation for a global distribution base for Hunter products. In 1955 Hunter developed a new wheel alignment system called 'Lite-A-Line,' which became the industry standard. In 1962, Hunter's 'Tune-Align' became the first <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> capable of compensating for wheel run-out, a major factor affecting wheel alignment precision. Hunter Engineering continued to expand its export markets and in 1964 was named by the U.S. Department of Commerce as a winner of the E-Award for excellence in the development of export trade.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} alignment {{method is}} commonly used in many industries today because it is cheaper and easier to operate than other alignment methods. However, very little systematic research and study has been conducted in this area so far, {{and there are still}} some fundamental questions which remain unanswered. In this thesis, we investigated the precision level and established the baseline achieved by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> using datums and reference surfaces. The factors which affect the accuracy of <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> were studied and methodology was developed to suppress these factors so as to reach its full potential precision. In order to characterize the <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> quantitatively, a new optical position monitoring system by using quadrant detectors has been developed in this thesis, it can monitor multi-dimensional degrees of mechanical workpieces in real time with high precision, which conventional measurement methods (such as interferometer) can not realize. We studied the noise factors inside the system and optimized the optical system. Based on the fact that one of the major limiting noise factors is the shifting of the laser beam, a noise cancellation technique has been developed successfully to suppress this noise, the feasibility of an ultra high resolution (< 20 angstrom) for displacement monitoring has been demonstrated. Using the optical position monitoring system, repeatability experiment of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> has been conducted on different kinds of samples including steel, aluminum, glass and plastics with the same size 100 mmx 130 mm. The alignment accuracy was studied quantitatively rather than qualitatively before. In a controlled environment, we found that common practice of preparation of datum by insertion of precision machined rod into tightly fitted hole may not be adequate. The alignment precision can be improved 5 folds by securing the datum without other means of help. The roughness of reference surface of the samples can affect the alignment precision, the alignment accuracy of an aluminum workpiece having reference surface by milling is about 3 times better than by shearing. Also we have found that sample material can have fairly significant effect on the alignment precision of the system. Contamination trapped between the datum and reference surfaces in <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> can cause errors of registration or reduce the level of manufacturing precision. In comparison with the results in a controlled environment above, we {{want to find out what}} will happen in the practice of industries where there is contamination and how much room there is in the system accuracy for improvement. In the thesis, artificial and natural dust particles were used to simulate the real situations and their effects on system precision have been investigated. In this experiment, we discovered two effective cleaning processes, one is the self-cleaning process, and another is the cleaning method by an air gun and a vacuum cleaner which is more efficient. We also studied how other factors (surface roughness, sample material) interacted with different types of contamination, and found that dust particles had less effect on the steel sample than on other samples...|$|E
40|$|Abstract With {{the advance}} of MEMS and NEMS technology, {{assembly}} of micro device may some day become important. The quality of the assembled micro device {{would depend on the}} accuracy of the alignment process. Optical Alignment System (OSA) for semiconductor industry has very high level of precision. But the system is too expensive, {{and the size of the}} marker is too big for practical application in the area of micro assembly. On the other hand, the alignment resolution of typical vision type of optical alignment system, limited by the wavelength of the light, is difficult to push too much beyond the um range. Therefore it is the objective of this presentation to discuss the finding of our investigation for an alternative low cost method that can operate in the tens of Nano Meter (nm) Range, and have the potential extending further into nm range. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> (MAS) is widely used in industry because of its simplicity, low cost and easy to use. However, there is a fairly common notion in the industry that MAS is relatively crude, and is not suitable for precision manufacturing. To certain extend, there are some reasons leading to that kind of erroneous conclusion. Some of the MAS used in the industry may indeed perform rather poorly with resolution merely in the tens of micron meter (um). The level of precision of MAS depends strongly on the design of the MAS and the operating condition of the MAS...|$|E

40|$|Background: Total knee {{arthroplasty}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} clinically successful and cost-effective interventions in medicine. However, implant malalignment, especially in the coronal plane, is a common cause of early failure following total knee arthroplasty. Computer-assisted surgery has been employed during total knee arthroplasty to improve the precision of component alignment. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of computer-assisted surgery to determine whether the improved alignment achieved with computer navigation provides a sufficient decrease in failure rates and revisions to justify the added cost. Methods: A decision-analysis model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of computer-assisted surgery in total knee arthroplasty. Model inputs, including costs, effectiveness, and clinical outcome probabilities, were obtained from a review of the literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of component-alignment precision with use of computer-assisted and <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> guides, total knee arthroplasty failure rates secondary to malalignment, and costs of computer-assisted surgery systems on the cost-effectiveness of computer navigation in total knee arthroplasty. Results: Computer-assisted surgery is both more effective and more expensive than <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>systems.</b> Given an additional cost of $ 1500 per operation, a 14 % improvement in coronal alignment precision (within 3 degrees of neutral mechanical axis), and an elevenfold increase in revision rates at fifteen years with coronal malalignment (54 % compared with 4. 7 %), the incremental cost of using computer-assisted surgery is $ 45, 554 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Cost-savings is achieved if the added cost of computer-assisted surgery is $ 629 or less per operation. Variability in published clinical outcomes, however, introduces uncertainty in determining the cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: Computer-assisted surgery is potentially a cost-effective or cost-saving addition to total knee arthroplasty. However, the cost-effectiveness is sensitive to variability in the costs of computer navigation systems, the accuracy of alignment achieved with computer navigation, and the probability of revision total knee arthroplasty with malalignment...|$|R

40|$|Assembly {{precision}} is {{very important}} as it can greatly affect the quality, yield and cost of many products. Thus far, the research on assembly precision has more focused on {{the analysis of the}} precision for a given and completed assembly process. However, selection of appropriate assembly processes with appropriate parameters can be of great significance in determining precision of the final assembled product. It appears that this important area is under-researched and has not yet been fully explored. In this thesis, a comparative study of different assembly processes and different process parameters is conducted to analyse their impact on assembly precision and dimensional variation of the final products. In particular, we are investigating how different mechanical alignment methodologies, part fixture locating layouts and part-to-part joining geometries affect the assembly precision in the presence of form and surface errors of the workpieces. One of the benefits of this work is to provide some guidance for improving the assembly precision by selecting better approaches and better parameters. Due to the complexity and difficulty of building a multiple-station monitoring system for assembly processes, theoretical modelling is used for the study. First, a state space model is developed to provide a mathematical representation of variation propagation in multistage assembly processes. Secondly, simulation method is used to study the effect of part imperfection such as part dimensional error, surface waviness and roughness. A methodology is developed to generate surface spanning from short-range to long-range based on various surface characterizations. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series modelling is utilized to simulate the machined surface short-range and medium-range profiles, which appear to be non-Gaussian and non-stationary. A Bezier curve is applied to fit the surface long-range profile that appears to have a certain repeatable pattern depending on material and process condition. Finally, the superimposition method is used to generate the complete surface spanning from short to long range. To date, relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} the design of alignment systems and how the parts should be located with respect to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> in the assembly process. The effect of using various part surfaces as datums for making the parts and assembling the parts is investigated in this thesis. Our analysis shows that if the MAS is not properly selected, the form errors as well as surface waviness and roughness of the workpieces to be assembled can badly limit the level of accuracy achievable. Such cases are common, where fabrication operations are done on parts before they are assembled. The study shows that if the workpieces are aligned with the same orientation, using similar or identical MAS for the fabrication processes and assembly processes, then the effect of the form errors as well as surface waviness and roughness of the workpieces can be greatly suppressed. The precision level can be readily improved from hundreds of microns to several microns and there is almost a two-orders-of-magnitude difference in the assembly precision between the good assembly case and the bad assembly case. Different types of part fixtures locating layouts and part-to-part joint geometries can significantly affect the assembly precision. In this thesis, we investigate the effects of three types of part-to-part joint geometries on assembly precision in the presence of part dimensional error, surface roughness and waviness. We confirm that fixture error, workpiece dimensional error, surface roughness and waviness can have significant effects on assembly precision. In addition, our analysis shows that the selection of joint and joining process can fairly affect the dimensional accuracy of part-against-part joints. Industrial case studies of front rail and rear gate opening assemblies during the automotive body manufacturing process have been investigated. Some of the potential impacts of the typical assembly approach and error sources have been identified...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Entre 2008 e 2010, 36 próteses totais de joelho foram executadas e comparadas, 25 navegadas e 11 mecânicas. Qualquer desvio de eixo medido no RX panorâmico pós-operatório foi considerado positivo.

Houve um melhor alinhamento com tendência à diferença estatística em favor da técnica navegada. CONCLUSÃO: Os casos com desvio de eixo maior que três graus foram significativamente maiores na técnica mecânica. A técnica por navegação foi incorporada por nossa equipe sem complicações adicionais e, mesmo sem experiência em cirurgia navegada, os primeiros casos obtiveram melhor alinhamento em relação à técnica mecânica e número significativamente menor de casos fora da zona de segurança de três graus em relação ao eixo mecânico.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{examine whether}} {{categories}} of anatomic alignment (varus, neutral, valgus) measured from knee X-rays agree with similar categories of <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> from the full limb film and whether varus anatomic malalignment predicts medial joint space loss on knee X-rays {{as well as}} varus <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment.</b> MethodsWe used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) (full limb and flexed knee X-rays) to examine agreement of anatomic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> and data from Boston Osteoarthritis of the Knee Study (BOKS) to evaluate the association of full limb <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> vs knee X-ray anatomic alignment with joint space loss. A 4 ° offset was used to correct for the more valgus angulation of the anatomic alignment. ResultsOf 143 subjects whose knee X-rays and full limb films were publicly released from the OAI, the agreement of varus, neutral and valgus alignment was only moderate (κ= 0. 43, P< 0. 001). In BOKS, varus <b>mechanical</b> and anatomic <b>alignments</b> measured from full limb and knee X-rays respectively both predicted {{a high risk of}} medial joint space loss vs neutral <b>alignment</b> – for <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment,</b> odds ratio (OR) = 4. 82 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 93, 12. 00] and for anatomic alignment OR= 4. 25 (95 % CI 2. 08, 8. 72). ConclusionsWhile agreement of alignment from knee X-ray to full limb film was only moderate, varus malalignment measured from a flexed knee predicted the likelihood of progression well. Flexed knee alignment may be more relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA) risk than that of a fully extended knee, but a measurement of alignment from a short limb is an imperfect surrogate for full limb alignment...|$|R

Questions/purposes We investigated what percentage of the normal population has constitutional varus knees and what are the contributing factors. Subjects and Methods We recruited a cohort of 250 asymptomatic adult volunteers between 20 and 27 years old for this cross-sectional study. All volunteers had full-leg standing digital radiographs on which 19 alignment parameters were analyzed.

Results Thirty-two percent of men and 17 % of women had constitutional varus knees with a natural <b>mechanical</b> <b>alignment</b> of 3 A degrees varus or more.

40|$|Laser beam {{alignment}} {{is very important}} for high-power laser facility. Long laser path and large-aperture lens for alignment are generally used, while the proposed <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> with a wedge by far-field sampling technique reduces both space and cost requirements. General <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> for large-aperture laser beam is long in distance and large in volum because of taking near-field sampling technique. With the development of laser fusion facilities, the space for <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> is limited. A new <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> for large-aperture laser beam is designed to save space and reduce operating costs. The new alignment for large-aperture laser beam with a wedge is based on far-field sampling technique. The wedge is placed behind the spatial filter to reflect some laser beam as signal light for alignment. Therefore, laser beam diameter in <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> is small, which can save space for the laser facility. Comparing to general <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> for large-aperture laser beam, large-aperture lenses for near-field and far-field sampling, long distance laser path are unnecessary for proposed <b>alignment</b> <b>system,</b> which saves cost and space greatly.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{strategy}} for combining the outputs of several <b>alignment</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on the word boundaries retrieved from a number of individual <b>alignment</b> <b>systems,</b> the new boundaries are estimated. We investigate three strategies for this estimation. First, the mean value of the individual boundaries is taken, second the median is selected, and third, confidence values of the <b>alignment</b> <b>systems</b> are considered. We apply the combination strategies on a word mapping system for historical handwritten manuscripts. After some preprocessing and normalizing steps, three differently trained hidden Markov model based handwriting recognizers are applied to the text lines in forced alignment mode. As a result, the positions of the word boundaries are obtained. In in a number of experiments it is shown that a combination strategy based on the median outperforms the others and all individual <b>alignment</b> <b>systems</b> with a word mapping rate of about 95 %...|$|R
40|$|StringsAuto and MapSSS are two {{closely related}} {{ontology}} <b>alignment</b> <b>systems.</b> The StringsAuto matcher seeks {{to explore the}} limits of a syntactic-only approach to <b>alignment.</b> The MapSSS <b>system</b> then expands on this work by embedding the syntactic matching of StringsAuto within a more complete <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> that also makes use of semantic and structural information. In this paper we describe the basic operation of the two systems and discuss their performance in the OAEI 2013 evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We propose and {{demonstrate}} an automatic optical fiber <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> using genetic algorithms. Connecting optical fibers {{is difficult because}} the connecting edges should be aligned with sub-micronmeter resolution. It, therefore, takes long time even for a human expert. Although automatic fiber <b>alignment</b> <b>systems</b> are being developed, they cannot be used practically if the degrees of freedom of fiber edges are large. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed an automatic fiber <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> using genetic algorithms, which incorporate a special local learning method. In experiments, fiber alignment of five degrees of freedom can be completed within a few minutes, whereas {{it would take a}} human expert about half an hour. ...|$|R

In the latter type, two independent pairs of vertical plates deflect the beams. Vertical plates for channel A {{had no effect}} on channel B's beam. Similarly for channel B, separate vertical plates existed which deflected the B beam only.|$|R

40|$|Although optical <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> for {{lithography}} {{can achieve}} very high resolution, {{for a lot}} of applications such as micro machining process, this kind of optical <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> is either too expensive or not compatible with the equipment and the manufacturing process of interest. In these situations, alternative precision alignment methods would be necessary. In this paper, we propose a design of an ultra-high resolution <b>alignment</b> <b>system</b> utilizing a Surface Probe (SP) such as atomic force microscope (AFM) or scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) and an alignment marker. In order to realize the potential of utilizing Surface Probe Microscope (SPM) as ultra-high resolution <b>alignment</b> <b>system,</b> one of the obstacles of poor definition of the alignment marker has to be overcome. Instead of a well defined points or lines, the alignment marker as fabricated by the available precision methods such as E beam or Ion beam Milling is still very large and very rough in comparison to the atomic dimension. A methodology is proposed to extract the alignment information from the alignment marker precisely. Using our method of extraction alignment information, our simulation study shows that alignment repeatability and accuracy in the order a few angstroms level can be achieved with our proposed <b>alignment</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
