25|$|The main feud on the Raw brand {{was between}} The Rock and Steve Austin. On the February 20 episode of SmackDown!, The Rock {{returned}} to WWE after a six-month hiatus from wrestling (since SummerSlam). On that evening, {{he was in}} a confrontation with Hulk Hogan before their WrestleMania X8 rematch at No Way Out. At the No Way Out event, The Rock defeated Hogan with the help of Mr. McMahon. On the following night's episode of Raw, The Rock returned to the Raw brand in a 20-man Battle royal that would determine the opponent for the World Heavyweight Championship. Rock however, was unable to win after he was eliminated by Booker T; after the match, Rock criticized Steve Austin for being chosen as the Superstar of the Decade by the WWE fans in January, beginning the feud between Rock and Austin. The following week on Raw, Austin, who was on a long hiatus before returning that previous Sunday at No Way Out, made his WWE television return, as he cut a promo about the WWE fans, before he was interrupted by Rock, who challenged him to a match at WrestleMania because The Rock, himself, was obsessed of not beating Austin at a WrestleMania event by the time they fought at WrestleMania XV and X-Seven during a four-year span. As soon as the challenge was made, Raw General manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the following week on Raw, Rock would face Booker T in a match, and if he won, he would have the choice to face either Austin or Triple H at WrestleMania. On the March 10 episode of Raw, Rock, with Bischoff's approval, announced that he would pick his own opponent for later that night, {{which turned out to be}} The Hurricane, in hopes for Rock to gain an easy victory. However, Austin <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the entrance ramp, which distracted Rock and allowed Hurricane to Roll up Rock into a successful pinfall, which made the Austin-Rock match at WrestleMania official. On the March 24, and final episode of Raw leading into WrestleMania, Austin was banned from entering the arena that night. He managed to enter the arena and attack Rock, however, before Rock fled the ring.|$|E
60|$|The face of {{the moon}} was in shadow. Below him the field {{stretched}} out in total darkness, a black void, endless, without form. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> carefully <b>down</b> the steps and along the ramp {{along the side of}} the field, to the control tower. A faint row of red lights showed him the way.|$|R
60|$|The officer <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>down</b> {{the ladder}} which {{led into the}} hold, and the {{corporal}} followed him, and had his chest level with the deck when the other had reached the bottom. It may have been something in Ephraim Savage's face, or {{it may have been}} the gloom around him which startled the young Frenchman, but a sudden suspicion flashed into his mind.|$|R
60|$|Now you {{remember}} that Whitefoot had <b>made</b> <b>his</b> home <b>way</b> <b>down</b> beneath the great pile of wood in the sugar-house. Of course Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown's boy used that wood for the fire to boil the sap to make the syrup and sugar. Whitefoot thought nothing of this until one day he discovered that his little home was no longer as dark as it had been. A little ray of light crept down between the sticks. Presently another little ray of light crept down between the sticks.|$|R
500|$|With two {{attempts}} {{to contact the}} battalion having failed, Manahi <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> Takrouna to locate reinforcements and supplies. [...] Ignoring an officer's advice that he abandon the ledge, he returned with a section from C Company as well as ammunition and stretcher bearers. [...] A further platoon arrived to further consolidate his position. [...] The expected counterattack then commenced, and this was successfully beaten off. [...] It was only then, after having been on Takrouna for 16 hours that Manahi and {{what was left of}} his section withdrew, leaving the platoon to hold the position.|$|E
2500|$|Captain Weaver later {{returned}} as a passenger of the steamer Norkoowa from the Solomon Islands in March 1906 {{and landed in}} Brisbane suffering from malaria just under seven years after the murder. [...] By late March he had <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to Sydney.|$|E
2500|$|Hulk Hogan then <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to {{the ring}} as Nash and Hall fled to the outside. In a {{surprise}} move, the longtime fan favorite Hogan then performed two Atomic Legdrops to Savage, revealing himself to be Hall and Nash's partner as The Outsiders returned {{to the ring}} to celebrate their new alliance as the stunned crowd looked on. The match officially ended in a no-contest after Hogan threw the referee {{out of the ring}} and hit Savage with one more Atomic Legdrop. After the main event, the audience began to throw trash in the ring. Gene Okerlund entered the ring and asked Hogan why he had turned his back on the fans and how he could align himself with Hall and Nash. Hogan claimed that the three of them were [...] "the future of wrestling" [...] and said that [...] "you can call this the new world order of wrestling, brother." [...] Hogan went on to justify his actions, saying he was bored with WCW and had grown tired of constantly pandering to the fans, especially considering that more and more of them had started to turn on him since he had joined the company in 1994. Hogan declared their intention to take over the wrestling business and destroy everything in their path.|$|E
60|$|Everything was wonderfully simplified. If only {{he could}} get across, once reach New York! Meanwhile, {{he looked at his}} watch again and {{discovered}} that it wanted but ten minutes to three. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> to <b>his</b> stateroom, which was already filled with his luggage. He shook out an ulster from a bundle of wraps, and selected a tweed cap. Already there was a faint touch of the sea in the river breeze, and he was impatient for the immeasurable open spaces, the salt wind, the rise and fall of the great ship. Then, as he stood on the threshold of his cabin, he heard voices.|$|R
60|$|He {{jumped into}} the {{automobile}} and was soon on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back. Gerald watched him until he was nearly out of sight. On the knoll, two of the wireless operators were already at work. Mr. Fentolin sat in his chair below, watching. The blue sparks were flashing. A message was just being delivered. Presently Mr. Fentolin turned his chair, and with Meekins by <b>his</b> side, <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back to the house. He passed along the hall and into his study. Gerald, who was on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the dining-room, heard the ring of the telephone bell and the call for the trunk special line. He hesitated for a moment. Then he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>down</b> towards the study and stood outside the door, listening. In a moment he heard Mr. Fentolin's clear voice, very low yet very penetrating.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{it became}} quite dark he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> {{cautiously}} <b>down</b> the valley, passed {{the spot where the}} French column had suffered so heavily, and then, turning to the left, traversed the narrow plain that divided the position on which the French heavy battery had been placed and the plateau on which their cavalry had been massed. Numerous fires blazed in the wide valley behind, where the reserve had been stationed on the previous morning, and he doubted not that the French cavalry were there, especially as he found no signs of life on the plateau above. Coming presently on a small stream he bathed his head for a considerable time, and then proceeded on <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> feeling much brighter and fresher than he had done before.|$|R
2500|$|The main feud {{leading into}} WrestleMania X-Seven {{involved}} Stone Cold Steve Austin challenging The Rock for the WWF Championship. The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin had fought [...] for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania XV and [...] in 1999. Stone Cold Steve Austin earned his opportunity {{to compete for}} the WWF Championship at WrestleMania X-Seven by winning the 2001 Royal Rumble match when he last eliminated Kane, while The Rock became the first ever six-time WWF Champion when he defeated Kurt Angle at No Way Out. During their feud, Austin's wife Debra, who was trying to get back into managing, was ordered by WWF chairman, Vince McMahon, to be The Rock's manager against her wishes as well as both Rock and Austin's. As a result, Austin would hold The Rock and McMahon responsible if any harm came to her. On the March 12 episode of Raw is War, The Rock was placed in an overlong Ankle Lock hold during his rematch with Kurt Angle. When Debra went to check on The Rock, Angle also placed her into an Ankle Lock hold. Austin soon ran in to save her and knocked Angle out of the ring. Keeping to his word, he immediately gave The Rock a Stone Cold Stunner as punishment. The following week on Raw is War, during a handicap tag team match involving The Rock, Chris Jericho, Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, and William Regal, Austin <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the ring and ended up getting a Rock Bottom from The Rock {{as a result of the}} stunner the previous week. On the March 29 episode of SmackDown!, Debra was relieved from her managerial role by Mr. McMahon after failing to prevent a brawl between Rock and Austin.|$|E
2500|$|Then {{came the}} match between Nash and Hogan on the January 4, 1999, episode of Nitro. The match was {{originally}} advertised as a Starrcade rematch between Nash and Goldberg. As a result, the Georgia Dome in Atlanta {{was a complete}} sellout, with over 40,000 people watching live expecting to see the rematch. Throughout the broadcast the announcers hyped the main event as being the [...] "biggest match {{in the history of}} our sport" [...] and said that [...] "unlike the other guys, we have a real main event". Instead, Goldberg was forced to forgo his title match after being kayfabe arrested by the police for stalking Miss Elizabeth and was replaced by Hogan. Hogan faked a punch on Nash and then poked him in the chest. Nash overselled the poke in the chest by forcefully falling to the mat and allowing Hogan to pin him for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The nWo hugged in the ring immediately afterwards until Goldberg <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the stage along with Lex Luger, only to have Luger blindside him and Hall taser him with a shock stick once again, just like at Starrcade. This incident has since gone down in wrestling lore as the [...] "Fingerpoke of Doom". This bait-and-switch damaged the credibility of the company as a whole, having failed to present the advertised match and using underhand tactics to sell out the arena for that night's telecast. On the same episode of Nitro, Tony Schiavone, under direction from Bischoff, revealed that Mick Foley won the WWF Title at a taped edition of Raw and mocked the WWF for making what he implied was a bad business decision (sarcastically saying [...] "huh, that's gonna put some butts in the seats"). [...] Nielsen ratings indicated that over 300,000 households changed the channel to watch the victory and shifted the ratings for the night in the WWF's favor.|$|E
60|$|So {{saying he}} sprang upstairs, while Ronald <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the door.|$|E
60|$|Maraton <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> from <b>Downing</b> Street on foot, curiously enough {{altogether}} escaping {{recognition from}} the crowds {{who were still}} hanging about on the chance of catching a glimpse of him. He was somehow conscious, as he turned northwards, of a peculiar sense of exhilaration, a savour in life unexpected, not altogether analysable. As a rule, the streets themselves supplied him with illimitable food for thought; the passing multitudes, the ceaseless flow of the human stream, justification absolute and most complete for the new faith {{of which he was}} the prophet. For the cause of the people had only been recognised during recent days as something entirely distinct from the Socialism and Syndicalism which had been its precursors. It was Maraton himself who had raised it {{to the level of a}} religion.|$|R
60|$|He {{descended into}} the street but {{for a few moments}} he found himself hopelessly lost at sea. So far as he could see there was no light nor any glimmer of one. He reached the corner of the street like a blind man, by tapping the {{kerbstone}} with his cane. Arrived here, he stood for a moment {{in the middle of the}} road, bareheaded. There was not a breath of wind anywhere. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> carefully <b>down</b> towards Downing Street, meeting few people, and still obliged to grope rather than walk. Along <b>Downing</b> Street he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> by the railings and rang the bell at last at the Premier's house. He was shown at once into the council room. The four or five men who were seated around a table, and who looked up at his entrance, bore every one of them, household names. The Premier held out his hand.|$|R
60|$|That {{night there}} was just {{sufficient}} light struggling through the clouds to make Panley Common visible as a black expanse, against the lightest tone of which a piece of ebony would have appeared pale. Not a human being was stirring {{within a mile of}} Moncrief House, the chimneys of which, ghostly white on the side next the moon, threw long shadows on the silver-gray slates. The stillness had just been broken by the stroke of a quarter past twelve from a distant church tower, when, from the obscurity of one of these chimney shadows, a head emerged. It belonged to a boy, whose body presently wriggled through an open skylight. When his shoulders were through he turned himself face upward, seized the miniature gable in which the skylight was set, drew himself completely out, and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> stealthily <b>down</b> to the parapet. He was immediately followed by another boy.|$|R
60|$|He crawled {{from the}} basket and {{carefully}} <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the tree to the ground.|$|E
60|$|Rob's {{heart was}} very light {{as he left}} the {{workshop}} and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the attic stairs.|$|E
60|$|Sir Eustace then <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> {{from the}} wall to his Apartments, where Dame Margaret was {{awaiting}} him. She hurried to meet him.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{a thought}} {{came to me}} and brought some little comfort to my heart. I was not {{absolutely}} alone in the world. Down {{at the bottom of the}} cliff, and within call of me, was waiting the faithful Zambo. I went to the edge of the plateau and looked over. Sure enough, he was squatting among his blankets beside his fire in his little camp. But, to my amazement, a second man was seated in front of him. For an instant my heart leaped for joy, as I thought that one of my comrades had <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> safely <b>down.</b> But a second glance dispelled the hope. The rising sun shone red upon the man's skin. He was an Indian. I shouted loudly and waved my handkerchief. Presently Zambo looked up, waved his hand, and turned to ascend the pinnacle. In a short time he was standing close to me and listening with deep distress to the story which I told him.|$|R
6000|$|Lawford nodded, {{with eyes}} fixed blankly on the candle, and turning once more, <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>down</b> the narrow green-bordered path {{upon which the}} stars rained a {{scattered}} light so feeble it seemed but as a haze that blurred the darkness. He pushed open the little white wicket and turned his face towards the soundless, leaf-crowned hill. He had advanced hardly a score of steps in the thick dust when almost as if its very silence had struck upon his ear he remembered the black broken grave with its sightless heads that lay beyond the leaves. And fear, vast and menacing, fear such as only children know, broke like a sea of darkness on his heart. He stopped dead--cold, helpless, trembling. And, in the silence he heard a faint cry behind him and light footsteps pursuing him. He turned again. In the thick close gloom beneath the enormous elm-boughs the grey eyes shone clearly visible in the face upturned to him. 'My brother,' she began breathlessly--'the little French book. It was I who--who mislaid it.' ...|$|R
50|$|One of the plainclothes officers, Antonio Cedillo, {{despite being}} seriously wounded, was {{still able to}} fire at the fleeing Eta members. He then <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> on foot <b>down</b> the road towards Rentería, {{collapsing}} 100 metres from the attack in a large pool of blood. A civilian, Jose Elicegui, who lived in a village a few metres from the road junction linking the towns of Oyarzun, Astigarraga and Renteria, was on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to work when he spotted the police officer and stopped to pick him up to take him to hospital. However, Elicegui was pursued by three ETA members who forced him to stop. After searching his van and finding the wounded police officer, they executed Cedillo with a shot to the neck.|$|R
60|$|The {{clapping}} {{broke out}} again as Joe <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the steps. Joe, as an All England player, was a favourite with the crowd.|$|E
60|$|He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the lane, {{which was}} still crowded with villagers and loungers. He was {{received}} with a shower of questions as he climbed into the car.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hoped so, {{although}} there was no arrangement between us to meet here. Still, I thought that he would have <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> here, if possible, as he would then be able to escape in the lugger." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} at night Pearson dropped lightly from the stockade on the side {{opposite}} to the gate, as he knew that, if the Indians were there, {{this would be the}} point that they would be watching; then, crawling upon <b>his</b> stomach, he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>down</b> to the lake. Entering the water and stooping low, he waded {{along the edge of the}} bushes for a distance of a mile; then he left the water and struck into the forest. Every few minutes he could hear the discharge of the rifles at the house; but, as before, no answering shots were heard. Treading very cautiously, he made a wide détour and then came down again on the clearing at the end furthest from the lake, where the Indians had been last seen moving about. All was still. Keeping among the trees and moving with great caution, he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> for a considerable distance, along the edge of the clearing; then he dropped on his hands and knees and entered the cornfield, and for two hours he crawled about, quartering the ground like a dog in search of game. Everywhere he found lines where the Indians had crawled along to the edge nearest to the house, but nowhere did he discover a sign of life. Then, still taking great care, he moved down toward the house and made a circuit of it a short distance outside the stockade; then he rose to his feet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{record shows}} that during his service, on September 27, 1857 he deserted from Fort Randall, South Dakota. He was arrested 3 {{days later in}} Sioux City, Iowa having <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> 120 miles <b>down</b> the Missouri River. He was court martialed and sentenced to 6 months of hard labor with a ball and chain and fined $10 plus an {{additional}} fine {{to cover the cost}} of his recapture. During the trial he declined to testify in his own defense. Fortunately for Augustus, his commanding officer, Captain William M. Gardner, testified on his behalf and prevailed on the court to suspend the harsher penalties. Augustus was only required to make up the 3 days of lost service and pay $30 {{to cover the cost of}} his apprehension. The episode is not disclosed in his book. Augustus did however express his gratitude toward the Captain.|$|R
5000|$|Francis Asbury (1745-1816), the {{founding}} bishop of American Methodism, established the precedent for circuit riding. Together with his driver and partner [...] "Black Harry" [...] Hosier, he traveled 270,000 miles and preached 16,000 sermons as he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up and <b>down</b> early America supervising clergy. He brought {{the concept of}} the circuit from English Methodism, where it still exists: UK Methodist churches in England are grouped in circuits, which typically include a dozen or more churches, and ministers are appointed ("stationed") to the circuit, not to the local church. A typical English circuit has two or three times as many churches as ministers, the balance of the services being led by lay Methodist local preachers or retired ("supernumerary") ministers. The title circuit rider, however, was an American coinage born of American necessities. Although John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, covered enormous distances on horseback during his career, and early British Methodist preachers also rode around their circuits, in general they had far less formidable traveling commitments than their American counterparts.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{he turned}} with his daughter, {{as if to}} retrace his steps up the street; but on {{reaching}} the first side street, turned, and then, by another street, <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the river, Rupert following closely behind.|$|E
60|$|A {{young man}} with a Wellington nose, who had {{occupied}} a seven-and-sixpenny seat, <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the stone stairs when the opera ended, as if he were still set a little apart from his fellows by the influence of the music.|$|E
60|$|So very tenderly {{he took up}} the child, {{and wrapped}} the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> {{the hill to the}} village, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and {{softness}} of heart.|$|E
60|$|Several {{times he}} had to pause and lean against the wall, {{and when he had}} passed the {{barricade}} at the Place de la Concorde, towards which he had almost instinctively <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> he sat <b>down</b> on one of the deserted seats in the Champs Elysées, and burst into tears. It had hardly come upon him as a surprise, for he had felt that, conspicuous as he had made himself, the chances of Arnold making his escape were small indeed, especially as Minette would cling to the Commune until the very end. Still it never struck him as being possible that he himself might witness the end. He had thought that the same obscurity that hung over the fate of most of the other leaders of the Commune would envelop that of Arnold. He would have fallen, but how or when would never have been known. He would simply have disappeared. Rumor would have mentioned his name for a few days, the rumor that was already busy with the fate of other leaders of the insurrection, and he had never dreamt that it would be brought home to him in this fashion. After a time Cuthbert pulled himself together, waited until a fiacre came along for on this side of Paris things were gradually regaining their usual aspect and then drove back to Passy.|$|R
60|$|The captain {{blew his}} whistle. Mr. Hamilton Fynes <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> quietly {{to the lower}} deck, which was almost deserted. In a very few minutes he was joined by half a dozen sailors, {{dragging}} a rope ladder. The little tug came screaming around, and before any of the passengers on the deck above had any idea of what was happening, Mr. Hamilton Fynes was on board the Anna Maria, and on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the river, seated in a small, uncomfortable cabin, lit by a single oil lamp.|$|R
60|$|Wolfenden, who {{had bought}} no paper on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up from Norfolk, gazed with {{something}} approaching amazement {{at the huge}} placards everywhere displayed along the Strand, thrust into his cab by adventurous newsboys, flaunting upon every lamp-post. He alighted near Trafalgar Square, and purchased a Globe. The actual facts were meagre enough, but significant when considered {{in the light of}} a few days ago. A vacancy had occurred upon the throne of one of England's far off dependencies. The British nominee had been insulted in his palace by the German consul--a rival, denounced as rebel by the authorities, had been carried off in safety on to a German gunboat, and accorded royal honours. The thing was trivial as it stood, but its importance had been enhanced a thousandfold by later news. The German Emperor had sent a telegram, approving his consul's action and forbidding him to recognise the new sovereign. There was no possibility of misinterpreting such an action; it was an overt and deliberate insult, the second within a week. Wolfenden read the news upon the pavements of Pall Mall, jostled from right to left by hurrying passers by, conscious too, all the while, of that subtle sense of excitement which was in the air and was visibly reflected in the faces of the crowd. He turned into his club, and here he found even a deeper note of the prevailing fever. Men were gathered around the tape in little clusters, listening to the click click of the instrument, and reading aloud the little items of news as they appeared. There was a burst of applause when the Prime Minister's dignified and peremptory demand for an explanation eked out about four o'clock in the afternoon--an hour later it was rumoured that the German Ambassador had received his papers. The Stock Exchange remained firm--there was enthusiasm, but no panic. Wolfenden began to wish that he, too, were a soldier, as he passed from one to another of the eager groups of young men about his own age, eagerly discussing the chances of the coming campaign. He walked out into the streets presently, and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> boldly <b>down</b> to the house which had been pointed out to him as the town abode of Mr. Sabin and his niece. He found it shut up and apparently empty. The servant, who after some time answered his numerous ringings, was, either from design or chance, more than usually stupid. He could not tell where Mr. Sabin was or when he would return--he seemed to have no information whatever as regards the young lady. Wolfenden turned away in despair and walked slowly back towards Pall Mall. At the bottom of Piccadilly he stopped for a moment to let a little stream of carriages pass by; he was about to cross the road when a large barouche, with a pair of restive horses, again blocked the way. Attracted by an unknown coronet upon the panel, and the quiet magnificence of the servants' liveries, he glanced curiously at the occupants as the carriage passed him. It was one of the surprises of his life. The woman nearest to him he knew well by sight; she was the Duchess de Montegarde, one of the richest and most famous of Frenchwomen--a woman often quoted as exactly typical of the old French nobility, and who had furthermore gained for herself a personal reputation for delicate and aristocratic exclusiveness, not altogether shared by her compeers in English society. By her side--in the seat of honour--was Helène, and opposite to them was {{a young man with a}} dark, fiercely twisted moustache and distinctly foreign appearance. They passed slowly, and Wolfenden remained upon the edge of the pavement with his eyes fixed upon them.|$|R
