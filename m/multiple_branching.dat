40|$|The {{need for}} <b>multiple</b> <b>branch</b> {{prediction}} is inherent to wide instruction fetching. This paper presents a completion time <b>multiple</b> <b>branch</b> predictor called the Tree-based <b>Multiple</b> <b>Branch</b> Predictor (TMP) that builds on previous single branch prediction techniques. It employs a tree structure of branch predictors, or tree-node predictors, and achieves accurate <b>multiple</b> <b>branch</b> prediction by leveraging the high accuracies {{of the individual}} branch predictors. A highlyefficient TMP design uses the 2 -bit saturating counters for the tree-node predictors. To achieve higher prediction rate, the TMP employs two-level schemes for the tree-node predictors resulting in a three-level TMP design. Placing the TMP at completion time reduces the critical latency in the front-end of the pipeline; the resultant longer update latency does not significantly impact the overall performance. In this paper the TMP is applied to a trace cache design and shown to be very effective in increasing its performance. Resu [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The second adventure, Bard Quest, was an {{experiment}} {{in the creation of}} <b>multiple,</b> <b>branching</b> paths rather than a single linear storyline. In Bard Quest, Hussie provided choice hyperlinks in a choose-your-own-adventure format. It was the first adventure to be hosted on its own website, but was ultimately left unfinished due to the difficulty Hussie faced in maintaining the complex web of branching storylines. Bard Quest was updated from June 12, 2007 to July 6, 2007, after which the site was left on hiatus.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} in 1956, it was stated that {{amylopectin}} contained three {{different types of}} chains. In each macromolecule there is one C-chain, which carries the only reducing group. The B-chains {{are linked to the}} macromolecules linked by their potential reducing group, and may contain one or more A-chains that are similarly linked. The ratio of A-B chains (1:1 to 1,5:1) {{is a measure of the}} degree of <b>multiple</b> <b>branching</b> and is an important property describing amylopectin. Nevertheless, the exact arrangement of chains within the amylopectin molecule is still not clear.|$|E
50|$|Non-linear {{branching}} storylines are {{a common}} trend in visual novels, which frequently use <b>multiple</b> <b>branching</b> storylines to achieve multiple different endings, allowing non-linear freedom of choice along the way. Decision points within a visual novel often present players with the option of altering {{the course of events}} during the game, leading to many different possible outcomes. An acclaimed example is Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward, where nearly every action and dialogue choice can lead to entirely new branching paths and endings. Each path only reveals certain aspects of the overall storyline and it is only after uncovering all the possible different paths and outcomes, through multiple playthroughs, that every component comes together to form a coherent well-written story.|$|E

50|$|Branching storylines are {{a common}} trend in visual novels, a subgenre of {{interactive}} narrative and adventure games. Visual novels frequently use <b>multiple</b> <b>branching</b> storylines to achieve multiple different endings, allowing non-linear freedom of choice along the way. Decision points within a visual novel often present players with the option of altering {{the course of events}} during the game, leading to many different possible outcomes. Visual novels are popular in East Asia, especially in Japan where they account for nearly 70% of personal computer games released there. A recent acclaimed example is 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, where nearly every action and dialogue choice can lead to entirely new branching paths and endings. Each path only reveals certain aspects of the overall storyline and it is only after uncovering all the possible different paths and outcomes through multiple playthroughs that everything comes together to form a coherent well-written story.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this part-review part-new work, {{studies on}} {{branching}} tube flows are described. These {{are based on}} modelling for increased flow rates {{as well as on}} direct numerical simulations and are motivated by applications to the cardiovascular system, lung airways and cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Small pressure differentials acting across a <b>multiple</b> <b>branching</b> are considered first, followed by substantial pressure differentials in a side branching, <b>multiple</b> <b>branching</b> or basic three-dimensional branching. All cases include a comparison of results between the modelling and the direct simulations. Wall shear, pressure variation, influence lengths, and separation or its suppression are examined, showing in particular sudden spatial adjustment of the pressure between mother and daughter tubes, nonunique flow patterns and a linear increase of flow rate with increasing number of daughters, dependent on the specific conditions. The agreement between modelling and direct simulations is generally close at moderate flow rates, suggesting their combined use in the biomedical applications.

40|$|The shape {{reconstruction}} of a 3 D object from its 2 D cross-sections {{is important for}} reproducing it by NC machining or rapid prototyping. In this paper, we present method of surface approximation to cross-sections with <b>multiple</b> <b>branching</b> problems. In this method, we first decompose each <b>multiple</b> <b>branching</b> problem into a set of single branching problems by providing a set of intermediate contours using distance maps. For each single branching region, a procedure then performs the skinning of contour curves represented by cubic B-spline curves on a common knot vector, {{each of which is}} fitted to its contour points within a given accuracy. In order to acquire a more compact representation for the surface, the method includes an algorithm for reducing the number of knots in the common knot vector. The approximation surface to the cross-sections is represented by a set of by cubic B-spline surfaces. This method provides a smooth surface model, yet realizes efficient data reduction. close 122...|$|E
