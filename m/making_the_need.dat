500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with many}} critics praising {{the return of}} Mac and the increased role of peripheral characters, the resolution to the rape mystery, and the setup of the next major story arc. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "great". He wrote that [...] "Spit & Eggs" [...] was a welcome episode for longtime fans, as it involved several plots converging {{in a way that}} he found satisfactory. He praised the final few scenes, writing that the episode transitions well into the next mystery of Dean O'Dell's death by developing it slowly {{over the course of the}} season's prior episodes, but he was more mixed towards the reveal of Mercer as the rapist, commenting [...] "the ultimate revelation can't help but be a little underwhelming, since not enough time has been spent on any of the credible suspects to really have a good handle on them or be invested in them one way or another." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, who was quite critical of the rape storyline in earlier episodes, said that the conclusion made the storyline slightly better overall. He praised the double reveal of Mercer and Moe as accomplices, stating, [...] "That twist overall is effective because it plays on everyone's expectations. The characters all believe there is a single culprit here. [...] It makes the revelations more plausible, while also <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for those revelations less intense (the two are related)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{artillery}} {{had been}} firing {{in defense of}} Mary Ann since soon after the first word of the attack reached brigade headquarters, it was 0325 before the first air assets appeared overhead. A Night Hawk helicopter from D Troop, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry (accompanied by a chase ship intended to drop flares and rescue the Night Hawk crew if there were problems) came on station and began engaging targets on the southeast slope of the hill. Forced to break station to refuel, the pilot (Captain Norman Hayes) learned that the additional gunships and medevac helicopters he'd requested when he came on station above Mary Ann had yet to launch from the airstrip at Chu Lai. Communications failures left both brigade and division headquarters believing that Mary Ann was only being shelled by mortars, <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for air support appear less critical. While Hayes was refueling, only his chase ship (a UH-1 from Company A, 123rd Aviation Battalion) was airborne over the base. They provided what fire support they could using door guns and grenades, and before breaking station to refuel they landed at the VIP pad and picked up [...] "six or seven" [...] {{of the most critical}} casualties and evacuated them to Chu Lai.|$|E

These dimensions, standards adopted for military use, were insufficient for any commercial use. Forestry had become the main economic activity in this region, and from 1867, local business people demanded that the government carry out improvements to the network because the original canal network had become outdated. In 1870 the Canals Commission recommended making the Ottawa River deeper between Lachine and Ottawa.
