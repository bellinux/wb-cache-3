Requires <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>liability</b> {{insurance}} {{be issued}} and rates set solely on basis of insured 2 ̆ 7 s driving record and vehicle type. Prohibits rates based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, age, marital status, or geographical location. Prohibits insurance company charging {{more than its}} lowest rate as of January 1, 1985. Permits raising rates annually upon Insurance Commissioner approval after proof by substantial evidence at public hearing that increases correspond to increased costs. If insurance companies refuse to issue policies, requires state establish a state owned and operated insurance program funded from premiums paid. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Rolling back insurance rates to January 1, 1985, for each category of driver and type of vehicle would reduce state insurance tax revenues by about 37 million in 1987. Requiring an insurer to charge its lowest rate would reduce tax revenue by an additional unknown but substantial amount. The ongoing revenue effect would depend upon the magnitude of future rate increases granted by Insurance Commissioner. The Insurance Commissioner would incur ongoing annual administrative costs of several million dollars to hold public hearings and review and approve rate increases. If state is required to establish and operate its own insurance program, the start-up costs could require the state to advance in excess of 100 million. It is unknown when these advances would be repaid. There could be additional annual state revenue loss...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{investigation into the}} relationship between fund mobilization by insurance companies and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in Nigeria and specifically how the latter responds to stimuli emanating from the insurance companies. A five variable-predictor multivariate regression model was estimated and analyzed. The short run results reveal that four explanatory variables namely: premium from fire, accidents, <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> and employee <b>liabilities</b> insurance policies positively and insignificantly correlate with Gross Fixed Capital Formation while the relationship between premium from marine insurance policies and GFCF is both negative and insignificant. In the long run, the fund mobilization variables by insurance companies positively and significantly impact on the growth of gross fixed capital formation. In addition, the Granger causality test provides no evidence of causality among the variables. The paper therefore recommends the formulation and implementation of policy measures that will increase insurance penetration, improve insurance fund mobilization and enlarge the insurance market in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|In 1989 and 1990, the {{expansion}} of the private insurance sector fell short of overall economic growth. For {{the first time in the}} eighties premium revenues rose less fast than nominal GDP. The tax reform of 1989 and the high level of interest rates let life insurance premium yields even decline in 1990. The loss ratio in the health insurance business hit its lowest level in six years in 1989, but rebounded thereafter. The <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>liability</b> insurance recorded higher premium revenues, concentrated however on the top brackets. Premium level differentials are currently too low as to induce substantial shifts in market shares from high- to low-premium insurers.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{trends in}} the development of the commercial insurance market in Poland and in Lithuania over the last decade. The insurance market changed in the 2002 - 2011 period. Those changes can be seen in various fields of commercial insurance. Data on the number of insurers, total premiums written, and the trends in claim payments and claim ratios were used to perform a market trend analysis. It should be emphasized that Poland experienced the results of the financial crisis in the insurance market later than Lithuania, which is visible in specific ratios under analysis. In Lithuania, in terms of insurance expenditures, non-life insurance products are definitely more popular, while in Poland life insurance plays the most important role. Poles buy most life insurance from group 1, and Lithuanians from group 3.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the popularization of motor vehicles and legal system construction, our daily lives become more convenient. But traffic accidents also have brought pain and heavy economic burden to the public. As the first compulsory insurance in China, the {{third party liability insurance}} aims at protect the injured in traffic accident sufficiently. In the recent years, however, the loss of the third party liability compulsory insurance of motor vehicle has aroused the concern of the whole society. Combining with our actual situation, this paper studies this insurance system in order to help to find out the deep causes of losses. Making a profit instead of suffering a loss has an important impact on the health of the insurance companies and the financial industry. Compared to the commercial insurance, the third party liability insurance of motor vehicle needs more improvement. According to the existing data and the foreign insurance operation experience, the paper analyzes the third party liability compulsory insurance of motor vehicle practicality through the comparative analysis. There are three parts to the causal analysis of the operating loss: insurance fraud, premium rate evaluation mechanism and the business model. At last, the paper gives some reasonable suggestions to make the compulsory <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>liability</b> insurance act better...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrically}} driven bicycle {{is equipped}} with an auxiliary-engine that is switched on when a certain pedalling power is applied. The legal position {{of this type of}} bicycle in the Netherlands is, at this moment in time, dual. According to the Road Traffic Act, it is a `normal' bicycle for which the behavioural rules for cyclists apply. According to the Dutch <b>Motor</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Liability</b> Law, however, it is a bicycle with an auxiliary-engine and, just like light mopeds, insurance is obligatory. Many are of the opinion, however, that the electrically assisted bicycle is more like a bicycle than a light moped. The insurance obligation therefore makes purchasing this bicycle type more difficult, whereas it is a environmentally friendly means of transport. The Ministry of Justice maintains that the electrically assisted bicycle can be exempted from insurance, if it appears that riding this bicycle type presents no extra danger to the other road users than an ordinary bicycle. In this study, the accident risk of electrically assisted bicycles both for the riders themselves and for other road users was estimated. In addition, the influence of these bicycles on the accident risk of the whole category of lightly-motorised two-wheelers was dealt with in a qualitative sense...|$|E
40|$|Commissioned by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, SWOV made a {{study of}} the road safety {{consequences}} of allowing the Segway Personal Transporter on public roads. This {{was the result of the}} Minister of Transport's promise to Parliament to investigate the matter. The study consisted of six parts: 1. studying the available literature; 2. carrying out a field test in a closed area; 3. reviewing the Segway for meeting Sustainable Safety principles; 4. making an inventory of relevant rules and regulations in the Netherlands and abroad; 5. making an inventory of opinions and ideas of relevant organizations; 6. estimating the road safety of the Segway. We conclude from the review for meeting the Sustainable Safety principles that a decrease in safety may be the result of an increase in vehicle types, especially if different rules apply. For reasons of recognizability and predictability, the number of vehicle types should be as limited as possible in sustainably safe traffic. Road safety calculations also lead us to conclude that we can expect a higher injury risk if the Segway was to be allowed in pedestrian areas. This is especially the case for the collision opponent in a crash. On the other hand, we do not expect a higher risk if they are allowed on cycle tracks and streets, provided the traffic and operating rules of the Segway are simple and known to all road users. The injury risk of the Segway can be compared with that of the bicycle. We advise not classifying the Segway as a handicapped vehicle. Furthermore we recommend that potential Segway riders be obliged to undergo a training, and to consider a minimum age of 16 or 18 years old. The Segway should be equipped with a bell, lights, and reflectors; and it should be insured according to the Third Party <b>Motor</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Liability</b> Act. We do not yet recommend compulsory crash helmet wearing. If the Segway is allowed on the cycle path and road, the Segway rider should have the status of driver and not that of pedestrian because priority regulations, for example, would then apply...|$|E
40|$|Solvency II project places {{emphasis}} on the modelling and management of risks of the insurance companies. This requires further improvement in actuarial methods and their application in insurance practice. Improving the quality of premium calculation methods is an effective factor in reducing the insurance technical risk of an insurer. Presentation the methods of premium calculation and its permanent updating is {{the aim of this}} article. Credibility theory is an experience rating technique to determine premiums, claim frequencies or claim sizes. Credibility models are based on the realistic concept of a heterogeneous insurance portfolio. Therefore, two sources of information are used in the calculation of the credibility estimators for the individual risk: typically little knowledge about the individual risk and quite extensive statistical information about entire portfolio. The most important model in the credibility theory is Bühlmann-Straub model. This model has a wide range of possibilities to be used in praxis mainly in general insurance. Besides that this model is a basis for other more specific models such as hierarchical, multidimensional or regression credibility models. In this article we deal with generalisation of one-dimensional Bühlmann-Straub credibility model to the multidimensional credibility model. We mainly focus on estimation of so-called structural parameters and usage of SAS Enterprise Guide application when estimating. The multidimensional Bühlmann-Straub credibility model is applied based the real data in <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> third party <b>liability</b> insurance...|$|R
