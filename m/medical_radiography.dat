25|$|Hard X-rays can {{traverse}} relatively thick objects {{without being}} much absorbed or scattered. For this reason, X-rays {{are widely used}} to image the inside of visually opaque objects. The most often seen applications are in <b>medical</b> <b>radiography</b> and airport security scanners, but similar techniques are also important in industry (e.g. industrial radiography and industrial CT scanning) and research (e.g. small animal CT). The penetration depth varies with several orders of magnitude over the X-ray spectrum. This allows the photon energy to be adjusted for the application so as to give sufficient transmission through the object {{and at the same}} time provide good contrast in the image.|$|E
25|$|X-rays {{with high}} photon {{energies}} (above 5–10 keV, below 0.2–0.1nm wavelength) are called hard X-rays, while those with lower energy are called soft X-rays. Due to their penetrating ability, hard X-rays {{are widely used}} to image the inside of objects, e.g., in <b>medical</b> <b>radiography</b> and airport security. The term X-ray is metonymically {{used to refer to}} a radiographic image produced using this method, in addition to the method itself. Since the wavelengths of hard X-rays are similar to the size of atoms they are also useful for determining crystal structures by X-ray crystallography. By contrast, soft X-rays are easily absorbed in air; the attenuation length of 600 eV (~2nm) X-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.|$|E
500|$|Equally {{important}} {{advances have}} occurred in [...] non-invasive techniques for examining the interior structures of the body. X-rays can be passed through the body and used in <b>medical</b> <b>radiography</b> and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and ultrasound imaging have all enabled examination of internal structures, living or dead, in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCanny's edge {{detection}} algorithm is a classical and robust method for {{edge detection}} in gray-scale images. The two significant {{features of this}} method are introduction of NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) and double thresholding of the gradient image.

In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm based {{on the concept of}} type- 2 fuzzy sets to handle uncertainties that automatically selects the threshold values needed to segment the gradient image using classical Canny's edge detection algorithm. The results show that our algorithm works significantly well on different benchmark images as well as <b>medical</b> images (hand <b>radiography</b> images) ...|$|R
