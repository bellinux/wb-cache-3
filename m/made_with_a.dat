5|$|All trips <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> SmarTrip card, {{with the}} {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E
5|$|Big Painting No. 6 (sometimes Big Painting or Big Painting VI) is a 1965 oil and Magna {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein.

5|$|In May 1914, Carl Larsson resumed {{the work}} on the {{painting}} on his own initiative. During 1915, he presented a painted sketch (№ 239), which was largely consistent with the previous painting. The king had been remade based on an oil painting (№ 240) that Larsson had <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> male model named Rydberg in 1914. The king's position was more pathetically composed and expressive and it agreed more with the change of emphasis that had taken place during the evolution of the work after Larsson's decision that the sacrifice was voluntary.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{sandwich}} was <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plain bun; however, that changed {{when the company}} switched to a sesame-seeded bun around 1970. In 1985, {{the weight of the}} Whopper was increased to , while the bun was replaced by a Kaiser roll. This was part of a program to improve the product and featured a US$30 million (approx US$66 million in 2014) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit. The goal of the program was to help differentiate the company and its products from those of its competitors. The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985. The Whopper sandwich's Kaiser roll was changed back into a sesame seed bun in 1994, eliminating the last trace of {{the sandwich}}'s 1985 reconfiguration.|$|E

Critics reacted positively to the episode, and David received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.|$|E

L7 recorded the album as a trio formed by founding members Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner, and longtime drummer Demetra Plakas, following the departure of bassist Gail Greenwood. It was <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low budget and produced by the band and their friend Brian Haught.|$|E
5|$|The 1945 Japan–Washington {{flight was}} a record-breaking air voyage made by three {{specially}} modified Boeing B-29 Superfortresses on September 18–19, 1945, {{from the northern}} Japanese island of Hokkaidō to Chicago in the Midwestern United States, continuing to Washington, D.C. The flight was made by three United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) generals and other airmen returning to the United States from their overseas duty after World War II. At that date, it involved the heaviest load carried by an American aircraft (144,000lb, 65,300kg), the longest nonstop flight made by the USAAF (5,840mi, 9,400km), and the first nonstop flight from Japan to the United States <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> complete aircraft.

5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team included director Takumi Nakazawa, {{writer and}} planner Kotaro Uchikoshi, character designer Yuu Takigawa, and composer Takeshi Abo.

A remake, simply titled Ever 17, {{was developed by}} 5pb. and Cyberfront for Xbox 360 in 2011, with the original's 2D sprites replaced by 3D models; this change was done as 3D models were seen as being easier to animate.

5|$|The first talkies {{shown in}} the Indies, Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man (both 1929), came from the United States and were {{screened}} in late 1929.

The comedy, <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single system camera that Krugers had obtained {{with the help of}} his Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers membership, is generally thought the first locally produced talkie released in the country, but had poor technical quality. It was a critical failure, as the majority Sundanese audience felt that they were being insulted; contemporary director Joshua Wong suggested that this poor reception was partly owing to the main character eating a frog, something which is forbidden for Muslims.|$|E
