5|$|During the French <b>Mandate</b> <b>and</b> {{under the}} {{parliamentary}} régime in Syria, there were reserved seats {{for the various}} religious communities, like in Lebanon, including for Armenians. This system is unofficially still living. Even when they didn't take part as such in elections, Armenian parties such as Dashnak exerted an influence on them.|$|E

Despite then-president of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was no objection to the revised mandate, the Human Rights Council never voted to revise the <b>mandate,</b> <b>and</b> resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—a {{private health insurance}} employer mandate, federalization of Medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973. In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer <b>mandate</b> <b>and</b> replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all, with income-based premiums and cost sharing.|$|E
5|$|Several {{insurers}} and actuary groups cited uncertainty created by President Trump, specifically non-enforcement {{of the individual}} <b>mandate</b> <b>and</b> not funding cost sharing reduction subsidies, as contributing 20-30 percentage points to premium increases for the 2018 plan year on the ACA exchanges. In other words, absent Trump's actions against the ACA, premium increases would have averaged 10% or less, rather than the estimated 28-40% under the uncertainty his actions created.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mandate</b> <b>and</b> {{the limits}} on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they get sick. In such a situation, insurers would have to raise their premiums to cover the relatively sicker and thus more expensive policies, which could create a vicious cycle in which {{more and more people}} drop their coverage.|$|E

5|$|In January 1936, Syrian {{nationalist}} sentiments became incensed as the French authorities suspended {{parliament and}} appointed the pro-French president Taj al-Din al-Hasani. Following {{the arrest of}} some nationalist leaders, a general strike was declared against the French <b>Mandate</b> <b>and</b> President al-Hasani. Speeches denouncing the arrests and colonialism were made at the Umayyad Mosque, after which demonstrators, including students and local youths, gathered at al-Bakri's home where they coordinated a march to the Serail (French government headquarters). The protests were led by al-Bakri, al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey, but they were confronted by the security forces before leaving al-Bakri's street.|$|E
5|$|The British were {{formally}} {{awarded the}} mandate {{to govern the}} region in 1922. The non-Jewish Palestinians revolted in 1920, 1929, and 1936. In 1947, following World War II and The Holocaust, the British Government announced its desire to terminate the <b>Mandate,</b> <b>and</b> the United Nations General Assembly adopted in November 1947 a Resolution 181(II) recommending partition into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the proposal, but the Arab Higher Committee rejected it; a civil war began immediately after the Resolution's adoption. The State of Israel was declared in May 1948.|$|E
5|$|After Hergé had redrawn The Black Island for {{publication}} in the United Kingdom, his British publishers at that time, Methuen, suggested that alterations be made to Land of Black Gold before releasing it into the UK market. In the original versions Tintin arrived in British-occupied Palestine, where he was arrested by British police before being captured by the Zionist paramilitary organization Irgun, who mistake him for {{one of their own}} agents. In this revised version Tintin arrives in Khemed, where he is arrested by the Arab military police before being captured and taken to Bab El Ehr. The inclusion of forces from the British Palestinian <b>Mandate</b> <b>and</b> the Irgun were no longer seen as relevant and so were removed from the story. Background detail was changed accordingly, with Jewish shop fronts with Hebrew signage being removed. A number of characters were also dropped, including the British officers Thorpe and Lieutenant Edwards. Whereas earlier versions had contained fictional Arabic script, for the 1971 version this was corrected to real Arabic.|$|E

5|$|Despite Bricius's earlier appeal, it was {{not until}} Andreas de Moravia's episcopate that Pope Honorius III issued his bull on 10 April 1224 authorising his legates Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop of Caithness, Robert, Abbot of Kinloss and Henry, Dean of Ross to examine the {{suitability}} of transferring the cathedra to Elgin. The Bishop of Caithness and the Dean of Ross performed the translation ceremony on 19 July 1224. On 10 July, Alexander II (Alaxandair mac Uilliam) had agreed to the transference in an edict that referred to his having given the land previously for this purpose. The land grant predated the Papal <b>mandate</b> <b>and</b> there is evidence that building had started in around 1215.Construction of the cathedral was completed after 1242. Chronicler John of Fordun recorded without explanation that in 1270 the cathedral church and the canons' houses had burned down. The cathedral was rebuilt in a larger and grander style to form the greater part of the structure that is now visible, work that is supposed to have been completed by the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296. Although Edward I of England took an army to Elgin in 1296 and again in 1303, the cathedral was left unscathed, as it was by his grandson Edward III during his assault on Moray in 1336.|$|E
5|$|More than 9.2 {{million people}} {{signed up for}} care on the {{national}} exchange (healthcare.gov) for 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump, who pulled advertising encouraging people {{to sign up for}} coverage, issued an executive order that attempts to eliminate the <b>mandate,</b> <b>and</b> has created significant uncertainty {{about the future of the}} ACA. Enrollments had been running ahead of 2016 prior to President Obama leaving office, with 9.8 million expected to sign-up, so President Trump's actions potentially cost about 600,000 national enrollments (i.e., 9.8 million expected − 9.2 million actual = 0.6 million impact). Of the 9.2 million, 3.0 million were new customers and 6.2 million were returning. The 9.2 million excludes the 11 states that run their own exchanges, which have signed up around 3 million additional people. These figures also exclude the additional coverage due to the Medicaid expansion, which covers another approximately 10 million persons, as described in the impact section above.|$|E
