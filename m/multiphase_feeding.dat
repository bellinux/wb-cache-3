40|$|Broilers are {{traditionally}} managed with feeding programs that often consist {{of three or}} four phases. In this study we investigated whether a <b>multiphase</b> <b>feeding</b> program (14 phases) of broilers based on the optimal mix of two feeds could replace a traditional four phase system while maintaining broiler performance. To evaluate this prposed program we measured variables of performance, carcass yield, and nitrogen excretion. In addition, we determined if the <b>multiphase</b> <b>feeding</b> program (14 phases) would be equally effective regardless of bird gender. A total of 480 day-old Cobb chicks were used, with an average weight of 44. 74 &# 177; 0. 16 g (females) and 44. 71 &# 177; 0. 11 g (males). The birds were distributed in a completely randomized 2 &# 215; 2 factorial design. Each treatment consisted of six replicates with 20 animals per experimental unit. Results were analyzed separately in two periods (1 &# 8211; 21 and 22 &# 8211; 42 days) as determined by slaughter date, {{as well as for the}} entire growth period (1 &# 8211; 42 days). The multiphase program led to improvements in final body weight and average daily weight gain, in addition to an increase in breast yield...|$|E
40|$|Nutritional {{problems}} of every category of pigs {{are presented in}} this paper. Nutrition of pigs is in constant changes adapting to the improvements of genetics potential {{as well as to}} the very severe ecological demands. As far as piglets just weaned are concerned, the nutrition problem is solved by means of adequate mixture with additives so that performance at this stage is remarkably increased. Nutritional {{problems of}} pregnant and lactating sows are analyzed. In pregnancy it is attempted to involve in practice cheap mixtures low in concentration of nutrients, while the needs of lactating animals are constantly increasing. As for fattening animals, a significant improvement is expected in the period to come if a <b>multiphase</b> <b>feeding</b> system is applied. At the same time such a system gives an opportunity to use rationally liquid by-products of the food processing industry with the maximum adaptive possibilities to the needs of pigs...|$|E
40|$|Feed-use (FU) amino acids, at {{constant}} performance, make {{it possible}} to reduce the protein content of pig feeds and nitrogen excretion by the animals. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the environmental impact of pig production in a conventional farm by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) according to several scenarios of FU amino acid incorporation. Two modalities of waste management (slurry or solid manure), two hypotheses of protein sources (soybean meal only, or soybean meal, rapeseed meal and pea) and two soybean origins (Centre-West Brazil vs. average Brazilian soybean) were considered. In each scenario investigated, gestating, lactating, pre-starter and starter feeds were formulated. Fattening pigs were fed either with only one feed (1 P), or with two feeds (2 P) or according to <b>multiphase</b> <b>feeding</b> (MP). In three scenarios, feeds were least-cost formulated: without incorporation of FU amino acids (NoAA), with FU amino acid incorporation and reduced protein content (LowCP), and FU amino acid incorporation with free protein content (Min€). In the fourth scenario (MinCP), feeds were formulated to minimize protein content. The average protein content of pig feeds decreased, from 190 g/kg in 1 P-NoAA down to 123 g/kg in MP-MinCP while FU amino acid incorporation increased. At the same time, the incorporation of soybean meal into feeds decreased from 197 kg/t down to 70 kg/t in MP-MinCP. This reduction of soybean meal incorporation was concomitant with a decrease in feed cost. The incorporation of FU amino acids in low protein diets clearly reduced the impacts of pig production on Climate Change (CC), Acidification (AC) and Eutrophication (EU). The lowest CC, AC and EU potential impacts were reached with the Min€ or MinCP scenarios, for which tryptophan and valine were incorporated in pig feeds. The impacts on terrestrial ecotoxicity, cumulative energy demand and land occupation were less sensitive to the studied scenarios. The combination of FU amino acid incorporation and <b>multiphase</b> <b>feeding</b> of growing-finishing pigs produced the largest reduction of CC, AC and EU impacts. The underlying mechanisms include the substitution of soybean meal and extruded soybean by cereals and FU amino acids and the reduction of nitrogen excretion which further reduces nitrous oxide and ammonia emissions. This study suggests that environmental impacts of pig production in France can be further reduced through feeding practices, especially for acidification, eutrophication and climate change...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop the design {{requirement}} with current regulatory and contemporary HSE practices, for a typical sour oil/gas production facility, a hypothetical case of about 3 mol % v/v H 2 S in gas and 300 ppm w/w H 2 S in oil, of <b>multiphase</b> <b>feed</b> stream, has been studied through the dispersion modeling for the conceptual stage. The findings indicated credible downwind lethal / semi lethal threat distance up to 300 meters. The conclusions of the H 2 S toxic risk assessment combined with the inherent safe design guidelines have yielded an entirely new set of requirement for the risk reduction. To start with it was realized that safe distance control room should be constructed and facilities should be designed for the remote operation, utilizing the new trends of foundation field bus, electronic marshaling and SIL- 3 fiber optic sensors. The facility should be access controlled with mandatory PPE requirement of personal H 2 S monitors and personal quick donning (5 sec) escape SCABA (15 minutes capacity). The centrifugal compressors should be new generation design of enclosed and hermetically sealed type, levitated with magnetic bearing, without dry gas seals and oil lubrication. The vessels should be ASME Section VIII ``lethal service'' design and plant piping should be as per fluid category ``M'' of ASME B 31. 3 chapter VIII. Furthermore, stress relieving for thicknesses as low as 10 mm, rather than ASME B 31. 3 code specified > 19 mm would be required. Small valves 4 '' sizes should be of forged steel instead of cast steel. The export oil/gas pipelines and flow lines should be designed for = 50 ~ 60 % of SMYS. Plate instead of Shell and Tube Exchangers. Adequate margins between vessels design and operating pressures to avoid PSV chattering. The PSV's to have acoustic monitoring. The facilities should be designed free of valve pits and internal corrosion monitoring pits...|$|R
40|$|A virtual {{population}} of 2000 pigs {{was used to}} simulate the effect of feeding strategy on the average performance and variability of the population, and on N output {{depending on the context}} of feed priees. The evolution of the average digestible lysine requirement of females was used to design a biphase strategy, combined with feed restriction or ad libitum <b>feeding.</b> <b>Multiphase</b> strategies were also tested in ad libitum conditions, with lysine levels ranging from - 10 % to + 35 % around the average requirement of females (FlOO}. Performance was simulated individually using lnraPorc® up to an average (population) final body weight of 115 kg. Nitrogen excretion and economie results were calculated in five different contexts of feed priees (2005 / 06 to 2009 / 10 }, with or without limitations on the dietary crude protein content. Results indicated that the lysine supply should be 30 % above F 100 to maximize growth. However, when multiphase strategies above F 100 are used, N excretion is increased. The best economie AA supply depends on the context of feed priees and limitation on the dietary formulation. A precision feeding technique, with tailored feed supply to individual pigs, allows for an improved margin per pig and a reduced N output. With a biphase strategy, simulations indicate that feed restriction allows for a reduction in variation in final body weight, increased margin and reduced N excretion...|$|R
40|$|Optimization {{of feeding}} {{strategies}} (S) {{is an effective}} option to reduce {{the environmental impacts of}} livestock. Itcan be performed, by using multi-objective feed formulation (MOF) to select feedstuffs according to their priceand environmental impacts, and by adapting dietary composition to animal requirements during the rearing period. This study investigates the combination of those feeding strategies on the environmental impacts of pig (P) and broiler (B) productions. Different S for conventional farms were specified in B and for fattening period in P. In P, the S were: 2 -phases feeding (S 1); <b>multiphase</b> <b>feeding</b> with two (S 2) or four (S 3) pre-diets, mixed together in different proportions during time; and 2 -phases feeding with a reduction of energy (S 4) or amino acid (S 5) content. In B, the S were: 3 -phases feeding (S 6) and 3 -phases feeding with lysine and energy contents respectively increased and decreased (S 7). For each S, feeds were formulated using least-cost optimization (LC) and MOF. The environmental impacts of the kg of BW at farm gate were assessed by Life Cycle Assessment and compared to the reference scenarios: LC-S 1 and LC-S 6 for P and B, respectively. S with LC formulation showed impacts between - 19 % and + 13 % compared to the reference impacts. MOF reduced impacts per kg of feed by up to 30 %, and final impacts per kg of BW by 1 to 20 %, except for Acidification and Climate Change (S 4), and for Land Occupation (S 7). Three criteria explain these contrasted results among S and LCA impacts at the kg of BW scale. The first one is the contribution of feed to impacts per kg of BW (34 % to 98 %). The second one is feed conversion ratio as it reflects the overall efficiency of the system, and thus impacts nutrient excretion and manure gas emission. The last one is nutritional balance of feed (protein, amino acids composition), explaining nitrogen excretion (S 2, S 3). This study underlines the need for optimizing S while considering simultaneously the consequences on economics and environmental performances at animal scale...|$|E
