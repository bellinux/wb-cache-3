The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System-Maintenance Extension taxonomy (HFACS-ME), an effective framework for classifying and analyzing the presence of <b>maintenance</b> <b>errors</b> that lead to mishaps, incidents, and personal injuries, is the theoretical foundation. An existing desktop mishap application is updated, a prototype web-based model is developed and an Asynchronous Distributed Learning (ADL) module is conceptualized.

40|$|<b>Maintenance</b> <b>errors</b> {{are known}} to be a key cause of {{aviation}} mishaps and the search for their causes is now given high priority in the aviation industry. In parallel with the search for causes, research efforts are also focusing on the ways in which various background factors link together to influence safety outcomes. The present study set out to validate a structural model wherein psychological strain is depicted as a major contributor to <b>maintenance</b> <b>errors</b> through the direct influence of strain on <b>maintenance</b> <b>errors</b> and also via its role as a mediator of the effects of safety climate on <b>errors.</b> The <b>Maintenance</b> Environment Survey (MES: Fogarty, 2004) was administered to 150 personnel responsible for maintenance of a large military helicopter fleet. Structural equation modeling was then used to test the fit of the mediation model. The findings support claims that the effect of safety climate on errors is at least partially mediated by individual level factors, such as psychological strain. In our efforts to secure better safety outcomes, we should therefore maintain a dual focus on organizational and individual level variables. Regular administration of safety climate and psychological health surveys can help to achieve this aim...|$|R
40|$|A three-pronged {{approach}} was adopted {{to the investigation}} of causes of <b>maintenance</b> <b>errors</b> in army aviation.

Interviews with maintenance technicians, on the other hand, put the spotlight on organisational variables, such as pressures created by poor planning. In the third phase, a survey instrument administered to 448 maintenance workers was used to develop a structural model that predicted 34 % of the variance in psychological health, 16 % of the variance in turnover intentions, and 16 % of the variance in self-reported <b>maintenance</b> <b>errors.</b> Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>errors</b> {{that occur}} in {{aircraft}} maintenance systems have a formidable impact on the safety and reliability of air transportation. Evaluation of the aircraft maintenance system requires {{an analysis of the}} maintenance processes in use. The systematic evaluation of data collected on the aviation maintenance process can provide management with feedback on the performance of the airline and consequently provide proactive support of the decision-making process prior to the dispatch of the aircraft. Recognizing that surveillance, auditing and airworthiness directives form {{a significant portion of the}} quality assurance function of an airline, it is critical that data be collected on these processes. Significant efforts have been made to investigate and track inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>errors.</b> Although valuable in terms of their contributions to the identification of the performance-shaping factors that lead to <b>maintenance</b> <b>errors,</b> these efforts have tended to be reactive in nature. Surveillance has a more practical bearing on the maintenance of aircraft.

5000|$|On 21 May 2009 a T-38 Talon {{from the}} test pilot school on a {{training}} flight crashed 12 {{miles north of}} Edwards AFB, killing the student pilot Major Mark Paul Graziano and severely injuring the student navigator Major Lee Vincent Jones. An accident investigation determined that the crash was caused when the aircraft's rudder operating mechanism disconnected the flight controls from the rudder actuators and caused the rudder to deflect 30 degrees to the left. This induced an uncontrollable yaw and a resulting roll, causing the aircraft to depart controlled flight, a condition that is unrecoverable in the T-38. The report stated that contributing factors to the crash were a structural fatigue failure or structural break in a critical component or bolt, and a <b>maintenance</b> <b>error</b> in which a nut or cotter pin did not properly secure a bolt connecting two critical components. Citing two historical cases of rudder failure, the report concluded that <b>maintenance</b> <b>error</b> was the more likely cause.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate and refine a safety information management system that will facilitate data collection, organization, query, analysis and reporting of <b>maintenance</b> <b>errors</b> that contribute to Naval Aviation mishaps, equipment damage and personnel injury using OPNAV 3750. 6 R, Human Factors Analysis and Classification System Maintenance Extension taxonomy. The target audience for this information management system tool included safety personnel, mishap investigators, Aircraft Mishap Board (AMB) members, and analysts. A review of three areas was needed to refine the prototype tool: (1) the collection, use and management of accident information, (2) human error theories as related to aviation mishaps and (3) the design of an effective mishap database tool. A usability study was conducted using potential end-users.
