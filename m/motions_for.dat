5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|An astronomical text {{recovered}} from Tomb no.3 in Mawangdui contains images {{and descriptions of}} 29 different comets. The descriptions often include the comet's name, notes about its apparition, and its associated portent, usually military, but lack detailed dates of the comets' sightings. This text can be solidly dated as being prior to 168 BC, the date assigned to the tomb. It {{may be associated with}} a similar astronomical text from the same tomb, which details planetary <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> the seventy years ending 177 BC.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "slow motion" [...] of {{the title}} is the {{movement}} of a woman's body, with the lyrics proclaiming: [...] "Uh, I like it like that / She working that back; I don't know how to act / Slow <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> me, slow <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> me / Slow <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> me; move it slow <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> me".|$|R
50|$|The Heisenberg {{equations}} of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> this operator reproduces {{the equation}} of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> the field.|$|R
25|$|The plaintiff's <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> {{preliminary}} injunction was granted, and the defendant's cross <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> {{summary judgment}} was denied.|$|R
5|$|Judge Kevin McNulty {{heard the}} case on remand. After {{considering}} the parties' <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> summary judgment again, he ruled in the city's favor in 2014. Heffernan, he ruled, had not engaged in any protected speech or expressive conduct. Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected, per Ambrose v. Robinson Township, a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association. He decided that Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission, {{a case in which}} the Sixth Circuit had held that the First Amendment reached perceived political association, was not a precedent he could rely on since Dye itself explicitly rejected Ambrose, and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.|$|E
5|$|Playable {{starting}} officers include Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, and Guan Yu for the Shu Kingdom; Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, and Cao Cao for the Wei Kingdom; and Sun Shang Xiang, Huang Gai, and Sun Jian for the Wu Kingdom. It {{is possible}} to unlock new characters from other kingdoms as well as use a player created character {{in any of the}} campaigns. The new 'Edit Mode' allows players to create an officer from sets of different features, motions, and weapons to use in 'Kaiba Mode.' The characters stance and motion are affected by their gender and the weapon the player has selected them to carry and use. The <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> the weapons are taken from pre-existing officers as well as from two characters removed from Dynasty Warriors 4 that were in Dynasty Warriors 3: Fu Xi and Nu Wa. Some characters are unlocked by fulfilling optional side-goals; most are unlocked by completing certain battles during gameplay. The maximum number of playable characters is 42, 46 with created characters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Motions</b> <b>for</b> {{leave to}} bring in bills by private Members.|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} court denied the summary of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> infringement and granted Netgear's summary of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> non-infringement.|$|R
50|$|The plaintiff's <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> {{preliminary}} injunction was granted, and the defendant's cross <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> {{summary judgment}} was denied.|$|R
50|$|Plaintiffs filed a <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> summary {{judgment}} on June 8, 2011, seeking {{to enforce the}} injunction against HB 260 on a permanent basis. The State of Utah responded on July 29, 2011 with a combined brief opposing plaintiff's <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> {{summary judgment}}, and supporting its own <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> summary judgment and <b>motion</b> to dismiss <b>for</b> lack of standing.|$|R
25|$|Depending on the situation, motions {{could be}} renewed, or made again. On the other hand, members should not use {{legitimate}} <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> dilatory and improper purposes to waste time.|$|E
25|$|Given the quasi-steady orbital {{properties}} (instantaneous position, {{velocity and}} time) {{of a group}} of celestial bodies, predict their interactive forces; and consequently, predict their true orbital <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> all future times.|$|E
25|$|No {{trial was}} {{actually}} held. After all witnesses had been deposed, Judge Michael M. Mihm considered <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> summary judgement, granting {{them for the}} defense. Churchill appealed, and won a reversal.|$|E
50|$|Since {{there are}} four (independent) {{constants}} of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> degrees of freedom the equations of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> a test particle in Kerr spacetime are integrable.|$|R
50|$|On November 23, 2008, Drew filed a <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> acquittal. On August 28, 2009, U.S. District Judge George H. Wu {{formally}} granted Drew's <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> acquittal, overturning the jury's guilty verdict.|$|R
40|$|Spin {{components}} {{have been}} explicitly included in an accurate analytical approach {{for the study}} of coherent structures in many-body systems. Equations of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> annihilators and creators are transformed into non-linear equations of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> a spin-dependent quantum field. It is demonstrated, using commutation relations for the quantum field operators, that spin-up, psi+, and spin-down, psi-, fields may be decoupled. The equation of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> psi+ is shown to have a form identical to the equation of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> psi+ which, in turn, is equivalent to that for a field with no specific spin component. The latter equations have the same form for both bosons and fermions...|$|R
25|$|The {{classical}} physical {{problem can}} be informally stated as: given the quasi-steady orbital properties (instantaneous position, velocity and time) {{of a group of}} celestial bodies, predict their interactive forces; and consequently, predict their true orbital <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> all future times.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Bono {{was added}} to the House Judiciary Committee by the Republican {{leadership}} in anticipation of the consideration of impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, thus becoming the only Republican woman on the committee. Bono voted along party lines on all four <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> impeachment in both the committee and on the House floor, despite other moderate Republican House members voting against Articles II, III, and IV.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 2008, {{the three}} {{opposition}} leaders signed an accord that {{laid down the}} basis for an agreement on a coalition government. The proposed structure would be a coalition between the Liberals and the NDP, with the New Democrats getting six Cabinet positions. Both parties agreed to continue the coalition until June 30, 2011. The Bloc Québécois would not be formally {{part of the government}} but would provide support on confidence <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> 18 months.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{equation}} of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> a frictionless fluid (the Euler equations) and taking the curl, one arrives at {{the equation of}} <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> the curl of the fluid velocity, that is to say, the vorticity.|$|R
40|$|We study {{integrals}} of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> Hirota bilinear {{difference equation}} that is satisfied by the eigenvalues of the transfer-matrix. The combinations of the eigenvalues of the transfer-matrix are found, which are integrals of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> integrable discrete {{models for the}} $A_{k- 1 }$ algebra with zero and quasiperiodic boundary conditions. Discrete analogues of the equations of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> the Bullough-Dodd model and non-Abelian generalization of Liouville model are obtained. Comment: 20 page...|$|R
5000|$|On March 28, 2008 the {{defendants}} won a legal victory when their <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> partial summary judgment was granted, and the plaintiffs' <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> summary judgment was denied. [...] On August 8, 2008, Judge Otero entered summary judgment against plaintiff ACSI.|$|R
25|$|The Democrats {{claimed that}} the change was illegal, and that {{therefore}} Malcolm Smith was still the Majority Leader and Temporary President. According to Smith and other Democrats, Senator Neil Breslin had accepted a motion to adjourn, and therefore ended the session before the Republicans voted to change leadership. Republican Senator Libous argues that since his original motion was on the floor, the session {{could not have been}} adjourned. Furthermore, like all motions, <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> adjournment require a vote, which never took place before Breslin adjourned the session.|$|E
25|$|The {{case was}} then {{assigned}} to Judge David Andrew Pine, who heard the steel companies' <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> a preliminary injunction. From a tactical perspective, both sides {{focused on the}} wrong issues: In its papers, the government stressed the ultimate constitutional issue of whether the President {{had the power to}} seize the mills; the steel companies appeared to be shying away from that issue by focusing on the equities and asking the Court merely to enjoin the federal government from entering into a collective bargaining agreement with the Steelworkers.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{information}} in Sims v. State seemed to suggest the possibility of causing great bodily harm, Hill filed, on December 15, 2005, a petition for postconviction relief {{in the state of}} Florida and requested an evidentiary hearing to investigate whether or not the state’s lethal injection death penalty did, in fact, cause bodily harm. The Circuit Court for Escambia County denied Hill’s <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> postconviction relief and for an evidentiary hearing. Hill then appealed to the Florida Supreme Court on January 3, 2006. On January 17, 2006, Florida’s High Court affirmed.|$|E
50|$|On August 22, 2013, the Taguig city {{government}} filed a <b>Motion</b> <b>for</b> Reconsideration before the Court of Appeals's Sixth Division affirming its claim on Fort Bonifacio. With {{the filing of}} the said <b>Motion</b> <b>for</b> Reconsideration, Taguig's jurisdiction forces itself over Fort Bonifacio. According to Taguig's legal department, jurisprudence and the rules of procedure in the country's justice system all say that the filing of a <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> reconsideration suspends the execution of a decision {{and puts it in}} limbo.|$|R
50|$|In orbits around planets {{or other}} bodies, the sail is {{oriented}} so that its force vector has a component along the velocity vector, either {{in the direction of}} <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> an outward spiral, or against the direction of <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> an inward spiral.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Motion</b> <b>for</b> Reconsideration was {{reassigned to}} Judge Harold E. Kahn, and {{continued}} to September 25, then October 3, then 22, and then 24, 2012. The case was reassigned to Judge Karnow who ruled against the <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> reconsideration in October 2012.|$|R
25|$|Following Judge Hawkins' {{denial of}} the <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> new trial, {{attorney}} George W. Chamlee filed an appeal and was granted a stay of execution. Chamlee was joined by Communist Party attorney Joseph Brodsky and ILD attorney Irving Schwab. The defense team argued that their clients had not had adequate representation, had insufficient time for counsel to prepare their cases, had their juries intimidated by the crowd, and finally, that it was unconstitutional for blacks to have been excluded from the jury. In the question of procedural errors, the state Supreme Court found none.|$|E
25|$|For the battle, they {{recorded}} 450 <b>motions</b> <b>for</b> the MASSIVE digital horses (though {{deaths were}} animated), and {{also had to}} deal with late additions in the film, such as Trolls bursting through Minas Tirith's gates as well as the creatures that pull Grond to the gate, and redoing a shot of two mûmakil Éomer takes down that had originally taken six months in two days. On a similar note of digital creatures, Shelob's head sculpture was scanned by a Canadian company for 10 times more detail than Weta had previously been able to capture.|$|E
25|$|New England almanacs were {{compiled}} by young Harvard graduates who used {{them as a}} vehicle for popular essays on Copernican astronomy. This included, Zachariah Brigden from Connecticut, who wrote about the revolution of the six planets around the sun, the four satellites around Jupiter and the two satellites around Saturn in The New England Almanack of the Coelestial <b>Motions</b> <b>for</b> this Present Year of the Christian AEra 1659. Brigden had access to English almanac-maker and astronomer Vincent Wing’s 1656 Astronomia Instraurata. Wing was the first to put the discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kelper into English. He published astronomical tables that made predicting eclipses more accessible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} a long-range version of self-avoiding walk in dimension d> 2 (α ∧ 2), where d denotes dimension and α the power-law decay exponent of the coupling function. Under appropriate scaling we prove convergence to Brownian <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> α ≥ 2, and to α-stable Lévy <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> α < 2. This complements results by Slade (1988), who proves convergence to Brownian <b>motion</b> <b>for</b> nearest-neighbor self-avoiding walk in high dimension. MSC 2000. 82 B 41. Keywords and phrases.
