50|$|Of all {{the women}} surveyed, 35% did not own any {{property}} and of that 35%, 49% experienced physical violence while 84% experienced psychological violence. The amount of violence was significantly lower in households where women owned land or property. According to this particular study, women's access to land and property ownership {{reduces the risk of}} spousal abuse by enhancing the livelihood of women as well as providing an escape route and means for survival if abuse begins. In many developing countries, where <b>marital</b> <b>violence</b> is prominent, barriers such as unequal laws and social and administrative bias keep women from owning land and property. A vast number of women are left out of owning immovable property (land or house) furthering their likelihood of experiencing <b>marital</b> <b>violence.</b> (Chowdhry). It can also be argued that land rights greatly shape an individuals relationship with nature and the environment.|$|E
50|$|Land {{ownership}} opportunities {{also have}} a critical impact on human development with freedom from violence. According to a 2005 study of <b>marital</b> <b>violence</b> and property ownership, 49% of propertyless women experience physical violence and 84% experienced psychological abuse. Ownership rights saw a drastic decrease in violence. Among women who owned both land and house there was only 7% physical violence and 16% psychological abuse.|$|E

5000|$|The American Psychiatric Association {{planning}} and research committees for the forthcoming DSM-5 (2013) have canvassed a series of new Relational disorders which include Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence or Marital Abuse Disorder (Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence). Couples with marital disorders sometimes come to clinical attention because the couple recognize long-standing dissatisfaction with their marriage {{and come to the}} clinician on their own initiative or are referred by an astute health care professional. Secondly, there is serious violence in the marriage which is -"usually the husband battering the wife". In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority often is the first to notify the clinician. Most importantly, <b>marital</b> <b>violence</b> [...] "is a major risk factor for serious injury and even death and women in violent marriages are at much greater risk of being seriously injured or killed (National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women 2000)." [...] The authors of this study add that [...] "There is current considerable controversy over whether male-to-female <b>marital</b> <b>violence</b> is best regarded as a reflection of male psychopathology and control or whether there is an empirical base and clinical utility for conceptualizing these patterns as relational." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "World wide, {{physical}} violence by husbands against wives {{is estimated to}} range between 10% and 50% (p824)". [...] It is difficult to pinpoint the causes of <b>marital</b> <b>violence</b> but economic dependence is widely acknowledged {{as one of the}} main sources. Land or property ownership provides women who may be experiencing <b>marital</b> <b>violence</b> with a credible exit option. Land ownership creates a means of production of both income and power. A study performed in Kerala, India examined the effects of property status and the likelihood of violence against women. Close to 500 women were surveyed about a number of happenings in the household such as the amount of longterm and current violence that occurred, women's ownership of the land or house, and other sociodemographic characteristics. The violence that occurs can be physical, such as hitting or kicking or psychological, such as threats or belittlement. Long-term violence, or violence that had been occurring throughout the entirety of the marriage, was experienced by 41% of women in rural households, while 27% of urban household women reported violence in various forms. Current violence, or violence occurring within 12 months of the time of survey was experienced by 29% in a physical capacity and 49% experienced psychological violence.|$|E

40|$|The {{responses}} of a nationally {{representative sample of}} 1, 000 parents to a survey concerning parent attitudes, disciplinary practices, and other predictors of competent parenting were analyzed. Cluster analysis identified three subgroups based on their profiles of parenting attitudes and discipline. The first was high on physical discipline, neglect, verbal abuse, and at-titudes that devalue children. They reported childhood abuse and domestic <b>violence,</b> <b>marital</b> difficulty, and problems man-aging anger. The second group was high on nonphysical {{as well as physical}} discipline, and had a more positive attitude toward children but also had a profile of psychosocial risk. The third group had low scores on all disciplinary practices, low perceived disciplinary efficacy, and a healthy marital and per-sonal history. These groups are different from traditional par-enting typologies, and the findings confirm theoretical predictions concerning the correlates of parenting problems and raise new questions concerning the convergence of physi-cally punitive with nonpunitive discipline practices. What characteristics distinguish parents who have difficulties with child management? Because of the relevance of this question to child abuse prevention, there has been considerable research devoted to un-derstanding the characteristics that identify parents who are at risk of harming their offspring (see Gelles, 1997; Straus, Gelles, & Steinmetz, 1980; Wolfe, McMa-hon, & Peters, 1997). Based on current conceptualiza-tions of parenting, research has focused on influences from the parent’s personal history (such as experienc-ing abuse as a child or witnessing domestic <b>violence),</b> <b>marital</b> conflict, self-perceptions of inadequacy or inef-ficacy as a parent, difficulties in emotion management, social isolation, and characteristics of the child (such as age or temperamental difficulty) as contributors to par-enting problems (for reviews, see Maccoby & Martin...|$|R

Using the Conflict Tactics Scale to measure domestic violence between husbands and wives, the study found that, as in the United States, all three variables are correlated with domestic <b>violence.</b> <b>Marital</b> power and conflict in particular were strongly correlated, with violent, e. Because a male dominant marital power structure was highly correlated with husband-to-wife violence, the study concludes that all possible efforts must be made to encourage and induce the formation of egalitarian marital organization, which is negatively correlated with violence.

50|$|In jurisdictions {{adopting}} the 'no-fault' principle regarding whether to grant a divorce, some courts may still {{take into account}} the fault of the parties when determining some aspects of the content of the divorce decree, e.g., its terms for the division of property and debts and the existence and, if applicable, the amount of spousal support. Provisions related to child custody are determined using a different fundamental standard, that of the child's or children's best interests; while some behaviors that may constitute <b>marital</b> fault (e.g., <b>violence,</b> cruelty, endangerment, neglect, or substance abuse) may also qualify as factors to be considered when determining child custody, they do so for the independent reason that they provide evidence as to what arrangement is in the child's or children's best interests going forward.|$|R
40|$|Connections: Relationships and Marriage ” {{is one of}} {{a number}} of high school {{marriage}} education curricula designed to teach students to develop healthy relationships and marriages. This study evaluates the effectiveness of this curriculum with 375 students from rural Midwest high schools who were in either the Connections group or in another Family and Consumer Sciences course. Findings suggest that students taking the Connections curriculum improved in their conflict resolution skills, became less likely to see divorce as a good option for troubled marriages, and were more likely to take advantage of pre-marital and post-marital programs to build better marriages. Implications and recommendations for Family and Consumer Sciences Educators are discussed. Marital distress (with or without divorce) negatively affects children, adults, and the community. Marital distress alone has been linked to manifestations of stress in children including: internalizing and externalizing behavior problems (Buehler et al., 1998); conduct disorders (Coie et al., 1991); poor academic performance, low self-esteem (Goldberg, 1993); youth crimes including theft, robbery, violence, gambling, and sexual crimes (Hooper, 1985); social and emotional disturbance in school (Mattison, Morales, & Bauer, 1992); and teen suicide (McClure, 1988; Nelson, Farberow, & Litman, 1988).
