60|$|Whene'er I buckle on <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> And foot it gaily in the track, O {{pleasant}} gauger, {{long since}} dead, I hear you fluting on ahead.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} nobody came at {{the border}} village to examine <b>my</b> <b>pack,</b> I passed through unchallenged. All was quiet and lifeless and hopeless, with big stretches of heavy land.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were only}} just in time," [...] {{he said after}} a moment or two. [...] "There was snow across the crack and it broke under me. Couldn't crawl out, with <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> {{dragging}} me down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Professor; I have <b>my</b> <b>packing</b> {{still to}} do. I have already bade Miss Grey adieu. In two months I shall see you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{coming home}} from the Court a good deal fatigued, I took a nap in <b>my</b> easy-chair, then <b>packed</b> <b>my</b> books, and {{committed}} the refuse to Jock Stevenson-- ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is known}} that Joanna {{was not a good}} mother. She did not do the things that Martin most needed, such as [...] "Making <b>my</b> <b>packed</b> lunches" [...] and [...] "Making that Incredible Hulk costume for Halloween". Joanna also {{purposely}} makes it difficult for him to locate his father, Donald Twat. This was done by changing Martin's surname and moving away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Youngster, even a silver-tip--thet's {{a grizzly}} bear--will make tracks {{away from a}} cougar. I lent <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> of hounds to a pard over near Springer. If I had them we'd put thet cougar up a tree in no time." ...|$|E
60|$|LIGHT as the linnet {{on my way}} I start, For all <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> I bear a {{chartered}} heart. Forth on {{the world}} without a guide or chart, Content to know, through all man's varying fates, The eternal woman by the wayside waits.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{provisions}} in <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> {{and you might}} lay out supper, but I don't think we'll make a fire to-night," [...] he said. [...] "I'll be back in about half an hour; I {{want to see what}} lies beyond the top of yonder ridge." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{rang the}} bell, and {{directed}} <b>my</b> servant to <b>pack</b> <b>my</b> portmanteau, and {{to send out}} for a railway guide. Mr. Bruff asked, in astonishment, what I was going to do.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is known}} that Joanna was not really a good mother. She did not {{do the things that}} Martin most needed, such as [...] "Making <b>my</b> <b>packed</b> lunches" [...] and [...] "Making that Incredible Hulk costume for Halloween". Joanna has also tried to make it hard for him to locate his father, Donald Twatt. This was done by {{changing}} Martin's surname and moving away.|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[In {{the same}} tone.] <b>My</b> bag's <b>packed</b> and I got my ticket. I'll go to New York to-morrow.|$|R
60|$|Although {{unwilling to}} put off more time, I threw down <b>my</b> <b>pack,</b> and untying it, {{displayed}} my leopard skin. The shout of delight and surprise which {{the sight of it}} drew from the negroes was so enthusiastic that I at once perceived I was considered to have secured a great prize.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I do not by {{any means}} deserve such a reputation," [...] said I, refastening <b>my</b> <b>pack,</b> [...] "for the shot was entirely accidental; so I pray you, good sir, to let the negroes know that, as I have no desire to go under a false flag, as my friend Peterkin would say--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is enough," [...] said Wayland, {{assuming}} {{an air of}} resolution. [...] "I will thwart {{that old}} villain's projects; my affright at his baleful aspect begins to abate, and my hatred to arise. Help me on with <b>my</b> <b>pack,</b> good mine host.--And look to thyself, old Albumazar; there is a malignant influence in thy horoscope, and it gleams from the constellation Ursa Major." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{shouldered}} <b>my</b> own <b>pack</b> and set off, {{through the}} {{bridge over the}} Rhine, and up the hill opposite.|$|R
50|$|Eating {{so little}} wasn't {{good for my}} health. For six months <b>my</b> periods <b>packed</b> up completely, {{a sure sign of}} starvation.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] Duncombe said, smiling. [...] "We had {{a little}} spill, and I've lost <b>my</b> bag. <b>Pack</b> me some more things quickly." ...|$|R
60|$|When I awoke {{next morning}} the priests were gone. So I took up <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> and pursued my journey alone, and walking slowly came at sunset to the distant lamasery. At its door an ancient figure, wrapped in a tattered cloak, was sitting, engaged {{apparently}} in contemplation of the skies. It was our old friend Kou-en. Adjusting his horn spectacles on his nose he looked at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what it is, Miss," [...] said Bob, quickly, exhibiting a {{singularly}} broad {{specimen of}} that {{difference between the}} man and the monkey. [...] "It tells i' measuring out the flannel, you see. I carry flannel, 'cause it's light for <b>my</b> <b>pack,</b> an' it's dear stuff, you see, so a big thumb tells. I clap my thumb at the end o' the yard and cut o' the hither side of it, and the old women aren't up to't." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ending, then, as I began them, [...] Closing thus {{and thus}} completing, [...] I fold up <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> of ballads, [...] Roll them closely in a bundle, [...] Lay them safely in the storeroom, [...] In the strong bone-castle's chamber, [...] That they never thence be stolen, [...] Never in all time be lost thence, [...] Though the castle's wall be broken, [...] Though the bones be rent asunder, [...] Though the teeth may be pried open, [...] And the tongue {{be set in}} motion.|$|E
6000|$|February 26.--Sent off ten pages this morning, with a revise; we spy land, {{but how to}} get <b>my</b> {{catastrophe}} <b>packed</b> {{into the}} compass allotted for it-- ...|$|R
60|$|I {{opened the}} bag and packed the boots in; and then, just as I was going to close it, a horrible idea {{occurred}} to me. Had I <b>packed</b> <b>my</b> tooth-brush? I don’t know how it is, but I never do know whether I’ve <b>packed</b> <b>my</b> tooth-brush.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘My dear Helena, no. Travel like a pilgrim, with {{wallet and}} staff. My wallet—or <b>my</b> knapsack—is <b>packed,</b> {{and ready for}} {{strapping}} on; and here is my staff!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Happen you'd like Mumps for company, Miss," [...] he {{said when}} he had taken the baby again. [...] "He's rare company, Mumps is; he knows iverything, an' makes no bother about it. If I tell him, he'll lie before you an' watch you, as still,--just as he watches <b>my</b> <b>pack.</b> You'd better let me leave him a bit; he'll get fond on you. Lors, it's a fine thing to hev a dumb brute fond on you; it'll stick to you, an' make no jaw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are brave young things," [...] {{she said}} at parting. [...] "I only wish I were going with you, <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> upon my back. You're {{perfectly}} glorious, the pair of you. If ever I can do anything for you, just let me know. You're bound to succeed, and I want a hand in it myself. Let me know how that government land turns out, though I warn you I haven't much faith in its feasibility. It's sure to be {{too far away from}} markets." ...|$|E
60|$|Here I found a {{long and}} crowded {{thoroughfare}} with gabled houses on either side in which all kinds of trades were carried on. Down this I wandered, being cursed at more than once because <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> mare, growing frightened, dragged {{away from me and}} crossed the path of carts which had to stop till I could pull her free. After the third of these tangles I halted {{by the side of the}} footway behind a wain with barrels on it, and looked about me bewildered.|$|E
60|$|On Sunday evening my handbag {{stood in}} <b>my</b> room <b>packed,</b> ready for <b>my</b> departure. Dick Blair {{came over to}} see me and brought strange and sad news.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose not. If I can {{get down}} to prayers after having all <b>my</b> things <b>packed</b> up, it will {{be as much as}} I can do." ...|$|R
5000|$|I <b>packed</b> <b>my</b> bag is a car game. One person says [...] "I <b>packed</b> <b>my</b> bag {{and in it}} I put...", {{followed}} by any object they like in the traditional version of the game. The next person then says [...] "I <b>packed</b> <b>my</b> bag and in it I put...", {{followed by}} the original suggestion, and adding their own. A player is disqualified if they forget one of the previously occurring items or {{can not think of}} a new item to add to the bag. The game continues until all but the winner has been disqualified.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is always}} a sense of effort for me," [...] he said, [...] "when I leave {{the world at the}} outset of the journey. I turn back again and again, and look at the little office as I go up my {{mountain}} side. The first day and night I'm a little disposed to shirk the job--every year it's the same--a little disposed, for example, to sling <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> from my back, and sit down, and go through its contents, and make sure I've got all my equipment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You speak true there, mum," [...] said Bob. [...] "My pack isn't for ladies like you. The time's gone by for that. Bargains {{picked up}} dirt cheap! A bit o' damage here an' there, {{as can be}} cut out, or else niver seen i' the wearin', but not fit to offer to rich folks as can pay for the look o' things as nobody sees. I'm not the man as 'ud offer t' open <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> to you, mum; no, no; I'm a imperent chap, as you say,--these times makes folks imperent,--but I'm {{not up to the}} mark o' that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She looked sick to me. You shouldn't be {{too hard}} on a sick woman, but she ought to send her girl away or get out. As you say, the Fork is no kind of a place for such a girl. If I had a son, a fine young feller like that girl is, do you suppose I'd let him load himself up with an old soak like me? No, sir; Lize {{has no right to}} spoil that girl's life. I'm nothing but a ham-strung old cow-puncher, but I've too much pride to saddle <b>my</b> <b>pack</b> on the {{shoulders}} of my son the way Lize seems to be doin' with that girl." ...|$|E
60|$|I rather pride {{myself on}} <b>my</b> <b>packing.</b> Packing {{is one of}} those many things that I feel I know more about than any other person living. (It surprises me myself, sometimes, how many of these {{subjects}} there are.) I impressed the fact upon George and Harris, and told them that they had better leave the whole matter entirely to me. They fell into the suggestion with a readiness that had something uncanny about it. George put on a pipe and spread himself over the easy-chair, and Harris cocked his legs on the table and lit a cigar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Out of <b>my</b> last <b>pack</b> I {{opened up}} a half gross of hand-mirrors, with solid tinfoil backs, and passed 'em around among the ladies. That was the first {{introduction}} of looking-glasses among the Peche Indians.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{go back to}} papa very soon," [...] she had said, [...] "as soon, indeed, as I {{can have}} <b>my</b> things <b>packed</b> up after the funeral. I have already written to papa to say so." ...|$|R
