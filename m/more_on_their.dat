5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies {{and went on}} to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|E
5|$|The book's eight {{chapters}} address prominent themes affecting slave children, including education, leisure, religion, {{transitions to}} freedmen, and work expectations. Due {{to a lack}} of historical sources direct from children, the book focuses <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> socialization and stories of survival than their internal perspectives. King's evidence includes slave narratives, ex-slave interviews collected by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), plantation owner diaries, census records, newspapers, autobiographies, missionary reports, and Freedmen's Bureau records. She contrasts Northern and Southern slave life, as well as their ownership by whites, blacks, and Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|It {{resulted}} in an overwhelming victory for the right, with the CEDA and the Radicals together winning 219 seats. Although the political situation was complicated, parties of the right won around 3,365,700 votes, parties of the centre 2,051,500 votes, and parties of the left 3,118,000 according to one estimate. Turnout was around 8,535,200 votes, 67.5% of the electorate. The right had spent far <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> election campaign than the Socialists, who campaigned alone. Women, in their first election, mainly voted for the centre-right. The Communist Party, with perhaps 3,000 members, were at this point not significant. Nationalist Basques won twelve of seventeen Basque seats, a considerable victory. Keeping their promise, the CNT proclaimed a revolution. There were many reasons the Socialists and Republicans lost out; the female vote alone cannot explain the shift. Among them was the disunity of the political left compared to the right, {{in a system that}} favoured broad coalitions. The Radicals and their supporters had also shifted to the right. Abstentionalism hindered Socialist and Republican candidates. Overall, the political system in Spain had changed dramatically since the last election.|$|E

5|$|One {{theory that}} has been {{advanced}} is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death, which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in {{a shift in the}} world view of people in 14th-century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art. However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.|$|E

The game provides an alternate backstory for Nina and Anna; the plot concentrating <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> father and how he died when they were children. In this game it is revealed that Richard Williams had struggled with a few guardsmen, and shouted for Nina to grab a gun which one of guardsmen had dropped. However, her hesitation and fear caused the guards to get the upper hand and shoot Richard Williams, killing him. Anna is shown comforting her sister moments after, while the older Nina looks over the scene. The rivalry which stemmed from the incident crossed over to the real-time events of the Tekken series.|$|E

500|$|Kwee thought {{himself a}} realist, {{considering}} it [...] "better {{to say things}} as they are, than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth." [...] He was highly critical of contemporary writers who relied <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fantasies than logic and truth. [...] Hoping to keep his story grounded in reality, Kwee researched {{the history of the}} Baduy, the geological formation of Krakatoa, and the events of 1883 and 1928; in total he consulted 15 books, all in English or Dutch. Writing began on 19 March 1928 and was completed on 28 May of that year. Drama dari Krakatau consists of sixteen chapters, which were spread over 125 pages in the first printing.|$|E
500|$|Later critics de-emphasised the {{significance}} of the poems in Wordsworth's artistic development. Hunter Davies (b. 1936) concluded that their impact relies <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> popularity than importance to Wordsworth's poetic career. Davies went on to claim, [...] "The poems about Lucy are perhaps Wordsworth's best-known work which he did in Germany, along with 'Nutting' and the Matthew poems, but the most important work was the beginning of The Prelude" [...] (emphasis in original). Some critics emphasised the importance behind Lucy as a figure, including Geoffrey Hartman (b. 1929), when he claimed, [...] "It is in the Lucy poems that the notion of spirit of place, and particularly English spirit of place, reaches its purest form." [...] Writer and poet Meena Alexander (b. 1951) believed that the character of Lucy [...] "is the impossible object of the poet's desire, an iconic representation of the Romantic feminine." ...|$|E
500|$|Architectural {{research}} in the late 20th and early 21st centuries focused less on the military aspects of the fortifications, however, and <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> roles as luxurious palaces and symbols of royal power. Each of the castles {{was designed to be}} suitable to support the royal court, should it visit. In the late 13th century, this meant having several sets of private chambers, discreet service facilities and security arrangements, producing, in effect, a royal palace in miniature. Some of these survive largely intact; Conwy, for example, has what historian Jeremy Ashbee considers to be the [...] "best preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales", including a private garden {{for the use of the}} queen. When built, the castles would have been more colourful than today, in keeping with the fashions of the 13th century. At Conwy, for example, the walls were white-washed with a lime render, and the putlog holes in the walls may have been used to display painted shields called targes from the walls.|$|E
