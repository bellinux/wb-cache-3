500|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, the Western Australian Nomenclature Advisory Committee {{had been}} {{choosing}} directional {{names for the}} state's main arterial roads (such as Great Eastern Highway), while the South Australian Highways Department had been naming the major roads to other states after explorers (such as Flinders Highway, named after Matthew Flinders).

500|$|After new snap {{elections}} were called for 1997, Dar {{ran for a}} National Assembly seat and was successfully re-elected from Lahore NA-97 constituency by obtaining 61,556 votes as a candidate of PML (N). His party, PML-N, had won a clear majority in the National Assembly for the first time. That same year, Dar {{was inducted into the}} cabinet of Nawaz Sharif and was appointed as the <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Commerce</b> with the status of a federal minister. After Pakistan tested its nuclear weapons in May 1998, the world responded with heavy sanctions against Pakistan. The economy plummeted, so Dar was given the additional cabinet portfolio of Minister for Finance for the first time. He helped conclude negotiations for an International Monetary Fund rescue package to meet an economic crisis that had been triggered by the sanctions. Dar continued to serve in both cabinet positions until the 1999 Pakistani coup d'état, during which then-Chief of Army Staff, General Pervez Musharraf, overthrew Nawaz Sharif and his existing elected government. Dar spent nearly two years in jail under Musharraf over corruption charges that never went to trial. His tenure as Member of the National Assembly was also terminated after the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1999. Dar kept the PML-N alive during Musharraf's rule.|$|E
