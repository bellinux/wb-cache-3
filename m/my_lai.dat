25|$|Since Thompson made an {{official}} {{report of the}} civilian killings, he was interviewed by Colonel Oran Henderson, {{the commander of the}} 11th Infantry Brigade (the parent organization of the 20th Infantry). Concerned, senior American officers canceled similar planned operations by Task Force Barker against other villages (<b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> 5, <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> 1, etc.) in Quảng Ngãi Province.|$|E

25|$|On May 2, 1989, the British {{television}} station Yorkshire Television broadcast the documentary Four Hours in <b>My</b> <b>Lai,</b> directed by Kevin Sim, {{as part of}} the networked series First Tuesday. Using eyewitness statements from both Vietnamese and Americans, the programme revealed new evidence about the massacre. The program was subsequently aired by PBS in the United States on May 23 as Remember <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> (Frontline, Season 7).|$|E
25|$|COL Oran K. Henderson – 11th Infantry Brigade commander, {{who ordered}} {{the attack and}} flew in a {{helicopter}} over <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Lai</b> during it. After Hugh Thompson immediately reported multiple killings of civilians, Henderson started the cover-up by dismissing allegation about the massacre and reporting to the superiors that indeed 20 people from <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> died by accident. Was accused of alleged cover-up and false swearing by the Army; charges were dropped.|$|E
25|$|Independent investigative {{journalist}} Seymour Hersh, after extensive interviews with Calley, broke the <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Lai</b> story on November 12, 1969, on the Associated Press wire service; on November 20, Time, Life and Newsweek magazines all covered the story, and CBS televised {{an interview with}} Paul Meadlo, a soldier in Calley's unit during the massacre. The Plain Dealer (Cleveland, Ohio) published explicit photographs of dead villagers killed at <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Lai.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thompson made an {{official}} {{report of the}} killings and was interviewed by Colonel Oran Henderson, {{the commander of the}} 11th Infantry Brigade (the parent organization of the 20th Infantry). Concerned, senior Americal Division officers cancelled similar planned operations by Task Force Barker against other villages (<b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> 5, <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> 1, etc.) in Quảng Ngãi Province, possibly preventing the additional massacre of further hundreds, if not thousands, of Vietnamese civilians.|$|E
25|$|PFC Varnado Simpson – Rifleman; 2nd Platoon; {{admitted}} that he slew around 10 people in <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> on CPT Medina's orders to kill not only people, but even cats and dogs. He fired {{at a group of}} people where he allegedly saw a man with a weapon, but instead killed a woman with the baby. He committed suicide in 1997, after repeatedly acknowledging remorse for several murders in <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Lai.</b>|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, {{interviews}} and stories connected to <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> massacre started to appear {{regularly in the}} American and international press.|$|E
25|$|Thirty {{years after}} the fact all three men were {{decorated}} with the Soldier's Medal for their heroic actions at <b>My</b> <b>Lai.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{phone call}} on October 22, 1969, {{answered}} by freelance investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh, and his subsequent independent inquiry, broke {{the wall of}} silence that was surrounding the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> massacre. Hersh initially tried to sell the story to Life and Look magazines; both turned it down. Hersh {{then went to the}} small Washington-based Dispatch News Service, which sent it to fifty major American newspapers; thirty of them accepted it for publication. New York Times reporter Henry Kamm investigated further and found several <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> massacre survivors in South Vietnam. He estimated the number of killed civilians as 567. Next, Ben Cole published an article about Ronald Ridenhour, a helicopter gunner and an Army whistleblower, who was among the first started to uncover the truth about the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> massacre. Joseph Eszterhas of The Plain Dealer, who was a friend of Ronald Haeberle and knew about the photo evidence of the massacre, published the grisly images of the dead bodies of old men, women, and children on November 20, 1969. Time magazine's article on November 28, 1969 and in Life magazine on December 5, 1969, finally brought <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> to the fore of the public debate about Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|During the Tet Offensive of January1968, {{attacks were}} carried out in Quảng Ngãi by the 48th Local Force Battalion of the National Liberation Front(NLF), {{commonly}} referred to by the U.S. Army as the Viet Cong. U.S. military intelligence assumed that the 48th NLF Battalion, having retreated and dispersed, was taking refuge {{in the village of}} Sơn Mỹ, in Quảng Ngãi Province. A number of specific hamlets within that village—designated <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> (1) through <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> (6) — were suspected of harboring the 48th.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 1969, Colburn {{testified to}} the investigative Peers Commission on {{what he had seen}} on March 16, 1968 in <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> (4).|$|E

25|$|The 1971 {{documentary}} Interviews with <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> Veterans won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, Short Subjects. In it, five American soldiers {{discussed their}} participation in the massacres.|$|E
25|$|Several {{spectacular}} {{incidents of}} terror {{stand out in}} VC/NVA operations, although these were not publicized in the Western media {{to the extent of}} the American-perpetrated <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> Massacre.|$|E
25|$|Some {{have argued}} that the outcome of the <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Lai</b> courts-martial failed to uphold the laws of war {{established}} in the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals. For example, Telford Taylor, senior American prosecutor at Nuremberg, wrote that legal principles established at the war crimes trials could have been used to prosecute senior American military commanders for failing to prevent atrocities such as the one at <b>My</b> <b>Lai.</b> The Secretary of the Army Howard Callaway was quoted in The New York Times as stating that Calley's sentence was reduced because Calley honestly believed that what he did was a part of his orders—a rationale that contradicts the standards set at Nuremberg and Tokyo, where following orders was not a defense for committing war crimes. On the whole, other than the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> courts-martial, there were thirty six military trials held by the U.S. Army from January 1965 to August 1973 for crimes against civilians in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|MG Samuel W. Koster – {{commander}} of the 23rd Infantry Division (United States) of the United States Army, known as the Americal Division, was not involved with planning the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> search-and-destroy mission. However, during the operation he flew over <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> and monitored the radio communications. Afterward, Koster did not follow up with the 11th Brigade commander COL Henderson on the initial investigation, and later {{was involved in the}} cover-up. Was charged by the Army with failure to obey lawful regulations, dereliction of duty, and alleged cover-up; charges dropped. Later was demoted to brigadier general and stripped of a Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

25|$|On December 10, 2010, Italian {{producer}} Gianni Paolucci {{released a}} movie entitled <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> Four, directed by Paolo Bertola, starring American actor Beau Ballinger as Calley, and {{adapted from the}} Pulitzer Prize–winning book by Seymour Hersh.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence Manley Colburn (July 6, 1949 – December 13, 2016) was a United States Army veteran who, {{while serving}} as a {{helicopter}} gunner in the Vietnam War, intervened in the March 16, 1968 <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> Massacre.|$|E
25|$|Altogether, 14 {{officers}} {{directly and}} indirectly involved with the operation, including two generals, were investigated {{in connection with the}} <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> massacre, for except LTC Frank A. Barker, CPT Earl Michaels, and 2LT Stephen Brooks, who died before the beginning of the investigation.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Thompson {{testified against}} those {{responsible}} for the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> Massacre. Twenty-six officers and enlisted soldiers, including William Calley and Ernest Medina, were charged with criminal offenses, but all were either acquitted or pardoned. Thompson was condemned and ostracized by many individuals in the United States military and government, as well as the public, {{for his role in the}} investigations and trials concerning the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> massacre. As a direct result of what he experienced, Thompson suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, divorce, and severe nightmare disorder. Despite the adversity he faced, he remained in the United States Army until November 1, 1983, and continued to make a living as a helicopter pilot in the southeastern United States.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the killings}} {{occurred}} {{in the southern part}} of Tu Cung, a sub-hamlet of Xom Lang, which was a home to 700 residents. Xom Lang was erroneously marked on the U.S. military operational maps of Quảng Ngãi Province as <b>My</b> <b>Lai.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prompted by {{numerous}} investigations into war crimes {{such as the}} Russell Tribunal, National Veterans Inquiry and Citizens Commission of Inquiry (CCI), the Vietnam Veterans Against the War {{wanted to have a}} large scale public hearing. With the courts martial for the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> Massacre making front page news, and the recent disclosure by members of the Central Intelligence Agency's Phoenix Program of its record of human rights violations in Vietnam, the VVAW was determined to expose a broad pattern of war crimes in Vietnam. The Winter Soldier Investigation (WSI) was intended to prove that massacres like the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> massacre were not isolated and rare occurrences, but were instead the frequent and predictable result of official American war policy.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 2008, the BBC {{broadcast}} the documentary The <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> Tapes on Radio 4 and subsequently on the BBC World Service, in both English and Vietnamese, that used never-before-heard audio recordings of testimony taken at The Pentagon during the 1969–1970 Peers Inquiry.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} prompted global outrage when {{it became}} public knowledge in November 1969. The <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> massacre increased to some extent domestic opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War when the scope of killing and cover-up attempts were exposed. Initially, three U.S. servicemen {{who had tried to}} halt the massacre and rescue the hiding civilians were shunned, and even denounced as traitors by several U.S. Congressmen, including Mendel Rivers, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Only after thirty years were they recognized and decorated, one posthumously, by the U.S. Army for shielding non-combatants from harm in a war zone. Along with the No Gun Ri massacre in Korea eighteen years earlier, <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> was one of the largest single massacres of civilians by U.S. forces in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|CPT Eugene M. Kotouc – {{military}} intelligence officer assigned to Task Force Barker; he partially provided information, {{on which the}} <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Lai</b> combat assault was approved; together with Medina and a South Vietnamese officer, he interrogated, tortured and allegedly executed VC and NVA suspects later that day. Was charged with maiming and assault, tried by the jury and acquitted.|$|E
25|$|Hugh Clowers Thompson Jr. (April 15, 1943 – January 6, 2006) was a United States Army Captain, and {{formerly}} a warrant {{officer in the}} 123rd Aviation Battalion, 23rd Infantry Division, who {{played a major role}} in ending the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> Massacre in Sơn Mỹ Village, Sơn Tịnh District, Quảng Ngãi Province, South Vietnam, on March 16, 1968.|$|E
25|$|MAJ Frederic W. Watke - {{commander}} of Company B, 123rd Aviation Battalion, 23rd Infantry Division, providing helicopter support on March 16, 1968. Testified that he informed COL Henderson about killings of civilians in <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> {{as reported by}} helicopter pilots. He was accused of failure to obey lawful regulations and dereliction of duty; charges were dropped.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1998, Thompson and Colburn {{returned}} {{to the village of}} <b>My</b> <b>Lai,</b> where they met some of the villagers they rescued, including Thi Nhung and Pham Thi Nhanh, two women who {{had been part of the}} group that was about to be killed by Brooks' 2nd Platoon. They also dedicated a new elementary school for the children of the village.|$|E
25|$|PFC Michael Bernhardt – Rifleman; {{he dropped}} out of the University of Miami to {{volunteer}} for the Army. Bernhardt refused to kill civilians in <b>My</b> <b>Lai.</b> Later, Captain Ernest Medina threatened Bernhardt, trying to deter him from exposing the massacre. As a result, Bernhardt was given more dangerous assignments such as point duty on patrol. He would later be afflicted with a form of trench foot as a direct result. Bernhardt told Ronald Ridenhour, who was not present in <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> during the massacre, about the events, thus pushing him to continue his investigation. Later he would help expose and detail the massacre in numerous interviews with the press, and he served as a prosecution witness in the trial of Medina, where he was subjected to intense cross examination by defense counsel F. Lee Bailey backed by a team of attorneys including Gary Myers. Michael Bernhardt is a recipient of the New York Society for Ethical Culture's 1970 Ethical Humanist Award.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} McCarthy campaign, Hersh {{returned}} to journalism as a freelancer covering the Vietnam War. In 1969, Hersh received {{a tip from}} Geoffrey Cowan of The Village Voice regarding an Army lieutenant being court-martialled for killing civilians in Vietnam. His subsequent investigation, sold to the Dispatch News Service, was run in thirty-three newspapers and exposed the <b>My</b> <b>Lai</b> massacre, winning him the Pulitzer Prize in 1970.|$|E
