25|$|Bob Hawke, a less polarising Labor leader than Whitlam, {{defeated}} Fraser at the 1983 Election. The {{new government}} stopped the Franklin Dam project via the High Court of Australia. The 1980s saw severe concerns about Australia's future economic health take hold, with severe current account deficits and high unemployment at times. Hawke, together with treasurer Paul Keating undertook <b>micro-economic</b> and industrial relations reform {{designed to increase}} efficiency and competitiveness. After the initial failure of the Whitlam model and partial dismantling under Fraser, Hawke re-established a new, universal system of health insurance called Medicare. Hawke and Keating abandoned traditional Labor support for tariffs to protect industry and jobs. They moved to deregulate Australia’s financial system and ‘floated’ the Australian dollar. An agreement was reached with trade unions to moderate wage demands and accept more flexible working condition arrangements by accepting tax cuts in return. Ultimately, many of the reforms, continued by successive governments, {{appear to have been}} successful in pushing the economy along.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{business model}} of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats. [...] On the <b>micro-economic</b> level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution. [...] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry. [...] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats. [...] International Harvest Hat proposed {{to do the same}} thing for straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. [...] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. [...] In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.|$|E

[...] These works adopted some of the approaches of institutional economics and were less quantitative and more philosophical than some of the author's previous efforts. [...] He then branched out even further afield, writing about nuclear disarmament in 1963 and population economics in 1970.

[...] Financial accounting deals {{mainly in the}} preparation of financial statements while management accounting deals mainly in analysis of internal results. Managerial economics is a technical course that mainly focuses on product pricing as influenced by many <b>micro-economic</b> theories and principals, while the aggregate or macro-economics course deals with topics like the banking system, the money supply, and inflation. Operations Research and statistics are sometimes combined as [...] "Managerial Decision-Making" [...] or [...] "Quantitative Decision-Making"; organizational behavior and human resource management may similarly be combined. In many programs, applicants with appropriate background may be exempt from various of the analytical courses.|$|E

5000|$|Engineering economics, {{previously}} {{known as}} engineering economy, is {{a subset of}} economics concerned with the use and [...] "...application of economic principles" [...] {{in the analysis of}} engineering decisions. As a discipline, it is focused on the branch of economics known as microeconomics in that it studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources. Thus, it focuses on the decision making process, its context and environment. It is pragmatic by nature, integrating economic theory with engineering practice. [...] But, it is also a simplified application of <b>micro-economic</b> theory in that it avoids a number of <b>micro-economic</b> concepts such as price determination, competition and demand/supply. [...] As a discipline though, it is closely related to others such as statistics, mathematics and cost accounting. [...] It draws upon the logical framework of economics but adds to that the analytical power of mathematics and statistics. [...] Engineers seek solutions to problems, and the economic viability of each potential solution is normally considered along with the technical aspects.Fundamentally, engineering economics involves formulating, estimating, and evaluating the economic outcomes when alternatives to accomplish a defined purpose are available.|$|E
