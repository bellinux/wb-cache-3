40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that in a loaded {{structural}} member, redistribution of stresses occur near a discontinuity, thus increasing the induced stress value significantly over the nominal stress value. The paper presents an experimental study on existence of stress concentration in the vicinity of drill hole present in <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> of a leaf spring bundle. For the purpose of experimentation a leaf spring testing rig is set up and <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> of an automobile leaf spring is procured. To investigate the state of stress field produced in the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> spring, load-deflection behavior of the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> is first studied experimentally. Experimental stress concentration factors are obtained by mounting strain gauges at different locations, around the central drill hole of the <b>master</b> <b>leaf.</b> In corresponding theoretical analysis, the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> spring is modeled as a curved beam with a circular hole on its centre line subjected to combined bending and stretching. Theoretical and experimental stress concentration factors are reported in an appropriate form which will facilitate to undertake rigorous theoretical analysis of stress distribution around geometric discontinuities in beam under different loading conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental study on large deflection behavior of initially curved cantilever beams subjected to {{various types of}} loadings. The physical system as a straight cantilever beam subjected to a tip concentrated load is considered in this study. Nonlinear differential equations are obtained for large deflection analysis of such a straight cantilever beam, and this problem is known to involve geometrical nonlinearity. The equations are solved numerically {{with the help of}} MATLAB® computational platform to get deflection profiles of the concerned problem. These results are imposed subsequently on the center line of an initially curved beam to get theoretical load-deflection behavior of curved beam problems. To verify the theoretical model, experiment is carried out with the <b>master</b> <b>leaf</b> of a leaf spring bundle by modeling it as an initially curved cantilever beam. The effects of initial clamping and geometry variations in the eye-region are observed from experimental investigation which is commonly neglected in the mathematical formulation. Comparisons of the theoretical results with the experimental results are quite good, but the avenues for further improvement are also reported. The proposed approach is further extended to study large deflection behavior of an initially curved cantilever beam subjected to distributed and combined load. These results are successfully validated with existing results for straight beams and some new results are furnished for initially curved cantilever beams...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{black walnut}} in {{plantations}} can aggravate disease problems, especially leaf diseases. Factors {{that lead to}} infection and increased disease incidence and severity are high humidity (> 98 %), free moisture on leaves (rain, dew, fog, or from irrigation), low light intensity, and temperatures around 21 ° C. There are four common leaf diseases of black walnut, microstroma white mold, bull? s-eye leaf spot, mycosphaerella leaf spot, and walnut anthracnose. The most common and most serious of these is walnut anthracnose. All but microstroma white mold can cause premature leaf loss resulting in reduced growth, increased susceptibility to other diseases, and reduced {{quantity and quality of}} nuts. All of these fungal diseases have a similar biology. Primary infections occur in the spring, May through early June, from ascospores emerging from fruiting bodies on overwintered leaves on the ground. Once primary infection occurs, lesions appear on leaves within a couple of weeks. Subsequent secondary infections occur on leaves throughout the summer by wind-dispersed spores (conidia) produced in these lesions. Production of spores increases gradually during July and reaches maximum numbers in August. The infected, fallen leaves serve as the reservoir for next year? s inoculum, completing the annual life cycles of these fungi. Microstroma White Mold-Microstroma white mold (or downy leaf spot), caused by Micrcostroma juglandis, is more unsightly than damaging. This disease does not kill the leaf and is not known to cause defoliation. The effect to the tree is minimal, probably resulting in a minor reduction in photosynthesis. Symptoms are a yellowish discoloration on the upper surface of the leaf (fig. 1), and a whitish growth {{on the underside of the}} leaf, often concentrated along the veins (fig. 2). Bull’s-Eye <b>Leaf</b> Spot-Bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>leaf</b> spot (or zonate leaf spot), caused by Grovesinia pyramidalis (asexual state = Cristulariella moricola) causes leaf spots and premature defoliation.

Results show that Jatropha curcas L. seedlings has the higher resistance ability to drought-stress, it can survival in lower soil moisture (0. 3 θf), and has certain growth potential. Dry mass of every organ in plant shows that shoot＞branch and master rod＞leaf＞root＞petiole. Storage water capability of unit dry mass for every organ in plant shows that petiole＞branch and master rod or shoot＞leaf＞root. Compared to W 4 treatments, W 2 reduced irrigation water by 27. 1 %, mean leaf area of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 reduced by 25. 8 %, but root-shoot ratio increased by 6. 1 %, meanwhile, mean storage water capability of unit root, lateral branch and <b>master</b> rod, <b>leaf,</b> shoot and total plant dry mass of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 increased by 15. 4 %, 1. 3 %, 7. 4 %, 0. 6 % and 1. 8 %, respectively.

Genetic analysis indicated that the cultivated kakrol as completely isolated from both the wild kakrol species. The big fruited M. cochinchinensis is phylogenetically more different than M. dioica from cultivated kakrol. Both pre-and post-zygotic isolation has been indicated. However, cultivated kakrol and M. dioica proved to be isolated more by post-zygotic mechanisms. The hybrids could be recovered at a low rate which were sterile and failed to reproduce successfully. The cultivated kakrol this proposed a separate status. The name Momordica hybrida has been proposed as the cultivated kakrol has traits common to both the wild types, seemed to be an amphidiploid arising from M. dioica and M. cochinchinensis.

6000|$|The {{wonder of}} the book is its {{superior}} intelligence. In the menstruum of this man's wit, {{the past and the present}} ages, and their religions, politics, and modes of thinking, are dissolved into archetypes and ideas. What new mythologies sail through his head! The Greeks said, that Alexander went as far as Chaos; Goethe went, only the other day, as far; and one step farther he hazarded, and brought himself safe back. There is a heart-cheering freedom in his speculation. The immense horizon which journeys with us lends its majesties to trifles, and to matters of convenience and necessity, as to solemn and festal performances. He was the soul of his century. If that was learned, and had become, by population, compact organization, and drill of parts, one great Exploring Expedition, accumulating a glut of facts and fruits too fast for any hitherto-existing savants to classify, this man's mind had ample chambers for the distribution of all. He had a power to unite the detached atoms again by their own law. He has clothed our modern existence with poetry. Amid littleness and detail, he detected the Genius of life, the old cunning Proteus, nestling close beside us, and showed that the dullness and prose we ascribe to the age was only another of his masks:--"His very flight is presence in disguise:" [...] that he had put off a gay uniform for a fatigue dress, and was not a whit less vivacious or rich in Liverpool or the Hague, than once in Rome or Antioch. He sought him in public squares and main streets, in boulevards and hotels; and, in the solidest kingdom of routine and the senses, he showed the lurking daemonic power; that, in actions of routine, a thread of mythology and fable spins itself; and this, by tracing the pedigree of every usage and practice, every institution, utensil, and means, home to its origin in the structure of man. He had an extreme impatience of conjecture, and of rhetoric. [...] "I have guesses enough of my own; if a man write a book, let him set down only what he knows." [...] He writes in the plainest and lowest tone, omitting a great deal more than he writes, and putting ever a thing for a word. He has explained the distinction between the antique and the modern spirit and art. He has defined art, its scope and laws. He has said the best things about nature that ever were said. He treats nature as the old philosophers, as the seven wise masters did,--and, with whatever loss of French tabulation and dissection, poetry and humanity remain to us; and they have some doctorial skill. Eyes are better, on the whole, than telescopes or microscopes. He has contributed a key to many parts of nature, through the rare turn for unity and simplicity in his mind. Thus Goethe suggested the leading idea of modern botany, that a <b>leaf,</b> or the <b>eye</b> of a <b>leaf,</b> is the unit of botany, and that every part of the plant is only a transformed leaf to meet a new condition; and, by varying the conditions, a leaf may be converted into any other organ, and any other organ into a leaf. In like manner, in osteology, he assumed that one vertebra of the spine might be considered the unit of the skeleton; the head was only the uppermost vertebra transformed. [...] "The plant goes from knot to knot, closing, at last, with the flower and the seed. So the tape-worm, the caterpillar, goes from knot to knot, and closes with the head. Men and the higher animals are built up through the vertebrae, the powers being concentrated in the head." [...] In optics, again, he rejected the artificial theory of seven colors, and considered that every color was the mixture of light and darkness in new proportions. It is really of very little consequence what topic he writes upon. He sees at every pore, and has a certain gravitation toward truth. He will realize what you say. He hates to be trifled with, and to be made to say over again some old wife's fable, that has had possession of men's faith these thousand years. He may as well see if it is true as another. He sifts it. I am here, he would say, to be the measure and judge of these things. Why should I take them on trust? And, therefore, what he says of religion, of passion, of marriage, of manners, property, of paper money, of periods or beliefs, of omens, of luck, or whatever else, refuses to be forgotten.|$|R
6000|$|Singing [...] "in to herself" [...] as she went, {{her mind}} {{still in the}} turmoil of a glad confusion, she rose and tripped upstairs to a little loft, lighted by four panes in the gable, where she slept {{with one of her}} nieces. The niece, who {{followed}} her, presuming on [...] "Auntie's" [...] high spirits, was flounced out of the apartment with small ceremony, and retired, smarting and half tearful, to bury her woes in the byre among the hay. Still humming, Christina divested herself of her finery, and put her treasures one by one in her great green trunk. The last of these was the psalm-book; it was a fine piece, the gift of Mistress Clem, in distinct old-faced type, on paper that had begun to grow foxy in the warehouse--not by service--and she was used to wrap it in a handkerchief every Sunday after its period of service was over, and bury it end-wise at the head of her trunk. As she now took it in hand the book fell open where the leaf was torn, and she stood and gazed upon that evidence of her bygone discomposure. There returned again the vision of the two brown eyes staring at her, intent and bright, out of that dark corner of the kirk. The whole appearance and attitude, the smile, the suggested gesture of young Hermiston came before her in a flash {{at the sight of the}} torn page. [...] "I was surely fey!" [...] she said, echoing the words of Dandie, and at the suggested doom her high spirits deserted her. She flung herself prone upon the bed, and lay there, holding the psalm-book in her hands for hours, for the more part in a mere stupor of unconsenting pleasure and unreasoning fear. The fear was superstitious; there came up again and again in her memory Dandie's ill-omened words, and a hundred grisly and black tales out of the immediate neighbourhood read her a commentary on their force. The pleasure was never realised. You might say the joints of her body thought and remembered, and were gladdened, but her essential self, in the immediate theatre of consciousness, talked feverishly of something else, like a nervous person at a fire. The image that she most complacently dwelt on was that of Miss Christina in her character of the Fair Lass of Cauldstaneslap, carrying all before her in the straw-coloured frock, the violet mantle, and the yellow cobweb stockings. Archie's image, on the other hand, when it presented itself was never welcomed--far less welcomed with any ardour, and it was exposed at times to merciless criticism. In the long vague dialogues she held in her mind, often with imaginary, often with unrealised interlocutors, Archie, if he were referred to at all, came in for savage handling. He was described as [...] "looking like a stirk," [...] "staring like a caulf," [...] "a face like a ghaist's." [...] "Do you call that manners?" [...] she said; or, [...] "I soon put him in his place." [...] "'Miss Christina, if you please, Mr. Weir!' says I, and just flyped up my skirt tails." [...] With gabble like this she would entertain herself long whiles together, and then her eye would perhaps fall on the torn <b>leaf,</b> and the <b>eyes</b> of Archie would appear again from the darkness of the wall, and the voluble words deserted her, and she would lie still and stupid, and think upon nothing with devotion, and be sometimes raised by a quiet sigh. Had a doctor of medicine come into that loft, he would have diagnosed a healthy, well-developed, eminently vivacious lass lying on her face in a fit of the sulks; not one who had just contracted, or was just contracting, a mortal sickness of the mind which should yet carry her towards death and despair. Had it been a doctor of psychology, he might have been pardoned for divining in the girl a passion of childish vanity, self-love in excelsis, and no more. It is to be understood that I have been painting chaos and describing the inarticulate. Every lineament that appears is too precise, almost every word used too strong. Take a finger-post in the mountains on a day of rolling mists; I have but copied the names that appear upon the pointers, the names of definite and famous cities far distant, and now perhaps basking in sunshine; but Christina remained all these hours, as it were, at the foot of the post itself, not moving, and enveloped in mutable and blinding wreaths of haze.|$|R
