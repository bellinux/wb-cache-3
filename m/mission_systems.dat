5|$|Westland and IBM {{formed a}} {{consortium}} in 1991 {{to perform the}} helicopter's complex systems integration. The AW101 features a network of helicopter management and <b>mission</b> <b>systems</b> designed to reduce pilot workload and enable the helicopter to undertake {{a wide variety of}} missions. A digital automatic flight control system (AFCS) is employed by the AW101. The AFCS allows the operation of a four-axis (pitch, roll, yaw and collective) autopilot and the automatic stabilisation system, and is linked in with the aircraft's flight management systems. The AFCS, manufactured by Smiths Aerospace, is a dual-duplex system using two flight computers to provide redundancy and fault-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|As selected, the Nimrod MRA4 {{was to be}} {{produced}} as essentially a new aircraft. Significant changes {{were involved in the}} remanufacturing process, including the installation of current-generation BR710 turbofan engines, the adoption of a larger and more efficient wing, various new missions systems and avionics, and an extensively refurbished fuselage. Much larger air intakes were required on the MRA4 in order to provide the necessary airflow requirements imposed by the BR710 engine, which is significantly greater than that of the original Spey 250 that had powered the original Nimrod variants. The MRA4 had also borrowed heavily from Airbus technology; the glass cockpit used was derived from the Airbus A340 airliner. British Aerospace also teamed up with Boeing to provide the Nimrod MRA4's <b>mission</b> <b>systems,</b> making use of the later's work on mooted patrol aircraft systems for the P-3 and Boeing 737.|$|E

25|$|In July 2014, Boeing {{recorded}} a $272 million pre-tax charge {{to cover a}} redesign of the tanker's wiring. The wiring issue arose when {{it was found that}} 5-10% of the wiring bundles did not have sufficient separation distance or were not properly shielded to meet an Air Force requirement for double or triple-redundant wiring for some <b>mission</b> <b>systems.</b> In September 2014, it was confirmed that the wiring redesign would delay the first 767-2C flight from June 2014 to November 2014. The 767-2C's first flight took place on 28 December 2014; it flew from Paine Field and landed at Boeing Field.|$|E
25|$|The Knifefish is an {{autonomous}} unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) under development by General Dynamics <b>Mission</b> <b>Systems</b> and Bluefin Robotics for the United States Navy. It is a propeller-driven minesweeping robot designed {{to replace the}} Navy's trained dolphins and sea lions after the retirement of the 50-year-old Marine Mammal Program in 2017. The Knifefish was first unveiled at a Navy exposition in April 2012, and is intended to operate {{in concert with the}} Navy's littoral combat ships (LCS) as part of a specialised counter-mine system. The Navy plans to begin sea trials of the Knifefish in 2015, and to enter it into active service in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Various {{avionics}} {{were installed}} on the Canberra, many of these had their origins within the Second World War. Such systems include Gee-H navigation, Rebecca beacon-interrogation distance-measuring equipment, very high frequency (VHF) radio, radio compass, radar altimeter, {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF), and Orange Putter radar warning receiver. Perhaps the most crucial of the <b>mission</b> <b>systems</b> was the HS2 automatic radar bombsight, which was mounted in the nose; delays {{in the development of the}} HS2 model intended for the Canberra led to early models being fitted with a T.2 optical sight for visual bombing in its place, which was considerably inferior to the radar-guided counterpart when attacking ground targets while flying at high altitudes.|$|E

25|$|When {{it became}} clear that new {{helicopters}} were desperately needed to replace the Sea King, the Liberal government began a slow procurement process that critics accused of being deliberately tailored to prevent the selection of the EH-101. The government continually modified the replacement project's terms, dubbed the Maritime Helicopter Project. The project was divided into two sections, with distinct airframe and integrated <b>mission</b> <b>systems</b> components. The two-parts approach was attacked from all sides; opponents insisted that separating the major MHP components would only raise total costs. Public Works insistence on “lowest-cost compliant” bids failed to help the situation. In December 2002, the new Minister of National Defence, John McCallum, reversed ‘two-part’ approach, opting “to proceed with a single contract rather than two”. However, this decision was criticized, often by the same elements who had attacked the earlier decision to split the MHP contest, as the procurement process was forced to restart.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005, {{the program}} entered the {{detailed}} design and integration phase, for which Raytheon is the <b>Mission</b> <b>Systems</b> Integrator. Both Northrop Grumman Ship Systems and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works share dual-lead for the hull, mechanical, and electrical detailed design. BAE Systems Inc. has the advanced gun {{system and the}} MK57 VLS. Almost every major defense contractor (including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Sperry Marine, L-3 Communications) and subcontractors from nearly {{every state in the}} U.S. are involved to some extent in this project, which is the largest single line item in the Navy's budget. During the previous contract, development and testing of 11 Engineering Development Models (EDMs) took place: Advanced Gun System, Autonomic Fire Suppression System, Dual Band Radar , Infrared, Integrated Deckhouse & Apertures, Integrated Power System, Integrated Undersea Warfare, Peripheral Vertical Launch System, Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI), Tumblehome Hull Form.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 {{features}} {{a range of}} customizable avionics systems, dependent on customer selection and purpose. On some models, French firm Thales Group provides {{various parts of the}} avionics, such as the glass cockpit, full-colour multifunction displays, tactical mission and encrypted communication systems, the TopOwl helmet-mounted sight/display, IFF and autonomous navigation systems, and the electrical power generation system. Other systems include a forward looking infrared (FLIR), weather radar, digital map generation system, enhanced ground proximity warning system, personal locator system, and VHF/UHF/HF tactical radios. In 2015, the NH90 became the first helicopter to receive an laser-based airborne collision avoidance system. Onboard <b>mission</b> <b>systems</b> feature a dual-redundant databus, are compliant with MIL-STD 1553, and are comprehensively managed via sensor fusion functionality. Customer demand for future avionics improvements such as new data links and communication systems, as well as additional electro-optical sensors, have been anticipated by the manufacturer.|$|E

500|$|The 1982 Falklands War {{made clear}} the {{importance}} of airborne early warning and control {{and led to the}} development of the Sea King AEW2, which was succeeded by the Sea King ASaC7. This will be retired in the second half of 2018 and planning for its replacement was identified at an early stage as an integral part of the next-generation aircraft carrier. The programme became known as the [...] "Future Organic Airborne Early Warning" [...] (FOAEW), and contracts were placed with BAE / Northrop Grumman and Thales in April 2001. In April 2002, BAE and Northrop Grumman received a follow-on study contract for Phase II of the project, by then renamed Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control (MASC). The MASC assessment phase began in September 2005 and by May 2006 three study contracts were awarded for MASC platform and <b>mission</b> <b>systems</b> options: one to Lockheed Martin UK for a Merlin helicopter fitted with AEW <b>mission</b> <b>systems,</b> another to AgustaWestland to maintain the present Sea King ASaC7 and finally to Thales UK to upgrade the Sea King's <b>mission</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1988, the Royal Air Force (RAF) {{commenced}} a Replacement Maritime Patrol Aircraft (RMPA) procurement programme, {{also known}} as Staff Requirement (Air) 420, which was intended to replace their fleet of Nimrod MR2 aircraft. Alternative options, such as avionics, sensors and tactical system upgrades of the MR2, were abandoned in 1990. [...] In 1993, a formal request for information was released. In response to the requirement, several different companies soon submitted their bids to meet the outlined demands. British Aerospace, who had internally studied prospective options to replace the Nimrod MR2 since 1986, including {{a variant of the}} Airbus A310 and other civil conversion projects, ultimately settled on a proposal that involved an extensive rebuild of several of the existing Nimrod MR2s. The remanufactured aircraft, which was marketed under the name Nimrod 2000, involved several major changes being performed, including the adoption of new engines, avionics, and <b>mission</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
