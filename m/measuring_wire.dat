A gauge number denotes a thickness on a standardized scale which, for most purposes, starts at 20g (0.812 mm thick— often used for the posts for nose studs), and increases in thickness (as the gauge number decreases) to 0g, then 00g, and rarely goes any further as these thicknesses come {{closer and closer to}} ″. From there, sizes of ″ and thicker are always specified in fractions of an inch.

40|$|Laser {{diffraction}} is {{a robust}} and precise technique for <b>measuring</b> <b>wire</b> diameters. However, classical Fraunhofer diffraction formulas are inappropriate {{for determining the}} size of three-dimensional objects. Babinet's principle (from classical diffraction theory) allows {{the use of such}} formulas only for angles of diffraction tending to zero. In practice diffraction measurements require a finite angular range (about 10 °) for good resolution. We show that use of the classical slit-diffraction formula for this extended angular interval introduces significant error. We develop a simple diffraction model valid for cylindrical shapes and a formula to obtain the diameter of cylindrical wires. To validate the diffraction formula we calibrate the diameter of the wires using an independent interferometric technique, which to our knowledge is original for this particular task. We have verified our diffraction formula to within about 0. 2 µm for various wire materials and diameters (30 µm to 300 µm) and a wide angular range (± 25 °). Two different experimental set-ups were implemented to increase the reliability of the results. The calibration procedure revealed a systematic disagreement with Babinet's principle, in particular a systematic overestimation of the diameter by about 0. 6 µm, almost independent of the material and the diameter itself. This is particularly relevant to metrological applications involving diffraction phenomena and based on classical diffraction theory...|$|E

Initial laboratory tests were performed on MIL-W- 81381 / 7, / 12, and / 21 aviation wire, a wire that has polyimide (Kapton) layers for insulation. Samples of this wiring were exposed to 370 C temperatures for different periods of time to induce a range of thermal damage. For each exposure, 12 samples of each gauge (12, 16, and 20 gauges) were processed. The velocity of the lowest order axisymmetric ultrasonic guided mode, a mode that is sensitive to the geometry and stiffness of the wire conductor and insulation, was measured. The phase velocity for the 20 -gauge MIL-W- 81381 / 7 wire had a baseline value of 3023 78 m/s. After exposure to the high temperatures, the wire's phase velocity rapidly increased, and reached an asymptotic value of 3598 20 m/s after 100 hours exposure. Similar behavior was measured for the 16 gauge MIL-W 81381 / 21 wire and 12 gauge MIL-W- 81381 / 12 wire which had baseline values of 3225 22 m/s and 3403 33 m/s respectively, and reached asymptotic values of 3668 19 m/s, and 3679 42 m/s respectively. These measured velocity changes represent changes of 19, 14, and 8 percent respectively for the 20, 16, and 12 gauge wires. Finally, some results for a wire with an ethylene tetrafluoroethylene insulation are reported. Qualitatively similar behaviors are noted ultrasonically...|$|E

This study aimed to test a method for assessing wire deflection within an Ilizarov frame. (1) To assess the repeatability of our novel measurement method in <b>measuring</b> <b>wire</b> deflection within an Ilizarov frame in vitro. (2) To compare the amount of wire deflection in an unstable model with that in an intact bone model. (3) To assess accuracy of this method by comparing wire deflection measured with overall machine extension. Tests were performed on clinical grade-tensioned fine wire 4 -ring Ilizarov constructs stabilising a simulated fracture, with and without an unstable defect. Models were sequentially loaded to 700  N using an Instron testing machine. A digital depth gauge attached to the superior ring measured relative wire displacement at the ring closest to the fracture. Tests were repeated 3 times. (1) Both unstable and stable bone models produced highly repeatable load deformation curves (R 2  =  0.98 and 0.99). (2) In the unstable model, wires tensioned at 882 and 1274  N produced mean maximum deflections of 2.41 and 2.69  mm compared with 0.05 and 0.04  mm in the intact bone model (significant p <  0.0001). (3) Wire deflection and machine extension results were strongly correlated (r =  0.99). A measurable difference in wire deflection between stable and unstable situations exists using this method which appears accurate and repeatable, with clear correlation between displacement and load and displacement and machine extension. This approach might be clinically applicable, and further clinical testing is required.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with measurements used in economic activity and investigates how historical markets managed transactional problems due to unreliable measurements. Existing literature has generally associated the problems of measurements in historical markets {{with the lack of}} uniformity in weights and measures. This thesis shows that metrological standardization was not sufficient to ensure reliability of measurements. Markets developed mensuration practices that enabled markets to address specific transactional issues in micro-contexts. This involved, in addition to the use of standardized metrology, improved governance of transactions, third party monitoring and guaranteeing, and other institutional solutions. Historical institutional arrangements were altered or replaced as a result of changing or standardizing mensuration practices. The thesis also makes a conceptual contribution in terms of understanding the process of standardization. It shows how, while standards can be inflexible and rationalized (i. e. limited in number), standardized practices can incorporate a number of such standards and be flexible in terms which standard to be used in a given context. Analytically, standardized practices are institutional objects that are determined endogenously and are formed in 'packages' that create interlinks between standards, other artefacts, rules and people. These arguments are developed by studying three detailed cases of mensuration practices in the British economy during the nineteenth-century. The case of the London Coal Trade examines how altered mensuration practices gave buyers greater assurance that the amount of coal they received was actually the amount they purchased. The case of the wire industry illustrates the struggles to define a uniform set of wire sizes that could overcome the disputes arising from incompatible and multiple ways of <b>measuring</b> <b>wire</b> sizes. The case of the wheat markets illustrates the complexity involved in developing standards of measurements such that quality could be reliably measured ex-ante. Through these case studies, the thesis shows how markets developed different mensuration practices to manage measurements in a given context. ...|$|E
40|$|The Standard Model is an {{incredibly}} successful theory that encompasses the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions of elementary particles and describes how they shape our world at the most basic level. It {{is supported by a}} large breadth of experimental evidence and boasts many successful predictions, culminating with the recent observation of the Higgs boson (or, at the very least, a Higgs-like particle) at the LHC. The search for rare processes beyond the scope of the Standard Model has become an increasingly important element of experimental particle physics. While the recent evidence of neutrino oscillations can be assimilated into the model with little trouble, all SM extensions predict Lepton Flavor Violating phenomena also occurring in the charged sector at high branching ratios. Observation of such extremely rare processes would be irrefutable proof of new physics. One of these pursuits, the search for the rare lepton flavor violating μ → eγ decay, is being undertaken by the MEG experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI, Switzer- land), in a collaboration of physicists from Italy, Japan, Switzerland, USA and Russia. The current published results, based on the analysis {{of the first half of}} the collected data, provide the best upper limit for the μ → eγ branching ratio: B = 5. 7 × 10 − 13 at 90 % CL. A second phase of the experiment (MEG II) has been studied to provide a substan- tial increase of sensitivity, down to ∼ 5 × 10 ^− 14. The construction of a new positron spectrometer, in which the Italian contribution features prominently, is underway, along with a new timing counter and a substantial redesign of the calorimeter. This thesis focuses on the study of the properties of the new drift chamber and of the liquid xenon calorimeter. In the first part, the theory behind the Standard Model and its extensions is summarized, with a focus on lepton flavor violation. The μ → eγ decay kinematics are then discussed. In the second part the MEG I experiment is described and the analysis of the latest published results are presented. The third part discusses the MEG II upgrade scheme and objectives and contains the core of the thesis. The drift chamber prototype studies taking place within the scope of the R&D activities in Pisa are presented, followed by an in-depth investigation of the photon detector behavior showing the limits of its achievable energy resolution. In the drift chamber studies we concern ourselves with the realization of small prototypes for aging and single hit resolution measurements, as well as the wiring and testing of the first full scale single cell prototype, showing the feasibility of a 2 m long stereo drift chamber with variable cell size and the possibility of using a double readout to achieve single cell longitudinal resolutions on the scale of 10 cm. The gain change along the cell length is measured and compared to the simulations and a method for <b>measuring</b> <b>wire</b> tension based on acustic excitation is presented. In the photon detector investigation we attempt to understand why the energy resolution of the MEG I calorimeter, while excellent, is still lower than the predicted value. A detailed study of calibration data is presented, leading to the development of a more accurate Monte Carlo simulation and an improved knowledge of the optical parameters of the detector. Evaluation of PMT quantum efficiency is discussed in this context, and the use of data acquired in gas phase xenon is proposed for MEG II as opposed to the liquid calibration scheme currently used.

40|$|Practical superconducting {{wires and}} tapes have {{significant}} potential {{for use in}} electrical engineering applications. The work presented in this thesis is focused on developing new measurement and theoretical techniques to more accurately model and measure ac losses in superconducting tapes in order {{to contribute to the}} skills, tools and understandings needed to assist in their utilization. Investigations of both BSCCO and MgB 2 superconducting tape and wire are described. A review of the literature with special emphasis on the mechanism of AC losses and theoretical approaches is presented. Some of the widely used analytical expressions for losses are presented and existing experimental techniques are reviewed and discussed in detail. Major instrumentation methods generally used in the measurement of ac losses are described. An experimental chamber for low temperature measurements has been assembled comprising cryogenic parts, electronic and electrical instrumentation and software written to provide a comprehensive data acquisition system. Detailed measurements are made on the effects of magnetic fields, temperature, current and mechanical strain on superconducting tape performance. A new method for AC loss measurement of BSCCO and MgB 2 superconducting tape at low temperatures (3 ̆c 50 K) using a calorimeter has been investigated and demonstrated. Calorimeter techniques have been widely accepted and have the advantage of being able to measure the total losses in a superconducting wire. The calorimeter presented here allows the measurement to be performed at low temperatures from 10 K to 50 K as compared with previously reported calorimeters that only measure at liquid nitrogen temperature at 77 K. This temperature range is of interest since the rapid development of cryogen-free chambers now makes this operating range important for practical applications of superconducting materials. In addition, the calorimeter was built to include a superconducting solenoid coil so that measurements on the effect of both external DC and AC magnetic fields on the superconducting sample can be undertaken. This method has been used to measure losses of BSCCO tape exposed perpendicularly to both DC and AC magnetic fields at various temperatures. Comparison between measurement results and theoretical computations verified the accuracy and reliability of the method. Moreover, AC loss measurement has also been performed on MgB 2 tape but with different external conditions in order to measure transport AC current with applied DC transverse field. The tape is mounted distinctively with a sharp bending edge and several calibration and stability tests carried out to assure the validity of measurement results. Losses were found to be higher than the theoretical predictions because the metallic parts of the tape contribute quite significantly to the total losses. Transport critical current measurement for MgB 2 wire and tape has been investigated with two different techniques, the DC four-probe arrangement and pulsed current with varying rate. The former method suffers from inevitable heating effect when <b>measuring</b> <b>wire</b> with high critical current value. This effect is more pronounced for the commonly used measurement of short samples. The pulsed method on the other hand has no significant heating effect but the critical current can depend on the rate of the current change (dI/dt) in the pulse. This method is particularly useful at low field regions which are often inaccessible using conventional DC methods. A finite element method (FEM) analysis is also performed to provide further evidence of the limitation of the DC method in obtaining high transport critical current. It is shown {{that the best way to}} accurately measure Ic at low fields is to extrapolate the values of Ic measured at different dI/dt to dI/dt = 0 This overcomes problems caused by the effects of heating (introduced in DC measurements) or effects of vortex dynamics (introduced in pulsed measurements). A new direct analytical method of solving the nonlinear integral equation that gives the current as a function of the applied external field or of the transport current is also presented. This method solves the singularity problem in thin superconductor and provides analytical expressions for both the sheet current and field distribution under self and external field conditions. In addition, a new numerical scheme is introduced using a two dimensional nonlinear magnetic diffusion equation model to find AC losses with finite thickness...|$|E
