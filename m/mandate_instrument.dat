A rationale to research the effective-ness of a state mandated test is based on opponents of measurement-driven reform asserting that high-stakes testing and assessment creates negative side effects such as dumbing-down the curriculum, de-skilling teachers, pushing students out of school, and gener-ally inciting fear and anxiety among both students an...|$|R

The systematic approach determined selection of specific research methods empirical logical comparative and statistical. 	Results the article is devoted to the problems of declining credit activity of commercial banks under the conditions of economic activity revival as well as to assessing the impact of the new reorganization mechanism on this process. It is shown that in the recent years the nonfinancial sector faces the trend of optimizing the corporate debts and the liquidity deficit which reduced the demand for loans and as a consequence decreased the banksrsquo credit activity. To analyze the dynamics of deficitsurplus of liquidity in the corporate sector a new classification of liquidity deficitsurplus levels was introduced. Based on the proposed classification the risk factors were identified that influenced the dynamics of indebtedness in the corporate sector. 	The article also analyses the modern monetary mechanism of money supply in the economy and its transformation.

DESIGN: Analysis of random samples from an interstate data bank comprised of the Minimum Data Set (MDS), a standardized, federally <b>mandated</b> assessment <b>instrument</b> for nursing home residents. SETTING: Nursing homes in four states participating in a federal demonstration project of case mix payment plus five others with existing MDS data systems. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals 65 {{years of age and}} older (N = 57, 029), who had very severe cognitive impairment, including total dependence in eating, and who resided in nursing homes during 1994, the most recent year for which uniform data were available. MEASUREMENTS: State-by-state differences in prevalence of tube feeding, controlling for demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of tube feeding ranged from 7. 5 % in Maine to 40. 1 % in Mississippi. Each state had a significantly elevated prevalence of tube feeding compared with Maine, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1. 50 to 5. 83, P <. 001. Specific directives not to provide tube feeding (OR 0. 41, P <. 001), and white race (OR 0. 45, P <. 001) were strongly and negatively associated with tube feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Wide regional variations exist in the use of tube feeding of nursing home residents with equivalent impairments.

However, many of these report cards appeared to provide little comparative information about one school's achievement over another. As a result of this deficiency, the late 1990 s brought a refinement in the report-card process. State legislatures and departments of public education began to design and <b>mandate</b> additional qualifying <b>instruments</b> to measure and compare the effectiveness of local schools. Thus, local school performance scores (SPS) have been instituted in many states as a process to compare the progress of schools toward predetermined benchmarks of effectiveness over time.

40|$|Outsourcing is {{a reality}} in the globalized world. In Brazil, it was {{recently}} approved by the National Congress the so-called "law of outsourcing," which in practice defines more flexible rules for organizations to outsource their core activity – something {{that used to be}} prohibited. This flexibility can lead organizations to obtain competitive advantage due to the costs associated with the outsourcing tending to be lower. However, there are issues relating to the products quality and services that must be taken when the decision is taken by managers. The outsourcing decision is still less explored in the academic environment. The majority of studies related to decision-making tend to analyze institutional and cognitive issues differently. However, there are few studies correlating the two areas, when taking into consideration the behavioral aspects of the individual and the institutional structure of their organizations. The present research aims to validate a research instrument that aims to measure the institutional and behavioral variables that influence outsourcing decision.

The relationship between the conceptual use of information and the quality of that information (reliability, relevance, and supportiveness) was also assessed for each of the four groups. ^ Two a priori hypotheses related to additional information desired by the faculty groups were supported: (a) internals in the long-time condition (vigilant decision makers) were significantly less interested in irrelevant information than they were interested in information that was either supportive, challenging, or directed toward shifting responsibility, and (b) externals in the short-time condition (defensive avoidance through bolstering) were significantly more interested in supportive information than information directed toward shifting responsibility or information that was irrelevant. ^ No significant differences were found among the four faculty groups in their conceptual or instrumental use of information. Significant positive relationships between conceptual use of information and its relevance, reliability, and supportiveness were found for all the groups. Although not all the expected differences were found, the research presents some evidence that the results of evaluations are used by college faculty in making decisions to modify or maintain instructional practices. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{periodic}} {{and frequent}} measurements of blood pressure for hypertensive patients are must {{to do their}} effective and efficient monitoring. Existing non-invasive blood pressure measurement <b>instruments</b> <b>mandate</b> a relaxed posture – it is con-sidered a prerequisite to factor out motion artifacts in the read-ing – before taking the final reading. This requirement causes not only a great discomfort for the patients but also renders the equipment useless in providing ubiquitous and real-time on-the-move remote monitoring of the patients. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to get accurate measurement of the blood pressure while walking with the free end motion of the arm. The approach utilizes an accelerometer mounted on the cuff wrapped over the upper arm {{in order to determine}} the noise superimposed over the oscillometric signal of the patient’s blood pressure. The system is tested on a mannequin’s limb simulated to have arm movements with the oscillometric signal. The re-sults of our analysis show that the system is robust in determin-ing the correct blood pressure irrespective of the noise level pro-duced due to the physical movement of the arm. We believe that our system will become a cardinal component of a cost-efficient, highly-reliable ubiquitous remote patient monitoring system...|$|R

40|$|NASA's {{experience}} with electrochemical sensors in a hand-held toxic gas monitor {{serves as a}} basis {{for the development of a}} fixed on-board instrument, the Contingency Gas Analyzer (CGA), for monitoring selected toxic combustion products as well as oxygen and carbon dioxide on the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). Oxygen and carbon dioxide are major components of the cabin environment and accurate measurement of these compounds is critical to maintaining a safe working environment for the crew. Fire or thermal degradation events may produce harmful levels of toxic products, including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and hydrogen chloride (HCl) in the environment. These three components, besides being toxic in their own right, can serve as surrogates for a panoply of hazardous combustion products. On orbit monitoring of these surrogates provides for crew health and safety by indicating the presence of toxic combustion products in the environment before, during and after combustion or thermal degradation events. Issues identified in previous NASA experiences <b>mandate</b> hardening the <b>instrument</b> and components to endure the mechanical and operational stresses of the CEV environment while maintaining high analytical fidelity.

In the past decade, an international legal framework has been developed to tackle corruption both in public and private sectors. This framework includes the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), which entered into force in 2005, and the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, which entered into force in 1999. These <b>instruments</b> <b>mandate</b> that State Parties must criminalise and punish a variety of corrupt practices. Relevant domestic laws have a direct impact on business, especially in States Parties instruments that require the establishment of liability of legal persons for corrupt acts. The African Union Convention also requires States Parties to establish mechanisms to encourage participation by the private sector in the fight against unfair competition, respect of the tender procedures and property rights. The paper details various steps needed to efficiently and effectively implement anti-corruption ethics and compliance programme in the African context. The first part of the paper develops the primary objective of the corruption risk assessment which is to better understand the risk exposure so that informed risk management decisions may be taken. A structured approach for how enterprises could conduct an anti-corruption risk assessment will be outlined in this first section. The author argued in this same first section that each enterprise’s own risk assessment exercise is unique, depending on that enterprise’s industry, size, location, and other factors inherent to that organisation.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{considerable}} {{evidence about the}} effectiveness of audit coupled with feedback, although few audit with feedback interventions have been conducted in long-term care (LTC) settings to date. In general, the effects {{have been found to be}} modest at best, although in settings where there has been little history of audit and feedback, the effects may be greater, at least initially. The primary purpose of the Data for Improvement and Clinical Excellence (DICE) Long-Term Care project is to assess the effects of an audit with feedback intervention delivered monthly over 13 months in four LTC facilities. The research questions we addressed are: 1. What effects do feedback reports have on processes and outcomes over time? 2. How do different provider groups in LTC and home care respond to feedback reports based on data targeted at improving quality of care? Methods/design The research team conducting this study comprises researchers and decision makers in continuing care in the province of Alberta, Canada. The intervention consists of monthly feedback reports in nine LTC units in four facilities in Edmonton, Alberta. Data for the feedback reports comes from the Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (RAI) version 2. 0, a standardized <b>instrument</b> <b>mandated</b> for use in LTC facilities throughout Alberta. Feedback reports consist of one page, front and back, presenting both graphic and textual information. Reports are delivered to all staff working in the four LTC facilities.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{considerable}} {{evidence about the}} effectiveness of audit coupled with feedback for provider behavior change, although few feedback interventions have been conducted in long-term care settings. The primary purpose of the Data for Improvement and Clinical Excellence-Long-Term Care (DICE-LTC) project was to assess the effects of a feedback intervention delivered to all direct care providers on resident outcomes. Our objective in this report is to assess the effect of feedback reporting on rates of pain assessment, depression screening, and falls over time. Methods The intervention consisted of monthly feedback reports delivered to all direct care providers, facility and unit administrators, and support staff, delivered over 13  months in nine LTC units across four facilities. Data for feedback reports came from the Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (RAI) version 2. 0, a standardized <b>instrument</b> <b>mandated</b> in LTC facilities throughout Alberta. The primary evaluation used an interrupted time series design with a comparison group (units not included in the feedback intervention) and a comparison condition (pressure ulcers). We used segmented regression analysis to assess the effect of the feedback intervention. Results The primary outcome of the study, falls, showed little change over the period of the intervention, except for a small increase in the rate of falls during the intervention period. The only outcome that improved during the intervention period was the proportion of residents with high pain scores, which decreased {{at the beginning of the}} intervention. The proportion of residents with high depression scores appeared to worsen during the intervention. Conclusions Maintaining all nine units in the study for its 13 -month duration was a positive outcome. The feedback reports, without any other intervention included, did not achieve the desired reduction in proportion of falls and elevated depression scores. The survey on intention to change pain assessment practice which was conducted shortly after most of the feedback distribution cycles may have acted as a co-intervention supporting a reduction in pain scores. The processing and delivery of feedback reports could be accomplished at relatively low cost because the data are mandated and could be added to other intervention approaches to support implementation of evidence-based practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{considerable}} {{evidence exists}} {{about the effectiveness}} of audit coupled with feedback, very few audit-with-feedback interventions have been done in either home care or supportive living settings to date. With little history of audit and feedback in home care or supportive living there is potential for greater effects, at least initially. This study extends the work of an earlier study designed to assess the effects of an audit-with-feedback intervention. It will be delivered quarterly over a one-year period in seven home care offices and 11 supportive living sites. The research questions are the same as in the first study but in a different environment. They are as follows: 1. What effects do feedback reports have on processes and outcomes over time? 2. How do different provider groups in home care and supportive living sites respond to feedback reports based on quality indicator data? Methods The research team conducting this study includes researchers and decision makers in continuing care in the province of Alberta, Canada. The intervention consists of quarterly feedback reports in 19 home care offices and supportive living sites across Alberta. Data for the feedback reports are based on the Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care tool, a standardized <b>instrument</b> <b>mandated</b> for use in home care and supportive living environments throughout Alberta. The feedback reports consist of one page, printed front and back, presenting both graphic and textual information. Reports are delivered to all employees working in each site. The primary evaluation uses a controlled interrupted time-series design, both adjusted and unadjusted for covariates. The concurrent process evaluation includes observation, focus groups, and self-reports to assess uptake of the feedback reports. The project described in this protocol follows a similar intervention conducted in our previous study, Data for Improvement and Clinical Excellence [...] Long-Term Care. We will offer dissemination strategies and spread of the feedback report approach in several ways suited to various audiences and stakeholders throughout Alberta. Significance This study will generate knowledge about the effects of an audit with feedback intervention in home care and supportive living settings.

40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) codes {{have gained}} a {{prominent}} role as tools in self-regulation for companies to establish their basic values, norms, and rules that condition the conduct of directors, managers, employees, and-increasingly-of suppliers. This development must {{be seen in the}} light of two important paradigmatic changes in the concepts both of CSR and corporate governance. The former is no longer purely voluntary and the latter has become inclusive of CSR, each with far-reaching consequences for the raison d 2 ̆ 7 itre and the place and function of the codes in the smart regulatory mix governing corporations. While the codes were based originally on voluntary adherence by companies to international soft law instruments such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (dating from 1976) and the International Labour Organization (lLO) Tripartite Declaration (dating from 1977), increasingly, governance and compliance-oriented soft and hard laws, including but not limited to criminal, administrative, and private laws, stimulate or even require companies to adopt codes of conduct, to monitor compliance and to enforce them. In this sense, corporate codes must be characterized increasingly as co-regulation <b>instruments,</b> <b>mandated</b> by soft and hard law as meta-regulation. Thus, the still widely held view, that the codes are merely voluntary instruments must be challenged on two levels: first, adoption of a code as corporate governance and CSR instrument is for many companies no longer voluntary, and, second, the content of the code is no longer optional in many respects. In order to enable the reader to appreciate the implications of these paradigmatic changes for corporate codes of conduct, this contribution will first briefly address these paradigmatic changes. Following these preliminary remarks, this contribution will describe the code 2 ̆ 7 s place in the corporate governance regulatory framework as one of the primary governance tools for the company. This contribution will also describe how meta-regulation has transformed corporate codes from pure selfregulation to responsive co-regulation. In conclusion, this contribution will analyze the implications of this transformation process for corporate management and it will address best practices in creating, monitoring, and enforcing the codes along with their identified problems through a legal and a business organizational lens...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Education, Washington State UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the level of support teachers and principals have toward the new <b>mandated</b> teacher evaluation <b>instruments</b> in the state of Washington. In 2010, the Washington state legislature passed SB 6696 which essentially overhauled the system of how principals evaluate teachers in the state. The bill did away with the old satisfactory or unsatisfactory evaluation and used a multi-tier model with a long list of specific criteria that teachers must now meet. The new law ultimately allowed each school district to select among three state approved evaluation models and unions were allowed to bargain with school districts about the way student performance would be used. The three evaluation models approved include the Danielson Model, Marzano Model, and CEL 5 D+ Model. The philosophical support of teachers and principals was really not included in the re-shaping of teacher evaluation laws. This study explored whether or not this current course of action is what was best for teachers and principals. This study challenged the political support of teacher evaluation reform with the philosophical support of the teachers and principals who were the most impacted by the change. A qualitative study based on participant interviews was completed in six school districts from the state of Washington during a two-month period. The districts were selected based on equal representation of three evaluations instruments used in that state (Danielson, Marzano, and CEL 5 D+). A total of six school districts participated by providing a willing teacher and principal for an interview. There were a total of twelve participants interviewed. The results of the study found the new evaluation too cumbersome and unrealistic with the current structure of time and resources allocated in the educational system. The new teacher evaluation instruments are good tools in fostering the development of teachers but lack in the ability to fairly evaluate teachers. Implications involved lawmakers and principals. Lawmakers are advised to implement educational change cautiously. The complexity of education requires educator input on time, resources, reality, and fairness. Principals need more support.
