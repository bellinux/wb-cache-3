40|$|Numerous {{villages in}} the European loess belt are confronted with floods caused by runoff from {{agricultural}} land. Seventy-nine percent of the municipalities in central Belgium experienced at least one muddy flood during the last decade. Of these flooded municipalities, 22 % have been affected more than 10 times during this period. Twenty municipalities have been selected for a detailed analysis. A database of 367 locations affected by <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> has been compiled, and the connectivity between cultivated areas and inhabited zones could be assessed for 100 flooded locations. Roads and drainage network facilitate runoff transfer between cultivated and inhabited areas in 64 % of cases. Three types of areas producing <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> have been identified: hillslopes (1 - 30 ha) without thalweg where runoff is generally dominated by sheet flow; small catchments (10 - 300 ha) characterised by runoff concentration in the thalweg and medium catchments (100 - 300 ha) with multiple thalwegs dominated by concentrated runoff. About 90 % of <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> are generated on hillslopes and in small catchments. A critical area-slope threshold for triggering <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> has been computed for hillslopes. A logistic regression shows that <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> are generated in small and medium catchments with 99 % probability after 43 mm rainfall. Rainfall depths required to trigger <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> are lower in May and June (25 12 mm) than between July and September (46 20 mm), because of different surface conditions (crusting, roughness and crop cover). Each year, <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> lead to a total societal cost of 16 x 10 (6) - 172 x 106 46 in central Belgium, depending on the extent and intensity of thunderstorms and monetary values damaged. Recent datasets suggest that the phenomenon {{is becoming more frequent}} in central Belgium, because of land consolidation, urban sprawl and expansion of row crops, sown in spring, at the expense of winter cereals. The huge costs induced by <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> justify the installation of erosion control measures. It is suggested to install a grassed buffer strip at the downslope edge of cultivated hillslopes to protect houses and roads. In small and medium catchments, it is preferred to install a grassed waterway and earthen dams in the thalweg. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRunoff {{and soil}} erosion have been {{successfully}} modelled since many years using distributed, hydrological, expert-rules and physics methods, but these are especially carried out at small scales and none can simulate <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> occurring at large scales according to local rules. Conversely, Cellular Automata (CA) models fail to replicate real discharges because they use relatively simple rules based on abstractions of hydrological process. In this work, we present the framework provided for identifying processes that are fundamental to simulate complex <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> phenomena in dry valleys. Within the Geographical Cellular Automata model RUICELLS (Runoff routIng on CELLular MeSh), environmental variables are progressively implemented in the cellular routing scheme. Several simulations highlight influence of controlling factors of first and second orders playing a key role on these floods from local to global scales. The morphological components have a major influence at the catchment scale whereas land use data aggravate topographic efficiency at the local scale. The violence and brutality of several <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> in some sub-catchments result from the conjunction of high rainfalls, high morphological potential and cultivated areas prone to generate high sediment content. This approach confirms the possibility of simulating the global behaviour of environmental systems through local rules using afar simpler solution and also underlines the importance of morphological forcing on <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> occuring in dry valleys...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} spatial {{variation}} of small-scale flooding and <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> {{in rural areas}} in a medium sized study area (5516 km(2)) and the linkage with controlling factors. A questionnaire set up in central Belgium indicates that 43 % of the municipalities have to deal {{from time to time}} with <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> generated from direct runoff from arable land and 36 % with flooding of permanent streams. A strong relation exists between the nature of the problem and the site in relation to topography and landuse. Areas suffering from <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> have significantly steeper cultivated slopes compared to areas suffering only from small-scale flooding. The high spatial and temporal frequency of small-scale flooding and <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> results in emotional and significant economic damage to private households. As a control measure more than 100 retention ponds have been constructed with 50 more to be built in the near future. The mean cost {{for the construction of a}} retention pond amounts to 380, 000 EURO. These retention ponds store large quantities of sediment from runoff events and must thus be dredged regularly with costs of the order of 1. 5 million EURO yearly. The dredged sediment volumes can be used to assess and predict sediment yield for these drainage basins; values vary between 0. 19 and 6 m(3) ha(- 1) year(- 1) for basins ranging from 25 to 5000 ha.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis aims at {{defining}} the conditions triggering <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> in the Belgian loess belt. On average, each municipality is confronted with 3. 6 <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> each year. Annual costs associated with their off-site impacts are estimated at € 16 - 172 millions for the entire Belgian loess belt. A topographic threshold is derived to predict the source areas of <b>muddy</b> <b>floods.</b> Furthermore, the storms required to produce a flood are, on average, smaller in May and June (25 mm) than between July and September (46 mm). This difference is explained by the variability of soil surface characteristics that determine the runoff potential of cultivated soils (soil cover by crops and residues, soil surface crusting and roughness). Steady state infiltration rates of cropland and grassed areas were characterised in the field using a 0. 5 m 2 -portable rainfall simulator. Overall, grassed areas have a lower infiltration rate (16 - 23 mm h- 1) than croplands (25 - 52 mm h- 1). <b>Muddy</b> <b>floods</b> are mostly observed between May-September because of the coincidence of critical soil surface conditions for runoff generation with the most erosive storms. After an adaptation of its decision rules to the local conditions, the STREAM expert-based model provides satisfactory runoff/erosion predictions at the catchment scale. The second part of the thesis aims at evaluating the effectiveness of measures to control <b>muddy</b> <b>floods.</b> A modelling case-study showed that peak discharge was reduced by more than 40 % by installing a grassed waterway and a dam at the outlet of a 300 ha-catchment. Monitoring the same catchment (2002 - 2007) demonstrated that the grassed waterway as well as three dams prevented any muddy flood in the downstream village despite the occurrence of several extreme storms (with a maximum return period of 150 years). Peak discharge was reduced by 69 %. Specific sediment yield dropped from 3. 5 t ha- 1 yr- 1 to a mean of 0. 5 t ha- 1 yr- 1 after the installation of the control measures, thereby reducing drastically sediment transfer to the alluvial plain. Finally, a methodology is provided to implement grassed waterways and earthen dams in other dry valleys in the Belgian loess belt and comparable environments. (GEOG 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|E

The shift has therefore been to concerns about a healthy and sustainable environment which includes soils.

40|$|<b>Muddy</b> <b>floods,</b> i. e. {{water flowing}} from {{agricultural}} fields and carrying {{large quantities of}} soil, affect routinely numerous municipalities of central Belgium, northern France and southern England. A comparison of flood frequency between different European regions is difficult, {{because of the lack}} of a uniform and official database as well as the landscape heterogeneity of administrative entities. Agri-environmental measures [AEMs; e. g. grass buffer strips (GBS) ] can contribute to the control of <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> but their installation is voluntary and depends therefore on farmers' willingness. Actions to increase awareness and to inform the farmers proved to increase drastically their participation rate in AEM programmes. In all the studied regions, flood prone areas are increasingly taken into account to define land approved for development. Moreover, several schemes for the control of <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> have also been proposed at the regional scale. However, there is a spatial mismatch between the scale at which <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> are triggered (small catchment scale) and the scale at which public authorities can operate (municipality, grouping of municipalities, delineated flood prone areas, river basin). In future, beside curative measures (e. g. retention ponds and dams), farming techniques preventing runoff and erosion in the field (e. g. conservation tillage) should be encouraged. This could be achieved by the creation of a new AEM. Moreover, guidelines for the location of AEMs could usefully be introduced. Existing flood control schemes should also be systematically carried out by catchment agencies including legal, environmental and financial expertise. These agencies should be set up for local groupings of municipalities and provide them technical assistance to equip the flood prone areas and carry out maintenance of the implemented control measures.

RNDr. Zdeněk Kliment, CSc. Abstract: <b>Muddy</b> <b>floods</b> {{represent a}} movement of accumulated material from agriculture areas during floods trigerred by heavy rainfall (with intensity that exceed 30 mm/hour). Areas where moody flows occur are typical with steep slopes, loess, thalweg cultivation and growing crops with erosion dangerous. The most intense moody floods occur particularly in central Belgium, France, Netherlands and Slovakia. The moody floods are caused by growing suburbanization, enlarging area of farmland, tamping during agricultural mechanization or transformation grassed areas into cultivated land. Great attention should be paid to measures against erosion because water erosion with heavy rainfalls increase amount of accumulated material, what amplify negative impact of moody flows. The most suitable solution is combination of agrotechnological, technical and organizational measures. The negative consequences of moody floods are e. g. soil degradation, flooding up nutrients, carrying topsoil or transportation of accumulated material into populated area, where high economical and emotional damage may be inflicted.

40|$|<b>Muddy</b> <b>floods</b> due to {{agricultural}} runoff are a widespread and frequent {{phenomenon in the}} European loess belt, and particularly in central Belgium. These floods are triggered when high quantities of runoff are generated on cropland and cause severe erosion. Three soil surface characteristics are relevant to determine the runoff potential of cultivated soils: soil cover by crops and residues, soil surface crusting and roughness. These characteristics have been observed on 65 cultivated fields throughout 2005. A heavy rainfall event representative for events triggering <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> in the region (60 mm h(- 1) during 30 minutes) has been simulated using a 0. 5 m(2) simulator on fields with the 17 most observed combinations of soil surface characteristics in central Belgium. Runoff is not observed {{in the case of}} (ploughed) bare uncrusted soils, nor in the case of soils covered by crops showing a transitional crust and a moderate roughness (1 - 2 cm). In the cases where runoff has been observed, mean runoff coefficients ranged from 13 % (wheat in July) to 58 % (sugar beet or maize in May and June). Grassed buffer strips (GBSs) and grassed waterways (GWWs) show a higher runoff coefficient (62 % for GBSs and 73 % for GWWs) than most cultivated soils (13 - 58 %). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that small plot measurements can be used to estimate runoff generation at the field scale. A classification of runoff generation risk based on the surveys of soil surface characteristics has been applied to common crops of central Belgium. February as well as the period between May and September are the most critical for runoff at the field scale. However, it appears from monitoring of a 16 ha catchment that the highest runoff volumes and peak discharges are recorded between May and August after heavy rainfall, explaining why 85 % of <b>muddy</b> <b>floods</b> are recorded during this period in central Belgium.

40|$|Vegetal remains are {{considered}} labile structures that quickly become decayed in ecosystems.

(Cuenca, Spain), those woody remains (trunks and branches) with resinous {{material in the}} inner tracheids and parenchyma cells that were buried rapidly under anoxic conditions experienced a low degree of maturation, becoming exceptionally well preserved. Those woody remains deposited under oxic conditions (subaerial or sub-aquatic exposure) were more intensely biodegraded and subsequently carbonified, partially or completely mineralized in gypsum and covered by a ferruginous crust. These two modes of preservation are scarce, with silicification or carbonification processes much more common, and both {{can be considered as}} ?exceptional preservation?. Other vegetal remains, such as carbonified leaves, stems and roots, were collected in the site.
