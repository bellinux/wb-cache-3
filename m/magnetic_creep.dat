Despite apparent structural differences, the dynamics of vortices in superconductors [1 – 3] has many common features with glass formers such as supercooled liquids, spin glasses or polymers [4, 5]. In superconductors even simple quantities such as the sample magnetisation, M, exhibit strong “glassy ” behaviours and a variety of “history dependent ” effects has been discussed [6]. Common examples are hysteretic magnetisation loops which at low temperature exhibit “memory ” effects: the value of M for a given applied field, H, depends on the sweep rate of H, i. e., {{on the history of the}} sample...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} some {{experimentally}} observed features of vortex matter in high temperature superconductors {{may be interpreted}} in simpler ways than it is usually done. In particular, we consider <b>magnetic</b> flux <b>creep</b> at low temperatures {{as well as the}} irreversibility line in the H-T phase diagram. We also discuss a new approach to the analysis of the equilibrium magnetization in the mixed state of type-II superconductors and we suggest an alternative configuration for the mixed state in magnetic fields close to the upper critical field.

40|$|A {{trapped field}} of over 1 T at 5 K and 0. 5 T at 20 K has been {{measured}} between {{a stack of}} magnetized cylinders of bulk polycrystalline Ba 0. 6 K 0. 4 Fe 2 As 2 superconductors 10 mm in diameter and 18 mm in combined thickness. The trapped field showed a low <b>magnetic</b> <b>creep</b> rate (~ 3 % after 24 hours at 5 K), while magneto-optical imaging revealed a trapped field distribution corresponding to uniform macroscopic current loops circulating through the sample. The superconductors were manufactured by hot isostatic pressing of pre-reacted powders using the scalable powder-in-tube technique. A high Vickers hardness of ~ 3. 5 GPa and a reasonable fracture toughness of ~ 2. 35 MPa m 0. 5 were measured. Given the untextured polycrystalline nature of the cylinders and their large irreversibility field (> 90 T), {{it is expected that}} larger bulks could trap fields in excess of 10 T.

40|$|This Thesis {{reports on}} our {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} the motion of magnetic domains in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy materials. We show that spatial fluctuations of the DMI {{give rise to a}} local in plane magnetic field parallel to the domain wall. Our calculations on the atomic scale also point out that the sign and magnitude of the DMI strength is strongly related to the interface structure. This result motivated our experimental study on interface effects which shows that the in-plane magnetic field dependence of the domain wall motion is governed by sample growth parameters. We show that in-plane field effects enter the creep theory in novel ways. Our work leads to new insights concerning the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-Interaction, in-plane <b>magnetic</b> fields, <b>creep</b> theory and effects of the conditions under which the studied samples are grown...|$|R
40|$|An exact {{solution}} of the nonlinear nonlocal diffusion problem is obtained that describes {{the evolution of the}} magnetic flux injected into a soft or hard type-II superconductor film or a two-dimensional Josephson junction array. (The magnetic field in vortices is assumed to be perpendicular to the film; the electric field induced by the vortex motion is proportional to the local <b>magnetic</b> induction; flux <b>creep</b> in the hard superconductors under consideration is described by the logarithmic U(j) dependence.) Self-similar flux distributions with sharp square-root fronts are found. The fronts are shown to expand with power law time-dependence. A sharp peak {{in the middle of the}} distribution appears in the hard superconductor case. Comment: 5 pages (epsf-LaTeX) and 3 EPS figure...|$|R

The moment M, relaxation rates R = – dM / dln t and S = R / M as well as glassy exponent μ were analyzed in partly and fully penetrated critical state in dependence on increasing and decreasing field. We demonstrated that a demagnetization affects the magnetic moment and the rate R {{but it does not}} influence on the normalized rate S and μ.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that subjecting perpendicular magnetic films which exhibit the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) to an in-plane magnetic field results in a domain wall (DW) energy, σ, that is highly anisotropic {{with respect to the}} orientation of the DW in the film plane, Θ. We demonstrate that this anisotropy has a profound impact on the elastic response of the DW as characterized by the surface stiffness, σ̃(Θ) = σ(Θ) + σ"(Θ), and evaluate its dependence on the length scale of deformation. The influence of the stiffness on DW mobility in the creep regime is assessed, with analytic and numerical calculations showing trends in σ̃ that better represent experimental measurements of domain wall velocity in magnetic thin films compared to σ alone. Our treatment provides experimental support for theoretical models of the mobility of anisotropic elastic manifolds and makes progress toward a more complete understanding of <b>magnetic</b> domain wall <b>creep...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} the field dependent magnetic spin structure of an antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled Fe/Cr heterostructure sandwiched between a hardmagnetic FePt buffer layer and a softmagnetic Fe top layer. The depth-resolved experimental studies of this system were performed via Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM) and various measuring methods based on nuclear resonant scattering (NRS) technique. Nucleation and evolution of the magnetic spiral structure in the AF coupled Fe/Cr multilayer structure in an azimuthally rotating external magnetic field were observed using NRS. During the experiment a number of time-dependent magnetic side effects (<b>magnetic</b> after-effect, domain-wall <b>creep</b> effect) caused by the non-ideal structure of a real sample were observed and later explained. Creation of the magnetic spiral structure in rotating external magnetic field was simulated using a one-dimensional micromagnetic model. The cross-sectional magnetic x-ray diffraction technique was conceived and is theoretically described in the present work. This method allows to determine the magnetization state of an individual layer in the magnetic heterostructure. It is also applicable in studies of the magnetic structure of tiny samples where conventional x-ray reflectometry fails...|$|R
40|$|We derive the {{response}} of the magnetic superconductors in the vortex state to the ac Lorentz force, F_L(t) =F_ acsin(ω t), taking into account the interaction of vortices with the magnetic moments described by the relaxation dynamics (polaronic effect). At low amplitudes of the driving force F_ ac the dissipation in the system is suppressed due to the enhancement of the effective viscosity at low frequencies and due to formation of the magnetic pinning at high frequencies ω. In the adiabatic limit with low frequencies ω and high amplitude of the driving force F_ac, the vortex and magnetic polarization form a vortex polaron when F_L(t) is small. When F_L increases, the vortex polaron accelerates and at a threshold driving force, the vortex polaron dissociates and the motion of vortex and the relaxation of magnetization are decoupled. When F_L decreases, the vortex is retrapped by the background of remnant magnetization and they again form vortex polaron. This process repeats when F_L(t) increases in the opposite direction. Remarkably, after dissociation, decoupled vortices move in the periodic potential induced by magnetization which remains for some periods of time due to retardation after the decoupling. At this stage vortices oscillate with high frequencies determined by the Lorentz force at the moment of dissociation. We derive also the creep rate of vortices and show that <b>magnetic</b> moments suppress <b>creep</b> rate. Comment: 7. 3 pages and 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|TECTONOMAGNETISM - {{the study}} of {{magnetic}} anomalies due to tectonic stresses - is attracting increasing interest {{as a method of}} monitoring local changes in Earth stress 1. The most important aspect is the search for the seismomagnetic effect; no convincing observation has yet been reported, although calculations 2, 3 indicate that in many cases it must be of measurable magnitude, and observations of <b>magnetic</b> precursors to <b>creep</b> increments on the San Andreas fault 4 encourage the view that magnetic effects of earthquakes themselves are observable. Local magnetic changes preceding and accompanying volcanic eruptions in New Zealand are very striking 5, 6 and indicate that substantial stresses are associated with eruptions; a quite different pattern of volcanomagnetic changes in Hawaii (P. D., F. S., Jackson and Field, to be published) suggests that Kilauea volcano is highly fragmentednd a incapable of supporting a large scale stress pattern. But both volcanic eruptions and the San Andreas creep increments are very imperfectly understood so that a large scale control experiment which demonstrates quantitatively the role of the piezomagnetic effect in producing local magnetic anomalies is very desirable. The requirement is satisfied by the water loads imposed on underlying strata by man-made lakes, which provide large scale Earth stresses of sufficient intensities to produce measurable magnetic anomalies. Recent completion of a new dam at Talbingo in the Snowy Mountains of SE Australia and rapid filling of the reservoir provided an opportunity to observe this effect...|$|R
