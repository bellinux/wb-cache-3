25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E

[...] The third child of Scottish {{business}} manager John Gibson and English born wife Ellen née Lawson, he was schooled at Melbourne Grammar and the University of Melbourne.

In one notable incident, hotels in Oklahoma City refused to admit Russell and his black teammates {{while they were in}} town for the 1954 All-College Tournament. In protest, the whole team decided to camp out in a closed college dorm, which was later called an important bonding experience for the group. Decades later, Russell explained that his experiences hardened him against abuse of all kinds. [...] "I never permitted <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a victim", he said.|$|E

[...] Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took artistic liberties and attempted to incorporate the various aspects of Assyrian culture, from its hunting mastery to its admiration for writing. He said of the sculpture: The piece has authentic qualities to it, {{but it is also}} my statue.... With the earrings and the clothing and the hair and his daggers, it is Ashurbanipal. But in the choice of (stance), {{the fact that he is}} holding a tablet and a lion, that is mine. I wanted <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> represented in the piece.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the sensations}} of the Games was black American track star Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals. According to some American press stories, Hitler left the stadium rather than {{shake hands with}} him. This was not the case; Hitler {{had been told by}} IOC {{president}} Baillet-Latour not to shake hands with the winners unless he was prepared to shake hands with all gold medalists, which he was not; this, however was not publicized. According to Butterfield, in later years retellings of what Brundage termed [...] "a fairy tale" [...] roused the American to [...] "acute fury". Hitler was, however, asked by his youth leader, Baldur von Schirach, to meet Owens, and he refused, [...] "Do you really think that I'd allow <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> photographed shaking hands with a Negro?" ...|$|E

The whole experience was five days in Belfast, and I enjoyed it a lot." [...] Prior to the season, in August 2015, reports emerged about the spotting of Rory McCann at a hotel frequented by actors during filming of the series, in Belfast.

500|$|Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 30April 1954 for {{his service}} in Malaya, Scherger joined the Air Board as Air Member for Personnel in March 1955. During his term he {{commissioned}} a review into {{the effectiveness of}} the syllabus at RAAF College for meeting the future needs of the Air Force in an age of missiles and nuclear weaponry. This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the College was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy. Promoted air marshal, he became Chief of the Air Staff in March 1957, succeeding Air Marshal Sir John McCauley. Long identified as a strong contender for the RAAF's senior role, Scherger was described by Air Marshal Hardman as [...] "easily the best material on offer". He declared that as an administrator he was [...] "not going to allow <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bogged down with minor matters of detail...Broad policy comes from the top.

500|$|After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain {{decided to}} compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain {{described}} the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first songwriting effort since her separation from Lange. She had to [...] "find [...] as a songwriter" [...] and become independent again. [...] "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years since I had written by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vulnerable the and judged, it scared {{the heck out of}} me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment.

He is a friend of former City midfielder Joey Barton, as well as Italian striker Alessandro Del Piero, who described Gallagher as Italy's [...] "lucky mascot" [...] during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and appears in the Oasis video [...] "Lord Don't Slow Me Down". Gallagher along with Kasabian lead guitarist Sergio Pizzorno took part in drawing teams for the FA Cup third round in 2011. Coincidentally Pizzorno drew his hometown team Leicester City with Gallagher's Manchester City for the Third round tie in which both teams drew 2-2 and Manchester City preceded to win 4-2 in the replay. He participated in the unveiling of Umbro sponsored football kits with captain Vincent Kompany. In the advertising campaign, the two men are pictured wearing the new Manchester City home and away shirts for the 2012–13 season. Formerly, the footballer introduced Gallagher to 80,000 fans during Rock Werchter music festival in Belgium. Gallagher also supports the Republic of Ireland national football team and has said [...] "I don’t consider <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> English at all". Nevertheless, he did serve as an official ambassador for England's bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> swept up in? Because you could have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, sometimes I think you need to save me." ...|$|E
