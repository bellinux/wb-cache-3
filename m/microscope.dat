50|$|Wide field optical <b>microscopes</b> and {{transmission}} electron <b>microscopes</b> both use {{the theory of}} lenses (optics for light <b>microscopes</b> and electromagnet lenses for electron <b>microscopes)</b> in order to magnify the image generated by {{the passage of a}} wave transmitted through the sample, or reflected by the sample. The waves used are electromagnetic (in optical <b>microscopes)</b> or electron beams (in electron <b>microscopes).</b> Resolution in these <b>microscopes</b> is limited by the wavelength of the radiation used to image the sample, where shorter wavelengths allow for a higher resolution.|$|R

50|$|Two-photon {{excitation}} microscopy: Although {{they use}} a related technology (both are laser scanning <b>microscopes),</b> multiphoton fluorescence <b>microscopes</b> are not strictly confocal <b>microscopes.</b> The term confocal arises from {{the presence of a}} diaphragm in the conjugated focal plane (confocal). This diaphragm is usually absent in multiphoton <b>microscopes.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{electron}} <b>microscope</b> directs {{a focused}} {{beam of electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, electron microscopes are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected <b>Microscope</b> is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, {{which is more than}} enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron <b>microscope</b> a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} optical <b>microscopes</b> {{are widely}} used as imaging tools across many scientific disciplines. Various imaging modes and contrast mechanisms have been developed, ranging from conventional brightfield <b>microscopes</b> to superresolving fluorescence <b>microscopes</b> with resolutions well below the diffraction limit. These <b>microscopes</b> have found particular application in imaging of biological specimens due to their abilities in imaging biologica...|$|R

50|$|The {{requirement}} for an enhanced {{signal to noise}} ratio to maximize localization precision determines the frequent combination of this concept with widefield fluorescent <b>microscopes</b> allowing optical sectioning, such as total internal reflection fluorescence <b>microscopes</b> (TIRF) and light sheet fluorescence <b>microscopes.</b>|$|R
5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} has a {{wide and}} various applications on the chemical, biochemical, physical, material and mineralogical sciences. Laue`s said that 'has extended the power of on serving minute structure ten thousand times beyond that of the optical <b>microscope.</b> X-ray diffraction produced a <b>microscope</b> with atomic resolution which shows the atoms and their electron distribution.|$|E
5|$|A common path {{interferometer}} is a {{class of}} interferometer in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along the same path. Fig.4 illustrates the Sagnac interferometer, the fibre optic gyroscope, the point diffraction interferometer, and the lateral shearing interferometer. Other examples of common path interferometer include the Zernike phase contrast <b>microscope,</b> Fresnel's biprism, the zero-area Sagnac, and the scatterplate interferometer.|$|E
5|$|A more area-selective {{method is}} {{electron}} energy loss spectroscopy, which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a transmission electron <b>microscope</b> when it interacts with {{a portion of}} a sample. The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.|$|E

5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his <b>microscope</b> was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a <b>microscope,</b> convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron <b>microscope</b> in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light <b>microscope</b> image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{began to}} quickly develop and grow with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's {{dramatic}} {{improvement of the}} <b>microscope.</b> It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.|$|E

40|$|With {{pressure}} on universities to teach larger class sizes with fewer resources university teachers are increasingly looking to technology to enhance student learning. A trial comparing virtual and optical <b>microscopes</b> in the face-to-face teaching of histology and pathology labs was undertaken. The laboratory classes were delivered to third year Chiropractic undergraduates, studying full-time on-campus. The students were randomly allocated to either virtual or optical microscopy in their labs. Students {{were asked to}} reflect on their learning experiences with the <b>microscopes.</b> Data presented shows the students perceptions of their learning experiences with the <b>microscopes,</b> and suggests that virtual <b>microscopes</b> were easy to use and were used for self-directed study by students. It also suggests that while optical <b>microscopes</b> may promote more group discussion of histology and pathology in laboratory settings they were harder to use than the virtual <b>microscopes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Blood film {{examination}} {{may reveal}} basophilic stippling of {{red blood cells}} (dots in red blood cells visible through a <b>microscope),</b> {{as well as the}} changes normally associated with iron-deficiency anemia (microcytosis and hypochromasia). However, basophilic stippling is also seen in unrelated conditions, such as megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 (colbalamin) and folate deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pisciodorus {{is similar}} in form to Tylopilus tabacinus. Unlike, T.tabacinus however, B.pisciodorus has spores that are hyaline in mass, and dark {{yellowish}} brown rather than hyaline when viewed with a light <b>microscope.</b> Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that is apparent in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a <b>microscope</b> can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional <b>microscope</b> because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E
50|$|Scanning probe <b>microscopes</b> also analyze {{a single}} point in the sample and then scan the probe over a {{rectangular}} sample region to build up an image. As these <b>microscopes</b> do not use electromagnetic or electron radiation for imaging they {{are not subject to}} the same resolution limit as the optical and electron <b>microscopes</b> described above.|$|R
50|$|Scanning probe <b>microscopes</b> and {{scanning}} electron <b>microscopes</b> cannot do {{any form}} of optical sectioning as these <b>microscopes</b> only interact with {{the surface of a}} sample. Total internal reflection microscopy is a fluorescent microscopy technique, which intentionally restricts observation to either the top or bottom surfaces of a sample, but with extremely high depth resolution.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} (Jonas-Dwyer & Sudweeks, 2007) {{indicated that}} when virtual <b>microscopes</b> {{were introduced to}} third year health science students {{as part of their}} histology and pathology laboratory work, no detrimental effects were found. To investigate the use of virtual <b>microscopes</b> further, an extended study was undertaken with both second and third year health sciences students. In this paper, we report the results of students’ learning approaches and compare the outcomes to identify and evaluate changes in students’ learning approaches when using virtual <b>microscopes</b> rather than optical <b>microscopes...</b>|$|R

5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear brown. Viewing {{them with a}} light <b>microscope</b> reveals finer details of their structure: they are roughly spherical but end {{abruptly}} in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and their size is between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7µm. The spores are in amyloid, meaning they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.|$|E

Flexure mechanisms created via folding enable a flat compact design. Structural loops in folded paper provide kinematic constraints {{as a means}} for passive self-alignment. This light, rugged instrument can survive harsh field conditions while providing a diversity of imaging capabilities, thus serving wide-ranging applications for cost-effective, portable <b>microscopes</b> in science and education...|$|R
