5|$|The book {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large <b>middle</b> <b>ground.</b> Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly {{facing each}} other, but sailing on {{opposite}} tacks. In order to engage, {{and to avoid}} some shoals (known as the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ground)</b> {{near the mouth of}} the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a manoeuvre that reversed his line of battle, but enabled it to line up with the French fleet as its ships exited the bay. This placed the squadron of Hood, his most aggressive commander, {{at the rear of the}} line, and that of Admiral Francis Samuel Drake in the van.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane has noted that there are three views. The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
5|$|Hareide {{was active}} in student politics. His {{involvement}} included terms {{as a member of}} the student parliament at the University of Bergen, as the leader of the Student Union of the Norwegian School of Economics 19941995, and as a board member of the national student union 19931994. During the period in student politics, Hareide held a Christian democratic <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> between radical (such as later socialist politician Aslak Sira Myhre) and conservative representatives, an experience he has described as educational.|$|E
5|$|Historically, migratory whales such as blue, fin, sei {{were very}} {{abundant}} in the island waters, but were severely reduced in numbers to near-extinction by commercial and illegal hunts including the mass illegal hunts by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 1970s. Southern right and sperm were most severely hunted among these, hence the area was called the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ground</b> by whalers. It is likely that these two were once seasonal residents around the island where right whales prefer sheltered, very shallow bays while sperm whales mainly inhabit deep waters.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is based}} upon Cochrane's {{doctoral}} thesis, which was completed at the London School of Economics, and builds upon subjects he had discussed in previous publications, including his first book. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory. It was published by Columbia University Press as the second book in their series Critical Perspectives on Animals, edited by Gary Francione and Gary Steiner. Critics {{from a variety of}} backgrounds responded positively to the book, focussing on how Cochrane had found a <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> between traditional animal rights philosophy and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, {{with the staff}} of Awakening returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> between the two releases.|$|E
5|$|As a teacher, Sudirman {{taught his}} {{students}} lessons on morality using {{examples from the}} lives of the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others.|$|E

5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a <b>middle</b> <b>ground.</b> Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner sought {{increased}} {{integration with}} other Latin American countries. He revived {{and tried to}} strengthen the Mercosur trade bloc and improved relations with Brazil, but without automatically aligning with that country, the regional power of South America. The president tried to keep a <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> between Brazil and Venezuela, since he considered the Brazilian Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva too conservative, and the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez too anti-American. Kirchner worked with centre-left presidents Lula and Chilean Ricardo Lagos and the left-wing rulers Chávez, Fidel Castro from Cuba and Evo Morales from Bolivia. He established a political alliance with Chávez's government, and by 2008, Argentinian exports to Venezuela were quadruple what they were in 2002. A bilateral military commission was established with Venezuela, through which some technological exchange took place.|$|E

5|$|Le Trésor De Rackham Le Rouge began {{serialisation}} as a daily {{strip in}} Le Soir from 19 February 1943. The {{title of the}} new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in the newspaper two days previously. In Belgium, it was then published in a 62-page book format by Editions Casterman in 1944. Red Rackham's Treasure contained one of Hergé's two favourite illustrations from The Adventures of Tintin. It combines three actions encapsulating a sequence of events into one drawing: Haddock striding up the beach in the foreground, the rowboat being brought ashore in the <b>middle</b> <b>ground,</b> and the Sirius weighing anchor in the background.|$|E
5|$|The family {{received}} the video from Capaldi on 3 November 2014. After viewing the video, Thomas felt encouraged to attend his grandmother's funeral. In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Ross Goodall explained that Capaldi's mention of sadness resonated with the child due to his experience of grief over his grandmother's death. He discussed {{the manner in which}} Thomas perceived emotions as a strict dichotomy between positive and negative without a <b>middle</b> <b>ground.</b> Thomas interpreted from the video that it was all right to feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred. Ross Goodall told The Guardian that before viewing the video from Capaldi, his son had not wanted to attend the funeral.|$|E
5|$|The psionic and technologically adept Protoss {{have access}} to {{powerful}} units and machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shields and localized warp capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy {{of the quality of}} their units over the quantity. The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies. The humanoid Terrans provide a <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible.

5|$|The {{remaining}} {{parts of}} the castle continued {{to be used as}} a manor house into the 14th century. By the 18th century, however, Dolbadarn Castle was ruined and uninhabited. From the 1760s onwards, however, it became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque. Typically the castle was painted in the <b>middle</b> <b>ground,</b> allowing the viewer's eye to contrast its ruined outline with the lakes and mountains of Snowdonia; frequently the landscape was misrepresented by the artist, to create a more striking or dramatic effect. J. M. W. Turner's 1800 work Dolbadarn Castle depicted the back-lit castle looming over the landscape and became particularly famous, but the paintings of the castle by Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby also represent important artistic works of the period.|$|E
5|$|M-13/M-84 {{crosses the}} west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz Nature Area to <b>Middle</b> <b>Ground</b> island. The highway {{continues}} over the east channel on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge, a drawbridge, to Lafayette Avenue {{on the eastern}} bank of the river. At the intersection with Broadway Street, M-13 turns southward, and M-84 continues eastward two more blocks. Turning north on Garfield Street, the highway runs parallel to the river through a residential area. North of the 14th Street intersection, Garfield Street curves northeasterly into Washington Avenue, passing {{to the east of}} an industrial complex on the river. At the intersection with McKinley Street, a one-way street, M-84 meets the eastbound direction of M-25 and BS I-75. One block north, M-84 terminates at the intersection with 7th Street, which carries westbound M-25 and BS I-75; both intersections also mark BS I-75's terminus immediately east of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis worsens {{with the}} {{severity}} of injury. Most TBIs are mild and do not cause permanent or long-term disability; however, all severity levels of TBI {{have the potential to}} cause significant, long-lasting disability. Permanent disability is thought to occur in 10% of mild injuries, 66% of moderate injuries, and 100% of severe injuries. Most mild TBI is completely resolved within threeweeks, and almost all people with mild TBI are able to live independently and return to the jobs they had before the injury, although a portion have mild cognitive and social impairments. Over 90% of people with moderate TBI are able to live independently, although a portion require assistance in areas such as physical abilities, employment, and financial managing. Most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover enough to live independently; <b>middle</b> <b>ground</b> is less common. Coma, as it is closely related to severity, is a strong predictor of poor outcome.|$|E

Because of the CPW feeder of antenna, the <b>middle</b> <b>grounds</b> are connected together with mutual effect in high-frequency band of UWB. The defected ground transformation reduces coupling of connected ground, and the center short-circuited strip plays a role of reflector between two antennas.

These views and the wider landscape of which they form a part are highly valued by the community and are bound up in the siting of the fortification for coastal defence purposes and the sense of security it has afforded Townsville since 1891.|$|R
