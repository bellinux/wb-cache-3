This calcium transportation control is responsible for its numerous physiological roles among which are control of neuronal activity, cardiac excitability, neuromuscular transmission, <b>muscular</b> contraction, vasomotor <b>tone,</b> blood pressure, and peripheral blood flow (Fawcet et al. 1999), whereas the analgesic properties are due to NMDA receptor blocking actions.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF) in modulating arteriolar tone in hypertension, a synthetic 25 AA human ANF-analogue (anaritide) was infused intraarterially in the forearm vascular bed of five patients with mild hypertension. A dose-dependent increase in blood flow (plethysmographic technique) was seen at rates covering a thousand-fold range (0. 008, 0. 08, 0. 8, 8. 0 micrograms/dl tissue/min x 15 minutes each). At the lowest infusion rate, the forearm blood flow increment was associated with changes in local venous ANF concentrations comparable with those reported during biological stimuli in hypertensive man and consistent with an ANF physiologic role in forearm arterioles of hypertensive patients. However, at local venous concentrations greater than 1000 pg/ml, ANF did not relax forearm vessels by more than about one-fourth of the total forearm vasodilator capacity (as assessed through a maximally active ischemic stimulus). These data confirm the low potency of ANF as an endogenous vasodilator, although vasodilator potency is not a necessary requirement for physiologic systems involved in the regulation of <b>muscular</b> vascular <b>tone.</b> Systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, and contralateral flow did not change during the study {{in spite of the}} markedly increased peripheral ANF levels recirculating from the local forearm administration.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} differences in rectal wall contractility between healthy volunteers and patients with chronic severe constipation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Whether motor function of the rectum contributes to slow-transit constipation is unknown. Measurements of rectal contractility have been performed traditionally with perfused catheters or microtransducers. The rectal barostat is a new technique that quantifies the volume of air within an infinitely compliant intrarectal bag maintained at constant pressure; decreases in bag volume therefore reflect increases in rectal <b>muscular</b> contractility (<b>tone).</b> Increases in volume reflect decreased contractility. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers (ten women and five men; mean age, 36 years) and eight patients (seven women and one man; mean age, 44 years) were studied. Barostat recordings were made for 1 hour before and after a meal. Randomly, neostigmine (0. 5 mg) or glucagon (1 unit) was then given intravenously. After 1 hour, the other medication was given. RESULTS: The fasting rectal volume was similar in the patient and control groups (113 +/- 7 mL vs. 103 +/- 4 mL, respectively; p > 0. 05). Compared with controls, constipated patients had a significantly lower reduction in rectal volume after a meal (constipated, 35 +/- 8 % vs. controls, 65 +/- 7 %; p < 0. 05) and after neostigmine administration (constipated, 39 +/- 6 % vs. controls, 58 +/- 6 %; p < 0. 05). Moreover, constipated patients had a smaller increase in rectal volume after glucagon administration than did controls (28 +/- 6 % vs. 64 +/- 18 %, respectively; p < 0. 05. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in rectal wall contractility in response to feeding, a cholinergic agonist, and a smooth muscle relaxant were decreased in constipated patients. These findings suggest that an abnormality of rectal muscular wall contractility is present in constipated patients...|$|R
5000|$|The ideal “slenderness” {{for women}} is being muscular for men. The media portrays the ideal image of men to be upscale, strong, and muscular. These ideals are seen mainly in {{advertisements}} and movies, with an increasingly heavy focus on fitness. [...] An {{example of this is}} Men’s Health, which serves male audiences who are interested in fitness and health. This magazine and other media portray to men that the more muscles they have the better off they will be. The male physique is often seen chiseled and shirtless in many movies and television programs. These images of perfect bodies stem a fear appeal in men. This fear is displayed in feelings of “embarrassment and non-masculinity” if the representation of a man’s body is not <b>toned</b> and <b>muscular.</b> The muscled body has recently lost its associations with manual labor and has become a symbol of willpower, energy, and control. The toned body is seen as representing success. With this pressure put on men to be <b>muscular</b> and <b>toned,</b> the media is now an equal opportunity discriminator. Men’s bodies don’t measure up to the standards of society anymore either. The pressure than men feel to achieve this body image often leads to physical problems, as men become willing to put their health at risk for the way the look. The idea that the amount of space consumed is equivalent to dominance had been a concept throughout all of history, as bigger men were often able to provide better protection and were more successful hunters. This mentality that with size comes dominance can lead to a refusal to lose weight from men who need to lose the weight. Men would rather be unhealthy but uphold this stereotype of men than to lose the weight and appear less dominant.|$|R

During each sexual encounter, people {{consciously}} and unconsciously seek their casual sex partners according to different attributes. Influential to a sexual network, research focusing on quantifying the effects of physical appearance on sexual network has been sparse. We evaluated the application of Log odds score (LOD) to assess the mixing patterns of 326 {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) in Hong Kong in their networking of casual sex partners by Body Image Type (BIT). This involved an analysis of 1, 196 respondents-casual sex partner pairs. Seven BITs were used in the study: Bear, Chubby, Slender, Lean <b>toned,</b> <b>Muscular,</b> Average and Other. A hierarchical pattern was observed in the preference of MSM for casual sex partners by the latter's BIT.

Marked avoidance was found between men who self-identified as Chubby and men of Other body type (within-group-LOD: 1. 25 - 2. 89; between-group-LOD: <- 1).

The new capabilities offered by this technology (e. g. high tissue penetrance, low toxicity) have opened a whole new era of investigations in modern biomedical research. However, the potential of using this promising technique in tissues of living animals is greatly limited by the intrinsic irregular movements that are caused by cardiac and respiratory cycles and <b>muscular</b> and vascular <b>tone.</b> Here, we show real-time imaging of the brain, spinal cord, sciatic nerve and myenteric plexus of living mice using a new automated program, named Intravital_Microscopy_Toolbox, that removes frames corrupted with motion artifacts from time-lapse videos. Our approach involves generating a dissimilarity score against precalculated reference frames in a specific reference channel, thus allowing the gating of distorted, out-of-focus or translated frames. Since the algorithm detects the uneven peaks of image distortion caused by irregular animal movements, the macro allows a fast and efficient filtering of the image sequence. In addition, extra features have been implemented in the macro, such as XY registration, channel subtraction, extended field of view with maximum intensity projection, noise reduction with average intensity projections, and automated timestamp and scale bar overlay. Thus, the Intravital_Microscopy_Toolbox macro for ImageJ provides convenient tools for biologists who are performing in vivo two-photon imaging in tissues prone to motion artifacts...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this case study and {{evidence}} based literature analysis {{is to determine the}} gross motor benefits to and feasibility of early independent power mobility on children with mobility impairments. Background: For children 3 years old and under, with mobility limitations, power mobility devices are not currently available. Having independent mobility has been linked to improvements in cognition, socialization, language and motor development. Supplying children with mobility impairments with early adaptive power mobility could improve overall functioning in later life. Case Description: Subject is a wonderful, loving 3 year old boy with spastic cerebral palsy. He started physical and occupational therapy 2 years ago after a referral from his pediatrician. Developmentally, the subject has the gross motor skills comparable to a 4 month old child, demonstrating emerging ability to roll to and from supine to prone, and does not have access to his environment. The subject is receiving a battery powered car modified for accessibility to provide independent mobility, which he has never experienced before. He will continue with physical therapy POC focusing on postural control, core stabilization, contracture prevention, management of <b>tone,</b> <b>muscular</b> strength and endurance training, and motor control training with an new dimension of independent mobility. The car will be modified by pediatric physical therapists who are experts on the musculoskeletal system and inspected by an electrical engineer. Outcomes: A review of current literature highlighted the lack of research that has been done in this area. The current level of evidence is not sufficient in answering the PICO question of "Are functional and developmental gross motor improvements made when the intervention of early independent power mobility is implemented into a plan of care of a child with functional mobility impairments?" The evidence does not show statistically significant data for improvements in gross motor skills; however, generalizable improvements in overall development are seen. Discussion: The results of this review, are inconclusive as to what gross motor skills are improved or affected when independent power mobility is implemented into a plan of care, however, they support the thought that this intervention has a positive effect on overall development. Of the 8 studies there was limited and variable evidence for the benefits of power mobility interventions in children with mobility impairments. The majority of the studies found that functional mobility was improved and general development progressed, however, the effects of early independent power mobility on gross motor development have not been determined. More research {{needs to be done in}} this field of physical therapy as implementing the use of independent mobility experiences into a plan of care has the potential to benefit the overall development of the child...|$|R
