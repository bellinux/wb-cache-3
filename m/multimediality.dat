40|$|A {{large number}} of {{scholars}} consider <b>multimediality</b> {{as one of the}} essential features of online media. Distinguishing between "multi-media" and "multiple media", most researchers define the <b>multimediality</b> used in online media as the integration of two or more mediums or media formats in the process of reporting for online journalism. Based on the theoretical literature, the proposed paper is intended to shed light on the specifications and features of <b>multimediality</b> developed in major news websites localized in Albania. The research on <b>multimediality</b> of the news websites is focused in two plans: At first are studied separately multimedia elements that are used in online news reporting. Thus, making a kind of deconstruction of the concept of multi-media, this paper studies the use and specifics of photos, info-graphics, animations, videos and audios, analysing them as separate multimedia elements used in online news reporting. Later, in another plan, these multimedia elements are studied as part of "multimedia storytelling" package. Multimedia storytelling applied through integrated multimedia package, represents actually the highest level of <b>multimediality</b> of a news website and reflects the maximum use of the web capacity in this regard. The work undertaken in this paper aims to highlight the experience and the problems of the <b>multimediality</b> applied in major news websites in Albania, in comparison with models, achievements and best global practices in this field. Under this optics it is hoped that this trial be a useful study for media agencies operating in the field of new media and online journalism. Analysis and conclusions of this study are supported by an extensive empirical research conducted {{over a period of several}} years by the author of this research. The study also offers relevant and useful recommendations for online media activity in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to reflect on the {{question}} of multimodality in a glottodidactic context, by way of an analysis of internet specialist texts (IST). Here, I take multimodality to mean all the communicative modalities undertaken by man, as distinguished from <b>multimediality,</b> which is defined as an interaction of various technical media in delivering a message. This two dimensions (multimodality and <b>multimediality)</b> are strictly related and interdependent. First, I present a few terminological remarks about expressions that are of key importance for understanding the subject-matter at hand: multimodality, <b>multimediality,</b> electronic hypertext and internet specialist texts. Next, I describe selected changes to the glottodidactic system caused by the Internet, with particular emphasis on changes in the way in which internet texts are formulated. Referring to F. Grucza’s anthropocentric theory of human languages, I draw attention to the structure of internet hypertexts and internet specialist texts and the possibility of a glottodidactic description thereof. Regarding the latter, I present the criteria governing a glottodidactic analysis of internet specialist texts, after which I enumerate and discuss the determinants for applying internet texts to the teaching of specialist languages. Finally, I indicate new areas of research into the glottodidactic potential of IST, taking into account the multimodal dimension. 1123324 Journal of Multimodal Communication Studie...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the characteristics of the sport journalistic weblog. To achieve this we have used the following questions: Which themes are included in the sport journalistic weblog? How much text does the sport journalistic weblog content? How often is <b>multimediality</b> incorporated in the sport journalistic weblog? Which references occur in the sport journalistic weblog? How many hyperlinks occur in the sport journalistic weblog? How many of the hyperlinks is internal respective external? How often does the sport journalistic weblog offers possibilities to interaction between the journalist and the reader? How often does interaction between the journalist and the reader occur? The theories we have used is both online publishing and Jan Schmidt’s analytical framework on blogs. Online publishing describes an important part in our paper, online journalism, which in turn describes three important definitions for this paper; hypertextuality, <b>multimediality</b> and interactivity. Jan Schmidt’s theory is central to understand the phenomena, and functions as a starting point in the analyze part. The method that we have used is a quantitative content analysis with a descriptive approach. This paper consists mostly of reliable sources, with only a few exceptions which we have constrained in our work. This means almost all sources are science material. The conclusion {{of this paper is}} as follows: The most appeared theme in the sport journalistic weblog is athlete, followed by the official fact theme, and from then on the private life theme. The general conclusion about the first question is that the most common theme is the athlete theme. Text is counted as words, and the sport journalistic weblog contents 177 words (related to its mean value). But note that the variation in words is quite large in different weblogs. <b>Multimediality</b> is almost exclusively excluded in the material, only pictures appear in some degree in the weblogs. The most common reference in the sport journalistic weblog is the journalist’s personal experience and references of complete or parts of quotes and interviews. 227 hyperlinks appeared in the sport journalistic weblog, where 215 was internal and 12 external. Another conclusion in this paper is that there’s always an opportunity for interaction between the journalist and the reader. Indeed this possibility creates chances of interaction, but its importance is quite insignificant because it’s not being used. It is, however, more regular with interaction from the reader than the journalist. Therefore we can conclude that the interaction is more like a one-way communication, rather than dialogical...|$|E

General news sites, online news papers, newsgroups, RSS-feeds, news alerts, online news forums, newsletters, wikinews sites, … all these news media cover daily news in their own, specific way. The main purpose of this presentation is not {{to focus on the}} news content itself, but on the formal and structural features of the online news media types. Too often, the internet is studied as one, uniform medium instead of a multiform or meta-medium with different types of online news. More specifically, the level of interactivity, <b>multimediality</b> and hypertextuality (the three main features of the internet and online journalism) differs between the online news media. First, interactivity is related to both the user’s control over content as to one’s possibility to give feedback or start a conversation about a specific topic. Second, <b>multimediality</b> is the extend to which different modalities are integrated into one message. Finally, hypertext {{is the way in which}} different parts and bits of news messages are connected. The result is a non-lineair type of storytelling with one anchor text and a (internal or external) linked matrix of according chunks of information. According to the Limited Capacity Model of Lang (2000), the Cognitive Mediation Model of Eveland (2001) and multiple theories within the domain of cognitive psychology (e. g. structural isomorphism), the formal and structural features have an effect on the cognitive processes while learning from the news media. In this presentation, we discuss the methodological challenges of this research. First, we present the operationalisation of the three features of online news. Second, we present the results of a content analysis and examine the difficulties of defining a sample and recording unit. Eventually, we underline the need for a combination of multiple research techniques (content analysis, eye tracking study, think aloud protocol) to fully examine the possible effects of formal and structural features on the cognitive processes while learning from the news media. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Key-words: hypertext; web journalism; online jornalism More than {{a decade}} after the {{beginning}} of online journalism, the great expectations of this field of expertise remain unfulfilled. Hypertextuality, <b>multimediality,</b> and interactivity remain original marks as yet unexplored by journalism made on the web (though not for the web). In the specific case of hypertextuality, the subject of this study, its little use is linked with journalists ’ time constraints, the absence of an organizational model not limited to copying printed papers, and the fear that readers may reject non-linear reading (Paul, 2005). The latter reason is likely what is most hindering the evolution of web journalism, despite the great potential of online news formed by networks of linked texts. To begin with, it frees the reader, giving them the option to create their own path of reading. Additionally, it offers extra contextual information about the subject, allowing readers to increase their knowledge on the subject according to their own interests...|$|E

40|$|Book synopsis: Dante on View opens an {{important}} new dimension in Dante studies: {{for the first}} time a collection of essays analyses the presence of the Italian Medieval poet Dante Alighieri in the visual and performing arts from the Middle Ages to the present day. The essays in this volume explore the image of Dante emerging in medieval illuminated manuscripts and later ideological and nostalgic uses of the poet. The volume also demonstrates the rich diversity of projects inspired by the Commedia both as an overall polysemic structure and as a repository of scenes, which generate a repertoire for painters, actors and film-makers. In its original <b>multimediality,</b> Dante's Commedia stimulates the performance of readers and artists working in different media from manuscript to stage, from ballet to hyperinstruments, from film to television. Through such a variety of media, the reception of Dante in the visual and performing arts enriches our understanding of the poet and of the arts represented at key moments of formal and structural change in the European cultural world...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] This article {{proposes a}} {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} newspaper apps developed for tablets and smartphones within different media systems. It studies the <b>multimediality,</b> interactivity and commercialization models adopted by newspaper publishers and journalists for these apps. The theoretical framework embraces two main topics: the media system models, starting from Hallin and Mancini’s proposal, and {{the characteristics of the}} media systems, particularly in the countries selected for this sample, focusing on the digital and mobile media scenario. In order to collect comparable data from a common source, we have selected indicators from Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2016. The total number of app versions analysed came to 148 (81 for smartphones and 67 for tablets) from 20 newspapers in 10 different countries. One conclusion is that newspapers’ commitment to the tablet and smartphone, in general, tends to be conservative and far from independent of pre-existing print and web-based media. This article shows how media systems have become more complex in the digital scenario, in which apps are an important, but not exclusive, aspect. So, it is necessary to take into account trends in news globalization and ‘convergent journalism’. Finally, this research confirms that crossplatform management and multichannel strategies are still weak, which has consequences for the innovation of app editions...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{spread of}} {{hypermedia}} {{has led to}} a proliferation of didactic software available on the market, but it is getting more and more difﬁ cult to choose the right product. To meet the teacher’s need to acquire methodologies and tools supporting her/his new function of critical evaluator of didactic SW, we have created HyperValu@tor, a tool for the multidisciplinary assessment of didactic hypermedia. HyperValu@tor takes into account the main quality indicators guaranteeing overall teaching efﬁ cacy (content, <b>multimediality,</b> interactivity, navigability, style). Using the questionnaire supplied, the teacher/evaluator assigns a score (from 0 to 2) to a series of questions probing these quality indicators. All the indicators need to be considered in order to achieve an overall assessment, but if only some aspects of a hypermedia need to be judged, the single indicators can be assessed separately with HyperValu@tor. This dynamic navigation, offering the possibility to choose which indicators to evaluate, is one of the strong points of HyperValu@tor. But its most salient feature is that it allows teachers/evaluators to set up collaborative activities through the Web. Unlike other tools in the ﬁ eld, with HyperValu@tor it is possible to make a public evaluation, whereby several users can collaborate to achieve an assessment of the same product...|$|E
40|$|The {{digitalization}} {{of education}} systems {{is presented as}} a possible way to match the concerns of a knowledge based economy with those of an inclusive information society. To meet this double challenge, education systems are asked to shift from a ‘traditional school’ to an ‘Education 2. 0 ’ model, introducing innovative pedagogies through the use of ICT devices characterized by interactivity and <b>multimediality.</b> The article investigates over the presence and breadth of this shift within secondary schools of the region Sardinia, Italy, since the introduction of Interactive Whiteboards (IWB), to focus next on the gender dimension of change. Empirical evidence drawn from an evaluative research adopting a mixed method approach is presented and analysed: first, an idealtype of classroom organization after IWB introduction is offered, then the main gender dynamics emerging in reorganized classrooms are considered, focussing on interaction among its main actors’, namely teachers and students. Conclusions suggest that, although a less gendered approach to technology is observed in classroom practices enhanced by Education 2. 0 models, these changes haven’t (yet) led to a reconfiguration of the symbolic representations and tacit assumptions structuring school settings, still hampering fairer educational and professional trajectories for women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths) ...|$|E

The study focuses on news stories introduced on the front page and the main method used is descriptive content analysis. Comparison is made across media (print versus online) and across countries (Britain versus Finland). Two general questions aimed to be answered are: how the Internet has affected newspapers, what differences can be found in Finnish and British journalistic cultures. The data was originally gathered for European A COST A 20 project, which studies Internet’s impact on mass media. It was found in this study that British and Finnish newspapers do not differ from each other greatly. The largest amount of space on the front page is devoted to news in print and online. Domestic news is the most popular geographical location of news stories. The most popular topics were politics, economics, crime and safety. Online newspapers do not use the potential web publishing offers. Personalisation is nonexistent. <b>Multimediality</b> and hypertextuality, linking outside own outlet is shallow.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} New Drastic Musicology {{based on the}} ludomusical {{premises}} of play, <b>multimediality,</b> and interactivity. Ludomusicology offers the exciting perspective of going beyond even the pioneering historical and technological overviews, case studies, and explorations of genre conventions {{that the study of}} game music has produced over the last decade. It necessitates innovations in three levels: (1) musical analysis, (2) musicological research themes and (3) musicological critical theory. Ludomusicology revolutionises the score analysis that musicologists have employed since the late nineteenth century. Since the concept of a score is obsolete in game music, ludomusicology must, rather, analyse the factors cooperating in the musical underlining of game plot and gameplay. I identify these as musical affect (connotation and identification), musical literacy (habituated signification), and musical interaction (play). The integration of these three factors into musical analysis leads to the genesis of entirely new musicological research fields. How does musical literacy in games relate to that in other multimedial genres? How does musical play in games relate to music-historical notions of play and performance? These new research questions, finally, evoke meta-critical reflections. Ludomusicology, with its pervasive attention to multimedial and interactive performativity, necessitates a rethinking of Abbate’s notion of “drastic” musicology. Ludomusicology can alter an entire discipline. Innovating the discipline on the levels of object analysis, research themes as well as critical reflection, ludomusicology can engender “The New Drastic”...|$|E

This research focuses on stereotypes in mobile dating apps and aims {{to answer the following}} research question: how normative assumptions about the heterosexual and male homosexual communities can be embedded in the affordances of Grindr and Tinder. Little research has focused on Grindr and Tinder as applications that include assumptions about their target community. In order to explore stereotypes and prejudices linked to the communities built in the affordances of the apps, an affordance analysis has been applied, with a specific focus on affordances that might be specifically related to assumptions about those groups. It has been considered that the affordances are found in the context between the actor and the object, therefore, subject to the environment in which they are analyzed. The following affordances have been analyzed in this thesis: authenticity and anonymity; proximity; immediacy; communication flow; locatability; community identification; accessibility, availability and portability; <b>multimediality,</b> little effort and playfulness; shallowness; legitimacy; homogenization. The results show that assumptions linked to both communities may be re-enforced by some of the affordances that have been analyzed. Promiscuity, sexually driven relationships, hyper-sexualized and impersonal behavior, little diversity in the community, and high value on casual sex are stereotypes linked to the male homosexual community. Perpetuation of traditional gender-roles, romantic approach in dating leading to marriage, and narcissism are stereotypes associated with the heterosexual community...|$|E

40|$|Popular {{culture and}} tourism are intertwining. The use {{of film and}} {{literature}} amongst destination marketing organisations is a global trend, but how can we understand this phenomenon and all the processes involved? Up to now popular culture and tourism have been researched mainly from a single media perspective. However, {{it is difficult to}} separate the impact of one media product from that of another, and it is now time to highlight the processes of <b>multimediality.</b> Moreover, this far most of the research has focused on destination marketing issues and not on the tourists involved in these processes. Therefore, it is relevant to explore in which sense these intertwined media products are part of tourists’ activities as well as of their understandings of places. The aim of this dissertation is to explore the different processes that emerge when tourism and popular cultural media products interweave, placing special emphasis on tourist performances and destinations. Roslyn Chapel, which is featured in The Da Vinci Code, and the hereto related tourism activities is the case studied in this dissertation.

The {{attention is focused on}} the Italian journalism, compared to the Portuguese one. The paper presents a research based on the analysis of all apps for iPad of the Italian daily newspapers, in order to study the main features of the new digital formats with respect to properties related to four thematic areas (<b>multimediality,</b> hypertextuality, social media models, and business strategies). The Italian newspaper apps are compared with the main Portuguese ones with respect to the same characteristics, with a communicative and social perspective, focusing on the opportunities and the limits of tablets in the editorial and information system. The comparison shows that all the Italian newspapers offer pdf edition on iPad, although with different levels of innovation. The Portuguese context is different for two main reasons: on one hand the strategies of the publishers are more variegate and some of them don’t offer the pdf release on the other hand a website oriented model is more common. The innovation is weak in both of them, even if there are efforts {{to take advantage of the}} new media opportunities. The paper contributes to the debate about new forms of journalism and allows to reflect on the new challenges which iPad and other mobile devices represent for journalists and publishers. They are not based only on tablets, but also on newspapers, Internet and the capability to manage the relationship between the different media...|$|E
