40|$|Fish {{production}} {{can lead}} to discharge of wastes and have negative impacts on the environment. It is therefore important to carefully monitor and plan the development of aquaculture. A model that can simulate fish growth {{on the basis of}} available fish species and local conditions (like water quality and quantity and quality of fish feed) could therefore be extremely useful. Since growth strongly depends on feed intake, a growth model should be able to predict <b>maximum</b> <b>feed</b> intake of fish under ad libitum feeding. This thesis aimed at investigating some potential mechanisms for feed intake regulation and predicting <b>maximum</b> <b>feed</b> intake in the light of these hypothesized mechanisms using a theoretical modeling approach. Among a wide range of factors involved in feed intake regulation, glucose and oxygen are two factors of particular interest. The overall hypotheses were: (1) high blood glucose level has a negative effect on feed intake in fish; and (2) dissolved oxygen concentration of the water is a major determinant of feed intake in fish. To investigate the effects of blood glucose on feed intake in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an experiment was done with feeds containing different combinations of carbohydrate and energy levels. The results showed that fish fed a diet high in carbohydrate but low in energy failed to achieve their digestible energy requirement, suggesting that a high level of blood glucose suppresses feed intake in Nile tilapia. A dynamic explanatory model for fish growth which incorporated metabolite pools as potential regulators of feed intake was then developed. After parameterization and calibration for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), the model gave good prediction of fish growth. The results showed that feed intake regulation could be simulated based on the glucose static theory. The parameterization and simulation results showed the gaps in our quantitative knowledge about the intermediary metabolism in fish. To investigate the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and body weight on <b>maximum</b> <b>feed</b> intake and growth of Nile tilapia, three experiments were conducted with different DO levels and body weight classes. The results provide strong support for the theory that limitation of oxygen supply through the gill surface area results in lower feed intake and growth of fish at low DO concentration. The allometric relationship between gill surface area and body weight results in lower relative feed intake, and therefore lower relative growth in bigger fish than in smaller fish. The study also demonstrated that the incipient DO (DO above which feed intake of fish remains unchanged) depends to a large extent on body weight and probably on feed composition. The short-term effect of DO on ad libitum feed intake was then simulated based on the balance between oxygen demand and oxygen supply. The model was calibrated and validated using the experimental data from the present study and some additional data from earlier published experiments. The calibration and validation results showed that the model could predict satisfactorily <b>maximum</b> <b>feed</b> intake and growth of Nile tilapia when DO was limiting. However, feed intake when DO was not limiting was not simulated satisfactorily. This was attributed to the empirical equation for <b>maximum</b> <b>feed</b> intake determined by a factor other than DO. In the last chapter, the modeling approaches, the role of glucose and oxygen in feed intake regulation, implications for aquaculture management, reliability of data on <b>maximum</b> <b>feed</b> intake and implications for further research are discussed...|$|R

In other word, it means higher iteration speed corresponds to higher <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>feed</b> rate. To develop interpolator with higher <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>feed</b> rate, the proposed interpolator is aimed to execute the interpolator tasks in concurrent manner. In the recent years, the computer industry has changed a lot in term of hardware development. Multi-core processors were introduced whereby a single computer has two processors working on it and contain multiple logical processors in a single package. By using multi-cores environment, algorithm has to be changed in order to fully utilise the speed of the processors. This situation is also required in interpolator algorithm. The existing interpolator is not using parallel programming which every task have not been execute simultaneous in concurrent manner although using multi-cores processor computer, thus, the more time is needed for the iteration time especially for a complex and large scale of process. The main research objective is to modify the existing Wan Yusoff reference-pulse CNC interpolator and Omirou reference-pulse CNC interpolator using parallel programming to increase <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>feed</b> rate. The proposed interpolator is developed using parallel programming in C/C++ language through Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP). The proposed interpolator was compared with Wan Yusoff (2003) interpolator and Omirou and Nearchau (2006) interpolator through computer simulation and experiment with servomotor.

The system was configured in a cross flow set up and effects of pH, feed flowrate and operation time were explored in relation to the membrane performance (rejection and flux). Acid mine collected from site had a very high concentration of Iron (1. 055 mg/L), sulphate (3639. 301 mg/L) and high levels of hardness due to magnesium ions (523. 011 mg/L). Also, heavy metals were in trace amounts. Experimental results showed that the maximum rejection of iron was 96. 28 % at a pH of 4. 37, <b>maximum</b> <b>feed</b> flowrate of 872 ml/min and the iron permeate concentration was within the potable water standards (less than 0. 100 mg/L) inferring suitability of the membrane for AMD amelioration at the aforementioned pH.

Several studies have shown the value of comparing the functional responses (FRs) of alien and native predators towards native prey, however, the technique is under-explored with herbivorous alien species and {{as a predictor of}} invasiveness as distinct from ecological impact. Here, in China, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to compare the FRs among three herbivorous snail species: the golden apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, a highly invasive and high impact alien listed in " 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species"; Planorbarius corneus, a non-invasive, low impact alien; and the Chinese native snail, Bellamya aeruginosa, when feeding on four locally occurring plant species. Further, by using a numerical response equation, we modelled the population dynamics of the snail consumers. For standard FR parameters, we found that the invasive and damaging alien snail had the highest "attack rates" a, shortest "handling times" h and also the highest estimated <b>maximum</b> <b>feeding</b> rates, 1 /hT, whereas the native species had the lowest attack rates, longest handling times and lowest <b>maximum</b> <b>feeding</b> rates. The non-invasive, low impact alien species had consistently intermediate FR parameters. The invasive alien species had higher population growth potential than the native snail species, whilst that of the non-invasive alien species was intermediate. Thus, while the comparative FR approach has been proposed as a reliable method for predicting the ecological impacts of invasive predators, our results further suggest that comparative FRs could extend to predict the invasiveness and ecological impacts of alien herbivores and should be explored in other taxa and trophic groups to determine the general utility of the approach...|$|R
