5|$|The next {{incident}} {{proved to}} be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop Liberty arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have <b>more</b> <b>wine</b> unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded.|$|E
5|$|For an {{hour the}} {{officers}} drank, Malcolm and Cooke learning {{detailed information about}} the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines, until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to greet the French arrivals. This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at Cavite, Rear-Admiral Don Ignacio María de Álava, who was not aboard, but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat. Each time, the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at gunpoint and taken below decks as prisoners of war. In Malcolm's cabin, the captured officers were informed of their situation, promised release before the British frigates sailed, and offered <b>more</b> <b>wine.</b> The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and donned their clothing. Climbing into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby Pasig River, where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored. Taking the crews by surprise, the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox. These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well-armed, one with a 32-pounder long gun and two with 24-pounder long guns, each supplemented by four swivel guns.|$|E

Until the 1930s {{there were over}} 60 wineries in the Province, producing <b>more</b> <b>wine</b> than Mendoza and San Juan; these were however forbidden by law {{in an effort to}} ensure the settlement of Western Argentina.

25|$|In 2004, {{exports to}} the U.S. {{plummeted}} 59% in value over the previous year. Sales in Britain dropped 33% in value during the same period. The UK, a major market, now imports <b>more</b> <b>wine</b> from Australia than from France. Amongst the possible causes for this economic crisis are that many consumers tend to prefer wine labels that state the variety of grape from which the wine is made, and often find the required French AOC labels difficult to understand.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{widespread}} misconception that wine always improves with age, or that wine improves with extended aging, or that aging potential is an indicator of good wine. Some authorities state that <b>more</b> <b>wine</b> is consumed too old than too young. Aging changes wine, but does not categorically improve it or worsen it. Fruitness deteriorates rapidly, decreasing markedly after only 6 months in the bottle. Due {{to the cost of}} storage, it is not economical to age cheap wines, but many varieties of wine do not benefit from aging, regardless of the quality. Experts vary on precise numbers, but typically state that only 5–10% of wine improves after 1 year, and only 1% improves after 5–10 years.|$|E
25|$|The Worcester {{district}} {{is responsible for}} <b>more</b> <b>wine</b> than any other wine region {{in the country with}} one fifth to one quarter of the entire South African yearly wine production coming from this area. Located just beyond Du Toit's Peak in the Breede River Valley, Worcester includes a broad fertile plain that relies on irrigation due to its dry, arid climate. The area's large and numerous co-operatives produce sizeable amounts of fortified wine as well as Muscadel and Hanepoot based dessert wines. In recent years, the Slanghoek ward and the Breedekloof district have been successful growing botrytised and dry Sauvignon blanc wines. The Worcester {{district is}} home to nearly half of all the Semillon, and a third of Ruby Cabernet, planted in South Africa with sizeable plantings of Colombard and Chenin blanc.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, Argentine winemakers were {{traditionally}} {{more interested}} in quantity than quality with the country consuming 90% of the wine it produces ( [...] per capita according to 2006 figures). Until the early 1990s, Argentina produced <b>more</b> <b>wine</b> {{than any other country}} outside Europe, though the majority of it was considered unexportable. However, the desire to increase exports fueled significant advances in quality. Argentine wines started being exported during the 1990s, and are currently growing in popularity, making it now the largest wine exporter in South America. The devaluation of the Argentine peso in 2002 further fueled the industry as production costs decreased and tourism significantly increased, giving way to a whole new concept of enotourism in Argentina.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{producing}} significantly <b>more</b> <b>wine</b> than neighboring Oregon, Washington wine lags {{far behind}} in consumer recognition {{among the general}} wine market. Wine experts such as Tom Stevenson speculate that {{this is because the}} wine industry in Oregon is uniquely associated with one main varietal--Pinot noir—while Washington has yet to shape an identity around any particular varietal or blend but instead aims to succeed in producing many varietals and blends of high quality. The similarity between the name {{of the state and the}} capital of the United States-Washington DC-may also contribute to the wine industry's lower profile. Master of Wine Bob Betz, who represented Chateau Ste Michelle for 28 years as an educator and now makes wine under his own label, noted that often in his travels internationally and across the United States he would get asked [...] "which side of the Potomac?" [...] that Washington wine grapes were grown on. According to Betz, a significant challenge to the Washington wine industry is increasing consumer awareness and name recognition of the state's AVAs that appear on wine labels. There are 12 AVA's in Washington State.|$|E
