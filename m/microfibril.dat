2500|$|An area {{of active}} {{research}} on microbial cellulose {{is in the}} area of electronic paper. [...] Currently, plant cellulose is used to produce the bulk of traditional paper, but due to its low purity it must be mixed with other substances such as lignin. [...] However, due to microbial cellulose's higher purity and <b>microfibril</b> structure, it may prove to be an excellent candidate for an electronic paper substrate. [...] Microbial cellulose can be fashioned into sheets approximately 100 micrometers thick, about the thickness of normal paper, by a wet synthesis process. [...] The microbial cellulose produces a sturdy substrate with a <b>microfibril</b> structure that allows the paper to be implanted with dopants. [...] Through the application of solutions to the microbial cellulose paper, conductive dopants and electrochromic dyes can be placed into the <b>microfibril</b> structure. [...] The bistable dyes change from clear to dark upon the application of the appropriate voltages, which when placed in a pixel structure, would allow images to be formed. [...] This technology is still in the research stage and has not yet been scaled to commercial production levels. [...] Further research has been done to apply bacterial cellulose as a substrate in electronic devices with the potential to be used as e-book tablets, e-newspapers, dynamic wall papers, rewritable maps and learning tools. Another possible example of bacterial cellulose use in the electronics industry includes the manufacture of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).|$|E
50|$|A {{naturally}} occurring polymer, it {{is composed of}} glucose units connected by a 1-4 beta glycosidic bond. These linear cellulose chains are bundled together as <b>microfibril</b> spiralled together in the walls of plant cell.

There are, however, relatively weak segments of the <b>microfibril</b> with weaker internal bonding.

Walls of these cells consist firstly of regions containing the primary pit fields and composed of <b>microfibrils</b> oriented predominantly transversely. The transverse <b>microfibrils</b> show a progressive disorientation {{from the inside}} {{to the outside of}} the wall which is consistent with the multinet model of wall growth. Between the pit-field regions and running the length of the cells are ribs composed of longitudinally oriented <b>microfibrils.</b> Two types of rib have been found at all stages of cell elongation. In some regions, the wall appears to consist entirely of longitudinal <b>microfibrils</b> so that the rib forms {{an integral part of the}} wall. At the edges of such ribs the <b>microfibrils</b> can be seen to change direction from longitudinal in the rib to transverse in the pit-field region. Often, however, the rib appears to consist of an extra separate layer of longitudinal <b>microfibrils</b> outside a continuous wall of transverse <b>microfibrils.</b> These ribs are quite distinct from secondary wall, which consists of longitudinal <b>microfibrils</b> deposited within the primary wall after elongation has ceased. It is evident that the {{arrangement of}} cellulose <b>microfibrils</b> in a primary wall can be complex and is probably an expression of specific cellular differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Background Cellulose from {{grasses and}} cereals makes {{up much of}} the {{potential}} raw material for biofuel production. It is not clear if cellulose <b>microfibrils</b> from grasses and cereals differ in structure from those of other plants. The structures of the highly oriented cellulose <b>microfibrils</b> in the cell walls of the internodes of the bamboo Pseudosasa amabilis are reported. Strong orientation facilitated {{the use of a}} range of scattering techniques. Results Small-angle neutron scattering provided evidence of extensive aggregation by hydrogen bonding through the hydrophilic edges of the sheets of chains. The <b>microfibrils</b> had a mean centre-to-centre distance of 3. 0 nm in the dry state, expanding on hydration. The expansion on hydration suggests that this distance between centres was through the hydrophilic faces of adjacent <b>microfibrils.</b> However in the other direction, perpendicular to the sheets of chains, the mean, disorder-corrected Scherrer dimension from wide-angle X-ray scattering was 3. 8 nm. It is possible that this dimension is increased by twinning (crystallographic coalescence) of thinner <b>microfibrils</b> over part of their length, through the hydrophobic faces. The wide-angle scattering data also showed that the <b>microfibrils</b> had a relatively large intersheet d-spacing and small monoclinic angle, features normally considered characteristic of primary-wall cellulose. Conclusions Bamboo <b>microfibrils</b> have features found in both primary-wall and secondary-wall cellulose, but are crystallographically coalescent {{to a greater extent than}} is common in celluloses from other plants. The extensive aggregation and local coalescence of the <b>microfibrils</b> are likely to have parallels in other grass and cereal species and to influence the accessibility of cellulose to degradative enzymes during conversion to liquid biofuels...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{orientation}} of cellulose <b>microfibrils</b> within plant cell walls has an important impact on the morphogenesis of plant cells and tissues. Viewing {{the shape of a}} plant cell as a square prism or cylinder with the axis aligning with the primary direction of expansion and growth, the orientation of the <b>microfibrils</b> within the cell wall {{on the sides of the}} cell is known. However, not much is known about their orientation at the ends of the cell. Here we investigate the impact of the orientation of cellulose <b>microfibrils</b> within a plant cell wall at the ends of the cell by solving the equations of linear elasticity numerically. Three different scenarios for the orientation of the <b>microfibrils</b> are considered. The macroscopic elastic properties of the cell wall are obtained using homogenization theory from the microscopic description of the elastic properties of the cell wall <b>microfibrils</b> and wall matrix. It is found that the orientation of the <b>microfibrils</b> in the upper and lower parts of cell walls do not affect the expansion of the cell in the direction of its axis but do affect its expansion in the lateral directions. The arrangement of the <b>microfibrils</b> in the upper and lower parts of cell walls is especially important in the case of directed forces acting on plant cell walls and tissues.

40|$|AbstractWe present ultrastructural and {{biochemical}} {{evidence for}} the turnover of intact fibrillin <b>microfibrils</b> by the serine proteinases, neutrophil elastase, chymotrypsin and trypsin. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy revealed that serine proteinase treatment of intact <b>microfibrils</b> isolated from foetal bovine skin resulted in extensive degradation. <b>Microfibrils</b> were destroyed by neutrophil elastase and effectively disrupted by chymotrypsin and trypsin, with no morphologically identifiable arrays remaining. Evidence of defined fibrillin degradation products was obtained by Western blotting of these enzyme-treated fibrillin assemblies. Fibrillin immunoprecipitated from dermal fibroblast culture medium was also comprehensively degraded by these enzymes. These observations demonstrate that serine proteinases are potent effectors for the physiological and pathological catabolism of <b>microfibrils,</b> and suggest {{a key role in}} elastic fibre degradation...|$|R

40|$|The fine {{structure}} of young root hairs of radish was studied, with {{special attention to}} cytoplasm-wall relationships. Hairs up to 130 / ~ in length were examined after fixation of root tips in glutaraldehyde followed by osmium tetroxide. Microtubules occur axially aligned in the cytoplasm just beneath the plasmalemma, and extend {{from the base of}} the hair to within 2 to 3 ~ of the tip. Poststaining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate clearly reveals in thin sections the presence of the two layers of cellulose <b>microfibrils</b> known from studies on shadowed wall preparations: an outer layer of randomly arranged <b>microfibrils</b> arising at the tip, and a layer of axially oriented <b>microfibrils</b> deposited on the inside of this layer along the sides. The youngest <b>microfibrils</b> of the inner, oriented layer first appear at a distance of about 25 /z from the tip.

40|$|The {{presence}} of elastic fibres in the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides physiologically important elastic properties for many tissues. Until recently, <b>microfibrils,</b> {{one component of}} the ECM, were thought primarily {{to serve as a}} scaffolding on which elastin is deposited during development to form elaunin fibres [1]. The most prominent protein that forms mammalian <b>microfibrils</b> is fibrillin. It is known that mutations in the fibrillin gene cause a heterogenous connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome [2], so information on mechanical properties of <b>microfibrils</b> or their role in tissue function would be useful. <b>Microfibrils</b> are also found in the ECM of some invertebrate tissues, and there is growing evidence that the protein forming the structure is homologous to mammalian fibrillin [3, 4]. It has been shown that the microfibril-based arterial wall of the lobster has viscoelastic properties [5], and we have now utilized this primitive artery to measure the modulus of elasticity of <b>microfibrils.</b> It {{is similar to that of}} the rubber-like protein elastin...|$|R

5000|$|A single {{collagen}} molecule, tropocollagen, {{is used to}} make up larger collagen aggregates, such as fibrils.

These three left-handed helices are twisted together into a right-handed triple helix or [...] "super helix", a cooperative quaternary structure stabilized by many hydrogen bonds.

50|$|In general, {{euchromatin}} {{appears as}} light-colored bands when stained in G banding and observed under an optical microscope, {{in contrast to}} heterochromatin, which stains darkly.

In prokaryotes, euchromatin is the only form of chromatin present; this indicates that the heterochromatin structure evolved later along with the nucleus, possibly as a mechanism to handle increasing genome size.|$|E
50|$|A <b>microfibril</b> is a {{very fine}} fibril, or fiber-like strand, {{consisting}} of glycoproteins and cellulose. It is usually, but not always, used as a general term in describing the structure of protein fiber, e.g. hair and sperm tail. Its most frequently observed structural pattern is the 9+2 pattern in which two central protofibrils are surrounded by nine other pairs. Cellulose inside plants {{is one of the}} examples of non-protein compounds that are using this term with the same purpose. Cellulose microfibrils are laid down in the inner surface of the primary cell wall. As the cell absorbs water, its volume increases and the existing microfibrils separate and new ones are formed to help increase cell strength.|$|E

Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses of normal and Tsk/+ mouse skin highlighted differences in the gross organization and distribution of microfibrillar arrays. Rotary shadowing of high Mr preparations from Tsk/+ skin demonstrated the presence of abundant beaded <b>microfibrils.</b> Some of these had normal morphology and periodicity, but others were distinguished by diffuse interbeads, longer periodicity, and tendency to aggregate. The presence of a structurally abnormal population of <b>microfibrils</b> in Tsk/+ skin was unequivocally demonstrated after calcium chelation and in denaturating conditions. Scanning transmission electron microscopy highlighted the presence of more mass in Tsk/+ skin <b>microfibrils</b> than in normal mice skin <b>microfibrils.</b> These data indicate that Tsk fibrillin- 1 polymerizes and becomes incorporated into a discrete population of beaded <b>microfibrils</b> with altered molecular organization...|$|R
40|$|Human blood {{platelets}} {{were subjected}} to osmotic shock, brief sonication, pressure homogenization, or treatment with adenosine diphosphate (ADP). These procedures demonstrated an abundance of cytoplasmic <b>microfibrils.</b> The fibrils resembled those found on electron microscopy of partially purified thrombosthenin, the actomyosin-like protein isolated from platelets, and they also appeared to resemble the myofilaments of smooth muscle. Similar fibrils were not found in leukocytes studied under identical conditions. Treatment with colchicine (2 × 10 - 5 mole/liter) resulted in the disappearance of microtubules but {{did not affect the}} morphology of the <b>microfibrils</b> or interfere with platelet-dependent clot retraction. Thus, <b>microfibrils</b> rather than microtubules may represent the morphologic counterpart of the contractile protein. Brief osmotic shock at low temperature or treatment with 10 - 4 M ADP caused the marginal band of microtubules {{to be replaced by a}} bundle of intertwining <b>microfibrils.</b> The apparent inter-conversion of microtubules and <b>microfibrils</b> under a variety of conditions led to the hypothesis that fibrils and tubules consist of similar subunits whose degree of polymerization might be dependent on local cytoplasmic forces. Furthermore, on the basis of these observations, it is postulated that the contractile properties of the cells may be vested in the <b>microfibrils,</b> whereas the tubules may serve to maintain the highly asymmetric shape characteristic of circulating and irreversibly aggregated platelets...|$|R
