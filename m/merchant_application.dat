40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to develop a}} generalized model for context specification and creation. Upon analysis of current and related papers, we can define context as a function of task, ontology and related data. A model and concept for its implementation are outlined, with which the majority of contexts can be created. This paper presents examples of context usage, the types of data that constitute a context, resources required to make the context, and a task driven view of the implementation, which creates the context ontology. In particular we give implement our model for the task of buying a camera from a <b>merchant</b> <b>application</b> using OWL, RDF, and RQL...|$|E
40|$|AbstractReducing global CO 2 {{emissions}} is a multi-faceted {{problem that}} will require contributions {{from a range of}} solutions. With manageable technical and economic hurdles, the reuse of CO 2 can be an early option to consider. It can also create opportunities to generate value return to offset capital costs, engage additional players, and provide an early contribution to company GHG reduction goals. Projects that reuse industrial by-product CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), <b>merchant</b> <b>applications,</b> and internal reuse in chemical processes will be given as examples...|$|R
30|$|In {{this section}} we apply the {{previously}} defined model to a use case: a Springoo application. Springoo is a web application that {{conforms to the}} three-tier Java Enterprise Edition (J 2 EE) platform architecture, to provide typical online <b>merchant</b> <b>applications</b> using Apache/Jonas/MySQL components. Originally based on the container framework Spring [31] it was developed as an internal test-bed for innovative technologies by Orange R&D. This application {{is one of the}} end-to-end case-studies of the OpenCloudware project for Cloud development and management infrastructures. We use it in this paper to show the advantages of self control and SLA management.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Web {{applications}} increasingly integrate third-party services. The integration introduces {{new security}} challenges {{due to the}} complexity for an application to coordinate its internal states {{with those of the}} component services and the web client across the Internet. In this paper, we study the security implications of this problem to merchant websites that accept payments through third-party cashiers (e. g., PayPal, Amazon Payments and Google Checkout), which we refer to as Cashier-as-a-Service or CaaS. We found that leading <b>merchant</b> <b>applications</b> (e. g., NopCommerce and Interspire), popular online stores (e. g., Buy. com and JR. com) and a prestigious CaaS provider (Amazon Payments) all contain serious logic flaws that can be exploited to cause inconsistencies between the states of the CaaS and the merchant. As a result, a malicious shopper can purchase an item at an arbitrarily low price, shop for free after paying for one item, or even avoid payment. We reported our findings to the affected parties. They either updated their vulnerable software or continued to work on the fixes with high priorities. We further studied the complexity in finding this type of logic flaws in typical CaaS-based checkout systems, and gained a preliminary understanding of the effort that needs to be made to improve the security assurance of such systems during their development and testing processes.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a ship weather routing method to minimize fuel consumption starting from meteo-marine forecasting data. For each route segment, fuel oil consumption is evaluated by a steady state {{model of the}} propulsion system, {{taking into account the}} weather conditions influence on the hull hydrodynamic resistance. Waves and wind data are estimated for each geographical position at every time step, by interpolating into 3 -dimensional (i. e. latitude, longitude and time) weather forecasting maps. A 3 D dynamic programming code is used to optimize ship route and speed profile, according to minimum fuel consumption criterion. Results and discussion of the proposed method are presented for a <b>merchant</b> ship <b>application...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} years, {{the growth of}} {{e-commerce}} has been considerable due to the increase of user confidence in secure electronic payment. Most of the security proposals in commerce scenarios {{have been based on}} a classical e-payment system definition. This definition basically represents a client who sends a payment order to obtain some goods/services from the merchant. Nevertheless, these definitions are not sufficiently robust when a new entity appears in the electronic payment transaction especially with the emergence of SEPA in Europe. Typically, when this entity named payment service provider, performs payment interactions on behalf of the customer and the merchant on the private banking network side. This new payment scheme handle the problem of trust and security. And to deal with this problem, payment service provider must propose a secure solution which is easy to integrate to the <b>merchant</b> web <b>application</b> and guaranties a good client experience...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear {{propulsion}} {{has many}} potential advantages {{in terms of}} reduced emissions, as nuclear fission itself has zero CO 2, NOx, SOx and PM emissions, although the whole nuclear fuel cycle has an amount of emission associated with it. An overview of current and future reactor technologies suitable for marine propulsion is presented. A comparison in terms of efficiency and technology used is performed and technical and constructional aspects for surface non - military applications are discussed. A debate of feasible ship types is made and proposals of propulsion layouts are highlighted {{including the use of}} all electric ship concepts. The actual engine loading and the efficiency of propulsion components have great importance in propulsion behaviour and fuel consumption, which imply further constraints in <b>merchant</b> nuclear propulsion <b>applications</b> in terms of refuelling intervals. The social impacts and constraints in operation of such vessels, orients the designers towards large DWT vessels that can load and unload outside the ports...|$|R
40|$|Organisations or {{individuals}} that lend money (banks and micro lenders) or that sell goods on credit (retailers) {{are classified as}} credit providers. The debtor enters into a contractual agreement with a credit provider, or creditor, with the obligation to repay the loan amount, fees and interest according to a predetermined schedule. The contractual agreement, {{also known as a}} credit agreement, is as a general rule very complex. Legislation protecting debtors in various ways is an international phenomenon. In South Africa, the National Credit Act, Act 34 of 2005 (NCA) was enacted in 2005. The NCA changed the playing field for credit providers participating in the South African consumer credit market to a great extent. Consumer lending is the sleeping giant of the financial sector. The key to successfully unlock this enormous market is the credit provider's ability to accurately assess the creditworthiness of a potential customer during the customer acquisition phase. The creditworthiness of the customer is related to the risk of default, i. e. a debtor's non-payment of debt in terms of the credit agreement. The risk of default is also known as credit risk. Real People Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd (RPIH) classifies credit risk as the single largest risk the Group is exposed to. They recognise that the intelligent and responsible management of credit risk makes it the Group's largest profit driver. Credit risk scorecards are excellent decision aids during the customer acquisition phase. The characteristics and behaviour of <b>merchants</b> submitting credit <b>applications</b> to RPIH for assessment have a definite impact on the credit risk of the Group. The merchant plays a pivotal role in the debtor-creditor-supplier business model. The merchant influences the customer's sales experience and subsequent level of satisfaction with the transaction. A satisfied customer constitutes a lower level of credit risk for the creditor, in this case RPIH. The research is conducted with a positivistic paradigm. The cross-sectional study approach is used. The merchant is the unit of analysis. A sample of 77 merchants is selected from the population of 244 merchants who submitted credit applications to RPIH during the observation period. Questionnaires are used as the data collection method in this research project. The predictive ability of fourteen merchant related characteristics are demonstrated through this empirical stud...|$|R
