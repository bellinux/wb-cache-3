40|$|Abstract The goal of {{this project}} is to examine how the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> that the European Central Bank have made use of {{in recent years have}} {{affected}} Danish consumers and the Danish financial sector. The empirical data in this project is used for analyzing whether the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> have affected Danish consumers, and to analyze the impacts of the Danish financial sector. In order to answer this in the best way possibly we have used elements from Niklas Luhmann and Talcott Parson’s theories to describe how trust and expectations of consumers affect the economy. In addition, we made use of overall monetary theory to analyze how the impact have been on the Danish financial sector.

5000|$|Monetary policy {{during the}} 1990s was {{conducted}} within {{a framework of}} limited central bank autonomy and a managed floating exchange rate regime. A key objective of the BCDR was price stability in conjunction with real output growth and reserve accumulation, such that the stock of BCRD net domestic assets became the targeted policy instrument. Liquidity was managed directly through credit controls and freezing asset reserves. BCRD also intervened in the private foreign exchange market, smoothing the volatility of the exchange rate.

50|$|In 2012, {{inflation}} {{was expected to}} fall well below the target, leading the CNB to gradually reduce the level of its basic <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument,</b> the 2-week repo rate, until the zero lower bound (actually 0.05 percent) was reached in late 2012. In light {{of the threat of}} a further fall in inflation and possibly even of a protracted period of deflation, on 7 November 2013 the CNB declared an immediate commitment to weaken the exchange rate to the level of 27 Czech korunas per 1 euro (day-on-day weakening by about 5 percent) and to keep the exchange rate from getting stronger than this value until at least the end of 2014 (later on this was changed to the second half of 2016). The CNB thus decided to use the exchange rate as a supplementary tool to make sure that inflation returns to the 2 percent target level. Such a use of the exchange rate as tool within the regime of inflation targeting {{should not be confused with}} a fixed exchange-rate system or with a currency war.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the role of}} exchange rate regimes in determining the nature of relationship be-tween monetary policy transmission mechanisms and manufacturing output growth in oil producing economies in Africa. Libya and Nigeria {{were used in the}} study because of the different exchange rate regimes practice in both oil exporting countries. Nigeria as a net oil exporter practices flexible ex-change rate while Libya as a net oil exporter practices fixed exchange rate system. The study employs structural variance decomposition approach (SVAR). It was found out from the study that exchange rate regime has some influences on the monetary policy transmission mechanism and its effectiveness on the manufacturing output growth in the two oil exporting countries. Oil price shocks affect the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument</b> of both countries greatly. While <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument</b> appears to be ineffective in promoting output growth of the manufacturing sector in Libya that practices fixed ex-change rate, the reverse is the case in Nigeria.

40|$|The {{literature}} on optimal monetary policy in New Keynesian models under both commitment and discretion usually solves for the optimal allocations {{that are consistent}} with a rational expectations market equilibrium, but it does not study whether the policy can be implemented given the available policy instruments. Recently, King and Wolman (2004) have provided an example for which a time-consistent policy cannot be implemented through the control of nominal money balances. In particular, they find that equilibria are not unique under a money stock regime and they attribute the non-uniqueness to strategic complementarities in the price-setting process. The authors clarify how the choice of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument</b> contributes to the emergence of strategic complementarities in the King and Wolman (2004) example.
