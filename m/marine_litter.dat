25|$|Marine debris, {{also known}} as <b>marine</b> <b>litter,</b> is human-created waste that has {{deliberately}} or accidentally been released in a lake, sea, ocean or waterway. Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate {{at the center of}} gyres and on coastlines, frequently washing aground, when it is known as beach litter or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called ocean dumping. Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood, are also present.|$|E

Studies of <b>marine</b> <b>litter</b> in the Mediterranean include surveys of seabed debris on the continental shelf, slope, and bathyal plain. In most studies, plastic items accounted for much of the debris, sometimes as much as 90% or more of the total, owing to their ubiquitous use and poor degradability.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{if there}} is truth to the preconceptions that non-resident workers (including FIFO/DIDO’s) detract from communities. We used marine debris to test this, specifically focussing on littering behaviour and evidence of awareness of local environmental programs that focus on <b>marine</b> debris. <b>Littering</b> was most common at recreational areas, then beaches and whilst boating. Twenty-five percent of respondents that admit to littering, reported no associated guilt with their actions. Younger respondents litter more frequently. Thus, non-resident workers litter {{at the same rate}} as permanent residents, visitors and tourists in this region, within this study. Few respondents are aware of the environmental programs that operate in their local region. Awareness was influenced by a respondent’s residency (non-residents are less aware), age, and level of education. To address this failure we recommend that industries, that use non-resident workers, should develop inductions that expose new workers to the environmental programs in their region...|$|R

The issue of <b>marine</b> plastic <b>litter</b> was raised during the inaugural meeting of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) in June 2014. Delegates from 160 countries adopted Resolution 1 / 6 on ‘Marine plastic debris and microplastics’ (Annex I).

40|$|The {{loss and}} {{disposal}} of fishing gear has been recognized internationally as a major environmental issue for several decades. This paper reviews the available data on fishing debris in the Australian marine environment. In some regions debris from deep-water trawl, longline and rock lobster fisheries has harmed <b>marine</b> wildlife and <b>littered</b> beaches. The highest documented incidence of wildlife entanglement by fishing debris is for the Australian fur seal in Bass Strait and off southern Tasmania, where over the period 1989 - 1993 approximately 1. 5 - 2 % of seals were found with neck collars. Data collected by Australian observers on board foreign vessels fishing within the Australian Fishing Zone, indicate that in 1992 and 1993 at least one-third of these vessels did not compl...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{colonization}} of <b>marine</b> plastic <b>litter</b> (MPL) {{is known for}} over four decades. Still, only a few studies on the plastic colonization process and its influencing factors are reported. In this study, seafloor MPL was sampled at different locations across the Belgian part of the North Sea to study bacterial community structure using 16 S metabarcoding. These marine plastic bacterial communities were {{compared with those of}} sediment and seawater, and resin pellets sampled on the beach, to investigate the origin and uniqueness of plastic bacterial communities. Plastics display great variation of bacterial community composition, while each showed significant differences from those of sediment and seawater, indicating that plastics represent a distinct environmental niche. Various environmental factors correlate with the diversity of MPL bacterial composition across plastics. In addition, intrinsic plastic-related factors such as pigment content may contribute to the differences in bacterial colonization. Furthermore, the differential abundance of known primary and secondary colonizers across the various plastics may indicate different stages of bacterial colonization, and may confound comparisons of free-floating plastics. Our studies provide insights in the factors that shape plastic bacterial colonization and shed light on the possible role of plastic as transport vehicle for bacteria through the aquatic environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine “who” and why people are littering in the Gladstone region. This was determined by investigating two aims: 1. What is the prevalence of littering behaviours and associated guilt in the Gladstone region; and 2. What is the public’s level of awareness of current programs designed to combat the issue of marine debris, focussing on four programs. A social survey was used to collect the data. The survey used face-to-face purposive sampling of individuals in the Gladstone region. A total of 137 people were sampled, with the sample size having a 95 % confidence level of being representative of the Gladstone population. The survey collected information about respondents residency, age, gender, education and income; their self-admitted littering behaviours and associated levels of guilt; and respondents awareness of four (quarterly marine debris surveys, the catchment to coast tagging programs, creek catchment community working bees and the community awareness campaigns) campaigns that deal with <b>marine</b> debris and <b>littering.</b> This research received approval from the Human Ethics Research Review Panel at CQUniversity and all research was conducted in accordance with the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research. Two major correlations were evident: Few respondent admitted to littering, with the following demographic correlation: Younger respondents more commonly admitted to littering; The awareness of the public programs is low, with greater awareness influenced by: A respondent's residence (permanent and “other 1 ” residents are more aware); A respondent's age (respondents aged 26 - 55 have greater awareness); and A respondent's level of education (respondents with a postgraduate education are more aware of the programs). These outcomes should provide some insight for community groups, industry, and policy-makers regarding future how to manage the issue of <b>marine</b> debris and <b>littering</b> in this region...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} worldwide anthropogenic pressure {{and in order}} to promote adequate environmental conservation strategies, quantification of non-biological diversity, such as considering <b>marine</b> and beach <b>litter,</b> is becoming increasingly useful. Information on beach litter in terms of richness and diversity may have a consistent influence regarding the evaluation of its pressure and impact on coastal ecosystems. Highlighted are strengths, weaknesses and caveats concerning the use of uni- and bi-variate diversity metrics applied to a class of man-made non-biological objects periodically accumulated on the beaches. Two case studies show evidence that the application of diversity metrics on non-biological objects may have different implications. In absence of a universal and standardized non-biological taxonomy, {{it is important to be}} cautious when comparing values obtained from non-living assemblages, in particular if different sites, time or operators are considered. Moreover, different indices provide different information. Therefore, users should pay particular attention on the application of diversity metrics, addressing specific research questions and avoiding automatic calculation of redundant and “magic” indices...|$|R
5000|$|Further {{action on}} a much wider scale may be required. According {{to a recent report}} [...] "Scotland's marine life could be almost wiped out within 50 years unless tough action is taken to manage the way humans use the seas". Fears were {{expressed}} by a consortium of environmental organisations that commercial fish stocks, including Atlantic cod are suffering from over-fishing, that fish farming, especially for salmon is damaging the aquatic environment, a reduction in coastal marsh habitats is affecting <b>marine</b> bird life, <b>litter</b> in densely populated estuaries such as the Firth of Clyde is affecting all forms of marine life and that the growth in off-shore tourism was deleterious to populations of, for example, basking shark. A call was made for a 'Scottish Marine Bill' to co-ordinate and manage human activity at sea and to provide more protected areas such as marine national parks. The Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 was subsequently passed by the Scottish Parliament.|$|R

40|$|<b>Marine</b> plastic <b>litter</b> is {{a global}} concern. Carrier bags {{manufactured}} from non-biodegradable polymers constitute a large component of this litter. Because of their adverse impact on marine life, non-biodegradable bags have recently been replaced by biodegradable ones. However, growing evidence shows that these latter are not readily degradable in marine sediments and can alter benthic assemblages. The potential impact of biodegradable bags on seagrasses inhabiting sandy bottoms,which are the mostwidespread and productive ecosystems of the coastal zones, has been ignored. Mesocosm experiments were conducted to assess {{the effect of a}} commercialized biodegradable bag on a common seagrass species of the Mediterranean, Cymodocea nodosa, both at the level of individual plant (clonal growth) and of plant community (plant-plant relationships), under three culture regimes (plant alone, in combination with a neighbour of the same species or of the co-existing seagrass Zostera noltei) simulating different natural conditions (bare substrate, monospecific meadows or mixed meadows). The bag behaviour in marine sediment and sediment physical/chemical variables were also examined. After six months of sediment exposure, the bag retained considerable mass (85 % initial weight) and reduced sediment pore-water oxygen concentration and pH. In the presence of bag, C. nodosa root spread and vegetative recruitment increased compared to controls, both intra- and interspecific interactions shifted from neutral to competitive, and the growth form changed fromguerrilla (loosely arranged group ofwidely spaced ramets) to phalanx form (compact structure of closed spaced ramets) but onlywith Z. noltei. These findings suggest that biodegradable bags altering sediment geochemistry could promote the spatial segregation of seagrass clones and influence species coexistence...|$|R
40|$|The {{pollution}} {{of the oceans}} with plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, called microplastics is moving into the focus of science and governments. To {{determine the amount of}} microplastics several steps are necessary, starting with the sampling, work up and finally analysis. Each step has its own challenges due to small size of the particles. [1] For analysis the imaging with µFTIR microscopy is a powerful tool allowing the analysis of complete filters. Systematic screening for optimal conditions and filter materials have already been performed. [2] While the measurement is performed mostly by the spectrometer, the data interpretation process is highly time consuming as it has to be made by hand on the basis of false color images. To overcome the manual part we developed a novel approach based on the Bruker OPUS© Software to decrease the high time demand for the analysis of microplastics. With this approach it was possible to analyze measurement files from focal plane array (FPA) FTIR mapping containing up to 1. 8 million single spectra. These spectra were compared with a database of different synthetic and natural polymers by various methods. By benchmark tests their performance was monitored with the focus on accuracy and data quality. After optimization high quality data was generated, which allowed image analysis. Based on these results an approach for image analysis was developed, giving information for the particle size distribution for each polymer type as well as their distribution on the filter. It was possible to collect all data with relative ease even for complex sample matrices. This approach has significantly decreased the time demand for the interpretation of FTIR-imaging data and increased the generated data quality. [1]	M. Bergmann, L. Gutow, M.

40|$|The {{production}} of biodegradable plastic is increasing. Given the augmented littering {{of these products}} an increasing input into the sea is expected. Previous laboratory experiments have shown that degradation of plastic starts within days to weeks. Little {{is known about the}} early composition and activity of biofilms found on biodegradable and conventional plastic debris and its correlation to degradation in the marine environment. In this study we investigated the early formation of biofilms on plastic shopper bags and its consequences for the degradation of plastic. Samples of polyethylene and biodegradable plastic were tested in the Mediterranean Sea for 15 and 33 days. The samples were distributed equally to a shallow benthic (sedimentary seafloor at 6 m water depth) and a pelagic habitat (3 m water depth) to compare the impact of these different environments on fouling and degradation. The amount of biofilm increased on both plastic types and in both habitats. The diatom abundance and diversity differed significantly between the habitats and the plastic types. Diatoms were more abundant on samples from the pelagic zone. We anticipate that specific surface properties of the polymer types induced different biofilm communities on both plastic types. Additionally, different environmental conditions between the benthic and pelagic experimental site such as light intensity and shear forces may have influenced unequal colonisation between these habitats. The oxygen production rate was negative for all samples, indicating that the initial biofilm on <b>marine</b> plastic <b>litter</b> consumes oxygen, regardless of the plastic type or if exposed in the pelagic or the benthic zone. Mechanical tests did not reveal degradation within one month of exposure. However, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis displayed potential signs of degradation on the plastic surface, which differed between both plastic types. This study indicates that the early biofilm formation and composition are affected by the plastic type and habitat. Further, it reveals that already within two weeks biodegradable plastic shows signs of degradation in the benthic and pelagic habitat...|$|R
