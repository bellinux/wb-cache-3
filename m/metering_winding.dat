Based on the analysis, California's offshore wind resource was divided up into three areas; Northern California, San Francisco Bay Area, and Southern California. The siting of an offshore wind farm is limited by water depth, with shallow water being the most preferable economically. Acceptable depths for offshore wind farms were broken up into three categories, based on current and future wind turbine tower support technology; <= 20 meters depth for monopile towers, <= 50 meters for water jacket tripods/quadrapods, and < = 200 meters depth for deep water floating tower technology {{which is likely to}} be developed in the next 15 years.

40|$|A new {{technique}} combining active and passive remote sensing instruments for {{the estimation of}} surface latent heat flux over the ocean is presented.

The 10 <b>meter</b> <b>wind</b> speed derived from the scatterometers and the lidar-radiometer inferred near-surface moisture are used to obtain an estimate of the surface flux of moisture via bulk aerodynamic formulae.

In addition, the MABL height, entrainment zone thickness and integrated lidar backscatter intensity are computed from the lidar data and compared with the magnitude of the surface fluxes. The results show that the surface latent heat flux is most strongly correlated with entrainment zone top, bottom and the integrated MABL lidar backscatter, with corresponding correlation coefficients of 0. 62, 0. 67 and 0. 61, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Long-term surface {{observations}} {{over land}} have shown temperature increases {{during the last}} century, especially during nighttime. Observations analyzed by Parker [2004] show similar long-term trends for calm and windy conditions at night, and on basis of this {{it was suggested that}} the possible effect of urban heat effects on long-term temperature trends are small. On the other hand, a simplified analytic model study by Pielke and Matsui [2005, henceforth PM 05] suggests that at night the resultant long-term temperature trends over land should depend on height and strongly on wind speed (mostly due to alterations in the rate of nocturnal cooling in the stable boundary layer (SBL)). In this paper we expand the PM 05 study by using a validated atmospheric boundary-layer model with elaborated atmospheric physics compared to PM 05, in order to explore the response of the SBL over land to a change in radiative forcing. We find that the screen level temperature response is surprisingly constant for a rather broad range of both geostrophic wind speed (5 - 15 ms- 1) and 10 <b>meter</b> <b>wind</b> (2 - 4. 0 ms- 1).

Severe tail buffet occurred near the angle of attack for maximum lift. Above initial stall the aircraft had pronounced pitch-up, characteristic of T-tail configurations.
