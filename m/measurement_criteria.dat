40|$|Process {{modeling}} {{by means}} of Gaussian-based algorithms often suffers from redundant information which usually increases the estimation computational complexity without significantly improving the estimation performance. In this article, a non-arbitrary <b>measurement</b> selection <b>criterion</b> for Gaussian-based algorithms is proposed. The <b>measurement</b> selection <b>criterion</b> {{is based on the}} determination of the most significant measurement from both an estimation convergence perspective and the covariance matrix associated with the <b>measurement.</b> The selection <b>criterion</b> is independent from the nature of the measured variable. This criterion is used in conjunction with three Gaussian-based algorithms: the EIF (Extended Information Filter), the EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) and the UKF (Unscented Kalman Filter). Nevertheless, the <b>measurement</b> selection <b>criterion</b> shown herein can also be applied to other Gaussian-based algorithms. Although this work is focused on environment modeling, the results shown herein can be applied to other Gaussian-based algorithm implementations. Mathematical descriptions and implementation results that validate the proposal are also included in this work...|$|R

With this criterion, we propose the piling algorithm to minimize the sequence length, then we show this algorithm is an optimal APS algorithm in commutative semigroups in the worst case. The experimental results also show the algorithmic efficiency of the piling algorithm. Furthermore, the theoretical works of APS algorithm will help to construct the higher dimensional thresholding methods...|$|R

30|$|As we know, feature {{selection}} with {{direct connection to}} SRC has not emerged. In this paper, we use SRC as a <b>measurement</b> <b>criterion</b> to design an unsupervised {{feature selection}} algorithm called sparsity preserving score (SPS). The formulated objective function, which is an essentially discrete optimization, aims to seek a binary linear transformation such that in a low-dimensional space the sparse representation coefficients are preserved. As the sparse representation is fixed, our theoretical analysis guarantees our objective function can be easily solved with a closed form, which is optimal solution. SPS simply ranks the score of each feature by Frobenius norm of sparse linear reconstruction residual {{in the space of}} selected features.|$|R
