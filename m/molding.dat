5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the <b>molding</b> cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil <b>molding.</b> Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown <b>molding.</b> Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E
5|$|The register's {{nomination}} gives {{details of}} the paneling and <b>molding</b> throughout the house. Entering through {{the front of the}} house leads to the central hall with a paneled wainscot below the chair rail, forward of the rising stairwell on the left. There is cornice <b>molding</b> and a molded chair rail with runners for the inside shutters. The woodwork in the west front room has a paneled fireplace and is wainscoted below the chair rail. The east rear room is divided in two, with one of the divisions being a bathroom. The upstairs rooms have molded chair rails and cased flair posts. However, the east front room lacks a fireplace while the western one is paneled as the first floor's front west room. The roof of the house is framed by sawn collar beams that were pegged to rafters which were hewn. The chimney stacks are angled so that they emerge symmetrically from the roof.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} weld-line {{reduction}} {{by using the}} laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> {{and the effect of}} hot air supply on the <b>mold</b> surface just before the injection have been investigated. The depth of the weld-line groove in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> is smaller than that in the conventional steel <b>mold.</b> <b>Mold</b> pressure increase in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> is faster than that in the steel <b>mold</b> and the peak pressure in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> is higher than that in the steel <b>mold.</b> This must be due to the low thermal conductivity of the laser metal sintered <b>mold.</b> As a preheating effect of the <b>mold</b> surface before the injection, hot air has been supplied on the <b>mold</b> surface using an air jet bulb. The reduction of the weld-line groove has been promoted in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> whereas few effects appeared in the steel <b>mold.</b> Surface temperature increase by the hot air supply in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> is larger than that in the steel <b>mold.</b> By this higher temperature increase, temperature of the resin on the weld-line area must be higher and the hardness of the resin must be lower in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> so that the resin is deformed well reducing the weld-line groove...|$|R
5|$|On September 12, 1912, the new library {{opened on}} the {{property}} near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, {{and much of the}} furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, crown <b>molding,</b> windows that were two-stories tall, and a fireplace. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a small fire damaged the furnace room and about 50 books at the library.|$|E
5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits {{to the size of}} a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable strain relief mechanism (usually <b>molding</b> integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the blackboards. Blackboards cover available space on the north, east, and south walls. Pressed tin extends over the ceiling and {{is used as a}} crown <b>molding</b> around the room on the walls from the ceiling {{to the top of the}} blackboards.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main disadvantages: high tooling cost, limited to low-melting-point metals, and short <b>mold</b> life. The high tooling costs make this process {{uneconomical}} for small production runs. When {{the process is}} used to cast steel or iron the <b>mold</b> life is extremely short. For lower melting point metals the <b>mold</b> life is longer but thermal fatigue and erosion usually limit the life to 10,000 to 120,000 cycles. The <b>mold</b> life is dependent on four factors: the <b>mold</b> material, the pouring temperature, the <b>mold</b> temperature, and the <b>mold</b> configuration. <b>Molds</b> made from gray cast iron can be more economical to produce but have short <b>mold</b> lives. On the other hand, <b>molds</b> made from H13 tool steel may have a <b>mold</b> life several times greater. The pouring temperature {{is dependent on the}} casting metal, but the higher the pouring temperature the shorter the <b>mold</b> life. A high pouring temperature can also induce shrinkage problems and create longer cycle times. If the <b>mold</b> temperature is too low misruns are produced, but if the <b>mold</b> temperature is too high then the cycle time is prolonged and <b>mold</b> erosion is increased. Large differences in section thickness in the <b>mold</b> or casting can decrease <b>mold</b> life as well.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a feature-based approach to automated design of multi-piece sacrificial <b>molds.</b> We use multi-piece sacrificial <b>molds</b> to create complex 3 D polymer/ceramic parts. Multi-piece <b>molds</b> refer to <b>molds</b> that contain {{more than two}} <b>mold</b> components or subassemblies. Our methodology has the following three benefits over the state-of-the-art. First, by using multi-piece <b>molds</b> we can create complex 3 D objects that are impossible to create using traditional two piece <b>molds.</b> Second, we make use of sacrificial <b>molds.</b> Therefore, using multi-piece sacrificial <b>molds,</b> we can create parts that pose disassembly problems for permanent <b>molds.</b> Third, <b>mold</b> design steps are significantly automated in our methodology. Therefore, we can create the functional part from the CAD model of the part {{in a matter of}} hours and so our approach can be used in small batch manufacturing environments. The basic idea behind our <b>mold</b> design algorithm is as follows. We first form the desired gross <b>mold</b> shape based on the feature-based description of the part geometry. If the desired gross <b>mold</b> shape is not manufacturable as a single piece, we decompose the gross <b>mold</b> shape into simpler shapes to make sure that each component is manufacturable using CNC machining. During the decomposition step, we account for tool accessibility to make sure that (1) each component is manufacturable, and (2) components can be assembled together to form the gross <b>mold</b> shape. Finally, we add assembly features to <b>mold</b> component shapes to facilitate easy assembly of <b>mold</b> components and eliminate unnecessary degree of freedoms from the final <b>mold</b> assembly...|$|R
5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection <b>molding</b> defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a projecting <b>molding.</b> The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built on the south side of the home.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} {{chapters}} on memory, imitation and suggestion, perceptual illusions, and esthetics. In these he refuted {{the idea that}} experience was just the external environment acting on and <b>molding</b> a mind working as a passive recipient. Stratton saw the sensation of time as being multidimensional, in analogy with perception of space. That we could simultaneously hear separately, without synthesizing, multiple mixed tones meant our experiences did not necessarily come in single file temporally. To Stratton this meant time had multiple dimensions, since simultaneous events could not be distinguished on the one past-present-future dimension of time alone. He did not address how the other dimensions could be in temporal-space if the events were indistinguishable temporally to begin with. He also analyzed poetic measure as mathematically connected to the waxing and waning span of attention, tying the arts to psychology. This last was rebutted by Charles Samuel Myers, writing in Nature, who saw poetry and its rhythm as too complex a subject to be reduced to the arithmetic of attention spans.|$|E

5|$|The dining room, {{originally}} the library, {{was designed by}} Lewis Wyatt in about 1808. Wyatt extended the room and added a shallow, semi-circular apse at one end. It features decorative plasterwork on both the ceiling and walls, but is largely unadorned. Wyatt implemented a design featuring gilded acanthus leaves and vines on the ceiling with large-scale egg-and-dart <b>molding</b> around the upper sections of the wall, scagiola columns and a black marble fireplace with bronze ornamentation. Wyatt's alteration works at Rode Hall {{are influenced by the}} style of Sir John Soane, and he described his designs for the interiors as an 'experiment in primitive simplicity... At Rode the primitivist intent is emphasized by the total absence of an entablature.' The room is furnished with original pieces of furniture designed and made by the English manufacturer Gillows of Lancaster and London; of note is the mahogany dining-table and the semi-circular sideboard built into the apse. A Royal Crown Derby dinner service, purchased by Mary Wilbraham-Bootle for her son Randle Wilbraham III in 1809, is on display here.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement like it was traveling on a slick surface. The control scheme allows the digital input to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its neutral position, the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden cabinets as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new cabinets with a rotational <b>molding</b> process.|$|E

5|$|Under Kistiakowsky's leadership, X-Division {{designed}} the complex explosive lenses needed to compress the fissile plutonium pit. These employed two explosives with significantly different velocities of detonation {{in order to}} produce the required wave form. Kistiakowsky chose Baratol for the slow explosive. After experimenting with various fast explosives, X-Division settled on Composition B. Work on <b>molding</b> the explosives into the right shape continued into 1945. The lenses needed to be flawless, and techniques for casting Composition B and Baratol had to be developed. The ERL managed to accomplish this by devising a procedure for preparing Baratol in a form that was easy to cast. In March 1945, Kistiakowsky became part of the Cowpuncher Committee, so-called because it rode herd on the implosion effort. On July 16, 1945, Kistiakowsky watched as the first device was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later a Fat Man implosion-type nuclear weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, {{beginning}} with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre {{characterized by a}} distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly, and harmonic sound. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys' songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture. The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, country rock, and psychedelic rock. Folk and country rock {{were associated with the}} rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream {{in the middle of the}} 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan's influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit, the Grateful Dead, a country and bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture, associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead were truly the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and <b>molding</b> a culture that defines Americans today.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection <b>molding.</b> The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E

This paper presents a systematic approach for manufacturability analysis of <b>molds</b> produced by rapid tooling methods, based on three aspects: <b>mold</b> feature manufacturability, secondary elements compatibility, and cost effectiveness. The geometric features of functional elements of the <b>mold</b> (core, cavity, side core, etc.) are evaluated for manufacturability using fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (Fuzzy-AHP) methodology. The secondary elements of <b>mold</b> (parting surface, ejectors, cooling lines, etc.) are checked for compatibility with RT <b>mold</b> properties (machinability, wear resistance, and surface evenness). Finally, the cost of RT <b>mold</b> is estimated using a semi-empirical model based on cost drivers and cost modifiers, and {{compared with that of}} a conventional <b>mold.</b> The methodology has been demonstrated with an experimental <b>mold.</b> It is useful not only for RT <b>mold</b> process selection, but also for identifying minor modifications to a <b>mold</b> design to improve its manufacturability and economy...|$|R
