5|$|O'Reilly {{scaled back}} his {{participation}} in Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1938–39 season, <b>making</b> <b>himself</b> unavailable {{for most of the}} campaign to spend time with his newborn son after half a year in England; he played in only two matches, against South Australia and arch-rivals Victoria. He took a ten-wicket haul in the latter match, but his figures of 6/152 and 4/60 were not enough to prevent defeat. Both teams were at full strength and eight of O'Reilly's victims were Test players, including batsman Lindsay Hassett twice. O'Reilly's only other match was for Bradman's XI against Rigg's XI in a match to commemorate the centenary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, in which he took a total of 7/129, to end the season with 19 wickets at 23.16.|$|E

Despite attempts by Pietersen to entice Trescothick back into the England set-up, Trescothick confirmed that his {{decision has been made}} and that he is putting his health and family first. In November 2008 Coming Back to Me was named the 2008 William Hill Sports Book of the Year.

5|$|Tonelli {{retired after}} the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any {{physical}} advantage, {{as he was}} relatively small for a swimmer. He was only 185cm tall and weighed 70kg, with relatively small hands and feet. Tonelli felt that his success was based around his ability to make fast starts from the blocks, and attributed his success to his mental approach {{and his ability to}} convert his energy into a fast swim in under one minute. He had a deliberate strategy of <b>making</b> <b>himself</b> nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 Republican presidential {{nomination}} on May 18, 1860, awaiting {{the results of the}} national convention by telegraph: New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward, widely considered the frontrunner; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, a favorite of the party's more radical wing; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates, preferred by more conservative elements of the party; and Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois. Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence: Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed, Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery, Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention, and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election. Lincoln is ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by <b>making</b> <b>himself</b> the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions, and proceeds to win the presidency.|$|E
