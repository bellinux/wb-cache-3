In August the forward Allied troops were thrown into disarray by a Bulgarian attack, and the British took up positions along the River Struma. 27th Division was then ordered to destroy two railway bridges across its tributary, the River Angista, {{to delay the}} Bulgarian advance towards the Struma. A <b>mixed</b> <b>party</b> of six officers and 77 other ranks, drawn from 17th Field Company, RE, the divisional mounted squadron (Surrey Yeomanry) and the cyclist company, went out from the Struma bridgehead at Neohori, and blew up the first bridge {{early in the morning}} of 20 August. The second bridge was damaged enough to stop trains crossing. The party withdrew with only one officer and one man wounded.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 October 2017, as huge protest {{rallies and}} a general strike took place in Catalonia, King Felipe VI {{delivered}} an unusually strongly worded televised address in which he condemned the referendum organizers for acting [...] "outside the law", accusing them of [...] "unacceptable disloyalty" [...] and of [...] "eroding the harmony and co-existence within Catalan society itself". He also warned the referendum could put {{the economy of the}} entire north-east region of Spain at risk. Reactions to the King's speech were <b>mixed.</b> <b>Party</b> officials from the PP and Ciudadanos praised the King's [...] "commitment to legality", whereas leaders from Unidos Podemos and Catalunya en Comú criticised it as [...] "unworthy and irresponsible", paving the way for a harsh intervention in Catalan autonomy. PSOE's leaders expressed support for the King's words in public, but were reported to be privately dissatisfied that the King had not made any call to encourage understanding or dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan governments. On 5 October the Constitutional Court of Spain suspended a future parliamentary session (scheduled for 9 October) that was planned in order to push for a Declaration of Independence.|$|E

Some of them were mounted on horses rudely caparisoned with bridles or halters of buffalo hide, one end trailing after them on the ground.

60|$|He {{was very}} angry,--though he hardly knew why or with whom. A girl {{when she is}} engaged is not {{supposed}} to talk to no one but her recognised lover in a <b>mixed</b> <b>party</b> of ladies and gentlemen, and she is especially absolved from such a duty when they chance to meet in the house of a comparative stranger. In such a house and among such people it was natural that the talk should be about hunting, and as the girl had accepted the loan of a horse it was natural that she should join in such conversation. She had never sat for a moment apart with Lord Rufford. It was impossible to say that she had flirted with the man,--and yet Morton felt that he was neglected, and felt also that he was only there because this pleasure-seeking young Lord had liked to have in his house the handsome girl whom he, Morton, intended to marry. He felt thoroughly ashamed of being there as it were in the train of Miss Trefoil. He was almost disposed to get up and declare that the girl was engaged to marry him. He thought that he could {{put an end to the}} engagement without breaking his heart;--but if the engagement was an engagement he could not submit to treatment such as this, either from her or from others. He would see her for the last time in the country at the ball on the following evening,--as of course he would not be near her during the hunting,--and then he would make her understand that she must be altogether his or altogether cease to be his. And so resolving he went to bed, refusing to join the gentlemen in the smoking-room.|$|E

50|$|Battle of the Somme In August the {{division}} marched south {{to take part}} in this offensive.

Casualties were very heavy but, after a renewed bombardment, German troops began to surrender. By the afternoon, 141 Bde held the wood, but was so disorganised by casualties that it had been formed into a composite battalion. Work on establishing a new line beyond the wood was started by a <b>mixed</b> <b>party</b> under Capt H.S. Read of the 1/20th Bn.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{scholarship that}} shows that judges decide cases {{in a manner that}} is consistent with their political biases has motivated a stream of proposals for reform, including judicial term limits, limitations on judicial review of statutes and agency actions, revision of the judicial appointments process, and mandatory <b>mixed</b> <b>party</b> representation on judicial panels. However, these proposals incorrectly assume that judicial bias is necessarily harmful, and do not fully consider the costs to other values even when reduction of judicial bias is justified. To evaluate proposals for reform, one needs a theory of judicial review, one that explains how bias and other characteristics of judicial behavior result in socially good or bad outcomes. This paper supplies such a theory, drawing on rational-choice accounts of the role of the judiciary in the legislative process. It argues that judicial bias is not harmful in a broad range of circumstances, and that the merits of the reform proposals depend on many factors, including, among others, the degree of supermajoritarianism of the legislative process, the magnitude of legislative bargaining costs, judicial competence, and the extent to which the judicial appointments process and party competition result in an ideologically diverse judiciary...|$|E
40|$|This article uses a rationalist {{approach}} {{to explain the}} international socialization of Central and Eastern Europe to liberal human rights and democracy norms. According to this approach, socialization consists {{in a process of}} reinforcement, and its effectiveness depends on the balance between the international and domestic costs and benefits of compliance {{over an extended period of}} time. EU and NATO accession conditionality has been a necessary condition of sustained compliance in those countries of Central and Eastern Europe that violated liberal norms initially. The pathways and long-term outcomes of international socialization, however, have varied with the constellations of major parties in the target states. Whereas conditionality has been effective with liberal and <b>mixed</b> <b>party</b> constellations, it has failed to produce compliance in antiliberal regimes. In the empirical part of the article, these propositions are substantiated with data on the development of liberal democracy in Central and Eastern Europe and case studies on Slovakia and Latvia. For useful comments on earlier versions, I thank the participants of the IDNET workshop seminars, especially Jeff Checkel, Matthew Evangelista, Judith Kelley, Thomas Risse, and Marianne van de Steeg. In addition, the anonymous reviewers and the editors of IO made excellent suggestions for improving and clarifying the argument.

40|$|Rank {{differences}} {{in the production of}} vocalizations by wild, semihabituated, unprovisioned chimpanzees were investigated during a 10 -month study in the Kibale Forest, Uganda. Vocalization rates were calculated from data collected during 230 hours of focal-animal sampling on adult females, adult males, and subadult males. Rates were calculated according to whether individuals were alone, with adult females only, or in <b>mixed</b> <b>parties,</b> and the results were compared with published data collected at the Gombe provisioning area. Adult females and low-ranking adult and sub-adult males were generally quiet except when they were in <b>mixed</b> <b>parties,</b> whereas high-ranking males vocalized in all social contexts. These results were in partial contrast to data collected at Gombe, which indicated that vocal production was similar across all age and sex classes. Vocal production at Gombe did, however, resemble that from <b>mixed</b> <b>parties</b> at Kibale, suggesting that the provisioning area at Gombe was comparable to a natural socioecological context occurring at large fruiting trees. It is suggested that low-ranking chimpanzees refrain from loud vocalizing when they are alone or with females only in order to avoid attracting feeding competition and/or potentially aggressive males. These individuals may vocalize when they are associating with high-ranking males in order to advertise the presence of large parties and to deter other individuals from joining them. The use of loud, interparty calls by high-ranking males, when alone or with others, is consistent with the greater sociality of adult male chimpanzees. Loud calling might be advantageous for adult males in attracting mates or allies. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
