To recover a legacy system, we follow an algebraic approach by using algebras in order to represent the models and manipulate them. RELS also automatically generates a data migration plan that specifies a data transfer process to save all the legacy knowledge in the new recovered database. The data migration solution is also introduced as a support for the OO conceptual schemas evolution where their persistent layers are stored by means of relational databases, in the ADAM tool.

Ethnic diversity is particularly high in the South, where the Nilo-Saharan Nyangatom and the Afro-Asiatic Daasanach dwell. Despite their linguistic differentiation, both populations rely on a similar agripastoralist mode of subsistence. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from Nyangatom and Daasanach archival sera revealed high levels of diversity, with most sequences belonging to the L haplogroups, the basal branches of the mitochondrial phylogeny. However, in sharp contrast with other Ethiopian populations, only 5 % of the Nyangatom and Daasanach sequences belong to haplogroups M and N.

40|$|Objective This paper {{focuses on}} the {{implications}} of migration for host health and social care systems in terms of linguistic diversity, language barriers and language supports. The objective is to compare Ireland, as a context responding to the new challenge of language barriers in healthcare, and England, as {{a context in which}} the management of language barriers is being re-assessed. Methods Empirical data from two action research studies in Ireland and England are compared. The combined data set is 146 data collection episodes with service users with limited English and their health and social care providers. Results Key findings are that the same range of formal and informal responses to language barriers occurs in practice in both contexts but proportions of knowledge and use of these responses differ. English service providers have more awareness about the use of formal responses than Irish service providers but uptake of formal responses remains low in both contexts. Data from service users confirms these findings. Conclusions There is a need for more attention to the implementation of policies for language barriers in both Ireland and England, further research about the normalization processes associated with these consultations and knowledge transfer networks to facilitate on-going dialogue between all key stakeholders with an emphasis on supporting service users' involvement and participation. <b>Migration</b> <b>Language</b> barriers Health and social care Health policy Action research...|$|E

40|$|Fluency in (or ease {{to quickly}} learn) the {{language}} of the destination country {{plays a key role in}} the transfer of human capital from the source country to another country and boosts the immigrant’s rate of success at the destination’s labor market. This suggests that the ability to learn and speak a foreign language might be an important factor in the migration decision. We use a novel dataset on immigration flows and stocks of foreigners in 30 OECD destination countries from 223 source countries for the years 1980 – 2009 and a wide range of linguistic indicators to study the role of language in shaping international migration. Specifically, we investigate how both linguistic distance and linguistic diversity, as a proxy for the “potential” ease to learn a new language and to adapt to a new context, affect migration. We find that migration rates increase with linguistic proximity and the result is robust to the inclusion of genetic distance as a proxy for cultural proximity and to the use of multiple measures of linguistic distance. Interestingly, linguistic proximity matters more for migrants moving into non-English speaking destinations than to English-speaking countries. The likely higher proficiency of the average migrant in English rather than in other languages may diminish the relevance of the linguistic proximity indicators to English speaking destinations. Finally, destinations that are linguistically more diverse and polarized attract fewer migrants than those with a single language; whereas more linguistic polarization at origin seems to act as a push factor.

40|$|In <b>migration,</b> <b>language</b> {{undergoes}} crucial changes. Not {{only are}} the linguistic practices of migrants reshaped in the new environment, but migrant displacement has a major effect on the way language users see and talk about language as such, especially in relation to linguistic varieties they encounter or acquire {{as part of their}} migrant experiences. Migrants’ transforming attitudes to language also interfere with other, non-linguistic areas of their lives – family relationships, career pathways, networking with fellow migrants, and daily interactions with the host environment. The way a layperson considers ‘their’ language in relation to the language of ‘others’ plays a crucial role in their identity construction – both as a factor and a domain for expression. The sociolinguistic context of a new culture is a defining factor in the transformation of one’s metalinguistic thinking. This thesis focuses on post-Soviet Russian-speaking migrants in the UK and explores their linguistic practices, language attitudes and discourses on language(s) as a key factor in their cultural integration in the host society. It is based on ethnographic fieldwork (in-depth semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and the discourse analysis of printed and online documents) conducted between 2011 and 2014, principally in the North-East of England. The central argument of the thesis is that the cultural phenomenon of ‘Russophonism’ (russkoiazychie) presents a dynamic model which functions in two ways. Firstly, it is a frame to express shared meanings of belonging to the post-Soviet domain, through which individual linguistic identities and community practices are expressed. Russophonism also influences migrants’ on-going relationship with and views of their home countries and the FSU context in general. Secondly, migrants’ understanding of Russophonism is a flexible tool to interpret current migrant experiences and to create new meanings of what being a migrant in the UK implies both for their personal life trajectories and for their self-presentation as a group...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic study of {{adolescent}} migrants in a South London secondary school. It examines {{what happens when}} young people from very different backgrounds encounter the education system in the UK. Very often, they are classified as ‘EAL’ (because they use English as an additional language) and are required to learn the majority language {{so that they can}} access the curriculum. I argue that this needs rethinking to take account of the skills, experiences and aspirations of the young people. The thesis is organised into three main parts. The first describes the setting and the broader context, and sets out the methodology that I follow in this study. The second contains the four analytical chapters; the third brings the discussion together, identifying the main findings and discussing the implications for practitioners, schools, policymakers and for the wider debates around <b>migration,</b> <b>language</b> and education. The study develops an innovative theoretical framework that analyses classrooms as spaces of ‘contact’ between young people with very different past experiences. It shows how their migration ‘trajectories’ are a crucial resource as they make sense of the school, and how they draw together resources from other times and places as they do (a process I describe as ‘networking’). The study also shows classrooms to be complex sociolinguistic environments with distinct interactional spaces, allowing the young people great flexibility as they encounter and negotiate the institution and each other. Increasing numbers of young people are moving through the education system in ways that were not foreseen even a few decades ago. Too often, they are defined in terms of linguistic deficiency and their experience of other ways of learning is ignored. This thesis argues for the urgent need to rethink that positioning, and offers an analytical framework to do so...|$|E

40|$|As China {{transforms}} into a {{space of}} immigration rather than emigration, second-generation students from Venezuela return to the country in order to study. This student migration is primarily education-centered, as it involves not just formalized education, but additionally, informal education via socialization in the ancestral hometown of Enping with extended family members and the community at large. The core areas of education, language, fashion, and food are the forums through which identity is expressed, and by assessing these areas of life, {{an understanding of the}} multiple layers of Chineseness is developed. Return migration to China itself is multi-layered, and understanding the specificity of this type of migration projects a future in which the social fabric of Chineseness evolves. Second-generation and first-generation emigrants now live in a social system in which they are truly transnational, with the concurrent development of Chinese global education and trade allowing for such a migration to occur. The identity-development and connection with Chineseness occurs simultaneously within the larger schemes of mobility and transnationalism both globally and within the Chinese community. Thus the sense of the global is interlocked with the specificities of the students birth country culture, and one can see mobility and transnational practices in action embodied in the lives of Chinese-Venezuelan students.
