5|$|By {{this stage}} of Operation Overlord, German forces were of an unknown {{quantity}} and quality, but the division would be confronted by elements of Germany's 711th Infantry Division, {{a part of the}} 15th Army. The 711th was composed of the 731st and the 744th Grenadier Infantry Regiments, together with artillery and other supporting arms. Even before the invasion the German division had not been considered a front line formation, but rather a static division on anti-invasion duties, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> units had not been at full strength. Furthermore, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> troops were older than was normal in a first line division, or were conscripted foreigners from Poland and Russia. Being a static division, it was hampered further by having almost no transport of its own, and what was available was mostly horse drawn.|$|E
