5000|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) is a <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> used {{to stimulate}} small {{regions of the}} brain. During a TMS procedure, a magnetic field generator, or [...] "coil", is placed near {{the head of the}} person receiving the treatment. The coil produces small electric currents in the region of the brain just under the coil via electromagnetic induction. The coil is connected to a pulse generator, or stimulator, that delivers electric current to the coil.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic {{flux leakage}} (،TFI) is a <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> of {{nondestructive}} testing {{that is used}} to detect corrosion and pitting in steel structures, most commonly pipelines and storage tanks. The basic principle is that a powerful magnet is used to magnetize the steel. At areas where there is corrosion or missing metal, the magnetic field [...] "leaks" [...] from the steel. In an MFL tool, a magnetic detector is placed between the poles of the magnet to detect the leakage field. Analysts interpret the chart recording of the leakage field to identify damaged areas and to estimate the depth of metal loss.|$|E

5000|$|The wire ropes are {{stressed}} by fluctuating forces, by wear, by corrosion and in seldom cases by extreme forces. The rope life is finite {{and the safety}} is only ensured by inspection {{for the detection of}} wire breaks on a reference rope length, of cross-section loss, as well as other failures so that the wire rope can be replaced before a dangerous situation occurs. Installations should be designed to facilitate the inspection of the wire ropes. [...] Lifting installations for passenger transportation require that a combination of several methods should be used to prevent a car from plunging downwards. Elevators must have redundant bearing ropes and a safety gear. Ropeways and mine hoistings must be permanently supervised by a responsible manager and the rope must be inspected by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> capable of detecting inner wire breaks.|$|E
40|$|A {{magnetic}} study over a 95 m x 150 m {{area of the}} Hickory sandstone aquifer {{in central}} Texas was carried out as part of multitechnique geophysical investigation that included ground penetrating radar (GPR), electromagnetic (EM), seismic and seimoelectric. In geophysical exploration, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> can be utilized {{as an alternative to}} more expensive methods, such as seismic or {{it can be used to}} complement other methods. In this thesis, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> is applied to estimate the location of a previously mapped fault by Texas A&M geology students, and it is used to estimate the magnetic susceptibility contrast of the targeted fault. The main challenge of this study is imaging shallow faults using the geophysical <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> in a fractured aquifer with widely-scattered distribution of iron bearing rocks as in the case of the Hickory sandstone aquifer. A Geometric?G 858 Cesium vapor magnetometer was used to collect magnetic data. The data consisted of 19 north-south and 1 east-west lines acquired in October and November of 2012. Elementary data processing such as diurnal correction, regional correction, reduction to pole (RTP) filter, Euler deconvolution, forward modeling and inversion were employed to characterize the faulted zone. This faulted zone separates granite basement rocks from the Hickory sandstone. As a result, this study emphasizes that Euler deconvolution applied to RTP-filtered data increases the interpretability of geological and structural contacts. The results of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> have been compared to results of GPR, EM and seismoelectric methods. Understanding the magnetic mineralogy of rocks and their properties can improve the geological interpretation of magnetic surveys...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{genesis of}} cobalt metal {{particles}} in silica-supported Fischer-Tropsch catalysts was studied using in situ Foner vibrating-sample <b>magnetic</b> <b>method.</b> The cobalt promoted and unpromoted catalysts were prepared by aqueous (co) -impregnation using cobalt nitrate or acetate, ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate or perrhenic acid followed by oxidative pre-treatment in air and reduction in hydrogen. In several catalyst preparations, sucrose {{was added to}} the impregnating solutions. The genesis of cobalt metal phases in these catalysts was monitored in situ by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> during the temperature-programmed reduction in pure hydrogen. A considerably higher extent of cobalt reduction was found in the catalysts prepared from cobalt nitrate than in those prepared from cobalt acetate. Promotion with ruthenium and rhenium results in a considerable decrease in the temperature of the emergence of cobalt metal phases. Small superparamagnetic, single-domain and multi-domain ferromagnetic cobalt metal particles were observed in the reduced catalysts by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>method.</b> It was found that lower temperature calcination of the cobalt catalysts prepared from cobalt nitrate and addition of sucrose to the impregnating solution lead to a decrease in the concentration of multi-domain cobalt ferromagnetic metal particles and to an increase in the fraction of superparamagnetic cobalt particles. Superparamagnetic cobalt particles smaller than 6 - 7 nm were detected in the reduced catalysts prepared from cobalt nitrate with sucrose addition and in the catalysts prepared from cobalt acetate. Catalyst characterization using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has confirmed the results about cobalt dispersion and reducibility in the cobalt silica-supported catalysts obtained by the Foner <b>magnetic</b> <b>method...</b>|$|E

40|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>method,</b> {{perhaps the}} oldest of geophysi-cal {{exploration}} techniques, blossomed after the advent of airborne surveys in World War II. With improvements in instrumentation, navigation, and platform compensation, {{it is now possible}} to map the entire crustal section at a variety of scales, from strongly magnetic basement at re-gional scale to weakly magnetic sedimentary contacts at lo-cal scale. Methods of data filtering, display, and interpreta-tion have also advanced, especially with the availability of low-cost, high-performance personal computers and color raster graphics. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> is the primary explo-ration tool in the search for minerals. In other arenas, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>method</b> has evolved from its sole use for map-ping basement structure to include a wide range of new applications, such as locating intrasedimentary faults, defining subtle lithologic contacts, mapping salt domes in weakly magnetic sediments, and better defining tar-gets through 3 D inversion.

40|$|Layered mafic {{intrusions}} {{represent an}} important aspect of magmatism on earth and have occurred from Archean to present times. Literature on the geochemistry and petrology of these intrusions abounds but their physical properties, which could provide significant constraints on their formation, have seldom been investigated. Classic petrological methods such as whole-rock geochemistry, textural analysis and mineral chemistry have been applied to several intrusions of various ages. Most of these methods are relatively expensive or time intensive which limits high resolution studies. On the contrary, <b>magnetic</b> <b>methods</b> are typically inexpensive and fast and have been successfully applied to various occurrences of mafic rocks. In this study, several <b>magnetic</b> <b>methods</b> have been applied to a 600 m-long continuous borehole core drilled through one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest layered mafic intrusion, the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe. The main goal {{of this study is to}} constrain the magmatic history of the intrusion. More specifically, it is important to determine if the intrusion functioned as an open system, characterized by multiple magma pulses, or as a closed system, undergoing differentiation after a single magmatic pulse. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>methods</b> have also been validated by other independent approaches including image analysis, and electron microprobe. This study demonstrates that <b>magnetic</b> <b>methods</b> can be used to rapidly obtain critical information on the internal structure of this type of intrusion before applying more costly chemical analyses.
