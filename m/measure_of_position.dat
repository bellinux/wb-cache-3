40|$|Summary. This {{research}} models US home-owners ’ {{decisions to}} move up or down in price. The models are based on three common conceptualisations: the housing ladder, the housing life-cycle and the housing life-course that use age of the householder as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in life. Age can be a proxy for many characteristics and we test several alternative measures using unique survey data {{that allow us to}} examine specific life-course variables. We conclude that, on an empirical level, age works reasonably well. However, we prefer a more complete formulation that includes presence of children, divorced or separated householder, income, age at first home-ownership and duration of ownership as being conceptually more accurate and more useful in policy-making...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} the attentional system of a humanoid robot based completely on space variant vision (in particular logpolar). The aim is that of providing the robot with a suitable <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>position,</b> speed and saliency of possibly interesting objects for saccading and tracking. The major advantage of log-polar based imaging is related to the reduced number of pixels while maintaining a large field of view. This arrangement is very well suited for motor control, where the high-resolution center (fovea) allows precise positioning and, at the same time, the coarse resolution periphery permits detection of potential targets. Algorithms for color processing, optic flow, and disparity computation were developed within this architecture. The attentional modules are intended as the first layer of a more complicated system, which shall include learning of object recognition, trajectory tracking, and naïve physics understanding during the natural interaction of the robot with the environment...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{step towards}} broadening {{the use of}} real world image-based visual servoing is {{to deal with the}} important issues of reliability and robustness. In order to address this issue, a closed loop control law is proposed that simultaneously accomplishes a visual servoing task and is robust to a general class of external errors. This generality allows concurrent consideration {{of a wide range of}} errors including: noise from image feature extraction, small scale errors in the tracking and even large scale errors in the matching between current and desired features. This is achieved with the application of widely accepted statistical techniques of robust M-estimation. The M-estimator is integrated by an iteratively re-weighted method. The Median Absolute Deviation is used as an estimate of the standard deviation of the inlier data and is compared with other methods. This combination is advantageous because of its high efficiency, high breakdown point and desirable influence functions. The robustness and stability of the control law is shown to be dependent on a subsequent <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> uncertainty. Furthermore the convergence criteria of the control law are investigated. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate visual servoing tasks which resist severe outlier contamination...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{tracking}} people through occlusions by scene objects. Rather than relying on models of the scene to predict when occlusions will occur as other researchers have done, this paper proposes a linear dynamic system that switches between two alternatives of the position measurement in order to handle occlusions as they occur. The filter automatically switches between a foot-based <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> (assuming z = 0) to a head-based position measure (given the person’s height) when an occlusion of the person’s lower body occurs. No knowledge of the scene or its occluding objects is used. Unlike similar research [2, 14], the approach does not assume a fixed height for people and so is able to track humans through occlusions even when they change height during the occlusion. The approach is evaluated on three furnished scenes containing tables, chairs, desks and partitions. Occlusions range from occlusions of legs, occlusions whilst being seated and near-total occlusions where only the person’s head is visible. Results show that the approach provides a significant reduction in false-positive tracks in a multi-camera environment, and more than halves the number of lost tracks in single monocular camera views. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ratio of}} two {{differentially}} replicating alleles is not constant during S phase. Using this fact, {{we have developed}} a method for determining allele-specific replication timing for alleles differing by at least a single base pair. Unsynchronized cells in tissue culture are first sorted into fractions based on DNA content as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> in S phase. DNA is purified from each fraction and used for PCR with primers that bracket the allelic difference, amplifying both alleles. The ratio of alleles in the amplified product is then determined by a single nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) assay, modified as described [Singer-Sam,J. and Riggs,A. D.

We report here use of this SNuPE-based method to analyze replication timing of two X-linked genes, Pgk- 1 and Xist, {{as well as the}} autosomal gene Gabra- 6. We have found that the two alleles of the Gabra- 6 gene replicate synchronously, as expected; similarly, the active allele of the Pgk- 1 gene on the active X chromosome (Xa) replicates early relative to the silent allele on the inactive X chromosome (Xi).

Perceived distress was measured using the Nottingham health profile. The <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic <b>position</b> included: social class, Jarman scores of patients' areas of residence, whether or not patients owned their own home, whether or not patients owned a car, whether or not they had been unemployed during the previous year {{and whether or not they}} had had further education. Social class data were only available for 84 % of the 1075 respondents completing the Nottingham health profile. Those respondents for whom social class data were not available were significantly more likely to score positively on the social isolation, sleep and physical mobility dimensions of the Nottingham health profile. Not owning one's own home emerged as the <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic status that best predicted distress. The other <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic status that were significantly predictive of distress were not having had further education and having been unemployed during the last year.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the graded association between socioeconomic position and health. Few of these {{studies have examined the}} cumulative effect <b>of</b> socioeconomic <b>position</b> throughout the lifecourse, and even fewer have included women. Those that have explored gender differences affirm the importance of studying the factors that predict women and men's health separately, This study addresses the associations between cross-sectional and longitudinal socioeconomic position, risk factors for cardiovascular disease and mortality From various causes. Analyses are based on data from a cohort of working Scottish women recruited between 1970 and 1973. Five socioeconomic measures were explored in relation to diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol concentration, body mass index, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), amount of recreational exercise taken, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. in general, for each <b>of</b> the five <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic <b>position,</b> there were significant differences in {{at least one of the}} age-adjusted physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease (diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol concentration, body mass index, FEV 1). There were also significant differences in the percentage of current cigarette smokers according to different <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic <b>position.</b> although this: was not the case for the other behavioural risk factors for cardiovascular disease (amount of recreational exercise taken, and alcohol consumption). <b>Measures</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic <b>position</b> were also examined in relation to cause of death for the women who died before 1 January 1999.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> sense in the lumbosacral area and to determine test-retest reliability. BACKGROUND: Proprioception, muscle control, and coordination training could be the key issues in resolving neuromuscular dysfunction in patients with low back pain, {{but there are no}} standard ways to assess these parameters. METHODS AND MEASURES: A piezoresistive accelerometer attached to the skin over the sacrum was used to research the repositioning accuracy of active pelvic tilting, between days, of 14 young nonimpaired subjects (20 to 26 years of age) in standing. RESULTS: The mean absolute error for repositioning accuracy (the difference between criterion and matching positions) was 1. 81 degrees (+/- 0. 85). The intraclass correlation coefficient between measurements obtained on days 1 and 2 was moderate (R = 0. 51). The average standard error of measurement associated with the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0. 5 degree (95 % confidence interval = +/- 0. 99 degree). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the proposed test is sensitive with moderate test-retest reliability to examine lumbosacral position sense in healthy subjects.

40|$|Growth hormone (GH) {{was applied}} to Atlantic salmon Salmo salar parr (the pre-migratory {{freshwater}} life stage) to manipulate growth potential experimentally and to elucidate the effects on dominance status, actual growth, exploratory activity and home range. Experiments were conducted using seven groups of eight parr from May to September of two successive years. The fish were tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags), tested for dominance, and then held in an enclosed section of a natural stream which was fitted {{with an array of}} PIT tag detectors to record space use at a definition of c. 2 m. Relationships between dominance rank, space use and growth were established over 2 weeks. The four lowest ranking fish in each group were then given a slow-release GH implant while the other fish received a placebo. The GH stimulated increase in fork length (LF) and mass and decrease in condition factor due to the relatively greater increase in LF. There was, however, an interaction between GH-stimulated increase in growth and season, with the hormone having an effect only during {{the early part of the}} summer. Regardless of treatment, fish that moved most around their home range grew fastest. Increased growth in GH-treated fish was associated with an increase in growth per unit movement, not increased total movement. This suggested that GH-treated fish increased their rate of short-distance (< 2 m) foraging movements. Overall, space use, measured in terms of home range size and time allocation throughout the range, did not vary consistently in response to application of GH. There was a strong correlation between the weighted centre of the home range (a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> within the enclosure) before and after treatment, irrespective of whether fish were given GH or a placebo. The study shows that when density is low relative to carrying capacity, GH stimulates increased dominance and growth in a near-natural environment without having measurable effects on space use at a definition of c. 2 m. The results are interpreted as suggesting that high dominance status gives no significant growth advantage in a highly competitive situation, but increases foraging rate when food is abundant. Increased foraging appears to result from local changes in time budgeting rather than variations in the extent of home range and larger-scale movements within it. Thus, in areas with declining wild Atlantic salmon populations where the habitat is unsaturated and food is abundant, introduced domestic Atlantic salmon may be competitively superior...|$|E

40|$|Background. Violence is {{a leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in South Africa and needs to be researched from a public health perspective. Typically in violence research, socioeconomic position is used in the analysis to control for confounding. Social epidemiology approaches this variable as a primary determinant of interest and is used in this research to better understand the aetiology of violence in South Africa. We hypothesised that <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic <b>position</b> (employment, education and household wealth) would be inversely related to violence at the individual and household levels. Methodology/Principal Findings. Data came from the 1998 South African Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS). <b>Measures</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic <b>position</b> used were employment, education and household wealth. Eighty-eight people (0. 2 %) received treatment for a violent injury in the previous 30 days and 103 households (0. 9 %) experienced a violent death in the previous year. Risk factors for violence at the individual level included employment (41 % of those who experienced violence were employed vs. 27 % of those who did not, p = 0. 02), and education (those who experienced violence had on average, one year more education than those who did not, p = 0. 04). Belonging to a household in the wealthiest quintile was protective against violence (OR: 0. 32; 95 % CI: 0. 12 – 0. 89). In contrast, at the household level all three <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> socioeconomic <b>position</b> were protective against the experience of a violent death.

This cross-sectional study examines multiple dimensions <b>of</b> social <b>position</b> in relation to obesity-related behaviors in an adolescent and young adult population. In addition to using conventional <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> social <b>position,</b> including parental education and household expenditures, we explore the usefulness <b>of</b> three youth-specific <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> social <b>position</b> – community and society subjective social status and school dropout status. Data are taken from a 2004 house-to-house survey of urban households within the bottom 20 th percentile of income distribution within seven states in Mexico. A total of 5, 321 Mexican adolescents, aged 12 – 22 years, provided information on obesity-related behaviors (e. g., diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior) and indicators of subjective and objective social position. A parent in each household provided information on socioeconomic status of the parent and household. Ordinal logistic regressions are used to estimate the associations of parental, household and adolescent indicators <b>of</b> social <b>position</b> and obesity-related risk behaviors. Those adolescents with the highest odds of adopting obesity risk behaviors were the ones who perceived themselves as lower in social status in reference to their peer community and those who had dropped out of school. We found no significant associations between parental education or household expenditures and obesity-related risk behaviors. Immediate social factors in adolescents’ lives may have a strong influence on their health-related behaviors. This study provides evidence for the usefulness <b>of</b> two particular <b>measures,</b> both <b>of</b> which are youth-specific. Adolescents and young adults who have dropped out of school and those with lower perceived relative social position within their community {{are more likely to be}} at-risk for obesity-related behaviors than those with higher relative social position.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to understand observed social variations in cardiovascular disease in terms of sets of intermediate or confounding risk factors. Tests of these models have tended to produce inconsistent evidence. This paper examines the relationships to cardiovascular risk factors or two theoretically based <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> social <b>position.</b> It shows that {{the strength of the}} relationships between social position and cardiovascular risk factors varies according to the definition <b>of</b> social <b>position</b> which is used: there is a closer relationship between most health behaviours and the Cambridge scale, an indicator of 'general social advantage and lifestyle', whereas the Erikson-Goldthorpe schema, which is based on employment relations and conditions, is more strongly related to work control and breathlessness. The implications of these findings for understanding the conflicting evidence in other studies of health inequalities are then discussed. The paper concludes that inconsistencies between studies may be in part due to unexamined differences between the conceptual bases <b>of</b> the <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> social <b>position</b> they use, combined with a failure to make explicit the hypothetical mechanisms of effect. If neither the conceptual basis <b>of</b> the <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> social <b>position,</b> nor the links between social position and health outcome tested in each study are clear, inconsistencies between studies will be difficult to interpret, making policy recommendations highly problematic.
