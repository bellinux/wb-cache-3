5|$|Shang Tsung (played by Philip Ahn, M.D.): {{the evil}} sorcerer who {{convinced}} Kahn to spare his life {{after losing the}} last tournament, with a new plan to appease his master, who in turn restores Tsung's youth. He {{also serves as a}} sub-boss of the game, appearing before Kintaro in the single player mode. As in the first game, he is able to <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> any of the playable characters, retaining their moves (in some versions only the character against whom he is currently fighting).|$|E
5|$|The initial {{idea for}} a video game that {{presented}} the Metroid series in a pinball setting came to Kensuke Tanabe after he learned that Fuse Games had previously worked on Mario Pinball Land, another pinball video game. Recalling that the series' protagonist, Samus, can <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> a ball, Tanabe {{was convinced that the}} Metroid universe could be adapted to a pinball setting. The game was sold with a Rumble Pak accessory for the Nintendo DS, marking the first time the accessory was available for the Nintendo DS.|$|E

5|$|During summer, the Bay of Bengal {{is subject}} to intense heating, giving rise to humid and {{unstable}} air masses that <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> cyclones. The 1737 Calcutta cyclone, the 1970 Bhola cyclone, and the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone rank among the most powerful cyclones to strike India, devastating the coasts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Widespread death and property destruction are reported {{every year in the}} exposed coastal states of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. India's western coast, bordering the more placid Arabian Sea, experiences cyclones only rarely; these mainly strike Gujarat and, less frequently, Kerala.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{was set in}} a dystopian future {{controlled}} by Cyber-cops (referred to as such by director Brett Leonard.) It depicted an individual who records the Cyber-cops beating a man, only to be noticed and attacked himself. His camera is destroyed and the Cyber-cops leave him unconscious on the ground, as they are busy trying to put down a riot elsewhere in the city. Alone, his camera equipment lands on him and is absorbed into his body, causing him to dramatically <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> a cyborg. The cyborg then joins the riot, leading the rebels to victory.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Calderon, Emily's {{doctor who}} works for a company called Prangen, refuses to {{transfer}} Emily's medical records to the County Children's Center, prompting Mulder to rough him up, but has to leave when security arrives. Later, Mulder follows Calderon after he leaves his office. Scully has imaging tests conducted on Emily. Calderon goes to see the Dark Suited Men, one of whom kills him by stabbing him in the neck with an alien stiletto; both men then <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> Calderon. Mulder follows as one of them leaves. The results of Emily's tests show her to be suffering from a tumorous infection. The other Calderon arrives at the hospital and injects Emily with an unknown green substance; he escapes by morphing into someone else. Scully believes that he is continuing the treatments, and the Sims were murdered because they were trying to stop him. Mulder follows the first Calderon clone into a building, where he meets Anna Fugazzi, an elderly woman in a nursing home.|$|E

Baltic Romani came from the Central Romani dialect which branches off to the many other dialects listed above.|$|R
5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grod√©nchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to know who she is. Kira and the crystal suddenly <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion. She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away. Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder, but not of his feelings for her.|$|E

25|$|Warren Ellis' Ultimate Galactus Trilogy {{originally}} {{suggested that}} the Ultimates' ally the Vision was the herald of Galactus, a robotic probe that travels through space warning civilizations of the impending arrival of Gah Lak Tus. In the final miniseries of the trilogy, Ultimate Extinction, silvery humanoids began to appear, sent to trigger mass suicides {{in order to reduce}} the population's resistance. Suicide cults founded by the creatures began to appear all across the globe as Gah Lak Tus drew near. These silvery beings had the ability to grow wings; <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> an ovoid; form spikes; or take an intermediary form, gliding on an oval surface. They also demonstrated the ability to manipulate large quantities of energy.|$|E
25|$|The second {{version of}} Fixer is an {{intuitive}} genius at invention {{of weapons and}} other electrical and mechanical devices. He has designed numerous devices and paraphernalia for himself, including his body armor. As weaponry, he has used various devices including bombs, electronic jamming devices, guided missiles, sonic amplifiers, brain-wave scanners, and mind-control pods. He has also built anti-gravity discs which are affixed {{to his feet and}} allow flight at the speed of sound, as well as a special mask which contains a three-hour air supply and acts as an air pressure reduction valve, together enabling flight at high velocity and high altitude. Fixer's Techno body can mentally control his robotic body which is capable of assuming virtually any form from blast cannons to pile-drivers to even the form of a space station. To take on larger shapes, Techno absorbed mass from other mechanical materials nearby. Techno's body also could <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> forms that appeared completely organic, as with his assumed guise of Thunderbolt machine-smith Ogre.|$|E
25|$|When emigrating, scout P. fraternus wasps {{lead the}} whole pack of wasps {{to the site}} in a swarm cloud that is about 2 to 4 meters wide and 3 meters tall. After landing on the new nest site, the scouts usually brushed antennas {{with each other and}} put their {{mouthparts}} on the new substrate. Then, they perform gaster dragging and flight looping behaviors to signify that they have arrived at the new nest site. These behaviors are usually repeated many times. Nest construction generally begins shortly afterwards with combs and peduncles being built. Old pulp from the previous nest site is used to construct the new nest. Scout wasps then return to the old nest to attempt to activate inactive wasps to depart by dragging and shaking their gasters and initiating mouth contact. After these interactions with scouts, the previously inactive wasps begin flying around and depart within a few minutes. Males often do not follow the swarm because they are not able to follow the swarm emigration trail. P. fraternus does not form clusters along the emigration route like some other species do when they emigrate. During an emigration, some worker wasps <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> the role of scouts.|$|E

500|$|After {{going from}} 34 seats to 8, as Caplan puts it, [...] "June 4 and June 11 , 1945, {{proved to be}} black days in CCF annuals: Socialism was {{effectively}} removed from the Canadian political agenda." [...] The CCF would never fully recover from this defeat and would eventually cease as a party and <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> the Ontario New Democratic Party. Only then, and in the 1970s, did a social democratic party attain the popularity it had under Jolliffe in 1943.|$|E
500|$|The Benaroya Hall {{entrance}} to University Street station, built in 1998 {{for the new}} venue, is decorated {{with a series of}} art pieces by Erin Shie Palmer known collectively as the [...] "Temple of Music". The walkway's walls are sandblasted with images that begin as an abstract musical score derived from Robert Fludd's [...] "Temple of Music" [...] and <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> pixellated patterns as it approaches the station mezzanine. The walkway's handrails are etched with Braille text and , and end in sculpted depictions of a violin and a microphone.|$|E
500|$|The album {{contained}} {{experiments and}} styles never previously attempted by Korn. AllMusic related: [...] "The band {{is far more}} experimental this time out, delivering Helmet-like ringing guitars that melt and <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> each other, a mix of Metallica-esque blastbeats and tight funk drumming from the constantly improving David Silveria, and memorable riffs that take the shape of dark sound structures and offer {{more than just a}} collection of chords." [...] The first two music videos from Untouchables, [...] "Here to Stay" [...] and [...] "Thoughtless", were directed by the Hughes Brothers. [...] "Here to Stay" [...] earned Korn a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. [...] "Here to Stay" [...] peaked at number seventy-two on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

500|$|The series premiere {{begins at}} Sunnydale High School, where a boy (played by Carmine Giovinazzo) breaks {{into the school}} during the night with a {{seemingly}} reluctant girl (Julie Benz), promising her mischief and therefore fun. Nervous and on edge, the girl says she thinks she heard something and fears someone is in the school, other than the two of them. The boy calls out but gets no response, leading him to say [...] "it's nothing" [...] to the girl and assure her that they [...] "are alone". The girl says [...] " [...] ok, that's good", after which she turns to face the boy, revealing her facial <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> her true identity; a vampire. She then bites the boy's neck. She is later revealed to be Darla.|$|E
500|$|Marrakesh has {{the largest}} {{traditional}} Berber market in Morocco {{and the image of}} the city is closely associated with its souks. Paul Sullivan cites the souks as the principal shopping attraction in the city: [...] "A honeycomb of intricately connected alleyways, this fundamental section of the old city is a micro-medina in itself, comprising a dizzying number of stalls and shops that range from itsy kiosks no bigger than an elf's wardrobe to scruffy store-fronts that <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> glittering Aladdin's Caves once you're inside." [...] Historically the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist but with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns. Haggling is still {{a very important part of}} trade in the souks.|$|E
500|$|Roy Thinnes, who {{portrayed the}} alien healer Jeremiah Smith, was {{suggested}} to Chris Carter by David Duchovny, after the latter had met and spoken to Thinnes {{on an airplane}} flight. Carter had seen Thinnes' television work before, and had {{been a fan of}} his appearance on the 1967‚Äì68 television series The Invaders. Early on in pre-production, the writers decided to have Smith <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> various characters that the Smoking Man had, either personally or involuntarily, killed, including Deep Throat, Bill Mulder, and Melissa Scully. Melinda McGraw, who portrayed Melissa Scully during the second season, was unavailable for filming, so her scene was cut. In addition, a photo-double was brought in for Jerry Hardin, who played Deep Throat, because he was unavailable on one of the filming days. Frank Spotnitz later called the prison sequence the scene with [...] "the biggest cast ever." ...|$|E
