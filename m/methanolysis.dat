50|$|The {{compound}} is {{manufactured by}} several methods, the principal one being the acetone cyanohydrin (ACH) route. ACH {{is produced by}} condensation of acetone and hydrogen cyanide.

50|$|It {{has also}} been {{employed}} widely in tandem with GC-MS {{for the analysis of}} various carboxylic compounds which are ubiquitous in nature. The fact that the reaction is rapid and occurs readily makes it attractive. However, it can form artifacts which complicate spectral interpretation. Such artifacts are usually the trimethylsilylmethyl esters, RCO2CH2SiMe3, formed when insufficient methanol is present. Acid-catalysed <b>methanolysis</b> is necessary to achieve near-quantitative yields of the desired methyl esters, RCO2Me.|$|E
5000|$|Composting {{of organic}} {{materials}} is the microbial degradation of heterogeneous organic material under moist, self-heating, aerobic conditions. Initially, activity by mesophilic organisms {{leads to a}} rapid rise in temperature, followed by thermophilic organisms dominating the degradation process leading to a cooling period in which mesophilic bacteria again dominate populations. A commercial FAME extraction protocol developed for identification of bacteria, a mild alkaline <b>methanolysis</b> protocol and PLFA-extraction/derivatization were compared for effectiveness. [...] The PLFA protocol gave the most detailed information about community succession, however, the other two protocols were much simpler and appeared suitable for analysis of microbial FAME profiles in compost.|$|E

[...] Most of the synthetic approaches to bicyclomycin, have started from the preformed 2,5-diketopiperazine ring.Williams synthesis starts from the para-methoxybenzyl protected 2,5-diketopiperazine 1, bis bromination to give the 3,6-dibromide followed by thiolate displacements with sodio-2-thiopyridine gave the syn di(thiopyridine) derivative which was condensed with the silyl ketene acetal of y-butyrolactone in presence of silver triflate (AgOTf) to give the mono lactone which upon reduction with LiAlH4 afforded the diol 2. Cyclization of 2 {{in the presence of}} silver triflate gave the bicyclo-4.2.2 alcohol 3. Dehydration to the key olefin proceeded in good overall yield followed by bridgehead carbanion oxidation with molecular oxygen gave the single hydroxylation product 4. Formation of the dianion of 4 followed by aldol reaction with acetal aldehyde 5 gave the aldol product with the desired relative configuration. Protection of the C-1'-hydroxyl as the corresponding trifluoroacetate followed by cleavage of the acetonide and p-methoxybenzyl groups with ceric ammonium nitrate followed by <b>methanolysis</b> on silica gel gave racemic bicyclomycin 6. Use of the optically active aldehyde analogue of 5 allowed preparation of optically active 6.|$|E
50|$|Most {{examples}} of MOF-based catalysis {{make use of}} metal ions or atoms as active sites. Among the few exceptions are two nickel- and two copper-containing MOFs synthesized by Rosseinsky and co-workers. These compounds employ amino acids(L- or D-aspartate) together with dipyridyls as struts. The coordination chemistry is such that the amine group of the aspartate cannot be protonated by added HCl, {{but one of the}} aspartate carboxylates can. Thus, the framework-incorporated amino acid can exist in a form that is not accessible for the free amino acid. While the nickel-based compounds are marginally porous, on account of tiny channel dimensions, the copper versions are clearly porous.The Rosseinsky group showed that the carboxylic acids behave as Brønsted acidic catalysts, facilitating (in the copper cases) the ring-opening <b>methanolysis</b> of a small, cavityaccessible epoxide at up to 65% yield. These researchers point out that superior homogeneous catalysts exist, but emphasize that the catalyst formed here is unique to the MOF environment, thus representing an interesting proof of concept.Kitagawa and co-workers have reported the synthesis of a catalytic MOF having the formula Cd(4-BTAPA)2(NO3)2. The MOF is three-dimensional, consisting of an identical catenated pair of networks, yet still featuring pores of molecular dimensions. The nodes consist of single cadmium ions, octahedrally ligated by pyridyl nitrogens. From a catalysis standpoint, however, the most interesting feature of this material is the presence of guest-accessible amide functionalities. The researchers showed that the amides are capable of base-catalyzing the Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with malononitrile. Reactions with larger nitriles, however, are only marginally accelerated, implying that catalysis takes place chiefly within the material’s channels rather than on its exterior. A noteworthy finding is the lack of catalysis by the free strut in homogeneous solution, evidently due to intermolecular H-bonding between bptda molecules. Thus, the MOF architecture elicits catalytic activity not otherwise encountered.In an interesting alternative approach, Férey and coworkers were able to modify the interior of MIL-101 via Cr(III) coordination of one of the two available nitrogen atoms of each of several ethylenediamine molecules. The free non-coordinated ends of the ethylenediamines were then used as Brønsted basic catalysts, again for Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with nitriles.A third approach has been described by Kim and coworkers. Using a pyridine-functionalized derivative of tartaric acid and a Zn(II) source they were able to synthesize a 2D MOF termed POST-1. POST-1 possesses 1D channels whose cross sections are defined by six trinuclear zinc clusters and six struts. While three of the six pyridines are coordinated by zinc ions, the remaining three are protonated and directed toward the channel interior. When neutralized, the noncoordinated pyridyl groups are found to catalyze transesterification reactions, presumably by facilitating deprotonation of the reactant alcohol. The absence of significant catalysis when large alcohols are employed strongly suggests that the catalysis occurs within the channels of the MOF.|$|E
30|$|<b>Methanolysis</b> is {{a simple}} {{alcoholysis}} treatment, which produces DMT and ethylene glycol. The PET is dissolved and partially glycolyzed by the <b>methanolysis,</b> resulting in DMT and ethylene glycol, and then DMT is purified by crystallization and distillation (Scheirs 1998). Typical PET feedstocks for <b>methanolysis</b> are postconsumer films, plant waste, fiber waste, and bottle scraps. Because {{it is much easier}} to purify DMT compared with BHET, PET feedstocks with lower quality are acceptable in the <b>methanolysis</b> process as compared with the glycolysis process, and other products such as ethylene glycol and methanol are easily recycled and recovered (Goto et al. 2002; Kurokawa et al. 2003; Genta et al. 2007; Guclu et al. 2003). Although <b>methanolysis</b> has high processing costs, its relatively low feedstock costs compensate for the relatively high processing costs because <b>methanolysis</b> is more tolerant of contamination. However, the main feedstock for PET production is purified TPA, not DMT, which is the major product of <b>methanolysis.</b> The conversion of DMT to TPA by hydrolysis adds considerable expense to the <b>methanolysis</b> process. A novel <b>methanolysis</b> technique, which has lower conversion costs and high yields, has been developed by Eastman Kodak and DuPont (Scheirs 1998).|$|E

Clinical and reference strains of the medically important yeasts Candida albicans, Torulopsis glabrata, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were cultured for 48 h at 26 degrees C.

The relative recovery rates for cellular fatty acids, including the volatile acids C 10 : 0 and C 12 : 0, were similar after alcoholysis with ethanol, propanol, or butanol, while <b>methanolysis</b> gave lower recoveries of volatile fatty acids. Thus, after ethanolysis, the recovery of C 10 : 0 acid (0. 1, 1, and 10 %) from a defined matrix (lyophilized Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells) varied from 97 to 102 %, while the recovery of C 10 : 0 after <b>methanolysis</b> varied from 49 to 75 %.
