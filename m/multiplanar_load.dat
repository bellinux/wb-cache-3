30|$|In vivo {{studies have}} shown that ACL strain {{increases}} the motion of knee flexion, tibial internal rotation, knee valgus, and anterior tibial translation (Asano et al. 2001; Kiapour et al. 2016). These studies demonstrated maximum ACL strain occurs during <b>multiplanar</b> <b>loads</b> of these four motions. In the current study, the maximum angle at landing was increased for tibial internal rotation only. Using the point cluster technique, Nagano et al. previously demonstrated that knee valgus angle and tibial internal rotation angle increased during SDL in a single task (Nagano et al. 2009); however, subjects were not athletes. We found that the maximum tibial internal rotation angle increased but knee valgus angle did not increase. A previous study showed that ACL strain increased because of changes in knee kinematics (Koga et al. 2010). The greater the changes in knee kinematics, the more the ACL strain increases, which can lead to ACL rupture.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of diagnostic techniques has augmented {{the number of}} operations performed in relation to resolving wrists pain. This cadaveric study obtains effective biomechanics knowledge {{which can be used}} to address the long-term surgical and therapeutic solutions related to the array of forearm medical conditions by considering the loadsharing mechanism of cadeveric specimens subjected to a <b>multiplanar</b> <b>loading</b> of the hand. Kinetic understanding of the load bearing response of the lunate, scaphoid, ulna and radius in response to a three-dimensional load is given. The lunate and scaphoid were exposed by dissection and a rosette strain gauge is bonded to each, in addition gauges are attached to the radius and ulna. A custom built rig was developed which allows a loading profile to be applied to each phalanx of cadeveric forearm specimens, and the relative force transmitted through the Innate and scaphoid and the ulna and radius to be monitored...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{a lateral}} lumbar shift are often managed with a frontal plane, manual {{correction}} first described by McKenzie. However, {{there is a}} subset of patients that require a frontal plane correction who do not demonstrate a lateral shift. Both of these patient groups have what is termed a relevant lateral component (RLC). The subset of patients who have an RLC, without a shift, has received very little attention in the literature to date. This case report describes a patient with no shift who had a remarkable disc extrusion identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient responded nicely {{to a combination of}} frontal and transverse plane loading strategies in six treatments using the mechanical diagnosis and treatment (MDT) evaluation and treatment system. The case report is unique in the literature in that it describes a patient with no apparent frontal plane, lumbar deformity that had documented evidence of a large disc extrusion and who responded to a variation of McKenzie’s flexion–rotation mobilization. The centralization phenomenon was demonstrated immediately when a non-weight bearing, <b>multiplanar,</b> <b>loading</b> strategy was administered...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{complications of}} osteosyntheses after hip fractures are previously investigated by mostly static or dynamic uniaxial loading test systems. However, the physiologic loading {{of the hip}} joint during a normal gait is a multiplanar, dynamic movement. Therefore, we constructed a system to test osteosyntheses for hip fractures under physiologic <b>multiplanar</b> <b>loading</b> representative of normal gait. To evaluate the testing system, 12 femora pairs were tested under 25, 000 cycles with two standard osteosyntheses (Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation/Gamma 3 Nail). For angular movement, the varus collapse to cut out (proportional to(CO)) (proportional to(CO) = 4. 8 degrees +/- 2. 1 degrees for blade and proportional to(CO) = 7. 8 degrees +/- 3. 8 degrees for screw) was the dominant failure mode, and only slight rotational angle shifts (proportional to(Rot)) (proportional to(Rot) = 1. 7 degrees +/- 0. 4 degrees for blade and proportional to(Rot) = 2. 4 degrees +/- 0. 3 degrees for screw) of the femoral head around the implant axis were observed. Angular displacements in varus direction and rotation were higher in specimens reinforced with screws. Hence, the cut out model and the migration directions showed a distinction between helical blade and hip screw. However, {{there were no significant}} differences between the different implants. The new setup is able to create clinical failures and allows to give evidence about the anchorage stability of different implant types under dynamic gait motion pattern. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a nonlinear Finite Element analysis of welded tubular connections, addressing several areas of recent {{interest in the}} field. A comprehensive study of <b>multiplanar</b> axially <b>loaded</b> T-DT joints in both CHS and RHS was undertaken {{to add to the}} available knowledge and interest/ activity in the field of multiplanar connections. Sections of this study are supported by earlier experimental work undertaken at Nottingham (not by the author) and from a combination of these and FE results, a series of design rules to supplement the current IIW planar design formulae developed. Analysis of the effect of brace angle on the difference between axially loaded T and Y joints was undertaken to resolve differences between current codes of practice. Finally an analysis of a family of partial overlapped RHS K joints was undertaken to ascertain the effects of boundary conditions, brace angle, β ratio, reversal of loading and hidden weld on the ultimate capacity and performance of such joints. All of the FE work was undertaken using ABAQUS, including both geometric and material non-linearity. Recommendations for further work are made...|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} hotspot stresses in multiplanar tubular XT-joints {{has been conducted}} in which 180 finite element analyses were performed. The study covers {{a wide range of}} joint geometries under various combinations of axial forces. The results of the analyses are presented as a set of equations expressing the stress concentration factor {{as a function of the}} relevant geometric parameters for various combinations of axial forces. A typical full-size steel multiplanar XT-joint was selected for experimental testing to verify the numerical analyses. A comparison is also made between the results obtained for multiplanar tubular XT-joints and those of the corresponding uniplanar T- and X-joints. It is found that, when all the braces of the <b>multiplanar</b> XT-joints are <b>loaded</b> simultaneously, the <b>multiplanar</b> effect is significant. When the out-of-plane braces are not <b>loaded,</b> the <b>multiplanar</b> effect is insignificant for small β value when the comparison in made between the multiplanar XT-joints with uniplanar T-joints. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, 20 multiplanar DX-joints (double X) with {{in-plane}} braces and out-of-plane braces {{subjected to}} various combination of axial loads were analyzed. The <b>multiplanar</b> effect of <b>loaded</b> and unloaded out-of-plane braces and the load-interaction of multiplanar DX-joints were investigated. The influence of geometric parameters on the stress concentration factors of the joints was also studied. The results {{obtained from the}} analyses of multiplanar DX-joints are {{compared with those of}} the corresponding uniplanar X-joints. It is found that, when the out-of-plane braces are not <b>loaded,</b> the <b>multiplanar</b> effect is not significant when the brace diameter is much smaller than the chord diameter. When the out-of-plane braces are loaded, the hot spot stresses are found to be lower or higher than the values predicted based on uniplanar joints. The deviation can be as much as 87 % or 94 %, respectively, depending on the combination of the load conditions and geometrical parameters. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Herein is {{presented}} a numerical methodology for a static resistance analysis of symmetrically <b>loaded</b> <b>multiplanar</b> KK joints in circular hollow steel sections. This methodology addresses {{factors related to}} the simulation of KK joints such as the material properties, the boundary conditions, mesh generation and refinement, incremental load steps and failure criteria. An objective criterion is proposed to identify the two failure modes most often occurring in KK joints. Failure mode 1 is observed when two neighboring diagonal braces loaded {{in the same sense}} act as one brace penetrating the chord together. In the failure mode 2, excessive deformation is observed in the chord region between two neighboring braces, folding the chord wall. However, in some cases the failure mode is not easily identified or both failure types are present. The proposed criterion objectively identifies the failure mode. In order to compute the joint resistance, an important failure criterion often adopted in literature for uniplanar K joints is the one known as Lu's deformation. In this paper, a strategy is proposed, which is an extension of Lu's criterion for multiplanar KK joints...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric study of symmetrically <b>loaded</b> <b>multiplanar</b> KK connections in circular hollow steel sections. The connections were designed with {{gaps between the}} diagonal braces. Analyses were performed using the commercial finite element program Ansys. A total of 54 KK connections and their corresponding uniplanar K connections were analyzed and compared {{in terms of the}} connection resistance. A new objective criterion to assess the two failure modes most often occurring in KK connections is proposed. Failure mode 1 is observed when two neighboring diagonal braces loaded in the same sense act as one brace penetrating the chord together. In failure mode 2, excessive deformation is observed in the chord region between two neighboring braces, folding the chord wall. However, in some cases, the failure mode is not easily identified, or both failure types are present The proposed criterion is based on the diametric deformation of the chord and objectively assesses the failure mode. By comparing the connection resistance of KK and K connections as determined using numerical analyses, analytical expressions to predict the connection resistance of KK connections were developed. The expressions accurately predict the connection resistance based on geometric parameters and the resistance of the corresponding uniplanar K connection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Jacket support {{structures}} are a preferred solution for offshore wind turbines in deeper waters. Extensive knowledge exists {{in relation to}} its construction technique {{as well as its}} crucial components, but due to considerable cost pressure, continued optimization is essential for the future competitiveness of the concept in the offshore wind business. A significant share of the overall production costs of jacket structures is related to the joints connecting the tubular members. Hence, these joints along with their complex welds are of special interest in terms of cost reduction. The design of tubular joints is generally driven by fatigue resistance. Due to the size, complexity and cost of these joints, this is assessed by using detailed FE models. When defining a numerical model, assumptions have to be made. These decisions influence the obtained output. Several aspects that {{have an impact on the}} results of the models are found to require further research and are investigated within this project: (1) influence of using solid versus shell elements in the modelling of the joint members; (2) degree of accuracy of the Efthymiou equations; (3) influence of the carry-over effect in multiplanar KK-joints; (4) differences in the fatigue life predictions between the hot-spot and the effective notch stress methods. Guidelines recommend the use of both solid and shell theories for the definition of the FE models used in the hot-spot fatigue assessment. Both options are compared in terms of accuracy of the results and computational time. Generally speaking, significant differences are found between both models. The background of the differences is studied. The employment of the Efthymiou formulae is common in practice. These equations provide the SCF at the locations around the weld where they are found to be maximum. The use of this approach carries two sorts of uncertainty. One is directly related to the values that the equations predict. The second one stems from the lack of information on the results at the other positions around the weld. The output of this approach is compared with the results of numerical models. The validity of its use is quantified. Offshore wind jacket joints are mainly <b>multiplanar</b> KK-joints. <b>Loading</b> in the braces of one face of the jacket may yield significant carry-over effects on the out-of-plane braces connected to the same joint. A parametric comparison is carried out to study the accuracy of modelling the joint as a planar K-joint. In general, it is found that the carry-over effect cannot be neglected and the assumption is not accurate. The fatigue assessment of tubular joints by means of the hot-spot method is subjected to several assumptions that limit the optimization of the members. The notch concept is a more realistic method that is presented as an alternative. However, this method is not widely used in engineering practice due to the difficulties in building the numerical model and the high computational requisites. An algorithm to carry out the effective notch stress assessment, based on the sub-modelling technique, is proposed. A comparison of the fatigue life prediction, between the hot-spot and the effective notch methods, is presented. The latter method is found to predict a higher fatigue life for many of the situations tested. Furthermore, since this method allows for a more detailed modelling, the weld profile can also be designed in order to optimize the fatigue resistance. The weld slope is found to have a significant impact on the results...|$|R
