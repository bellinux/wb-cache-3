5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the <b>more</b> <b>you</b> see something, the <b>more</b> <b>you</b> like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E

50|$|The {{version in}} Godspell follows more closely the wording in Hymn 429 of the 1940 Hymnal: Day by day, Dear Lord, of thee three things I pray: To see <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> clearly, Love <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> dearly, Follow <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> nearly, Day by day.|$|R
5000|$|The {{prayer was}} adapted {{for the song}} [...] "Day by Day" [...] in the musical Godspell (1971), with music by Stephen Schwartz. The words used, with a few embellishments, {{were based on the}} {{following}} from [...] "Songs of Praise, Enlarged Edition":Day by day,Dear Lord, of thee three things I pray:To see <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> clearly,Love <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> dearly,Follow <b>thee</b> <b>more</b> nearly,Day by Day.|$|R

The three-hour block of programming designed for 14-16 year-old teenage viewers {{is under the}} umbrella branding of The <b>More</b> <b>You</b> Know, based on the network's long-time strand of internally-produced public service announcements of the same name. It premiered on October 8, 2016, giving Litton control of all but Fox's Saturday morning E/I programming among the five major broadcast networks.|$|E

25|$|On March 28, 2012, NBCUniversal {{announced}} {{an agreement with}} sister cable channel PBS Kids Sprout (now Sprout, which was integrated into NBCUniversal through its 2011 acquisition by the channel's existing part-owner Comcast) to produce and program new weekend morning preschool blocks for NBC and Telemundo. The block, MiTelemundo, premiered on July 7, 2012 and also airs Saturday and Sunday mornings; as with its predecessors, it consists of Spanish dubbed versions of programs seen on its sister broadcast network's Saturday morning block, NBC Kids, which debuted on the same date. With NBC Kids being replaced with Litton Entertainment's The <b>More</b> <b>You</b> Know E/I block on NBC by September 25, 2016, MiTelemundo retained on television with the same programming from the former NBC Kids block.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the decoding stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such decoding practice allows the child to improve their decoding skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, the <b>more</b> <b>you</b> do it the better you get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of decoding improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding of what is being read increases.|$|E
25|$|As an NBC owned-and-operated station, KXAS {{differs from}} many network-owned {{stations}} {{in that it}} does not carry its associated network's complete programming schedule. The station currently does not clear NBC's weekday overnight lineup, opting instead to air syndicated programming after Last Call with Carson Daly; it has never cleared the network's broadcast of CNBC's Mad Money during NBC's carriage of the program from September 2012 until the network replaced it with an extended rolling block of Early Today in September 2017, although it did air the rebroadcast of the fourth hour of Today from its addition to the overnight block in September 2011 until September 2015. In addition, KXAS also airs The <b>More</b> <b>You</b> Know educational block on a one-hour delay due to the 9:00a.m. hour of its Saturday morning newscast (which itself airs as a split two-hour format bookending the Saturday edition of Today), resulting in the third hour of the block being shifted to Sundays whenever network sports telecasts are scheduled on Saturdays during the noon hour or earlier in order to meet FCC educational programming quotas.|$|E

500|$|Armstrong {{was not a}} [...] "walker"; he {{believed}} in waiting for the umpire to make a decision, once telling the English cricketer Arthur Gilligan, [...] "The <b>more</b> <b>you</b> play this game, the <b>more</b> <b>you</b> will find out that will be given out many times when you are not out and vice versa". [...] English professional cricketers took {{a dim view of}} Armstrong's approach to the game. [...] Jack Hobbs, describing one instance said, The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who got very nasty and unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire's decision. That upset me. I did not know if was standing on my head or my heels with the consequence that two balls later I let one go, never even attempting to play it; and it bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.|$|E

For those of us who know Family Guy better than Star Wars, there is plenty of bad material here to remind us that nothing much has changed".

500|$|After [...] "Within You Without You", [...] "The Inner Light" [...] was {{the second}} {{composition}} to fully reflect Harrison's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly meditation, an interest that had spread to his Beatles bandmates and to the group's audience and peers. The lyrics espouse meditation {{as a means to}} genuine understanding. Theologian Dale Allison describes the song as a [...] "hymn" [...] to quietism and comments that, in their attempt to [...] "relativize and disparage knowledge of the external world", the words convey Harrison's enduring worldview. Author John Winn notes that Harrison had pre-empted the message of [...] "The Inner Light" [...] in an August 1967 interview, when he told New York DJ Murray Kaufman: [...] "The <b>more</b> <b>you</b> learn, the <b>more</b> <b>you</b> know that you don't know anything at all."

Mincham notes a subtle growth [...] "in the imitative opening motives of the violins taken, incidentally, from the sinfonia and dominating this movement throughout".|$|E

Aaron Bay-Schuck, Mars' A representative at the time, found the track's production to be cutting edge, although admitting {{that it was not}} an instant favorite. However, he perceived that [...] "it was something special" [...] but {{had no idea how to}} classify it.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{observed}} 12 Monkeys {{depiction of}} the future, finding similarities with Blade Runner (1982; also scripted by David Peoples) and Brazil (1985; also directed by Terry Gilliam). [...] "The film is a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate", Ebert wrote. [...] "This vision is a cold, dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. All of this is done very well, and the <b>more</b> <b>you</b> know about movies (especially the technical side), the more you're likely to admire it.
