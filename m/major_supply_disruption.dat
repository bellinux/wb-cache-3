Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 have proven that U. S. petroleum infrastructure is vulnerable to <b>major</b> <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions</b> {{as a direct result}} of disasters. Due to the structure of U. S. oil supply chain, primary oil production centers (i. e. PADD * 3) are geographically separated from primary demand centers (i. e.

To better understand the extent of those dependencies and downstream impacts of <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions,</b> a multi-disciplinary research approach is necessary. The cross-disciplines in this research include disaster management, critical infrastructure and oil supply chain management, and the utilization of geographic information systems (GIS) and systems simulation.

A rationale for the stockpiling of cobalt is presented, followed by a method for bringing the stockpiled amount from any level to a desired goal, in this case an amount determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to last through three years of conventional warfare. The method involves solving a stochastic programming problem in order to balance the expected values of the social benefit and the social cost of building the stockpile—Social benefit is accrued by decreasing the impact and {{the probability of a}} war or a <b>major</b> <b>supply</b> <b>disruption</b> occuring before the stockpile goal is realized; social cost is determined from the additional amount U. S. cobalt consumers must pay due to the increase in world demand brought about by stockpiling. The management of the filled stockpile is then discussed, introducing the idea of using the stockpile to assure stability in the world price of cobalt and of defraying maintenance costs by market speculation. Least-squares fitting is used to determine whether prices are high or low and how much to sell or buy, respectively, to bring prices back into line. Then the conditions under which the stockpile should be drawn down are considered, with the proper rate and total amount of released stockpile material determined for two cases, that of a <b>major</b> <b>supply</b> <b>disruption</b> and that of actual warfare. Finally, generalization of the method to cover other strategic stockpiles is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Russia’s elite {{discourse}} {{often seems}} inconsistent, and even contradictory at some times. This {{raises the question}} what has actually been said, and what policy consequences one could expect. One case of this discursive ambiguity could be observed in Russia’s energy relations with Ukraine. Whereas Medvedev publicly claimed that ‘the Russian side has never used economic factors to decide political issues’, Putin highlighted such a political package deal proclaiming that ‘We [the Russian government] offered a 100 dollar discount for every tcm [of gas] as a payment for hosting our [Black Sea] fleet at the Crimea. ’ This discursive discrepancy might be explained on several grounds. There might be a difference between elite membership: Putin might stress other aspects of energy relations than Medvedev. Moreover, the discourse might change over time, especially as the Ukraine crisis unravelled itself during 2014. Thirdly, audience expectations might {{play a role in}} what aspects Russia’s elite tend to emphasize. This paper explores the influence of these three factors, elite membership, time and audience, have on Russia’s selection of particular energy frames.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to characterize}} and measure hierarchical, functional and geographical alignment within an organization {{in an effort}} to understand the individual's attributes of resilience within the broader organization's business strategy. In partnership with a multinational chemicals manufacturer, data was collected from product supply organizations through interviews, surveys and case discussions, {{in an effort to}} understand resilience awareness and strategic alignment. The results are primarily used to quantify differences between strategic direction set by executives and the tactical execution of individual contributors. Secondary analysis examines correlations in responses, and further compares results by segmenting respondents by level within the organization, tenure with the company, functional role and cultural background. Data collected through this study identifies a difference between the attitudes and perceptions of executives and those of individual contributors. Understanding this misalignment is important as external research has found that there can be a permanent market capitalization loss of 5 - 10 % after an announcement of a <b>major</b> <b>supply</b> <b>disruption.</b> Whether the disruption is due to a geological event or a political uprising, being prepared to respond to such disruptions is critical in today's complex business environment.

40|$|Recent {{natural and}} manmade {{disasters}} have had significant regional economic impacts. These effects have been muted, however, by the "resilience" of individual businesses and of regional markets, {{which refers to}} the inherent ability and adaptive responses that enable firms and regions to avoid potential losses. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis is a promising approach to disaster impact analysis because {{it is able to}} model the behavioral response to input shortages and changing market conditions. However, without further refinement, CGE models, as well as nearly all other economic models, reflect only "business-as-usual" conditions, when they are based on historical data. This paper advances the CGE analysis of <b>major</b> <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions</b> of critical inputs by: specifying operational definitions of individual business and regional macroeconomic resilience, linking production function parameters to various types of producer adaptations in emergencies, developing algorithms for recalibrating production functions to empirical or simulation data, and decomposing partial and general equilibrium responses.

40|$|The {{powerful}} {{earthquake that}} hit Japan on March 11, 2011, not only devastated the northeastern region but also affected millions of firms and households in east Japan. In particular, {{immediately after the}} earthquake, consumers reportedly faced severe commodity shortages caused by a sudden increase in demand as well as <b>major</b> <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions.</b> Although anecdotal evidence abounds, we {{know very little about}} the actual effects of the earthquake on prices and expenditures. Did prices rise in response to the excess demand? To what extent, did consumers engage in hoarding? Did the commodity shortages create any discrepancy between those consumers who were able to stockpile goods and those who could not? In this paper, using high-frequency commodity-level micro panel data, we investigate the effects of the 3 / 11 disaster on commodity prices and household purchasing behaviors in the areas not directly damaged. We find that store-level commodity prices increased surprisingly little after March 11, which implies that the excess demand was resolved mainly through quantity adjustments. We also find that, while the average household expenditure on storable goods rose sharply after the earthquake, the households with higher opportunity costs of shopping (i. e., households with an infant or a wife working fulltime) did not increase expenditures as much. If these households were indeed "rationed out, " then our results indicate important heterogeneity across households in their consumption after the disaster...|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} note discusses {{the changes in}} the price of crude oil that occurred {{in the second half of}} 2014 and the price dynamics of the first half of 2015. It shows that from 2011 till the first half of 2014 the price of crude oil remained at a remarkably stable level around 100 dollars per barrel, while prices for other commodities were falling as a result of declining demand, particularly in emerging markets. We argue that the resiliency of crude oil prices between 2011 and 1 H 2014 was a result of deliberate action by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) producers to keep the price of oil stable at a level perceived to be competitive by intervening in the market when the price diverged too far from an established level. Saudi Arabia and the GCC compensated three <b>major</b> <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions</b> by increasing production to prevent prices remaining above the 100 dollars per barrel mark for long. Beyond stabilizing prices, the strategy aimed at maintaining Saudi production competitive, increasing its world market share. Our research finds that the recent and sharp decline in price, a result of increased production from the United States tight oil basins, has led GCC to emphasize its market share strategy by increasing production at the new price level to bring United States shale production increase to a halt. Indeed, this means that the price of crude oil will be set at the marginal price of production of non-conventional crudes in the United States, a characteristic found in competitive markets and heretofore missing from the crude oil market...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with <b>supply</b> <b>disruption</b> risks and robust investment strategies in petroleum markets. We study two research areas: modelling oil and gas <b>supply</b> <b>disruption</b> risks, and robust portfolio management in financial and petroleum markets under <b>supply</b> <b>disruption.</b> Petroleum <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions</b> are persistent and financially catastrophic. Quantitative modelling of <b>supply</b> <b>disruption</b> risks is essential for energy market participants. We model petroleum <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions</b> using extreme value theory (EVT) and copula. Using EVT, we describe univariate oil and gas <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions</b> in terms of volumetric and financial losses. Copula functions are used to model the multivariate dependence between the <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions.</b> Our empirical results indicate that multivariate financial losses exhibit stronger positive dependence than multivariate volumetric losses. Portfolio management under uncertainty has been the central topic of extensive research in finance. Single and multi-period asset allocation models have been developed under several assumptions on the underlying price dynamics. It {{is well known that}} statistical measurements do not unfold the complete dynamics of the market, and inherently involve estimation errors. Robust optimization has been introduced to reduce perturbations arising in estimations of random parameters. Within the robust optimization framework, we first study the single period Markowitz mean-variance portfolio allocation problem under discrete assets choice constraints. Special emphasis is placed on worst-case robust optimal strategies which yield reduction on discontinuity with guaranteed performance. We are also concerned with robust investment strategies in petroleum markets. We formulate three different but related problems in context of portfolio management within energy markets. The first model considers standard energy trading strategies using futures contracts under price and demand uncertainty while the second one uses swap contracts under price uncertainty for hedging purposes. The last model integrates energy and weather derivatives for hedging price and weather uncertainties in petroleum markets. A tractable robust approach to the portfolio allocation problems is proposed to reduce parameter estimation errors arising in stochastic price and demand processes as well as <b>supply</b> <b>disruption</b> and weather uncertainties. The robust counterpart of the underlying problem involves worst-case outcome of the stochastic data in terms of spot price, demand or temperature within the uncertainty sets. We investigate modelling implications of symmetric and asymmetric uncertainty sets and analyze the impact of parameter estimation error within the portfolio allocation problems...|$|R

We examine a firm with an unreliable supplier that is subject to supply yield uncertainty as well as complete <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions.</b> We consider one case where the unreliable supplier is the only supply option, and a second case where a second, reliable (but more expensive) supplier is available. We develop models for both cases to determine the optimal order and reserve quantities. We then compare these results to those found when a single-period approximation is used. We demonstrate that a single-period approximation causes increases in cost, under-utilizes the unreliable supplier, and distorts the order quantities which should be placed with the reliable supplier in the two-supplier case. Moreover, using a single-period model can lead to selecting the wrong strategy for mitigating supply risk.

Two different types of uncertain demands, disrupted demand with a step change in demand and random demand, are considered.

This change tendency differs from the finding that each kind of peak is independent of the <b>supply</b> <b>disruption</b> start time under no demand disruption.

Because oil is fungible in {{an integrated}} world oil market, increased oil consumption, whether from domestic or imported sources, increases the economic losses associated with oil <b>supply</b> <b>disruptions.</b> Nevertheless, increased U.
