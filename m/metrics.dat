5|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>metrics</b> {{commonly}} used to measure storm size. The most common <b>metrics</b> include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.|$|E

25|$|<b>Metrics</b> {{applicable}} to the ED can be grouped into three main categories, volume, cycle time, and patient satisfaction. Volume <b>metrics</b> including arrivals per hour, percentage of ED beds occupied and age of patients are understood at a basic level at all hospitals as an indication for staffing requirements. Cycle time <b>metrics</b> are the mainstays of the evaluation and tracking of process efficiency and are less widespread since an active effort is needed to collect and analyze this data. Patient satisfaction <b>metrics,</b> already commonly collected by nursing groups, physician groups and hospitals, are useful in demonstrating the impact of changes in patient perception of care over time. Since patient satisfaction <b>metrics</b> are derivative and subjective, they are less useful in primary process improvement. Health information exchanges can reduce nonurgent ED visits by supplying current data about admissions, discharges, and transfers to health plans and accountable care organizations, allowing them to shift ED use to primary care settings.|$|E

25|$|Three {{additional}} <b>metrics</b> {{have been}} proposed: h2 lower, h2 center, and h2 upper, {{to give a}} more accurate representation of the distribution shape. The three h2 <b>metrics</b> measure the relative area within a scientist's citation distribution in the low impact area, h2 lower, the area captured by the h-index, h2 center, and the area from publications with the highest visibility, h2 upper. Scientists with high h2 upper percentages are perfectionists, whereas scientists with high h2 lower percentages are mass producers. As these <b>metrics</b> are percentages, {{they are intended to}} give a qualitative description to supplement the quantitative h-index.|$|E
