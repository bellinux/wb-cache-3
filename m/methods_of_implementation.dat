50|$|Email {{archiving}} is the act {{of preserving}} and making searchable all email to/from an individual. Email archiving solutions capture email content either directly from the email application itself or during transport.

In addition to simply accumulating email messages, these applications index and provide quick, searchable access to archived messages independent of the users of the system using {{a couple of different}} technical <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation.</b> The reasons a company may opt to implement an email archiving solution include protection of mission critical data, to meet retention and supervision requirements of applicable regulations, and for e-discovery purposes.

Additionally, decisions made by the ARCs regarding exceptions and appeals were vetted by the CPA Administrator. Finally, the enforcement of this policy occurred at a broad and deep level. All ministries, per Memorandum No. 1, were assigned investigators to determine employees affiliation with the Ba'ath Party and determine which individuals were subject to the penalties under Order No. 1.

50|$|In the 1990s, Gillham, Tratnyek, Kriegman, Zhang, and Batchelor {{all made}} {{significant}} contributions in testing different metals and oxides {{for the use of}} ISCR. Gillham and Tratnyek in particular applied the reductive chemistry to groundwater treatment with the emplacement of ZVI barriers. Although {{it has been shown that}} other metals like aluminum and magnesium can produce the same effect in the laboratory, ground water treatment most generally focuses on the use of iron. Other major contributions in this field includes Zhang, who researched nanoscale iron, and Batchelor, who researched zero-valent iron clay (ZVI Clay). This past decade, more aspects of ISCR have been researched and new <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation,</b> such as ZVI clay and emulsified ZVI (EZVI), have been created. Scientists have also found that certain iron minerals, like green rust, magnetite, and pyrite, also have reductive capabilities although they contain ferrous iron rather than ZVI.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} the various <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> of {{international}} labuor standards is the multilateral enforcement model. The model, embodied in the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), is different from other compulsory methods in that it opposes any imposition of common standards schemes. Instead, the multilateral enforcement model requires that signatories to agreements like the NAALC make firm commitments to existing labor standard structures within their respective domestic spheres. The unique aspect of the NAALC, however, {{is that it does}} not in any way dictate policy. This includes a strong aversion to uniformly adopted standards on the international level. Rather than encouraging the inclusion of a baseline set of workers’ rights, the multilateral enforcement model merely requires that its members strive to create unbiased administrative bodies that judge whether or not appropriate measures are being taken to ensure the continued support of domestic labour standards. In this manner, the multilateral model is not international in its adoption of a common set of principles, but rather in its level of required commitment to an unspecified group of standards. In enforcing such commitments, agreements like the NAALC primarily utilize recommendations and publicity to make decision makers accountable for their actions. Multilateral enforcement models like the NAALC have experienced mixed results in terms of effectiveness due to their limited powers of influence.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} {{township}} music in South Africa began from {{the formation of}} townships, which are urban residential areas where Africans were authorized to rent houses built by the government during the 1950s. [...] Binns and Nel state in their article that townships were the poor, black residential areas created under apartheid, explicitly revealing that these townships {{were not for the}} wealthy Westerners living in South Africa, but for the lower class of South Africa. [...] According to Ballantine, legislation was passed during the 1950s to further consolidate the apartheid state, and violent <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> also assisted this along. [...] In fact, the most serious legislation that was passed for urban black music was the Group Areas Act of 1950, which separated all racially mixed neighborhoods by removing black communities and relocating them on the peripheries into townships. [...] Williams confirms this relocation by describing them as similar to African American ghettos and illustrates the emotion of musicians within the townships as a lack of power, which resulted in the musicians' need to explore alternative music paths. [...] To those who tried to suppress the lower-class Africans, jazz aspired to (among other things) musical and social equality, which was viewed as a form of rebellion during the time, hence its suppression. [...] According to Ballantine, [...] "the white and racist South African state" [...] was forming an ideology and program for separating and turning black South Africans against one another.|$|E
