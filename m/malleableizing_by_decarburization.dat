40|$|Abstract. The {{compatibility}} of Reduced Activation Ferritic/Martensitic Steel (RAFM) {{with liquid}} Li and molten-salt Flibe have been characterized and accessed. Static compatibility tests {{were carried out}} in which the specimens were immersed into liquid Li or Flibe in isothermal autoclaves. Also carried out were compatibility tests in flowing liquid Li by thermal convection loops. In the case of liquid Li, the corrosion rate increased with temperature significantly. The corrosion was almost one order larger for the loop tests than for the static tests. Chemical analysis showed that the corrosion was enhanced when the level of N in Li is increased. Transformation from martensitic to ferritic phase and the resulting softening were observed in near-surface area of Li-exposed specimens, which were shown to be induced <b>by</b> <b>decarburization.</b> In the case of Flibe, the corrosion loss was much larger in a Ni crucible than in a RAFM crucible. Both fluorides and oxides were observed on the surfaces. Thus, the key corrosion process of Flibe is the competing process of fluoridation and oxidation. Possible mechanism of the enhanced corrosion in Ni crucible is electrochemical circuit effect. It was suggested that the corrosion loss rate of RAFM by liquid Li and Flibe can be reduced by reducing the level of impurity N in Li and avoiding the use of dissimilar materials in Flibe, respectively. 1...|$|R
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} {{is essentially}} an improved version of the Bessemer process (<b>decarburization</b> <b>by</b> blowing oxygen as gas into the heat rather than burning the excess carbon away by adding oxygen carrying substances into the heat). The advantages of pure oxygen blast over air blast was known to Henry Bessemer, but the 19th-century technology was not advanced enough {{to allow for the}} production of the large quantities of pure oxygen to make it economically feasible for use.|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric plasma {{spraying}} of WC coatings is typically characterized <b>by</b> increased <b>decarburization,</b> with a consequent reduction of their wear resistance. Indeed, high temperature and oxidizing atmosphere promote {{the appearance of}} brittle crystalline and amorphous phases. However, by using a high helium flow rate in a process gas mixture, {{plasma spraying}} may easily be optimized by increasing the velocity of sprayed particles and by reducing the degree of WC dissolution. To this purpose, a comparative study was performed at different spray conditions. Both WC-Co powder and coating phases were characterized by X-ray difraction. Their microstructure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical, dry sliding friction, and wear tests were also performed. The wear resistance was highly related to both microstructural and mechanical properties. The experimental data confirmed that high-quality cermet coatings could be manufactured by using optimized Ar-He mixtures. Their enhanced hardness, toughness, and wear resistance resulted in coatings comparable to those sprayed by high velocity oxygen-fuel...|$|R

These properties can be improved further by decreasing the content of impurities like carbon and oxygen. The main purpose of this research work is to study the possibility of stainless steel powder <b>decarburization</b> <b>by</b> vacuum annealing. The influence of different process parameters like treatment time, temperature, fraction size and depth of the powder layer on the decarburization process was analyzed.

40|$|Ferritic {{stainless}} steels (α െ SSs) have exhibited higher resistance to {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SCC) than austenite stainless steel (γ െ SSs) in chloride environments[1]. In particular, low interstitial-high Cr α െ SSs producted <b>by</b> vacuum oxygen <b>decarburization,</b> are not susceptible to SCC in boiling 42 % LiCl or 42 % MgCl 2 solutions under 90 % yield strength. For that reason, α െ SSs {{have been widely used}} as structure materials for boiler pipe, marine structure materials, and installation materials of paper and medicine industry. However, the addition of Cu (0. 5 ~ 1 wt. %) to α െ SSs, otherwise immune to stress corrosion cracking, drastically decreases the resistance to stress corrosion cracking[2, 3].

40|$|In {{the present}} study, WC- 12 Co {{coatings}} were deposited by detonation-spraying technique using conventional and nanostructured WC- 12 Co feedstock at four different oxy/fuel ratios (OF ratio). The coatings exhibited {{the presence of}} phases like W 2 C and W due to the decarburization of the WC phase, and the proportions of these phases {{were higher in the}} nano WC- 12 Co coatings compared with conventional WC- 12 Co coatings. Coating hardness and fracture toughness were measured. The tribological performance of coatings was examined under dry sand rubber wheel abrasion wear, and solid particle erosion wear conditions. The mechanical and wear properties of coatings were influenced <b>by</b> degree of <b>decarburization</b> and more so in the case of nanostructured WC-Co coatings. The results indicate that the extent of decarburization has a substantial influence on the elastic modulus of the coating which in turn is related to the extent of intersplat cracking of the coating...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{embrittlement}} {{of grain}} boundaries or other defects {{that can serve}} as crack initiators, the addition of radiation attack at cracks can cause intergranular stress corrosion cracking. The main environmental stressor that forms due to radiation is hydrogen embrittlement at crack tips. Hydrogen ions are created when radiation splits water molecules, which is present because water is the coolant in PWR's, into OH− and H+. There are several suspected mechanisms that explain hydrogen embrittlement, three of which are the decohesion mechanism, the pressure theory, and the hydrogen attack method. In the decohesion mechanism, {{it is thought that}} the accumulation of hydrogen ions reduces the metal-to-metal bond strength, which makes it easier to cleave atoms apart. The pressure theory is the idea that hydrogen can precipitate as a gas at internal defects and create bubbles within the material. The stress caused by the expanding bubble in addition to the applied stress is what lowers the overall stress required to fracture the material. The hydrogen attack method is similar to the pressure theory, but in this case it is suspected that the hydrogen reacts with carbon in the steel to form methane, which then forms blisters and bubbles at the surface. In this case, the added stress by the bubbles is enhanced <b>by</b> the <b>decarburization</b> of the steel, which weakens the metal. In addition to hydrogen embrittlement, radiation induced creep can cause the grain boundaries to slide against each other. This destabilizes the grain boundaries even further, making it easier for a crack to propagate along its length.|$|R
40|$|Oxygen-sensitive {{alloying}} {{elements such as}} Mn, Si, and Cr have a high potential for improving the properties of low alloyed sintered steels while reducing the alloying cost. However, {{it is necessary to}} find a way for avoiding, or at least minimizing, the oxidation of these elements especially during {{the early stages of the}} sintering cycle. In this study Mn, Si, and Cr were introduced in the form of a master alloy powder designed to be mixed with the iron base powder and provide the final composition of the steel during the sintering process. The reduction/oxidation phenomena taking place during the heating stage were studied by thermogravimetry, dilatometry, and mass spectroscopy, using either reducing (H 2) or inert (Ar) atmospheres. The results show how the difference in chemical activity between base iron powder and master alloy causes the so called "internal-getter" effect, by which the reduction of less stable iron oxides leads to oxidation of the elements with higher affinity for oxygen. This effect can be somehow minimized when sintering in H 2, since the iron oxides are reduced at lower temperatures at which the reactivity of the elements in the master alloy is lower. However, H 2 concentration in the processing atmosphere needs to be carefully adapted to the specific composition of the materials being processed in order to minimize <b>decarburization</b> <b>by</b> methane formation during sintering.
