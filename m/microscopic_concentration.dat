40|$|Neurotrophins {{constitute}} {{a family of}} trophic factors with profound effects on the survival and differentiation of the nervous system. Addition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3), but not nerve growth factor (NGF), increased the survival of embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons in culture, although all three neurotrophins enhanced neurite outgrowth. Here we report that neurotrophins also exert acute actions on the morphology and motility of 1 -day-old cultured Xenopus spinal neurons. Bath application of BDNF induced extensive formation of lamellipodia simultaneously at multiple sites along the neurite shaft {{as well as at}} the growth cone. The BDNF-induced lamellipodia appeared within minutes, rapidly protruded to their greatest extent in about 10 min, and gradually disappeared thereafter, leaving behind newly formed thin lateral processes. When applied as <b>microscopic</b> <b>concentration</b> gradients, both BDNF and NT- 3, but not NGF, induced the growth cone to grow toward the neurotrophin source. Our results suggest that neurotrophic factors, when delivered to responsive neurons, may serve as morphogenic and chemotropic agents during neuronal development. Key words: growth cone; lamellipodium; turning; chemotropism; actin; neurotrophic factors The development and maintenance of the nervous system depend on the presence of neurotrophic factors, which include retrograde factors derived from postsynaptic target cells, proteins secreted from presynaptic neurons, and molecules released from glial and hematopoietic cells (Barde, 1989).

40|$|Using pulse {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance (EPR) on {{a series}} of L(+) -ammonium tartrate (AT) dosimeters exposed to radiations with different linear energy transfer (LET), we assessed the ability of pulse EPR spectroscopy to discriminate the quality of various radiation beams such as (60) Co gamma-ray photons,, protons and thermal neutrons at various doses by analyzing the local radical distributions produced by the different beams. We performed two types of pulse EPR investigations: two-pulse electron spin echo decay obtained by varying the microwave power, and a double electron-electron resonance (DEER) study. Both methods provide information about the dipolar interactions among the free radicals and about their spatial distributions. The first method provided information on the instantaneous diffusion and hence the <b>microscopic</b> <b>concentration</b> of the radicals that is compared with the macroscopic one obtained by CW-EPR. The DEER spectra yielded the distributions of distances between pairs of radicals two to five crystal cells apart produced by the same radiation event, a result reported here for the first time. The inter-radical distributions given by the DEER results have been simulated by modeling the radical distributions according to the details of the matter-radiation interactions for the various beams. The results of both types of pulse experiments are strongly dependent: on the radiation quality. This was also observed for samples giving indistinguishable CW-EPR spectral profiles. We conclude that the pulse EPR measurements can be valuable tools for distinguishing the LET of the radiation beams, an important parameter for radiobiological considerations...|$|E
40|$|The {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy {{is widely}} applied for retrospective dosimetric purposes by means of quantitative detection of radicals in tooth enamel and bone samples. In this work we report a study by cw and pulsed EPR on two samples of human tooth enamel respectively irradiated by UV (254 nm) and gamma-exposed. The continuous wave (cw) EPR spectra have shown the usual presence in both samples of two types of CO_(2) ^(-) radicals, with axial and orthorombic g tensors. We have obtained the electron spin echo detected EPR (ED-EPR) spectra at 80 K of the two samples, and we have shown that they are suitable to mark {{the difference between the}} effects produced by the different irradiations. At low temperature the contribution to the ED-EPR spectrum of the mobile radical with the axial g tensor is still present in the UV irradiated sample, but not in the gamma-irradiated one, where its dynamics is too slow to average the g tensor. We have moreover studied the two-pulse electron spin echo decay on varying the microwave power, a well established method for measuring the Instantaneous Diffusion. We have found that the spectral diffusion parameter is almost the same for both radiation types, whereas the Instantaneous Diffusion is significantly larger for gamma-exposed samples than for UV irradiated ones. This difference is due to a higher local <b>microscopic</b> <b>concentration</b> of free radicals for samples irradiated with gamma photons...|$|E

There is some disagreement regarding the assessments of the Fe-Cr phase diagram available in the literature, but all versions reported indicate the presence of intermediate phase in the solid state. Since the arrangement of molecules in a liquid alloy is in some respects similar to that of a crystal, at least near to its melting temperature, the complex formation phenomenon in Fe-Cr melts has been described in terms of the <b>microscopic</b> functions (<b>concentration</b> fluctuations in the long-wavelength limit and chemical short-range order parameter) ...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular matrix (ECM) in chondrocytes-seeded agarose {{aggregates}} to form {{islands of}} matrix. These islands need to coalesce to develop functional cartilage. Hence, macroscopic properties {{are determined by}} transport and aggregation of macromolecules at the microscale, which varies temporally and spatially. This study evaluates {{the importance of the}} mutual interaction between matrix components and matrix development. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements demonstrates that diffusivity depends on the presence and density of ECM. A reaction-diffusion model describing synthesis, transport and immobilisation of ECM predicts steep gradients in ECM around chondrocytes, resembling histology. Steric hindrance of diffusion by ECM is essential for the formation of these gradients. Finally, <b>microscopic</b> ECM <b>concentration</b> is linked with macroscopic mechanical properties. Construct softening is predicted when temporal and spatial variations in diffusivity are considered.

40|$|Echo-detected {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance (echoEPR) profiles for irradiated deuterated ammonium tartrate single crystals depend strongly on {{the delays}} between pulses of the echo sequence. This is mainly due to instantaneous and spectral diffusion that {{plays a crucial role}} in determining the decay of the echo at every field position: the dephasing rate 1 /T-M depends on the number of spins excited by the pulses and on the total number of interacting spins. A rigorous simulation of the echoEPR profiles at different delays requires the evaluation of the modulation pattern (ESEEM) and of the dephasing processes at every field position. From the simulations, information on the <b>microscopic</b> radical <b>concentration,</b> and on the electron-electron flip-flop rates of the single radical species can be obtained.

Molecular dynamics simulations of ligand bound membrane protein complexes were used to validate binding poses, allowing analysis of key interactions and binding site solvation to develop structure−activity relationships of β 2 ligand binding. The resulting relationships are consistent with intrinsic binding affinity (corrected for membrane interaction). The successful structure-based design of ligands targeting membrane proteins may require an assessment of membrane affinity to uncouple protein binding from membrane interactions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo examine {{effects of}} varied {{freezing}} {{conditions on the}} development of spatial heterogeneity in the frozen protein solution, macroscopic freeze concentration and micro-segregation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were investigated in a temperature-controlled 200 -ml freeze container. Freezing to − 40 °C promoted formation of protein concentration gradients (69 – 114 μgml− 1) in frozen samples taken from 12 different freezer positions, whereby slow freezing in 4 h or longer facilitated the evolution of strong spatial heterogeneities and caused local concentration increases by 1. 15 -fold relative to the initial protein concentration (100 μgml− 1). To visualize protein micro-segregation during phase separation, BSA was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy was used to localize and size the freeze-concentrated protein regions. Slow freezing resulted in distinctly fewer and larger protein domains in the frozen bulk than fast freezing. Surface stress on the protein during freezing would therefore be minimized at low cooling rates; <b>microscopic</b> freeze <b>concentration</b> would however be highest under these conditions, potentially favoring protein aggregation...|$|R

When Cl- could penetrate the starch granules, the hydrogen bonds were ruptured and then the viscosity increased. However, the gelatinization temperature was sifted higher and the enthalpy increased with increasing NaCl concentration up to 10 wt%.

40|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} to determine the concentrations of molecular water and hydroxyl groups in hydrous rhyolitic, orthoclasic, jadeitic, and Ca-Al-silicate glasses synthesized by quenching of melts from elevated presure and temperature. The rhyolitic glasses and some of the Ca-Al-silicate glasses were quenched from water-vapor- saturated melts and used to determine the solubility of water in melts of these compositions. For all compositions studied, hydroxyl groups are the dominant hydrous species at low total water contents, whereas molecular water dominates at elevated water contents. Although the trends in species concentrations in all these compositions are similar, the proportions of the two hydrous species are influenced by silicate chemistry: increasing silica content and K relative to Na both favor molecular water over hydroxyl. Results on rhyolitic glass demonstrate that molecular water is also favored by decreasing temperature at T< 850 ° C. For rhyolitic glasses quenched from vapor-saturated melts, the mole fraction of molecular water is proportional to water fugacity for P(H_ 2 O) ≤ 1500 bars, demonstrating that the behavior of molecular water is approximately Henrian at total water contents up to at least several weight percent. Data on water solubility for albitic, orthoclasic, and Ca-Al-silicate melts to higher pressures can also be fit by assuming Henrian behavior for molecular water and can be used to set constraints on the partial molar volume of water in these melts. The demonstration of Henry's law for molecular water in these liquids provides a link between spectroscopic measurements of <b>microscopic</b> species <b>concentrations</b> and macroscopic thermodynamic properties...|$|R

This paper presents a multiproxy palaeoecological analysis of a sedimentary sequence taken from a small sedimentary basin located in logged semi-evergreen lowland forest in northern Congo-Brazzaville which addresses these questions. Analyses undertaken included fossil pollen, geochemical and microscopic charcoal. Geochemical results were interpreted as a proxy for rainfall, and showed that northern Congo has experienced changes in rainfall during the past 2580 years, while <b>microscopic</b> charcoal <b>concentrations</b> indicated increased burning from approximately 1240 cal. yr BP to the present. Analysis of the fossil pollen assemblages showed that although light-demanding taxa were a major constituent of this forest throughout the sequence, shade-tolerant taxa were more abundant in the forest prior to 1345 cal. yr BP. Increases in aridity and/or droughts after 1345 cal. yr BP, and an increase in fire after 1240 cal. yr BP resulted in a semi-evergreen forest with abundant pioneers that persisted with minor changes in composition during the last 900 years, even during a period of increased rainfall from 400 to 100 cal. yr BP.

Carbon analysis showed the concentration of micron-size particles containing MWCNT did not exceed 0. 0053 mg-C/m 3 around the loom. This value was much lower than the respirable dust mass concentration. Most of micron-size particles seemed to originate from polyester yarn without MWCNT coating. It is recommended that workers use conventional (even not specialized for nanoparticles) personal protective equipment such as respirators and gloves to prevent exposure to respirable-size MWCNT-containing particles.

The segregation of hydrogen below fracture surfaces supports a previously proposed theory that corrosion-produced hydrogen is responsible for hot salt stress corrosion embrittlement and cracking of titanium alloys. These advanced analytical techniques suggest great potential for many areas of stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement research, quality control, and field inspection of corrosion problems. For example, it appears possible that a contour map of hydrogen distribution at notch roots and crack tips could be quantitatively determined. Such information would be useful in substantiating current theories of stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMonolayers of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) {{mixing with}} various mole {{percentages}} of distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) -conjugated poly-(ethylene glycol) (PEG m. w. 750 – 5000) were deposited on DPPE-coated glass surfaces by the Langmuir-Blodgett method. Increasing percentages of grafted PEG in these supported lipid surfaces increasingly inhibit the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA), laminin, and fibronectin. Increasing percentages of grafted PEG also inhibit the adhesion of erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages to these supported lipid surfaces. The adsorption of proteins on lipid coated glass surfaces were assayed by the fluorescence of FITC-labelled proteins. Cell adhesion was measured mainly by <b>microscopic</b> counting. The <b>concentration</b> of PEG-grafted lipids {{required for the}} inhibition of erythrocyte adhesion decreases with increasing molecular weight of the grafted PEG. The inhibitory effects are strongly dependent on the graft density of PEG at low concentrations, but weakly dependent on graft density at higher concentrations. For DSPE-PEG 5000, the change of graft density dependency occurs approximately at the complete coverage of the lipid surface by the grafted polymer in the mushroom conformation (0. 7 mol%), and the transition to partial brush conformation. The change-overs become less distinctive for grafted PEG of lower molecular weights, {{probably due to the}} failure of strictly mushroom and brush models of the polymer. The relative inhibitory efficiency is protein or cell dependent. The implication on the function of stealth liposomes is discussed...|$|R

Both HA native and newcomer ewes were maintained at an altitude of 3589 m during mating and pregnancy. Control low altitude (LA) native ewes were maintained at sea level. Half of each group received daily oral supplements of vitamins C (500 mg) and E (350 IU) during mating and gestation. Near term, maternal plasma vitamin levels and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured. At delivery, lambs were weighed and measured, and placentas were recovered for macroscopic and <b>microscopic</b> evaluation. Vitamin <b>concentrations</b> in supplemented ewes were two-or threefold greater than in non-supplemented ewes. Plasma carbonyls and malondialdehyde in non-supplemented ewes were consistent with a state of oxidative stress, which was prevented by vitamin supplementation. Vitamin supplementation increased lamb birthweight and cotyledon number in both HA native and newcomer ewes, although placental weight and cotyledon surface were diminished. Placentas from vitamin-supplemented HA ewes were similar to those from ewes at sea level, making these placental traits (weight, number and diameter of cotyledons) similar to those from ewes at sea level. Vitamin supplementation had no effect on LA pregnancies. In conclusion, supplementation with vitamins C and E during pregnancy at HA prevents oxidative stress, improving pregnancy outcomes.
