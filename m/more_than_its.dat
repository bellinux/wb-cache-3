5|$|From Russia with Love was a {{critical}} and commercial success. It took more than $78 million in worldwide box office receipts, far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> $2 million budget and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> predecessor Dr. No, thereby becoming a blockbuster in 1960s cinema.|$|E

5|$|Empire of the Sun {{was given}} a limited release on December 11, 1987, before being wide {{released}} on Christmas Day, 1987. The film earned $22.24 million in North America, and $44.46 million in other countries, accumulating a worldwide total of $66.7 million, earning <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> budget but still considered a box office disappointment by Spielberg.|$|E
5|$|On {{its opening}} weekend, {{the film was}} the highest-grossing movie at the U.S. box office, {{reaching}} approximately $58 million, $2 million <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> predecessor. On its second weekend, the film had a 66% drop, and then had a 54% drop in its third weekend. The film grossed $289 million worldwide, including a $131.9 million gross in the United States and Canada and $157 million overseas. The budget was $130 million.|$|E
5|$|The Grinch realizes {{then that}} Christmas is {{something}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> trappings. The book criticizes {{the commercialization of}} Christmas and satirizes those who exploit the holiday. The tale was adapted into a 1966 short animated film for television with a screenplay by Seuss and narration by Boris Karloff. Later adaptations include a Broadway musical and a feature film in 2000 starring Jim Carrey.|$|E
50|$|Drishti (Sanskrit: , 'sight') is {{an aspect}} to an entire house. Grahas cast only forward aspects, with the furthest aspect being {{considered}} the strongest. For example, Mars aspects the 4th, 7th, and 8th houses from its position, and its 8th house aspect is considered <b>more</b> powerful <b>than</b> <b>its</b> 7th aspect, {{which is in}} turn <b>more</b> powerful <b>than</b> <b>its</b> 4th aspect.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles, {{all of which have}} an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone. The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile, most of the land being farmed. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and marine energy resources are of growing importance, and the island generates <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> total yearly electricity demand using renewables. The local people are known as Orcadians and have a distinctive dialect of Scots and a rich inheritance of folklore. There is an abundance of marine and avian wildlife.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with its precursor, Final Destination ranked #3 on its opening weekend with {{net worth of}} $10,015,822, which is $6 million less than the first weekend of Final Destination 2 at #2. The previous film received $53,302,314 domestically throughout its 22-week run, $64 million <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> sequel's gross all through its 16-week presentation. Final Destination amassed $59,549,147 in other countries and $112,802,314 overall, getting $16 million and $22 million more than Final Destination 2 in that order.|$|E

The game sold over 70,000 copies in Quantic Dream's home country France during that time, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> previous game Heavy Rain during its three-month debut. Heavy Rain budget was $22million and the budget for Beyond: Two Souls was $27 million, not including approximately $18 million in costs for marketing and distribution.|$|E

5|$|The Halo {{video games}} have been highly {{successful}} and influential; {{the first game}} was labeled the killer application of Microsoft's Xbox and was credited with selling many consoles. Halo: Combat Evolved is also noted for its intuitive control scheme {{that has been used}} by many console first person shooters since. Halo 2 sold 2.4million copies making US$125 million in the first 24hours after its release beating the record for highest grossing entertainment release. Halo 3 grossed US$170million on its first day, $45million <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> predecessor.

5|$|The {{remaining}} {{boats were}} filled {{much closer to}} capacity and in an increasing rush. No.11 was filled with five people <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> rated capacity. As it was lowered, it was nearly flooded by water being pumped out of the ship. No.13 narrowly avoided the same problem but those aboard were unable to release the ropes from which the boat had been lowered. It drifted astern, directly under No.15 as it was being lowered. The ropes were cut in time and both boats made it away safely.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|Made on {{a budget}} of 180 million {{including}} production, prints and advertising, and marketing, Mary Kom earned 200 million, and before release recouped <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> cost from brand tie-ups. The film made profits before the release. Partnership was arranged {{in a way that}} the products from brands were either showcased in the film or the brands promoted the film in their advertising. The satellite rights of the film were sold for 140 million and music rights for 30 million. The film was released in DVDs on 15 October 2014 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained behind-the-scene footage and deleted scenes. The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time. The Mary Kom Blu-ray is the first Blu-ray title in India to feature a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Sega also {{experienced}} success with arcade games. In 1992 and 1993, the company's new Sega Model 1 arcade system board showcased Sega AM2's Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter (the first 3D fighting game), which {{played a crucial}} role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics. In particular, Virtua Fighter garnered praise for its simple three-button control scheme, with the game's strategy coming from the intuitively observed differences between characters that felt and acted differently rather than the more ornate combos of two-dimensional competitors. Despite its crude visuals—with characters composed of fewer than 1,200 polygons—Virtua Fighters fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with sprites. The Model 1 was an expensive system board, and bringing home releases of its games to the Genesis required <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>its</b> hardware could handle. Several alternatives helped to bring Sega's newest arcade games to the console, such as the Sega Virtua Processor chip used for Virtua Racing, and eventually the Sega 32X add-on.|$|E
