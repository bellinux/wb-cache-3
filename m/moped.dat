5|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Zakuani {{attracted}} interest from West Ham United's youth program. He later tried out for the youth team of Queens Park Rangers, and in 1997, he joined the Arsenal Academy. Zakuani became cocky and brash while not focusing on schoolwork and was released. His off-the-field issues culminated in serious injuries when {{he was involved in}} a crash while riding on a <b>moped</b> that one of his friends had stolen. Zakuani was unable to play for 18months. After losing interest in soccer and renewing his efforts in school, his teacher and mentor Paul Goodison took him to watch motivational speaker and evangelist Myles Munroe. This inspired Zakuani to renew his commitment to becoming a professional player and, although unsuccessful, he tried out for the senior teams of Queens Park Rangers, Wigan Athletic, AZ Alkmaar, and Real Valladolid.|$|E
5|$|John McFall {{was born}} on 25 April 1981 in Frimley, Surrey, in England. Between 1994 and 1997 he {{attended}} school at Millfield in Street, Somerset, where as a teenager he was a runner and hockey player. In August 2000 while on a gap-year trip to Ko Samui, Thailand, after his A-levels, {{he was involved in}} a serious motorcycle accident. While riding a <b>moped,</b> he went round a corner too quickly and skidded. He put out his leg to stop the motorcycle from falling over, and smashed his knee. The motorcycle then fell on him, resulting in the chain severing major blood vessels in his leg. He was flown to a hospital in Bangkok, but as he had damaged his lower right leg too severely, it had to be amputated above the knee after three days. Upon returning to the UK, he spent about seven weeks undergoing rehabilitation at Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, London.|$|E
5|$|Hasselbaink {{was born}} on 27 March 1972 in Paramaribo, Suriname (then part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), to Frank Ware and Cornelli Hasselbaink; he was the {{youngest}} of six children. At the age of three Hasselbaink was run over by a <b>moped</b> which broke his right leg. In October 1978, his mother took him and three siblings to live in Zaandam, Netherlands; his father remained in Suriname and rarely contacted the family. The next year Hasselbaink began playing youth football for Gestaagt Volharding Overwint (GVO), initially as a goalkeeper. He later played for Zaansche Football club (ZFC) and Zaanlandia as a right winger. He joined a street gang as a teenager and spent three months in a youth detention facility for stealing. After his release he joined the youth team at DWS, but was dismissed from the club for stealing the watch of a first-team player. He began his senior career with Telstar, while still a gang member, and had disciplinary issues at the club due to his persistent lateness. He made his Eerste Divisie debut on 27 October 1990, in a 2–0 defeat at VVV-Venlo. Head coach Niels Overweg dismissed him after he turned up late to a match.|$|E

25|$|A <b>moped</b> licence {{can also}} be {{acquired}} when the driver is 15 years old and requires the driver to pay a fee of usually 100 DKR for an amount of classroom education.

A valid <b>moped</b> driving licence grants the driver permission to drive mopeds limited to 30 km/h, but it does not grant the driver permission to drive T/M vehicles. Anyone above the age of 18 can drive a <b>moped</b> limited to 30 km/h with, or without a licence. Anyone with a B licence are allowed to drive mopeds that are limited to 45 km/h.|$|E

Soon afterward, a {{disguised}} Randolph tricks <b>Mopes</b> into performing a Smoochy act at a neo-Nazi rally. <b>Mopes</b> is branded a racist and loses his job and show, and Nora refuses to help him. However, when Randolph barges into Nora's apartment and tries to convince her to help him get his job back, he accidentally reveals that he set <b>Mopes</b> up. Tommy and her crew then barge into Angelo's apartment and force Randolph to confess that he tricked <b>Mopes.</b> As a result, Mopes' show is restored and Randolph is dubbed the most hated man in America by the media. To make matters worse, a fed up Angelo kicks Randolph out of his house. After telling him that his show is back on the air, Nora kisses <b>Mopes</b> and has sex with him.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe antioxidative {{effects of}} {{methanol}} orange peel extract (<b>MOPE)</b> and butylatedhydroxytoluene (BHT) on stability of crude peanut oil (CPO) stored for twelve months in white transparent plastic bottles {{at room temperature}} (27 – 33 °C) were investigated. Extract of orange peel was prepared by dissolving 20 g of dried, ground and sieved sweet orange peel into 200 ml of methanol for three days. The methanol orange peel extract (<b>MOPE)</b> was added at varying concentrations (200 – 1000 ppm) to CPO. Another set of CPO which contained 200 ppm BHT as well as CPO that contained no additive was also set up. The colour and refractive indices of oil samples were immediately determined while free fatty acid (FFA), acid value (AV) and peroxide value (PV) of CPO samples were determined monthly using standard methods. The colour of CPO containing additives (<b>MOPE</b> and BHT) and that which contained no additive (0 ppm) was 30. 0 units in 1 / 2 ′′ cell. The refractive index of CPO containing varying concentrations of <b>MOPE</b> ranged between 1. 464 and 1. 465 while CPO containing no additive (0 ppm) and 200 ppm BHT was 1. 463. There {{was no significant difference}} at P< 0. 05 in FFA, AV and PV of CPO containing <b>MOPE,</b> BHT and CPO containing no additive. The FFA, AV and PV of CPO containing additive (<b>MOPE</b> and BHT) were lower than that of CPO containing no additive. BHT was better in stabilizing hydrolytic rancidity of CPO while <b>MOPE</b> was superior to BHT in stabilizing CPO against oxidative rancidity...|$|R

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{motorized}} bicycle or motorbike varies widely according to intended use. Some motorized bicycles are powerful enough to be self-propelled, without use of the pedals. A development of the motorized bicycle is the <b>moped,</b> which commonly has only a vestigial pedal drive fitted primarily to satisfy legal requirements, and suitable only for starting the engine or for emergency use. The alternate design philosophy to the <b>moped</b> is the so-called motor-assist or pedal-assist bicycle. These machines utilize the pedals as the dominant form of propulsion, with the motor used only to give extra assistance when needed for hills or long journeys.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, the <b>moped</b> craze {{arrived in}} the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Mopeds had been {{produced}} for years in France and Italy, but were largely unknown in other countries. The moped's surge in popularity was motivated {{by the arrival of}} new machines produced in Japan by Honda, Yamaha, and other manufacturers, which could be operated without a driver's license and with a minimum of effort to meet existing regulation by the authorities. The new <b>moped</b> designs were really low-powered motorcycles, equipped with pedals largely to meet legal requirements. Most could be pedaled only with difficulty over short distances on level ground.|$|E

40|$|Under copper {{limiting}} {{growth conditions}} the methanotrophic bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) secrets essentially only one protein, MopE*, to the medium. <b>MopE</b> * is a copper-binding protein whose structure {{has been determined}} by X-ray crystallography. The structure of <b>MopE</b> * revealed a unique high affinity copper binding site consisting of two histidine imidazoles and one kynurenine, the latter an oxidation product of Trp 130. In this study, we demonstrate that the copper ion coordinated by this strong binding site is in the Cu(I) state when <b>MopE</b> * is isolated from the growth medium of M. capsulatus. The conclusion is based on X-ray Near Edge Absorption spectroscopy (XANES), and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) studies. EPR analyses demonstrated that MopE*, {{in addition to the}} strong copper-binding site, also binds Cu(II) at two weaker binding sites. Both Cu(II) binding sites have properties typical of non-blue type II Cu (II) centres, and the strongest of the two Cu(II) sites is characterised by a relative high hyperfine coupling of copper (A| | = 20 mT). Immobilized metal affinity chromatography binding studies suggests that residues in the N-terminal part of <b>MopE</b> * are involved in forming binding site(s) for Cu(II) ions.

25|$|The {{motorcycles}} {{are divided}} in three categories. Anyone born before 1985 may drive a <b>moped.</b> Persons born in 1985 or after may obtain a <b>moped</b> driver's licence {{at the age}} of 15. This requires training in a driving school or by your relative. After that there's a theoretical test and short handling test. The A1 licence, allowing the use of light motorbikes, may be obtained {{at the age of}} 16. The practical training is done independently in traffic after a training permit has been obtained from the police. Theoretical training includes 12 theory lessons. A person who has A1 licence can get an A2 after holding the A1 for two years by completing an additional training course in a driving school. After two years of A2 licence, it can be turned into full A licence with extra training in a driving school. After the age of 24, a person can obtain the A licence directly, without holding an A1 licence first.|$|E
