5|$|During 1958–1960 VAT focused {{increasingly}} on custom-building vehicles {{according to}} customer request. Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} <b>main</b> <b>office</b> in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} axles, desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the reign}} of King Fuad I, two laws were passed that reorganized the {{educational}} structure at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three departments: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Additionally, formal examinations were required to earn a degree {{in one of these}} three fields of study. Six years later, a second law was passed that moved the <b>main</b> <b>office</b> for the school to a newly constructed building {{across the street from the}} mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1940, Himmler {{opened up}} Waffen-SS {{recruiting}} to ethnic Germans {{that were not}} German citizens. In March 1941, the SS <b>Main</b> <b>Office</b> established the Germanische Leitstelle (Germanic Guidance Office) to establish Waffen-SS recruiting offices in Nazi-occupied Europe. The majority of the resulting foreign Waffen-SS units wore a distinctive national collar patch and preceded their SS rank titles with the prefix Waffen instead of SS. Volunteers from Scandinavian countries filled the ranks of two divisions, the SS-Wiking and SS-Nordland. Belgian Flemings joined Dutchmen to form the SS-Nederland legion, and their Walloon compatriots joined the SS-Wallonien. By the end of 1943 {{about a quarter of}} the SS were ethnic Germans from across Europe, and by June 1944, half the Waffen-SS were foreign nationals.|$|E
5|$|General Friedrich Fromm, {{commander-in-chief}} of the Reserve (or Replacement) Army (Ersatzheer) and Stauffenberg's immediate superior, was one {{of those}} implicated in the conspiracy. Hitler removed Fromm from his post and named Himmler as his successor. Since the Reserve Army consisted of two million men, Himmler hoped to draw on these reserves to fill posts within the Waffen-SS. He appointed Hans Jüttner, director of the SS Leadership <b>Main</b> <b>Office,</b> as his deputy, and began to fill top Reserve Army posts with SS men. By November 1944 Himmler had merged the army officer recruitment department with that of the Waffen-SS and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS.|$|E
5|$|Gottlob Christian Berger (16 July 1896– 5 January 1975) was {{a senior}} German Nazi {{official}} who held the rank of SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS (lieutenant general), and was {{the chief of the}} SS <b>Main</b> <b>Office</b> responsible for Schutzstaffel (SS) recruiting during World War II. Serving in the German Army during World War I, he was wounded four times and awarded the Iron Cross First Class. Immediately after the war, he was a leader of the Einwohnerwehr militia in his native North Württemberg. He joined the Nazi Party in 1922, but lost interest in right-wing politics during the 1920s, training and working as a physical education teacher.|$|E

5|$|In August 1940, Berger reorganised the SS-HA {{to focus}} better on its main role of {{recruiting}} for the Waffen-SS, creating separate sections {{to deal with}} recruiting {{inside and outside the}} Reich. The section targeting recruits from outside of the Reich developed out of a briefing he received from the Chief of the SS-Führungshauptamt (SS Command <b>Main</b> <b>Office,</b> or SS-FHA) SS-Brigadeführer Hans Jüttner on Hitler's expectations of the Waffen-SS for the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, which included the raising of a fourth division and the expansion of the LSSAH to a motorised brigade. Berger realised that the Wehrmacht quotas for the Waffen-SS would fall short of its manpower needs by at least 6,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|In March 1897 Charles Churchill & Co Ltd was {{put into}} {{voluntary}} liquidation to aid capital restructuring. This comprised an increase in authorised share capital to £50,000: £30,000 was fully subscribed, £10,000 allotted as goodwill for the old company and £10,000 retained for later issue. Within two years the company advertised with contact addresses at 2 – 10 Albert Street in Birmingham, 5 Cross Street in Manchester and 52 Bothwell Street, Glasgow, and its <b>main</b> <b>office</b> at 9 – 15 Leonard Street, Finsbury. By 1902 advertisements show the Manchester address as 2 Charlotte Street, Mosley Street and an additional office had opened at Albion Buildings, St James' Street, Newcastle. There were more than 30 employees at the London premises and 8 or 9 in Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Leeds Dock was {{originally}} a large timber dock, situated {{between the city}} centre and Hunslet. Decades of industrial decline left the dock obsolete. The opening of the Royal Armouries Museum in 1996 began the regeneration of the area, however little else was undertaken, until the wider redevelopment began in 2001. This was completed in 2007 (at a cost of £260million) and includes flats, offices, bars, restaurants, a hotel and a casino. The development centres on the dock itself as well as around 'Armouries Boulevard' and 'Armouries Square', two pedestrianised thoroughfares. The <b>main</b> <b>office</b> block on the development is Livingston House which has not yet attracted a tenant. The smaller dock incorporates six residential berths for house boats, while a passenger boat service to Granary Wharf runs from here.|$|E

5|$|Mengele {{joined the}} Nazi Party in 1937 and the Schutzstaffel (SS; {{protection}} squadron) in 1938. He received basic training in 1938 with the Gebirgsjäger (mountain infantry) and was called up for {{service in the}} Wehrmacht (German armed forces) in June 1940, some months after the outbreak of World War II. He soon volunteered for medical service in the Waffen-SS, the combat arm of the SS, where he served with the rank of SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) in a medical reserve battalion until November 1940. He was next assigned to the SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt (SS Race and Resettlement <b>Main</b> <b>Office)</b> in Posen, evaluating candidates for Germanisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the <b>main</b> <b>office</b> building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E
