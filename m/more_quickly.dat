5|$|Aposematism is {{exploited}} in Müllerian mimicry, where {{species with}} strong defences evolve to resemble one another. By mimicking similarly coloured species, the warning signal to predators is shared, {{causing them to}} learn <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> at less of a cost {{to each of the}} species.|$|E
5|$|Automation {{means that}} the smaller size of parts permits a mobile {{inspection}} system to examine multiple parts <b>more</b> <b>quickly.</b> In addition to mounting inspection systems on automatic devices, multiple-axis robots can remove parts from the mould and position them for further processes.|$|E
5|$|Comparison of {{high-resolution}} images {{obtained by}} the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than previously estimated. A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimetres of regolith a hundred times <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> than previous models suggestedon a timescale of 81,000 years.|$|E

5|$|Since 1995, Bughouse {{has been}} {{available}} online at chess servers such as FICS and ICC and, more recently, at chess.com. FICS is currently the most active server for bughouse, attracting the world's best players like Levon Aronian, but {{it is much more}} likely to find a game <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> at chess.com.|$|E
5|$|The dam was {{expected}} to provide 10% of China's power. However, electricity demand has increased <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> than previously projected. Even fully operational, on average, it supports only about 1.7% of electricity demand in China {{in the year of}} 2011, when the Chinese electricity demand reached 4692.8 TWh.|$|E

5|$|To combat delays, the {{standard}} committee allowed {{the creation of}} optional addenda which would add features <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> than by {{waiting for the next}} standard revision. However, some committee members raised concerns about incompatibilities between implementations and frequent modifications of {{the standard}}.|$|E
5|$|Up until now, the Bf 109s had {{successfully}} blocked {{attacks on the}} bombers. However, Park's tactics of attacking the Germans all along the route forced their fighters to use up fuel <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> in dogfights. When the outskirts of London came into view, they began to depart at 12:07 north of Lewisham.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is widely {{regarded}} as sexually monomorphic, males have been suggested to grow <b>more</b> <b>quickly,</b> and in some naturally occurring strains, males are noted to possess dark blotches on the base of their dorsal fins. The species reaches sexual maturity around one year of age, and continues to reproduce for 9–10 years. Frequency and timing of spawning {{may be related to the}} occurrence of rain. A. ocellatus fish are biparental substrate spawners, though detailed information regarding their reproduction in the wild is scarce.|$|E
50|$|Three <b>more</b> singles <b>quickly</b> followed, all minor hits, and White toured with Steppenwolf, Anne Murray, Sly & the Family Stone, Creedence Clearwater Revival {{and other}} major rock acts of the 1970s, playing in France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and England.|$|R

50|$|In 1995, Air New Zealand landed Queenstown Airport’s first trans-Tasman {{flight from}} Sydney and <b>more</b> flights <b>quickly</b> followed, mainly {{bringing}} skiers during the winter. From then on, an almost continuous expansion programme began {{in order to}} cater for passenger and airline demand.|$|R
5|$|Arizona {{was the one}} {{approved}} battleship for {{the fiscal}} year 1914. Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer had requested three battleships for that fiscal year, citing the former policy of building two per year, plus an additional ship to make up for authorizing only Pennsylvania in the previous year, but congressional compromises once again approved only one new battleship. Arizona was authorized on 4 March 1913, but to avoid a lengthy delay between the two, the ship was ordered much <b>more</b> <b>quickly,</b> on 24 June, by giving the contract to a navy-owned shipyard.|$|E
5|$|As in most Sonic series games, the Chaos Emeralds {{play a major}} role; {{they help}} Shadow {{remember}} his past and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow to move <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> in levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast creates an explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> than the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E

We believe that tools that better support this activity can help developers answer these questions <b>more</b> easily, <b>quickly,</b> and accurately...|$|R
5000|$|In theory, tunnels {{can be built}} much <b>more</b> cheaply and <b>quickly</b> {{because of}} their reduced complexity, {{equipment}} costs and operational overhead.|$|R
5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around <b>more</b> <b>quickly,</b> increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E
5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length {{is one that is}} lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a snapshot of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start much <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> than it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} year Cusack moved onto the Cork under-21 team and <b>more</b> success <b>quickly</b> followed. He won a Munster title in this grade {{that same year}} as Clare were totally outclassed on a score line of 3-16 to 2-7. Cork, however, fell in the All-Ireland semi-final against Galway.|$|R
60|$|Seth {{suddenly}} {{became aware that}} he was playing the part of a sneak by thus listening; and although eager to hear <b>more,</b> turned <b>quickly</b> away, busying himself at {{the opposite side of the}} barn, where it would not be possible to play the eavesdropper in even so slight a degree.|$|R
50|$|The blue {{forms of}} the Dark {{mutation}} were far more popular than the Greens and commanded fantastic prices in the mid-twenties. In February 1927 Mauves and Cobalts were sold for £175 a pair, but by 1931 the price was down to £2 a pair, as more and <b>more</b> were <b>quickly</b> bred.|$|R
5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars much <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> than would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, {{making it difficult to}} predict future developments.|$|E
5|$|Fighter pilots {{received}} no instrument training until very {{late in the}} war, after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel shortages {{and the need to}} produce pilots <b>more</b> <b>quickly</b> to replace losses. Galland also did not make sure all-weather flying was incorporated into pilot training, which was of decisive importance in an effective air defence force.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area <b>more</b> <b>quickly.</b> By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.|$|E

5000|$|... "On Fire" [...] is a 2004 hit single from Lloyd Banks' debut album, The Hunger for <b>More.</b> It <b>quickly</b> {{became a}} {{nationwide}} hit and cemented Lloyd Banks' {{name in the}} Hip Hop scene. The single peaked inside the top ten in the U.S., reaching #8. The song samples [...] "The Champ", performed by The Mohawks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940 several ORFU teams disbanded {{during the}} war, and several <b>more</b> were <b>quickly</b> thrown {{together}} {{to ensure a}} season was played. The team from Hamilton was nicknamed the [...] "Alerts" [...] by the press, but was not a descendant or continuation of the original team: they won 1 of 5 games in 1940.|$|R
