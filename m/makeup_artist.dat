50|$|Because stage {{actors are}} seen from {{farther away than}} actors on screen, {{it is crucial that}} their makeup is more {{dramatic}} and professionally done.

5|$|The {{screenplay}} which Sachs dramatized {{was originally}} {{intended as a}} parody of horror films, but comedic scenes were edited out during production and new horror scenes added.

The Incredible Melting Man was produced by American International Pictures, which also handled the theatrical distribution. The film includes several homages to science fiction and horror films of the 1950s. <b>Makeup</b> <b>artist</b> Rick Baker provided the gory makeup effects for the film. He originally created four distinct stages of makeup design so that the main character's body would appear to melt gradually, but the stages were ultimately cut from the final film.|$|E

5|$|In Return of the Jedi, Jabba {{is portrayed}} by a one-ton puppet that took {{three months and}} {{half a million dollars}} to construct.

Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue.
