2500|$|John Pizer or Piser (c. 1850–1897) was a Polish Jew {{who worked}} as a bootmaker in Whitechapel. In {{the early days of the}} Whitechapel murders, many locals {{suspected}} that [...] "Leather Apron" [...] was the killer, which was picked up by the press, and Pizer was known as [...] "Leather Apron". He had a prior conviction for a stabbing offence, and Police Sergeant William Thicke apparently believed that he had committed a string of minor assaults on prostitutes. After the murders of Mary Ann Nichols and Annie Chapman in late August and early September 1888 respectively, Thicke arrested Pizer on 10 September, even though the investigating inspector reported that [...] "there is no evidence whatsoever against him". He was cleared of suspicion when it turned out that he had alibis for two of the murders. He was staying with relatives at the time of one of the canonical murders, and he was talking with a police officer while watching a spectacular fire on the London Docks at the time of another. Pizer and Thicke had known each other for years, and Pizer implied that his arrest was based on animosity rather than evidence. Pizer successfully obtained monetary compensation from at least one newspaper that had named him as the murderer. Thicke himself was accused of being the Ripper by H. T. Haslewood of Tottenham in a letter to the Home Office dated 10 September 1889; the presumably <b>malicious</b> <b>accusation</b> was dismissed as without foundation.|$|E

But poor Geoffrey Hudson's laces, embroideries, and the rest of his finery, were sorely worn and tarnished by the time which he had spent in jail, under the vague and <b>malicious</b> <b>accusation</b> that he was somehow or other an accomplice in this all-involving, all-devouring whirlpool of a Popish conspiracy--an impeachment which, if pronounced by a mouth the foulest and most malicious, was at that time sufficiently predominant to sully the fairest reputation. It will presently appear, that in the poor man's manner of thinking, and tone of conversation, there was something analogous to his absurd fashion of apparel; for, as in the latter, good stuff and valuable decorations were rendered ludicrous by the fantastic fashion in which they were made up; so, such glimmerings of good sense and honourable feeling as the little man often evinced, were made ridiculous by a restless desire to assume certain airs of importance, and a great jealousy of being despised, on account of the peculiarity of his outward form.|$|E
60|$|Officers were {{immediately}} sent to seize Scevinus, {{and to bring}} him into {{the presence of the}} emperor. Scevinus knew, of course, that the only possible hope for him was in a bold and resolute denial of the charge made against him. He accordingly denied, in the most solemn manner, that there was any plot or conspiracy whatever, and he attempted to explain all the circumstances which had awakened his servant's suspicions. The knife or dagger which Milichus had produced, was an ancient family relic, he said,--one which he had kept {{for a long time in}} his chamber, and which his servant had obtained surreptitiously, for the purpose of sustaining his false and malicious charge against his master. As to his will, he often made and signed a will anew, he said, as many other persons were accustomed to do, and no just inference against him could be drawn from the circumstance that he had done this on the preceding day; and in respect to the bandages and other preparation for the dressing of wounds which Milichus alledged that he had ordered, he denied the statement altogether. He had not given any such orders. The whole story was the fabrication of a vile slave, attempting, by these infamous means, to compass his master's destruction. Scevinus said all this with so bold and intrepid a tone of voice, and with such an air of injured innocence, that Nero and his friends were half disposed to believe that he was unjustly accused, and to dismiss him from custody. This might very probably have been the result, and Milichus himself might have been punished for making a false and <b>malicious</b> <b>accusation,</b> had not the sagacity of his wife, who was all the time watching these proceedings with the most anxious interest, furnished a clew which, in the end, brought the whole truth to light.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prominence of}} wireless ad hoc networks is stimulating {{greater interest in}} developing adequate security mechanisms for securing applications involving these innovative networks paradigms. To-date, the proposed security schemes either provide inadequate security or they are too costly computationally, and therefore impractical for most ad hoc network applications. Adapting wired network security schemes—particularly those involved digital certificates—to wireless ad hoc networks environments, poses many difficulties, primarily for two reasons: the limitation of computational resources, {{and the absence of}} centralized entities for performing critical key management tasks such as certificate revocation. In this paper, we propose a certificate revocation scheme for wireless ad hoc networks. Our revocation scheme not only provides a measure of protection against <b>malicious</b> <b>accusation</b> attacks, but it also effectively eliminates the window of opportunity whereby revoked certificates can be used to access network services. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{localized}} trust {{management scheme}} for ad hoc networks Abstract — Wireless ad hoc networks are generating much interest, both in research {{literature and the}} telecommunication industry. The attractiveness of these networks {{lies in the fact}} that unlike other wireless networks, ad hoc networks are selfcontaining: the hosts constituting the networks can communicate with each other without reliance on centralized or specialized entities such as base stations. As these networks become more prominent, the need for adequate security mechanisms is increasingly apparent. Trust management is essential to the security framework of any network. In most traditional networks–both wired and wireless– centralized entities play pivotal roles in trust management. There are no centralized entities in ad hoc networks. This unique feature of ad hoc networks add many challenges in addressing this fundamental security issue: trust management. In this paper we present a trust management scheme that is based on the more reliable and structured hierarchical trust model. Our scheme is robust against <b>malicious</b> <b>accusation</b> exploits; it addresses explicit revocation of certificates without any input from centralized authorities, and it does so in such a way that the window of opportunity whereby revoked certificates can be accepted as valid, is practically eliminated. Key words: ad hoc networks, trust management, trust model, certificate revocation I...|$|E

WMC's counsel entered into evidence both Larkin's unsuccessful prior accusation of Secretary Shepherd and a letter alleging corruption addressed to the Bribery and Secret Commissions Prevention League. WMC's Company Secretary and three members of the Board of Directors testified there were no aerial survey contract discussions. The three other members of the Convention publicly disavowed the circular and were dropped from the suit. The final weight of the ensuing loss of the suit fell entirely upon Larkin and Shaw. Their subsequent bankruptcies left Larkin as a salaried manager in his own liquidated company, Larkin Aircraft Supply Company. Larkin subsequently left for Europe in 1937.|$|R
40|$|Cloud storage {{services}} are becoming very {{popular due to}} their usefulness: many companies use such services to store important files. However, {{there are still many}} unsolved security issues. Users can not verify whether the files stored in the cloud storage are correct. The content of files may be changed, and the order of write and read operations may be inconsistent. Clients need a way to ensure the consistent behavior of their cloud storage. To address this problem, we propose a light and fast way to audit files, called Real-time POV. Client devices do not need to cache any hash values of files in order to verify that the service behaves correctly, but just need to fetch two values of each 1 kB from a synchronization server before each operation. The cloud storage only needs to maintain a small structure of authenticity information, called an FBHTree, to preserve the authenticity information for its files. The clients and the cloud storage exchange attestation data with each operation. This system protects not only the clients, but also protects the service provider of cloud storage from <b>malicious</b> <b>accusations.</b> It also outperforms previous methods by one to two orders of magnitude...|$|R

They only served to prove {{the fact that he had}} been accused of something, and likewise that he had powerful friends, and was thought worth being treated with adulation, according to the fashion of his day.

If we could have had access to the Fordyce papers, no doubt they would have given the other phase of the transaction, but they were unattainable. The only public record that Clarence could discover was much abbreviated, and though there was some allusion to intimidation, the decision seemed to have been fixed by the non-existence of any entail.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper adapts a {{new group}} {{signature}} (GS) scheme to {{the specific needs of}} certain application e. g., a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). Groth GS is the first efficient GS scheme in the BSZ-model with security proofs in the standard model. We modify the Groth GS in order to meet a restricted, but arguably sufficient set of privacy proper-ties. Although there are some authentication schemes using GS none of them satisfy all the desirable security and privacy properties. Either they follow GSs that rely on Random Oracle Model, or unable to satisfy po-tential application requirements. In particular, link management which allows any designated entities to link messages, whether they are coming from the same member or a certain group of members without revealing their identities; opening soundness that prevents <b>malicious</b> <b>accusations</b> by the opener against some honest member of the group; revocation sys-tem that privileges from fraudulent member like the traditional Public Key infrastructure (PKI). In order to achieve the aforementioned security properties together, we propose a new GS model where linkability, sound opening and revocability properties are assembled in a single scheme. The novelty of our proposal stems from extending the Groth GS by relaxing strong privacy properties to a scheme with a lightly lesser privacy in or-der to fit an existing VANET application requirements. In addition, we partially minimize the Groth GS scheme to expedite efficiency...|$|R

We modify the Groth GS in order to meet a restricted, but arguably sufficient set of privacy properties. Note that Groth GS is secure in the dynamic group signature model of Bellare, Shi, and Zhang (BSZ) without relying on random oracle Model (ROM). Although some authentication schemes using GS are proposed for VANET, none of them satisfy all the desirable security and privacy properties. Either they follow GSs that rely on ROM, or unable to satisfy potential VANET application requirements. In particular, link management which allows any designated entities (e. g., RSUs in VANET) to link messages, whether they are coming from the same vehicle or a certain group of vehicles, without revealing their identities. Besides that opening soundness property prevents <b>malicious</b> <b>accusations</b> by the opener against some honest member of the group. By using this property, we propose a new secure application framework for value-added service providers (VSPs) in VANET. Meanwhile, a real-world VANET deployment must provide a mean to revoke system privileges from fraudulent vehicles like the traditional Public Key infrastructure (PKI). However, in order to achieve the aforementioned security properties together in VANET, we propose a new GS model where linkability, sound opening and revocability properties are assembled in a single scheme.

40|$|The offence of blasphemy and its {{implications}} {{is one of the}} critical issues in Pakistan today. This research examines the historical setting and gradual amendment of blasphemy laws and their impact on religious communities in Pakistan. The law of blasphemy belongs to two historical periods. First, the era when the country was under military rule by the British during the colonial period: they originally framed Chapter XV of Offences Relating to Religion of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in 1860. Secondly, its application in an independent subcontinent gradually moved from its original intention in Pakistan after 1947. In 1980 s Pakistan, both the intentions of this law and its penalties were significantly altered, becoming the law which people now known as the law of blasphemy. Since the law was amended, it has made people in all religious communities, particularly minorities, critically vulnerable to <b>malicious</b> or unfounded <b>accusation</b> and has been interpreted and applied to varying effects. This historical review shows how Pakistan, though claiming to be secular and to protect all religions and communities, has actually become an exclusively Islamic country. Amending Chapter XV of Offences Relating to Religion was one of the important steps to Islamise Pakistan. This research considers a range of legal, political and constitutional questions concerning the law of blasphemy and religious communities both in pre and post-colonial periods, exploring how the law and religious communities have been and are affected by politics and legislation. In so doing, it will appraise politically significant religious laws, values and activities...|$|R
