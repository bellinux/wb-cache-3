The concept of “quality of life” includes its most important component, the “standard of living”.

The impact of fiscality on the standard of living can be best perceived on the <b>occupied</b> <b>population,</b> which is taxed, the employees representing the most relevant category.

40|$|Abstract For {{a proper}} {{understanding}} of the present evolution of the commerce with services {{we have to start}} from the Romanian tertiary sector analysis for the period 1990 – present time. The study analyses the evolution of the three sectors, mainly the tertiary sector considering some indicators and the dynamics of the Romanian services importation and exportation during 2003 – 2006. Till 1898 the increase of the percentage of <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> with services (from 14, 4 % to 27 %) was slower than in industry (from 15, 1 % to 38, 1 %) and the contribution of the services to the Gross National product increased in the same period from 13, 4 % to 26, 1 %. In this period the most important services were those for the population (natural persons) not for enterprises (legal persons), so that some support services for the modern society remained behind (telecommunications, transportation, bank services and insurances, etc.). After 1990 the situation became, as we can observe in table 1, more favorable for the tertiary sector (the services), the <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> in this sector reaching 37, 5 % in 2005.

This is the reason why we aim to study the evolution of disparities both at national level among the economic development regions of Romania and {{at the level of the}} European Union, by taking into consideration all the member countries. In order to study the disparities among the economic development regions of Romania, we took into account the following variables: the available income of private households, the rate of <b>occupied</b> <b>population,</b> the human resources in sciences and technology (as a percentage of the <b>occupied</b> <b>population),</b> the life expectancy at birth, the gross domestic product and the unemployment rate.

The purpose of our approach is to estimate the size of the middle class from Romania and to determine the possible changes on it by the recent economic and financial crisis upon it. Actually, we have an approach of which shows the probable affiliation to the middle class starting from the position {{of the people on the}} labour market. We used two reference indicators, school training and the nature of the occupation – at least high school training and the non-manual occupations, both management and executive positions. The results obtained (AMIGO, INS data) show a substantial increase of the number of people with high school and university training during the recent years, as well as of the some occupations specific to non-manual activities, such as specialists. If we are taken into consideration the full achievement of those two requirements of the definition mentioned above, only one forth of <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> belongs to the middle class. In the expanded variant of estimation (at least high school education for all <b>occupied</b> <b>population)</b> that value reaches to 50 %...|$|R

50|$|When {{we look at}} the {{occupational}} structure we find that there was a very high percentage of dependents, i.e. women and children. But leaving aside dependents, domestic service was the largest occupational group. In both 1901 and 1911 it accounted for over 40% of the <b>occupied</b> <b>population.</b> This explains the large number of single people, as was seen earlier, and also the class structure. The domestic servants were usually employed by those in the next largest sector- the public and professional service. These were mainly army personnel living outside the barracks.
