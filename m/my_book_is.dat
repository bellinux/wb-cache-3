On 28 March Darwin wrote to Lyell asking about progress, and offering to give Murray assurances [...] "that <b>my</b> <b>Book</b> <b>is</b> not more un-orthodox, than the subject makes inevitable." [...] He enclosed a draft title sheet proposing An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection, with the year shown as [...] "1859".|$|E

People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints. Nothing I did in <b>my</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> as mean as any of the people I wrote about." [...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since I {{received}} the first accusation twenty-two years after Baby and Child Care was originally published--and since those who write about how harmful <b>my</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> invariably assure me they've never used it--I think it's {{clear that the}} hostility is to my politics rather than my pediatric advice.

2500|$|Prior to the book's release, Victoria's Secret {{released}} a statement claiming Bisutti had made [...] "numerous fabrications and misstatements…She was never a Victoria's Secret 'Angel' {{as defined by the}} terms of our Angel model contract. [...] And contrary to Ms. Bisutti's claims, she was never offered any subsequent modeling contracts or opportunities with Victoria's Secret despite her multiple appeals for further work." [...] Bisutti responded in an interview: [...] "All the truth is in the book. … <b>My</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> really not about Victoria's Secret. It's about the modeling industry as a whole and about helping girls with self-body image issues, eating disorders and really exposing the entire industry for what it is. It's not targeting their brand." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Huxley's {{attacks were}} making their mark. In April 1860 the Edinburgh Review {{included}} Owen's anonymous {{review of the}} Origin. In it Owen showed his anger at {{what he saw as}} Darwin's caricature of the creationist position, and his ignoring Owen's [...] "axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things". As well as attacking Darwin's [...] "disciples", Hooker and Huxley, for their [...] "short-sighted adherence", he thought that the book symbolised the sort of [...] "abuse of science... to which a neighbouring nation, some seventy years since, owed its temporary degradation" [...] in a reference to the French Revolution. Darwin thought it [...] "Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever, and... damaging" [...] and later commented that [...] "The Londoners say he is mad with envy because <b>my</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> so talked about. It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reason for}} his {{criticism}} of the Origin, some historians claim, was that Owen felt upstaged by Darwin and supporters such as Huxley, and his judgment was clouded by jealousy. Owen in Darwin's opinion was [...] "Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because <b>my</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> so talked about". [...] "It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me". Owen also resorted to the same subterfuge he used against Mantell, writing another anonymous article in the Edinburgh Review in April 1860. In the article, Owen was critical of Darwin for not offering many new observations, and heaped praise (in the third person) upon himself, while {{being careful not to}} associate any particular comment with his own name. Owen did praise, however, the Origins description of Darwin's work on insect behavior and pigeon breeding as Huxley, Thomas H., (1861), [...] "On the Zoological Relations of Man with the Lower Animals", Natural History Review 1: 67–84."real gems".|$|E
2500|$|In France, intellectuals, {{because they}} had a chance of being {{published}} and could call on their “audience” to purchase their books, were able to express themselves on the subject of captivity. Their message, which naturally was not representative of all prisoners’ experiences, took several forms. Gaston Riou developed European themes in 1928 in his best-known work, Europe, ma patrie. The rapprochement with Germany that he outlined remained solely cultural, indeed superficial. Jacques Rivière, a prisoner since 24 August 1914, took an entirely different approach, developed in L’Allemand: “I must confess frankly: a relationship is described here, rather than an objective, rather than an appearance [...] The subject of <b>my</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> Franco-German antagonism”. Rivière developed a theory of economic rapprochement that would find fruition after the next world war: “Forgetfulness will develop, in Germany and here, if we know to organise industrial unity in the Rhine basin, if we know to harmoniously regulate trade there [...] There is all the same, in our current occupation of the Ruhr, with whatever intensity it has borne the Franco-German crisis, the foreshadowing of an equilibrium and a possible harmony between the two countries”.|$|E
