40|$|Background:Chronic sleep-onset {{insomnia}} is a preva-lent health complaint in adults. Although {{behavioral and}} pharmacological therapies {{have been shown}} to be effec-tive for insomnia, no placebo-controlled trials have evalu-ated their separate and combined effects for sleep-onset insomnia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of behavioral and pharmacological therapy, singly and in combination, for chronic sleep-onset insomnia. Methods: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that involved 63 young and middle-aged adults with chronic sleep-onset insomnia. Interven-tions included cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), phar-macotherapy, or combination therapy compared with pla-cebo. The main outcome measures were sleep-onset latency as measured by sleep diaries; secondary mea-sures included sleep diary measures of sleep efficiency and total sleep time, objective measures of sleep vari-ables (Nightcap sleep <b>monitor</b> <b>recorder),</b> and measures of daytime functioning. Results: In most measures, CBT was the most sleep ef-fective intervention; it produced the greatest changes in sleep-onset latency and sleep efficiency, yielded the larg-est number of normal sleepers after treatment, and main-tained therapeutic gains at long-term follow-up. The com-bined treatment provided no advantage over CBT alone, whereas pharmacotherapy produced only moderate im-provements during drug administration and returned mea-sures toward baseline after drug use discontinuation. Conclusions: These findings suggest that young and middle-age patients with sleep-onset insomnia can de-rive significantly greater benefit from CBT than pharma-cotherapy and that CBT should be considered a first-line intervention for chronic insomnia. Increased recognition of the efficacy of CBT and more widespread recommendations for its use could improve the quality of life of a large numbers of patients with insomnia.

40|$|The Pulau Bukom-SBM, {{situated}} at about 10 kilometers offshore Singapore, {{is used as}} a mooring facility for tankers transporting crude oil for the Shell refineries on the island of Pulau Bukom. The bow hawsers (nylon ropes) which connect the ships with the SBM are frequently subjected to extreme forces excited by the ships. Many similar installations are used over the entire globe and normally these peak loads are due to wave- or current forces working on the tankers in severe weather conditions. Offshore Singapore, however, these loads also occur during apparent calm periods and seem to be independent of the waves. In order to guarantee safe dynamic operations SEPL installed a load <b>monitor</b> <b>recorder</b> on the SBM which measures all the executed forces in the hawsers. The data obtained from the load recordings are compared to the tidal predictions for Singapore area which show that some sort of relation exists between the height of the peak loads and the current velocities present at the time the forces are executed. Because of the suspected inaccuracies in the data the exact relation can not be derived. Investigation of the continuous load monitor recordings give some insight in the physics of the system as is explained in chapter 2. In chapter 3 the dynamics of the system (SBM inclusive moored tanker) are examined. Although the system is a non-linear double mass-spring system, adequate approximations of the resonant frequency can be obtained when the system is simplified to a linear single mass-spring system. Hereby the effects of the simplifications on the natural frequency value are investigated as well. A study on the average occuring wave fields near Singapore (chapter 4) shows that neither first- nor second order wave motions possess enough energy for exciting the moored tankers significantly. Through the establishment of a detailed tidal current model of the area of the SBM the presence of macro eddies is proven (chapter 5). These macro eddies are local current fluctuations in the order of minutes which originate in lee of islands or by other irregularities in the bottom topography. When carried along in the main current they can cover a distance of several kilometers before they are damped out. Since the diameters of the eddies are about two or three times the average ship length they can excite the tankers to peak loads comparable to the recorded forces and are, thus, the most probable cause of the problems. Although the development and testing of load reducing measures fall {{beyond the scope of this}} study, it is clear that it will be very difficult to apply adequate measures within limited costs which can lengthen the operational life of the hawser.

50|$|Steam {{locomotives}} of the 21st century {{fall into}} two broad categories: those that use advanced steam technology and {{are designed to be}} commercially competitive with diesel locomotives; and those built to more traditional designs for hauling tourist trains. Even locomotives in the second case likely use some modern methods and materials. These include welded boilers, to simplify construction, and roller bearings to improve reliability. For safety reasons, asbestos is not used for boiler lagging and is replaced by other materials, such as glass fibre. If the locomotive runs on main lines, safety systems such as the Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS) and an On-Train <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Recorder</b> (OTMR) must be fitted.|$|R

30|$|If {{the goal}} is an {{analysis}} {{of a number of}} different runs, rather than real-time location of an individual train, a potential source of speed profiles is from on-train event recorders (also known as an On-Train <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Recorder</b> or Juridical Recording Unit). Depending on the legislation in the country of operation, additional data may also be available to determine train location directly. Digital train event recorders in Italy include signalling system data and GPS, which have been used to improve the understanding of train running times and timetable planning [10]. Event recorder data may be more limited however, and two possible alternatives are to compare the timing of station stops against the timetable for the recorded diagram, and/or compare the speed profile against the maximum line speed for candidate sections of track [11].|$|R
40|$|The current {{practice}} for assessing driver competence performance is in-cab riding by driver managers. However, this paper investigates whether real-world driving data extracted from on-train <b>monitoring</b> <b>recorders</b> data (OTMR) {{can be used}} to assess the driver performance. A number of indicators were used to evaluate the drivers’ performance. These include: their use of the emergency bypass switch, the driver's reminder appliance as well as the driver’s reaction time. A study case illustrated the applicability of OTMR data to estimate the proposed indicators, which suggests that the indicators can be useful in the driver management system in addition to the current indicators. Furthermore, the proposed indicators could be used to tailor the driver training schemes up to their individual needs and evaluate their effectiveness. They could even be used for improving driver competence performance and reducing crash involvement by revealing potentially detrimental driving performance...|$|R

However, one complete unit, no. 1001, was preserved by Hastings Diesels Ltd., which is based at St Leonards-on-Sea. Vehicle no. 60000 has been named Hastings after the town which it previously worked to. This was mainline operational from the unit's revival in 1996 to 2006, but this motor coach was not prioritised when it needed fitting with Central Door Locking (CDL) & On-Train <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Recorders</b> (OTMR). 60000 also needed an overhaul to its bodywork {{and because of the}} costs involved, both financial and manpower, this work has not been carried out yet, which means it is currently in storage at St Leonards Depot.

40|$|Objective To {{correlate}} arrhythmic symptoms {{with the}} presence of significant arrhythmias through the external event monitoring (web-loop). Methods Between January and December 2011, the web-loop was connected to 112 patients (46 % of them were women, mean age 52 ± 21 years old). Specific arrhythmic symptoms were defined as palpitations, pre-syncope and syncope observed during the monitoring. Supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter or fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, pauses greater than 2 seconds or advanced atrioventricular block were classified as significant arrhythmia. The association between symptoms and significant arrhythmias were analyzed. Results The web-loop recorded arrhythmic symptoms in 74 (66 %) patients. Of these, in only 14 (19 %) patients the association between symptoms and significant cardiac arrhythmia was detected. Moreover, significant arrhythmia was found in 11 (9. 8 %) asymptomatic patients. There was no association between presence of major symptoms and significant cardiac arrhythmia (OR= 0. 57, CI 95 %: 0. 21 - 1. 57; p= 0. 23). Conclusion We found no association between major symptoms and significant cardiac arrhythmia in patients submitted to event <b>recorder</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Event loop <b>recorder</b> was useful to elucidate cases of palpitations and syncope in symptomatic patients...|$|R
