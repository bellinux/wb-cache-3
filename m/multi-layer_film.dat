40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of a <b>multi-layer</b> polymeric <b>film</b> made from a hybrid organic-inorganic bond-layer, a decorative epoxy-based basecoat and, finally, a protective polyurethane-based topcoat. The establishment of visual appearance and mechanical strength of the <b>multi-layer</b> polymeric <b>films</b> has been investigated by varying both baking time and temperature on a very wide range. Furthermore, two different two-step baking procedures (i. e., with and without full post-curing of the topcoat) were also proposed and comparatively evaluated. Improved trends of average roughness and mechanical strength of the <b>multi-layer</b> <b>films</b> were found at any time progressively higher baking time and/or temperature was set. Accordingly, the overall adhesion between <b>multi-layer</b> <b>films</b> and underlying metal surfaces was found to increase, as well. Nonetheless, experimental results show that even though satisfactory surface roughness and mechanical properties of the <b>multi-layer</b> <b>films</b> can be established over wide enough ranges of baking time and temperature with both baking procedures, an acceptable visual appearance is only achievable if the topcoat is superimposed at least on an almost fully cured basecoat.

50|$|Polyelectrolytes {{have been}} used by {{scientists}} to coat stainless steel using the layer-by-layer application method in order to inhibit corrosion. The exact mechanism by which corrosion is restricted is unknown because polyelectrolyte multi-layers are water-logged and of a gel-like consistency. One theory is that the layers form a barrier impenetrable to small ions that facilitate corrosion of the steel. Additionally, the water molecules within the <b>multi-layer</b> <b>film</b> are held in a restricted state by the ionic groups of the polyelectrolytes. This decreases the chemical activity of the water at the surface of the steel.|$|E

40|$|Auxetic {{materials}} {{display a}} negative Poisson’s ratio. Such materials have {{a host of}} potential benefits that could be exploited such as high shear resistance, fracture toughness, and high indentation resistance amongst others. The inclusion of auxetic materials within positive Poisson’s ratio materials is investigated {{in an attempt to}} improve the effective mechanical properties. The project focuses on the modification of mechanical properties of an adhesive, or interface, system via the addition of either auxetic and/or conventional constituents. The objective is achieved via two main approaches: a multi-layer adhesive/film interface and auxetic particulate filled adhesives. Multi-layer film/adhesive interfaces are modelled for Constant Interface Thickness (CIT) and Constant Constituent Layer Thickness (CCLT) systems using Finite Element Modelling (FEM), analytical expressions from averaging techniques for the effective elastic properties of a composite (the Ramirez approach) and a modified (weighted) Rule of Mixtures approach developed by the author. High and low modulus adhesives relative to the films are considered. In the second approach, FEM of particulate filled systems is performed for high and low modulus auxetic fillers relative to the matrix. The results are compared to existing analytical theories such as the Self-Consistent Field theory, Hashin Shtrikman and the bounding techniques of elasticity. Auxetic materials are predicted by the models to give rise to improvements in the effective mechanical properties (Young’s modulus and shear modulus) of both the multi-layer film/adhesive and particulate filled composite interfaces. Experimental work in support of the model predictions includes 3 and 4 point bending tests of <b>multi-layer</b> <b>film</b> adhesive interfaces comprising polypropylene films and polyolefin adhesive, and tensile testing of auxetic silica particulate (high modulus filler) and short chopped auxetic polypropylene fibre (low modulus filler) filled epoxy matrix composites.
