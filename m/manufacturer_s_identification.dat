Unidirectional carbon fiber sheets bonded formed by wet layup were used in all cases. The published tensile strength, rupture strain, and elastic modulus of a 1 -ply cured fiber-reinforced sheet from manufacturer M are 830  MPa, 1.67  %, and 49.3 GPa, respectively. Similarly the published tensile strength, rupture strain, and modulus of a 1 -ply cured sheet from <b>manufacturers</b> <b>S</b> are 849  MPa, 70.5  GPa, and 1.12  %; and those for manufacturer F are 875  MPa, 72.4  GPa, and 1.2  %, respectively.

40|$|Vibration {{measurements}} at {{the workplace}} are often complicated and expensive. The {{assessment of the}} risk in conformity with EC Directive 2002 / 44 /EC Vibration (which lays down the minimum requirements of laws in Europe for occupational safety and health) can therefore be carried out {{on the basis of}} an estimate based on information from manufacturers as well as by measurement conforming to ISO 5349. The characteristic values (emission values) determined by manufacturers in laboratory conditions may deviate from the exposure values measured at source at the workplace. Equally, deviations may arise {{as a result of the}} delay in the changeover of test methods from the single axis of measurement to the total vibration value for the three axes of measurement conforming to ISO 20643. To prevent faulty estimates, the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> information has to be corrected by a tool-related factor in accordance with CEN/TR 15350. By taking the example of masonry and stone working machines, the empirically determined tool-related correction factor is checked and confirmed. Methods Vibration measurements were carried out in accordance with ISO 5349 in practical application conditions on 10 selected typical eccentric and orbital sanders, concrete and disc grinders as well as on wall chasers and stone saws. Results The total vibration value obtained for the investigated tools rangedfrom ahv = 3. 6 m/s to ahv = 11. 6 m/s. When the values from the practical measurements are compared with the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> vibration values, the underestimation of the risk occurring in some cases can be largely compensated for by the tool-related factors conforming to CEN/TR 15350 (see Figure 1) ...|$|R

Maximum wholesale margins enhance the <b>manufacturer</b> 4 <b>s</b> ability to reduce competition from parallel trade in the destination country by increasing wholesale prices. In a symmetric equilibrium, maximum wholesale margins of both countries partly offset each other.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, the {{diffusion}} of Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing from Japanese <b>manufacturers</b> to U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers</b> has progressed at an accelerated rate. At {{this stage of the}} diffusion process, JIT implementations are more common and more advanced in large U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers</b> than in small; consequently, U. S. businessmen's understanding of issues associated with JIT implementations in large manufacturers is more developed than that of small manufacturers. When small manufacturers represent about 96 percent of all U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> investigation of JIT implementations in small, as well as large, manufacturers is warranted. This survey study investigates JIT implementation differences between small and large U. <b>S.</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> Ten management practices that constitute the JIT concept are used to examine implementation of JIT manufacturing systems. Odds ratio were constructed to determine if an association exists between implemented versus not implemented and manufacturer size for each JIT practice. Ten changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation are also assessed and examined in the study. Logistic regression models are used to examine the relationships between implementation status of each of the JIT practices and of each of the changes in performance in small and large manufacturers. The results of the study show that the frequencies of the 10 JIT management practices implemented differ between the two groups of manufacturer size, and an association exists between the JIT practices implemented and manufacturer size. Moreover, the changes in performance attributed to JIT implementation vary, depending on implementation status of specific JIT management practices and manufacturer size. empirical study, just-in-time manufacturing, performance, manufacturer size, logistic regression...|$|R
