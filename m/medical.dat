2500|$|McNeil Consumer Healthcare {{was founded}} on March 16, 1879 by 23-year-old Robert McNeil. In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, {{became part of the}} company and {{together}} they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company focused on direct marketing of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of acetaminophen began under the leadership of Robert L. McNeil, Jr., who later served as the firm's chairman. In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell Tylenol for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1977, two subsidiary companies were created; McNeil <b>medicals</b> products and McNeil Consumer Products Company (also known as McNeil Consumer Healthcare). The focus of McNeil <b>medicals</b> products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil <b>medicals</b> products merged with the Ortho Pharmaceutical to form Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical. In 2001 McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer & Specialty <b>medicals</b> products. However, it was later changed to [...] "McNeil Consumer Healthcare".
