5000|$|The shelter rule is a {{doctrine}} {{in the common}} law of property under which a grantee who has received an interest in property from a bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser</b> will also be protected as a bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser,</b> even if the grantee would not legally qualify for this status. The grantee is [...] "sheltered" [...] from other claims by the grantor's status as an actual bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser.</b>|$|R
50|$|In American law, a bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser</b> who unknowingly {{purchases}} and subsequently sells stolen goods will, at common law, {{be held liable}} in trover for the full market value of those goods as of the date of conversion. Since the true owner retains legal title, the seller is liable even in a chain of successive bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchasers</b> (i.e., the true owner can successfully sue the fifth bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser</b> in trover). However, the problem of successive bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchasers</b> can be remedied: If the jurisdiction recognises an implied warranty that the seller has title to the property (Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in the United States), then the bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser</b> can sue the seller for breach of that implied warranty. Courts of equity traditionally also recognise various other exceptions, likely giving rise to the idea embodied in the modern UCC.|$|R
500|$|However, {{the law on}} {{this issue}} is {{presently}} unclear. In Lee Mau Seng, the High Court said that <b>mala</b> <b>fides</b> was not a justiciable issue {{in relation to the}} ISA. A similar stance was taken in Malaysia in Karam Singh. However, in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal said that it did not need to decide whether Lee Mau Seng has precluded judicial review in <b>mala</b> <b>fides</b> situations until a case with a <b>mala</b> <b>fides</b> factual situation arises. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of Malaysian cases reflecting [...] "a gradual recognition that ... indicate a retreat from the purely subjective approach".|$|R

500|$|In {{response}} to the harshness of the rule in Lee Mau Seng, academics have offered several suggestions for circumventing it. One is that the definition of <b>mala</b> <b>fides</b> used by the courts in Lee Mau Seng is actually unreasonableness and not <b>mala</b> <b>fides</b> in the narrow sense of dishonesty or bad faith. In Cannock Chase District Council v. Kelly (1977), Lord Justice Megaw asserted that bad faith is [...] "dishonesty" [...] and [...] "always involves a grave charge". This contrasts with the meaning of <b>mala</b> <b>fides</b> in Lee Mau Seng which includes situations of carelessness or vagueness. Thus, an allegation of bad faith in the narrow sense could permit review by the courts.|$|R

50|$|Another {{matter is}} the {{transfer}} of other legal rights normally granted by ownership. In 2011, a US District judge ruled that {{a woman who had}} purchased a stolen laptop could sue a device tracking company for invasion of privacy stemming from recording software installed on the laptop to facilitate its recovery after being stolen. This ruling demonstrated that bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchasers</b> are entitled to some rights by virtue of possession alone, or that nemo dat is superseded by the bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser's</b> right to privacy.|$|R

50|$|There had also, {{the court}} found, been {{a breach of}} the nemo iudex in sua causa rule, which {{required}} that an affected party be heard by an impartial and unbiased tribunal. At no stage was the first applicant given a real and meaningful hearing. The ANC had been the complainant, and then the prosecutor and ultimately the judge in its own cause. This had violated the rules of natural justice. In {{the circumstances of the}} case the inference that the ad hoc committee was in fact biased was irresistible. The court held, further, that the ad hoc committee had acted <b>mala</b> <b>fide,</b> and that no-one had the power to act <b>mala</b> <b>fide,</b> Parliament included. The Constitution also did not intend to authorise bias.|$|R

50|$|The {{rule has}} several purposes. One {{is to allow}} a bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser,</b> who is {{entitled}} to hold and enjoy the property, to have a congruent entitlement to sell that property. Another is to prevent {{the use of the}} property from being held up in litigation.|$|R

5000|$|Barwick CJ, {{agreed with}} Supreme Court ruling that {{by reason of}} Breskvars (Plaintiff) conduct in {{providing}} the means of transfer to G.P.

50|$|This rule {{comes into}} play in {{situations}} under a number of circumstances. For example, where a bad actor agrees to convey the same real property to multiple other parties. For example, if Oscar conveys Blackacre by deed to Andrew on Monday; before Andrew records the conveyance, Oscar conveys Blackacre to Bob, who is a bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser</b> and who is unaware of Oscar's previous conveyance of the same property. Bob then conveys Blackacre to Charles, but before the conveyance, Andrew notifies Charles of the deed conveyed from Oscar to Andrew. Since Charles has notice of the prior conveyance, Charles does not qualify to be a bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser.</b> However, under the shelter rule, Charles will receive the same treatment as Bob, and will prevail over Andrew in a legal contest over the ownership of Blackacre.|$|R

50|$|A {{court may}} also order costs de bonis propiis against {{a person who}} acts in a {{representative}} capacity, such as an executor of a deceased estate, or a trustee of an insolvent estate.

25|$|Floating charges {{take effect}} in equity only, and {{consequently}} are defeated by a bona <b>fide</b> <b>purchaser</b> for value without notice of any asset covered by them.
