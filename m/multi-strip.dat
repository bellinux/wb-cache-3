40|$|For {{achieving}} high-quality LIDARgrammetry {{and performing}} surface reconstruction by 3 D point clouds acquired at different locations or in different coordinate systems, a novel method was proposed and is called tie voxel method, in which voxel denotes “volume element”. The motivation, ideas and concrete {{formulation of the}} tie voxel method are to be given. Its potential applications are discussed. On the one hand, the theoretical quality of the tie voxel method is studied by using simulated data points. On the other hand, some tests are also done by using real airborne LIDAR points. One of diverse types of tie voxels is tie cuboid. This paper describes the tie cuboid method. This method {{can be used for}} <b>multi-strips</b> airborne LIDAR points registration. It is hoped that the blunder LIDAR points and the systematic errors could and must be detected somehow. The theoretical accuracy and reliability of the tie cuboid method is then studied by using simulated LIDAR points. Test results verify that the tie cuboid method provides good accuracy and reliability for airborne LIDAR point registration, even in the case of improper point distribution on a side plane. The method exploits all implicit geometric conditions such as coplanarity, colinearity and perpendicularity so that it can provide good geometric strength for 3 D point cloud registration. Also, the test results using multiple tie cuboids between two neighboring LIDAR strips show that this method can determine an accurate vertical drift parameter SZ with the a posteriori standard deviation ± 0. 0494 m� 0. 25 �z, where �z=± 0. 20 m denotes the a priori standard deviation of Z-coordinate of a LIDAR point. Moreover, some tests are also done by using real airborne LIDAR points with a priori standard deviations ± 0. 15 m and ± 0. 30 m in vertical and horizontal direction, respectively. The root mean square distance 0. 213 m of a LIDAR point to the corresponding plane is achieved. These test results verify the applicability of the proposed tie cuboid method. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{airborne}} {{lidar system}} {{has been shown to}} be an effective and reliable method for spatial data collection. Lidar records the coordinates of point and intensity, dependent on range, incident angle, reflectivity of object, atmospheric condition, and several external factors. To fully utilize the intensity of a lidar system, several researchers have proposed correction models from lidar equations. The radiometric correction models are divided into physically-oriented models and data-oriented models. The lidar acquisition often contains multiple flight lines, and the radiation energy of each flight line can be calibrated independently by calibration coefficient. However, the calibrated radiances in the overlapped area have slightly different measurements. These parameters should be implicitly taken into account if calibrating radiances back to reflectance using known calibration targets. This study used a single-strip physically-oriented model to obtain a backscattering coefficient and a data-oriented model to obtain corrected intensity. We then selected homogeneous tie regions in the overlapped areas, and the differences between strips were compensated by gain and offset parameters in <b>multi-strip</b> radiometric block adjustment.

3000|$|In {{the last}} few decades, the subject of {{fractional}} differential equations has become a hot topic for the researchers due to its intensive development and applications {{in the field of}} physics, mechanics, chemistry, engineering, etc. For a reader interested in the systematic development of the topic, we refer the books [1 – 6]. A fractional-order differential operator distinguishes itself from the integer-order differential operator {{in the sense that it}} is nonlocal in nature, that is, the future state of a dynamical system or process involving fractional derivative depends on its current state as well its past states. In other words, differential equations of arbitrary order describe memory and hereditary properties of various materials and processes.

There has been a great surge in developing the theoretical aspects such as periodicity, asymptotic behavior and numerical methods for fractional equations.
