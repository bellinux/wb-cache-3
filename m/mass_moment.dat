It is found that the behaviour of the factorial moments is well represented by the Lund parton shower model. An estimate is made of the scale of fluctuations needed to describe the data. Differential moments are introduced and are used to demonstrate that within the average represented by the traditional factorial moments the pattern of fluctuations is itself a strong function of rapidity.

40|$|The electrovacuum {{around a}} {{rotating}} massive body with electric charge density {{is described by}} its multipole <b>moments</b> (<b>mass</b> <b>moments,</b> mass-current moments, electric moments, and magnetic moments). A small uncharged test particle orbiting around such a body moves on geodesics if gravitational radiation is ignored. The waves emitted by the small body carry information about the geometry of the central object, and hence, in principle, we can infer all its multipole moments. Due to its axisymmetry the source is characterized now by four families of scalar multipole moments: its <b>mass</b> <b>moments</b> $M_l$, its mass-current moments $S_l$, its electrical moments $E_l$ and its magnetic moments $H_l$, where $l= 0, 1, 2, [...] . $. Four measurable quantities, the energy emitted by gravitational waves per logarithmic interval of frequency, the precession of the periastron (assuming almost circular orbits), the precession of the orbital plane (assuming almost equatorial orbits), {{and the number of}} cycles emitted per logarithmic interval of frequency, are presented as power series of the newtonian orbital velocity of the test body. The power series coefficients are simple polynomials of the various moments. Comment: Talk given by T. A.

40|$|Abstract - We discuss specific, recent {{advances}} {{in the analysis of}} an experiment to test the Equivalence Principle (EP) in free fall. A differential accelerometer detector with two proof masses of different materials free falls inside an evacuated capsule previously released from a stratospheric balloon. The detector spins slowly about its horizontal axis during the fall. An EP violation signal (if present) will manifest itself at the rotational frequency of the detector. The detector operates in a quiet environment as it slowly moves with respect to the co-moving capsule. There are, however, gravitational and dynamical noise contributions that need to be evaluated in order to define key requirements for this experiment. Specifically, higher-order <b>mass</b> <b>moments</b> of the capsule contribute errors to the differential acceleration output with components at the spin frequency which need to be minimized. The dynamics of the free falling detector (in its present design) has been simulated in order to estimate the tolerable errors at release which, in turn, define the release mechanism requirements. Moreover, the study of the higher-order <b>mass</b> <b>moments</b> for a worst-case position of the detector package relative to the cryostat has led to the definition of requirements on the shape and size of the proof masses...|$|R

There is no universal symbol, nor even a universal name, for this quantity. Different authors may denote it by other symbols if any (for example μ), may designate other names, and may define N to be the negative of what is used here. The above form has the advantage that it resembles the familiar Galilean transformation for position, which in turn is the non-relativistic boost transformation between inertial frames.|$|E
