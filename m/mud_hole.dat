2500|$|Called a “St. Francis of the wilderness,” [...] Sheffey was {{renowned for}} his {{concern about the}} welfare of animals. [...] He once {{dismounted}} to collect tadpoles in his handkerchief {{so that he could}} transfer them to a stream from a small pool where they were certain to die. [...] Others he tried to save by bringing water to their <b>mud</b> <b>hole.</b> [...] Sheffey regularly stopped to right beetles and dropped out of funeral processions to lift insects {{out of the way of}} wagon wheels. [...] He gave his lunch to hungry dogs and tried (unsuccessfully) to “relieve” flies caught on sticky paper. [...] Once when his brother-in-law cut a wasp in two with a pair of scissors, Sheffey went out to the yard and starting praying. [...] When the brother-in-law asked why, he replied, “I am praying for the Lord to make another wasp to take the place of the one you killed.” [...] Sheffey was especially solicitous of his horse. [...] He specifically instructed hosts how to water and feed his horse, and he often dismounted rather than make the horse carry him up a steep grade. Sheffey had a sweet tooth and would often fill his mouth with sugar, honey, or maple syrup. [...] He regularly prayed, “Lord, bless the little honeybees for they make sweet honey. Like sweet Jesus.” ...|$|E

60|$|Billy hated {{everything}} that was respectable. He had hated the smug, self-satisfied merchants of Grand Avenue. He had writhed in torture {{at the sight of}} every shiny, purring automobile that had ever passed him with its load of well-groomed men and women. A clean, stiff collar was to Billy as a red rag to a bull. Cleanliness, success, opulence, decency, spelled but one thing to Billy--physical weakness; and he hated physical weakness. His idea of indicating strength and manliness lay in displaying as much of brutality and uncouthness as possible. To assist a woman over a <b>mud</b> <b>hole</b> would have seemed to Billy an acknowledgement of pusillanimity--to stick out his foot and trip her so that she sprawled full length in it, the hall-mark of bluff manliness. And so he hated, with all the strength of a strong nature, the immaculate, courteous, well-bred man who paced the deck each day smoking a fragrant cigar after his meals.|$|E

500|$|Although the rhino {{had been}} {{thought to be}} extinct in Kalimantan since the 1990s, in March 2013 World Wildlife Fund (WWF) {{announced}} that the team when monitoring orangutan activity found in West Kutai Regency, East Kalimantan, several fresh rhino foot trails, <b>mud</b> <b>holes,</b> traces of rhino-rubbed trees, traces of rhino horns {{on the walls of}} <b>mud</b> <b>holes,</b> and rhino bites on small branches. The team also identified that rhinos ate more than 30 species of plants. On 2 October 2013, video images made with camera traps showing the Sumatran rhino in Kutai Barat, Kalimantan, were released by the World Wildlife Fund. Experts assume the videos show two different animals, but aren't quite certain. According to the Indonesia's Minister of Forestry, Zulkifli Hasan called the video evidence [...] "very important" [...] and mentioned Indonesia's [...] "target of rhino population growth by three percent per year". On 22 March 2016 it was announced by the WWF that a live Sumatran Rhino was found in Kalimantan; it was the first contact in over 40 years. The rhino, a female, is being transported to a nearby sanctuary.|$|R
6000|$|... "At length {{the faint}} dawn came {{stealing}} {{like a ghost}} up the long slope of bush, and glinted on the tangled oxen's horns, and with white and frightened faces we got up and set {{to the task of}} disentangling the oxen, till such time as there should be light enough to enable us to follow the trail of the lioness which had gone off with Jim-Jim. And here a fresh trouble awaited us, for when at last with infinite difficulty we had disentangled the great helpless brutes, it was only to find that one of the best of them was very sick. There was no mistake about the way he stood with his legs slightly apart and his head hanging down. He had got the redwater, I was sure of it. Of all the difficulties connected with life and travelling in South Africa those connected with oxen are perhaps the worst. The ox is the most exasperating animal in the world, a negro excepted. He has absolutely no constitution, and never neglects an opportunity of falling sick of some mysterious disease. He will get thin upon the slightest provocation, and from mere maliciousness die of 'poverty'; whereas it is his chief delight to turn round and refuse to pull whenever he finds himself well in the centre of a river, or the waggon-wheel nicely fast in a <b>mud</b> <b>hole.</b> Drive him a few miles over rough roads and you will find that he is footsore; turn him loose to feed and you will discover that he has run away, or if he has not run away he has of malice aforethought eaten 'tulip' and poisoned himself. There is always something with him. The ox is a brute. It was of a piece with his accustomed behaviour for the one in question to break out--on purpose probably--with redwater just when a lion had walked off with his herd. It was exactly what I should have expected, and I was therefore neither disappointed nor surprised.|$|E

5000|$|In Indiana the Trace's {{main line}} split into several smaller trails that converged north of Jasper, near several large ponds, or <b>mud</b> <b>holes,</b> where buffalo would wallow.

Various trails also converged around a major salt lick, {{probably}} near present-day French Lick, Indiana. The Trace crossed the White River at several points, including places near the present-day towns of Petersburg and Portersville, Indiana. After a major crossing at the Wabash River, the Trace split into separate trails that led west across Illinois to the Mississippi River or north to what would become Chicago.|$|R
50|$|By 1837, the Michigan Road {{had reached}} Logansport. The roadway {{consisted}} of leveled dirt and log bridges, which decayed with every rain and snow fall. By 1850 the state approved funding {{to have the}} road planked. The roadbed was leveled and then covered with a wooden structure. Planking consisted of log sills or sleepers, laid lengthwise along the outer edges. Crosswise, planks were nailed to the sleepers. The planks were 2 or 3 in thick. Each sleeper run could be up to 10 ft in length. When necessary, multiple sleeper sections were linked end to end. Together, these planks provided a road free of dust and mud. With age, <b>mud</b> <b>holes</b> formed under the planks and sprayed outwards and up between the planks, making some sections of roadway impassible during the muddy season.|$|R
50|$|The Sumatran rhino (Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis) {{spends a}} large part of its day wallowing. When <b>mud</b> <b>holes</b> are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. One 20-month study of wallowing {{behaviour}} found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before foraging for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80-300 minutes per day spent in wallows. Captive individuals deprived of adequate wallowing have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, suppurations, eye problems, inflamed nails, hair loss and have eventually died.|$|R

It inhabits Taiwan and southwestern and southern China, including Hainan Island, southward through Southeast Asia to Indonesia, and westward to India and Sri Lanka (Shieh 1993). Currently, numerous amphibian species exist in Vietnam. However, D. melanostictus represents the only species of its genus in Vietnam and is distributed throughout the entire country at different elevations, and in various temperature and humidity regimes (Nguyen et al. 2009). According to Pratihar and Kundu (2010), some adult females of this species grow to almost 20 cm long (from {{the tip of the}} snout to the tip of the fourth toe). This species is commonly distributed in villages, towns, and open areas, and only seen occasionally in primary forest. In winter, the species can hibernate in <b>mud</b> <b>holes</b> (Nguyen et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2011).|$|R

It is very fond of {{the fruits of the}} Oenocarpus bataua palm, and also eats the ants that climb on these fruits, as well as any other invertebrates it may chance upon. It may swim across streams and wallow in <b>mud</b> <b>holes.</b> When dawn is approaching it finds its path and follows it to one of its burrows. Here it gathers some leaf litter to add to its resting chamber and retires underground. It moves around, compressing its bed for a while before settling down.

60|$|But {{there are}} {{stranger}} subterranean refuges than that at Fricourt.

The wreckage of the graves was Durereqsue. And here would be a fragment of marble angle and here a split stone with an inscription. Splinters of coffins, rusty iron crosses and the petals of tin flowers were trampled into the mud, amidst the universal barbed wire. A little distance down the slope is a brand new cemetery, with new metal wreaths {{and even a few}} flowers; it is a disciplined array of uniform wooden crosses, each with its list of soldiers' names.
