Commentators, including Gene Kerrigan and Vincent Browne, questioned its significance to the Irish economy, and many viewed it as a cosmetic public relations exercise.

25|$|With {{the aim of}} {{protecting}} models and projecting a healthier body image, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Israel, “passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5”. The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models, {{and the need for}} a medical certificate to verify their health. This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18. France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements. However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves. Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; Kering and LVMH, recently “announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2”. Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming. For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to “send the message that super slim body types is the ‘ideal’”.|$|E

2500|$|Of key {{important}} to Okabayashi's approach was a traditional concept of movement common to most koryū styles but {{not present in}} the teachings of most contemporary Daitō-ryū teachers. This concept was called 'hitoemi', and describes an idiosyncratic movement, readily seen in any Japanese period drama or koryū art, where the warrior class walk and perform techniques while lining their bodies up 'on one line' as they move forward. Okabayashi during his lengthy morning sessions acting uke, or receiver of techniques for Takeda noticed that his movements always seem to conform to this principle while other teachers, even {{those who had been}} taught by Tokimune did not always move so. When he asked the headmaster about this he reputedly replied obliquely saying [...] "The secret of Daitō-ryū {{is to be found in}} our sword. Study the sword movements and you will find the answers.

The Native Americans set fire to the prairie and began using the smoke for cover as their attacks intensified. Wright now turned east-northeast to the Spokane River where, with the water at his back, he could more effectively concentrate his fire and protect his men. To clear the way, Wright ordered Mullan and his 30 Niimíipu scouts to race through the smoke and scout the land ahead to ensure the column was <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction.

Whenever Native Americans attempted to regroup in the forest to Wright's left, the howitzers and cannon would rake the trees.

500|$|Trespass to goods {{is defined}} as [...] "wrongful {{physical}} interference with goods that are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possession of another". It is covered {{not only by the}} common law, but also by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, which was written to clear up the confusing rules on trespass to goods which had evolved over the centuries. It is similar to the tort of conversion, which covers the interference with goods in a way which is inconsistent with <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of <b>the</b> owner. [...] "Physical interference" [...] is usually the taking or destroying of goods, but can be as minor as touching or <b>moving</b> them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> circumstances. <b>In</b> Kirk v Gregory, the defendant moved jewellery from one room to another, where it was stolen. The deceased owner's executor successfully sued her for trespass to goods. Goods cover almost any physical object, including animals, as in Slater v Swann, but not organs, as in AB & Ors v Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust.

People with impaired higher visual functions after unilateral brain lesion are often tested with paper pencil tests, but such tests do not assess the degree of interaction between the healthy brain hemisphere and the impaired one.

METHODS: A new measurement setup, that involves real-time comparisons of shape and size of objects, orientation of lines, speed and direction of <b>moving</b> patterns, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> or left visual hemifield, has been developed. The setup was implemented in an immersive environment like a hemisphere {{to take into account the}} effects of peripheral and central vision, and eventual visual field losses. Due to the non-flat screen of the hemisphere, a distortion algorithm was needed to adapt the projected images to the surface. Several approaches were studied and, based on a comparison between projected images and original ones, the best one was used for the implementation of the test. Fifty-seven healthy volunteers were then tested in a pilot study. A Satisfaction Questionnaire was used to assess the usability of the new measurement setup.

40|$|According to our {{analysis}} we are <b>moving</b> slowly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction on <b>the</b> way to gender balance in local politics. During the last 20 - 30 {{years we have}} witnessed a positive development. The representation of women has in particular increased among local councillors <b>in</b> general. On <b>the</b> other hand women {{are more or less}} absent as top candidates and as mayors. The degree of female underrepresentation varies in Norwegian municipalities. We have identified two types of municipalities; those with an overall high level of female local politicians and those with an overall low level. Furthermore, in municipalities {{with a high level of}} female participation women are more often nominated at the top of their list, they are more likely to get elected as mayors and they more often run for reelection. Further attempts to achieve gender balance in local politics must take into consideration the municipalities as the context where the participation takes place, the political parties as the gatekeepers to local government, and women themselves in respect to motivation to participate in local politics. Among these, political parties have a vital role. Women’s representation is positively correlated to representation of socialist parties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local assembly. This indicates that certain parties enhance, whereas other parties hamper women’s participation in local politics. All in all women are welcomed in local politics, but still they are placed second compared to their male colleagues. Nevertheless, women are important to the political parties as candidates. The appeal of a list consisting of a balanced mix between female and male candidates is regarded as superior to a list where one gender is highly underrepresented...|$|R

This signifies that the less haul out space available, the more vigilant mothers become. Also, mothers spend less time loafing overall than lone adults and more time swimming, possibly due to the fact they are teaching their young feeding techniques. The data on vigilance rates being relatively equal between the two seal categories is inconsistent with prior studies, possibly due to smaller number of sample days. Overall, this study shows that while vigilance does not change much for mothers, they do spend more time exhibiting other active behaviors and less time resting than lone adults...|$|R
