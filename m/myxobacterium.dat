Spectacular examples of multicellular behavior can be found among the <b>myxobacteria.</b> <b>Myxobacteria</b> travel in swarms containing many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. Most <b>myxobacteria</b> are predatory: individuals benefit from aggregation as it allows accumulation of extracellular enzymes which are used to digest prey microorganisms. When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into fruiting bodies, within which the swarming cells transform themselves into dormant myxospores with thick cell walls. The fruiting process is thought to benefit <b>myxobacteria</b> by ensuring that cell growth is resumed with a group (swarm) of <b>myxobacteria,</b> rather than isolated cells.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{progress}} in modeling collective behaviors in <b>myxobacteria</b> using lattice gas cellular automata approach (LGCA). <b>Myxobacteria</b> are social bacteria that swarm, glide on surfaces and feed cooperatively. When starved, {{tens of thousands}} of cells change their movement pattern from outward spreading to inward concentration; they form aggregates that become fruiting bodies. Cells inside fruiting bodies differentiate into round, nonmotile, environmentally resistant spores. Traditionally, cell aggregation has been considered to imply chemotaxis, a long-range cell interaction. However, <b>myxobacteria</b> aggregation is the consequence of direct cell-contact interactions, not chemotaxis. In this paper, we review biological LGCA models based on local cellâ€“cell contact signaling that have reproduced the rippling, streaming, aggregating and sporulation stages of the fruiting body formation in <b>myxobacteria.</b> <b>Myxobacteria,</b> collaborative behavior, cellular automata, pattern formation, complex systems, stochastic modeling...|$|R

5000|$|Epothilones {{are derived}} from a fermenting soil bacteria, Sorangium cellulosum and it {{was found to be}} too toxic for use as an antifungal. Epothilones are {{microtubule}} stabilizing agents with a mechanism of action similar to taxanes, including suppression of microtubule dynamics, stabilization of microtubules, promotion of tubulin polymerization, and increased polymer mass at high concentrations. They induce mitotic arrest in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, resulting in apoptosis. Epothilone A and epothilone B exhibit both antifungal and cytotoxic properties. These epothilones are competitive inhibitors of the binding of paclitaxel to tubulin, exhibiting activity at similar concentrations. This finding leads to assume that the epothilones and paclitaxel adopt similar conformations in vivo. However, the epothilones are around 30 times more water-soluble than paclitaxel and more available, being easily obtained by fermentation of the parent <b>myxobacterium</b> and could be prepared by total synthesis. The epothilones also shows not to be recognized by multidrug resistant mechanisms, therefore it has much higher potency than paclitaxel in multidrug resistant cell lines.|$|E

A. Jacobi, E. Stackebrandt, H. Reichenbach, and B. J. Tindall, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 46 : 119 - 122, 1996). Five of the Chondromyces strains were found to be associated with a companion bacterium, and one strain lost its companion during the study. A 16 S ribosomal DNA (16 S rDNA) clone library was generated for each Chondromyces culture. Sequence similarity was > 99. 1 % for all but one strain of C. crocatus and all but one strain of "Candidatus comitans". The three analyzed 16 S rDNA clone sequences of the companion of Cm c 7 indicated that this companion strain is slightly less related to the other companion strains. The association between the companion and the <b>myxobacterium</b> including the sporangioles was determined by in situ hybridization with fluorescently labeled rRNA probes and scanning confocal laser microscopy.
