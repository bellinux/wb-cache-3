This concern with the organization’s ‘inside’ is gradually projected to the outside, to society as a whole. Simultaneously, changes occur in <b>managing.</b> <b>Managing</b> which was first understood as <b>managing</b> others, i. e. as the activity of the manager <b>managing</b> the worker, changed into <b>managing</b> oneself.
