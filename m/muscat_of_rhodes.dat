2500|$|Muscat blanc à Petits Grains and <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria, themselves, {{have crossed}} and have {{produced}} at least 14 different grape varieties, 5 {{of which are}} mostly cultivated in South America and 9 still found in Italy though none are of major use in wine production. More notable and widely planted offspring have come from Muscat blanc à Petits Grains and <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria crossing with other grape varieties, such as the Argentine wine grapes of Cereza, Torrontés Riojano and Torrontés Sanjuanino, stemming from a cross <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria with [...] "Listán negro" [...] (also known as the [...] "Mission grape") ...|$|R
50|$|Recent {{research}} using DNA profiling {{has shown that}} the different Torrontés are genetically closely related but distinct grape varieties, and that Torrontés Riojano, Torrontés Sanjuanino, and Torontel (also known as Moscatel Amarillo) are all separate crossings of Mission (originally reported as Criolla Chica) and <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria. Torrontés Mendocino was found to probably be a crossing <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria and another, so far unidentified grape variety. While the Muscat-like qualities of the Torrontés varieties meant that a relationship to <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria had been expected, the presence of Mission or Criolla Chica in the pedigree was unexpected to the researchers.|$|R

2500|$|Even {{though the}} vast {{majority}} of the members <b>of</b> the <b>Muscat</b> family are dark skinned grapes, most of the major varieties used in wine production are white or [...] "pale skinned", with the one significant exception <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg, which is also known as Black Muscat. This dark-skinned grape is believed to have originated in the Victorian greenhouses of England, where it was first described in 1858 as being propagated by Seward Snow, gardener to the Earl de Grey. Snow described the grape as a seedling that he created from crossing the Black Hamburg grape (an old synonym of Schiava Grossa) with the White <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria. In 2003, DNA analysis confirmed that <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg was, indeed, a crossing <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria and Schiava Grossa, which makes the grape a full sibling to the central Italian grape Malvasia del Lazio which has the same parentage.|$|R

2500|$|In South Africa, <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria {{is known}} as [...] "Hanepoot" [...] and was the fourth-most widely planted white wine grape variety in the country until the early 2000s. While some of the plantings were used for wine production, {{particularly}} for fortified wine, many plantings {{were used for the}} production of grape concentrate and raisins. In California, there is still more plantings <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria than any other Muscat variety, with most of these grapes going into anonymous jug wines from the Central Valley. As in many other places in the world, the grape had a long history of use in the United States as a raisin variety, though in the 1920s, plantings <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria began to decline as producers turned to more popular seedless grape varieties.|$|R
25|$|Nearly all {{the most}} notable sweet <b>Muscats</b> <b>of</b> Greece, {{particularly}} those from the island of Samos {{and the city of}} Patras on the Peloponnese are made from Muscat blanc à Petits Grains. In the history of South African wine, the famous dessert wine of Constantia was made from this variety <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> and while today <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria is more widely planted in South Africa, producers around Constantia are trying to reclaim some of the region's viticultural acclaim by replanting more Muscat blanc à Petits Grains and making wines {{in the style of the}} original Constantia.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria {{has also}} been crossed with the German / Italian wine grape Trollinger (also known as [...] "Schiava Grossa") to produce <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg and Malvasia del Lazio, and with the Italian wine grapes Catarratto bianco and Bombino bianco to produce the Marsala wine grape Grillo and Moscatello Selvatico, respectively.

2500|$|While <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg is used {{mostly as}} a table grape {{throughout}} the world, {{there are two}} notable exceptions. The first is in California, where {{nearly all of the}} [...] <b>of</b> Black <b>Muscat</b> in cultivation in 2009 were destined for wine production, primarily to produce dessert wines. The other exception is in China, where <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Hamburg is often crossed with Vitis amurensis species that are native to the region to produce wine grapes that are better adapted to the climate of various Chinese wine regions.|$|R
2500|$|Of {{the more}} than 200 grape {{varieties}} sharing [...] "Muscat" [...] (or one of its synonyms) in their name, the majority are not closely related to each other. The exception are the members <b>of</b> the <b>Muscat</b> blanc à Petits Grains and <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria families. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis showed that <b>Muscat</b> <b>of</b> Alexandria was, itself, a natural crossing <b>of</b> <b>Muscat</b> blanc à Petits Grains and a black-skinned table grape variety from the Greek islands known as Axina de Tres Bias.
