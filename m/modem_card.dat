50|$|Terminal Servers: Used {{to connect}} any device with serial ports over Ethernet {{for access to}} network server applications. Examples of devices with serial ports include Cisco console ports, POS terminals, servers, <b>modems,</b> <b>card</b> readers and {{a wide range of}} {{industrial}} equipment.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the respective expansion bus pins, these slots also carried audio and serial lines. The serial bus was shared with the external modem port. Because the power and serial pins remained unchanged between the two slots, {{it was possible to}} design a universal <b>modem</b> <b>card</b> which could work in either. Network adapters, however, needed to be designed for one or the other.|$|E
50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} to both is {{that when}} a <b>modem</b> <b>card</b> is installed in the Communication Slot, the modem serial port {{on the back of}} the computer is disabled. Computers that came with this card installed had the modem port blanked out (though the connector was still present). Further, due to its unconventional architecture, the Performa 5200's printer port would be disabled if a network adapter was installed in the Communication Slot.|$|E
5000|$|ThinkPad T21 - Featuring an {{upgraded}} Pentium III processor {{at either}} 750 MHz, 800 MHz, or 850 MHz, the T21 featured either a 13.3" [...] XGA TFT, 14.1" [...] XGA TFT, {{or a new}} 14.1" [...] SXGA+ TFT display (exclusive to 850 MHz models). This model shipped with a swappable CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive, and a choice of a 10GB, 20GB or 32GB hard drive. The T21 features either a mini-PCI <b>modem</b> <b>card</b> or an Ethernet/modem combo card, one USB 1.1 port, and 128MB of RAM standard (upgradeable to 512MB using PC100 SODIMMs).|$|E
50|$|In addition, a {{modified}} Communication Slot II was {{present on the}} Power Macintosh G3 personality cards. This slot only provided power and serial lines, leaving the PCI pins disconnected. For this reason {{it could only be}} used with <b>modem</b> <b>cards.</b> As in other machines, the external modem port is disabled when a modem is installed in the Communication Slot.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{cards are}} [...] "low-profile" [...] cards, {{meaning that they}} are shorter than {{standard}} cards and will fit in a lower height computer chassis. (There is a [...] "low profile PCI card" [...] standard that specifies a much smaller bracket and board area). The group of expansion cards that are used for external connectivity, such as network, SAN or <b>modem</b> <b>cards,</b> are {{commonly referred to as}} input/output cards (or I/O cards).|$|R
50|$|The {{operating}} {{system can be}} located on any storage, but is typically installed on a hard disk or solid-state drive. A Live CD represents the concept of running an {{operating system}} directly from a CD. While this is slow compared to storing the operating system on a hard disk drive, it is typically used for installation of operating systems, demonstrations, system recovery, or other special purposes. Large flash memory is currently more expensive than hard disk drives of similar size (as of mid-2014) but are starting to appear in laptop computers because of their low weight, small size and low power requirements. Computer communications involve internal <b>modem</b> <b>cards,</b> <b>modems,</b> network adapter <b>cards,</b> and routers. Common peripherals and adapter cards include headsets, joysticks, microphones, printers, scanners, sound adapter cards (as a separate card rather than located on the motherboard), speakers and webcams.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, {{battery-powered}} routers {{may include}} a cellular Internet radiomodem and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations {{to access the}} Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the tethering technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on Android, BlackBerry, Bada, iOS (iPhone), Windows Phone and Symbian, though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. [...] "Internet packs" [...] provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the MiFi- and WiBro-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular <b>modem</b> <b>card</b> can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.|$|E
50|$|Apple {{introduced}} its first true modems in 1984, the Apple Modem 300 & 1200 modems (V21/V22). Prior to that they offered {{a third party}} Apple-badged comparatively low-tech acoustic coupler. Those were followed by the industry standard 2400/data and combined 9600/fax (V29) AppleFax Modem in 1987. Apple introduced the internal 2400 data/fax <b>modem</b> <b>card</b> for its Macintosh Portable in 1989 as well as released its last external desktop Apple Data Modem 2400. Only standard internal modems were offered during the 1990s through 2005, with the notable exception of Apple's foray into GeoPort passive telephony modems which relied heavily upon the computer's software and processing power rather than dedicated hardware (like Apple's proprietary internal Express Modem). The Apple USB Modem is Apple's first true external modem since the Apple Data Modem 2400 was discontinued in 1992.|$|E

40|$|Soft Modems use {{the main}} {{processor}} to execute modem functions traditionally performed by hardware on the <b>modem</b> <b>card.</b> To function correctly, soft modems require that ongoing signal processing computations be {{performed on the}} host CPU in a timely manner. Thus, signal processing is a commonly occurring background real-time application [...] -one running on systems that were not designed to support predictable real-time execution. This paper presents a detailed study of the performance characteristics and resource requirements of a popular soft modem. Understanding these requirements should inform the efforts of those designing and building operating systems needing to support soft modems. Furthermore, {{we believe that the}} conclusions of this study also apply to other existing and upcoming soft devices, such as soft Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) cards. We conclude that (1) signal processing in an interrupt handler is not only unnecessary but also detrimental to the predictability of other computations in the system and (2) a real-time scheduler can provide predictability for the soft modem while minimizing its impact on other computations in the system. 1...|$|E
40|$|An ultra small {{aperture}} terminal (USAT) at Ka-band frequency {{has been}} developed by Lewis Research Center (LeRC) for data rates up to 1. 5 Mbps in the transmit mode and 40 Mbps in receive mode. The terminal consists of a 35 cm diameter offset-fed parabolic antenna which {{is attached to a}} solid state power amplifier and low noise amplifier. A single down converter is used to convert the Ka-band frequency to 70 MHz intermediate frequency (IF). A variable rate (9. 6 Kbps to 10 Mbps) commercial modem with a standard RS- 449 /RS- 232 interface is used to provide point-to-point digital services. The terminal has been demonstrated numerous times using the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) and the 4. 5 in Link Evaluation Terminal (LET) in Cleveland. A conceptual design for an advanced terminal has also been developed. This advanced USAT utilizes Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuit (MMIC) and flat plate array technologies. This terminal will be self contained in a single package which will include a 1 watt solid state amplifier (SSPA), low noise amplifier (LNA) and a <b>modem</b> <b>card</b> located behind the aperture of the array.

40|$|In {{response}} to a growing interest in networked communications at sea {{as well as the}} needs of our vital commercial fishing industry, the Northeast Consortium funded a novel research initiative to establish wireless acoustic and radio communications at sea. The platform used for this type of telemetry instrumentation was to be a buoy which could not only withstand the often harsh conditions off the northeastern coast of America (specifically, Cape Ann), but do so while exhibiting an exceptionally small response in heave and roll. A spar type buoy was designed and built at the MIT Sea Grant facility. Spars are a special type of buoy shape whose hydrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions with the sea are decoupled enough so that extreme sea conditions do not induce extreme buoy motions. Most oceanographic buoys are of the discus type, and move as the surface of the ocean does. This type of wave-following buoy would not sufficiently facilitate the requirements of the high-bandwidth wireless networking hardware, and therefore would not serve the current purpose. (cont.) The NEC buoy displaces approximately 140 kg of sea water and is roughly 11 feet long when fully assembled, not including its 5 foot antenna mast. The buoy employs a PC 104 stack to control an 802. 1 lb wireless card and antenna, an acoustic <b>modem</b> <b>card</b> and transducer, other peripheral instrumentation, a main battery, and a solar power system. by Meghan Hendry-Brogan.

5000|$|The 1-Meg Modem can be {{deployed}} up to 18000 ft {{from the central}} office providing a downstream bit rate of 960 kilobits per second (kbit/s) and a maximum upstream rate of 120 kbit/s over 24 gauge wire. The second generation could achieve a transfer rate of 1280 kbit/s downstream and 320 kbit/s upstream. [...] Unlike most ADSL modems which use Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) virtual circuits to carry data, the 1-Meg Modem used Ethernet which makes the product easy for most residential users to install themselves but ill-suited for applications that require quality of service to be enforced.

40|$|Target of this Diploma Thesis is the {{development}} of a thermal simulation card to analyze the thermal behavior of a LTE PCIe Mini data card for GSM/UMTS based wireless networks in different environments. The power consumption of modern wireless communication systems has increased dramatically during the last years. Especially {{for the next generation of}} wireless <b>modem</b> <b>cards</b> the thermal dissipations will be slightly on or even beyond the official guidelines of the components and the whole card. To gain knowledge about the behavior of the data card, it shall be simulated with software as well as real hardware. As the ASIC components are not available yet, a hardware emulation shall be developed. The thesis covers the whole development process from the idea, the conception, the layout to the assembly and the measurements. It starts with finding a way of emulating the mounted components, measuring and powering. Afterwards a card, incorporating the principles found before, will be developed. An additional software simulation gives comparative values against the measurements. After assembling the emulation cards and running reference measurements, trials for temperature improvements will be ran and compared with the simulations...|$|R
50|$|It was {{originally}} {{designed as a}} standard for memory-expansion cards for computer storage. The existence of a usable general standard for notebook peripherals led to many kinds of devices being made available based on its configurability, including network <b>cards,</b> <b>modems,</b> and hard disks.|$|R
50|$|For example, many modem, network, and TV cards {{accept this}} configuration. Due to their thinness, most Type II {{interface}} cards feature miniature interface connectors {{on the card}} connecting to a dongle, a short cable that adapts from the card's miniature connector to an external full-size connector. Some cards instead have a lump on the end with the connectors. This is more robust and convenient than a separate adapter but can block the other slot where slots are present in a pair. Some Type II cards, most notably network interface and <b>modem</b> <b>cards,</b> have a retractable jack, which can be pushed into the card and will pop out when needed, allowing insertion of a cable from above. When use of the card is no longer needed, the jack can be pushed back into the card and locked in place, protecting it from damage. Most network cards have their jack on one side, while most modems have their jack on the other side, allowing the use of {{both at the same}} time as they do not interfere with each other. Wireless Type II cards often had a plastic shroud that jutted out from the end of the card to house the antenna.|$|R
