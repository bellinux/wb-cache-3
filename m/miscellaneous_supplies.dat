2500|$|Much of the Butler-managed Norfolk {{trade was}} via the Dismal Swamp Canal to six northeastern {{counties}} in North Carolina {{separated from the}} rest of the state by Albemarle Sound and the Chowan River. Although cotton was not a major crop, area farmers purchased bales from the Confederate government and took them through the lines where they would be traded for [...] "family supplies." [...] Generally, the Southerners returned with salt, sugar, cash, and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>supplies.</b> They used the salt to preserve butchered pork, which they sold to the Confederate commissary. After Atlantic-blockaded ports such as Charleston and Wilmington were captured, this route supplied about ten thousand pounds of bacon, sugar, coffee, and codfish daily to Lee's army. Ironically, Grant was trying to cut off Lee's supplies from the Confederacy when Lee's provender was almost entirely furnished from Yankee sources through Butler-controlled Norfolk.

Similarly, materials such as <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>supplies</b> purchased in bulk—pencils, pens, paper—are typically handled as indirect costs, while materials required for specific projects are charged as direct costs.|$|E

After departing Sri Lanka on 31 October, Whipple proceeded to the Philippines and arrived at Subic Bay on 8 November {{to prepare for a}} voyage home. She got underway on 20 November; made brief stops at Guam and Midway for refueling; and, in company with her squadron mates, steamed single-file into Pearl Harbor on 7 December. The destroyer escort spent the remainder of the year 1973 in a leave and upkeep stand-down period. Whipple resumed local operations out of Pearl Harbor and engaged in routine exercises, inspections, and maneuvers through August. Early in September 1974, the ship commenced preparations for her third WestPac deployment and, on 1 October, got underway for Subic Bay.|$|E

40|$|Sustainability {{has gained}} growing {{interests}} among both practitioners and academics {{with the environment}} that {{we are living in}} deteriorates. With the consumers' advocate towards sustainability, companies nowadays are also trying to integrate the theme into theirs business operations thus developing sustainable organization capabilities that helps them to compete in the business world. The thesis picks up the angle of supply chain management to study the sustainable organization capabilities because greening the supply chain activities is also an area that's increasingly gaining public recognition. The literature part of the thesis is fulfilled by reading previous literature on the topic thus providing guidelines for the research. The empirical part is done through the method of systematic review. The comparison between the two parts provides insights for further research. The objective of the thesis is define sustainable organizational capabilities through earlier literature and to explore its application within supply chain management field thus providing useful insights both for practitioners and academics. The author used a quantitative research method in conducting a qualitative research. The main methodological framework of the thesis is systematic literature review. In addition, for developing the search concept, triple bottom line and Porter's value chain model are also engaged for providing guidelines for the study. The thesis engages systematic literature review as the main method for providing a comprehensive result of the current literature. With 226 defined search strings, the search took place between 2015 to year 2016. It covers the 5006 search hits, 2264 articles. Out of which, 24 are selected for final discussion. The results provide a comprehensive overview of current literature in sustainable organizational capabilities in supply chain management including: procurement, supplier assessment, IT and also some other <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>supply</b> chain organizational capabilities. In light to further research area, the author has also pointed out worthy exploring organisation operations such as material management and warehousing management. Practical wise, the author provided profound suggestions to supply chain managers and top level managers in business operations...|$|R
40|$|Many {{changes have}} been made during my first {{eighteen}} months as the Chief Judge of the District Court of Maryland. For example, we have added a brand new program to provide all indigent defendants with representation at initial appearances before Commissioners. We have also converted the judiciary from paper filing to an electronic filing and case management system and moved {{the location of the}} district court headquarters. All of these endeavors have been challenging, but something special came when packing up the old office and moving next door. In the accumulation of folders, documents, and other <b>miscellaneous</b> office <b>supplies,</b> I found two ordinary file folders hidden amongst the many records accumulated by the district court over the years. These files, however, were anything but ordinary. What I found was not only history of the district court, but also history of its first Chief Judge – the man who sat in my position, over forty years ago. Looking through these folders that contained speeches, convocations, and publications, I not only received first-person insight to the beginnings of a new court, but of the man behind it all – the Honorable Robert F.

40|$|In {{response}} to a bioterrorism attack in the Washington, D. C., area in October 2001, a mobile laboratory (ML) {{was set up in}} the city to conduct rapid molecular tests on environmental samples for the presence of Bacillus anthracis spores and to route samples for further culture analysis. The ML contained class I laminar-flow hoods, a portable autoclave, two portable real-time PCR devices (Ruggedized Advanced Pathogen Identification Device [RAPID]), and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>supplies</b> and equipment to process samples. Envelopes and swab and air samples collected from 30 locations in the metropolitan area once every three days were subjected to visual examination and DNA extraction, followed by real-time PCR using freeze-dried, fluorescent-probe-based reagents. Surface swabs and air samples were also cultured for B. anthracis at the National Veterinary Service Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. From 24 October 2001 to 15 September 2002, 2, 092 pieces of mail were examined, 405 real-time PCR assays were performed (comprising 4, 639 samples), and at the NVSL 6, 275 samples were subjected to over 18, 000 platings. None of the PCR assays on DNA extracted from swab and air samples were positive, but viable spores were cultured from surface swabs taken from six locations in the metropolitan area in October, November, and December 2001 and February, March, and May 2002. DNA extracted from these suspected B. anthracis colonies was positive by real-time and conventional PCRs for the lethal factor, pXO 1, and for capA and vrr genes; sequence analysis of the latter amplicons indicated > 99 % homology with the Ames, vollum, B 6273 - 93, C 93022281, and W- 21 strains of B. anthracis, suggesting they arose from cross-contamination during the attack through the mail. The RAPID-based PCR analysis provided fast confirmation of suspect colonies from an overnight incubation on agar plates...|$|E
60|$|The {{next was}} much more impressive. Darius died soon after the news of his defeat at Marathon reached him, and for four years his son and successor, Xerxes, {{prepared}} a host to crush the Greeks. For a time terror united all the Greeks. The army of Xerxes was certainly the greatest that had hitherto been assembled in the world. It was a huge assembly of discordant elements. It crossed the Dardanelles, 480 B.C., by a bridge of boats; and along the coast as it advanced moved an equally <b>miscellaneous</b> fleet carrying <b>supplies.</b> At the narrow pass of Thermopylæ a small force of 1400 men under the Spartan Leonidas resisted this multitude, and after a fight of unsurpassed heroism was completely destroyed. Every man was killed. But the losses they inflicted upon the Persians were enormous, and the army of Xerxes pushed on to Thebes and Athens in a chastened mood. Thebes surrendered and made terms. The Athenians abandoned their city and it was burnt.|$|R
