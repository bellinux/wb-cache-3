The utilization of renewable energy considered as one of the most promising electrical energy sources, which has grown rapidly in the last three decades.

In this work, there is a new technical control is known as synchronverter control which is using the synchronous generator mathematical equations as a reference. This synchronverter control is connected with DC-AC three phase inverter to work as controller of output power to feed the load. In this control strategy, the output current of the controllable inverter is controlled by a feedback load current according to the current reference.

This study aims at disentangling the biological mechanisms underlying connectivity plasticity in the uninjured motor network after an ischemic lesion. In particular, we measured generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) {{to assess whether}} post-stroke connectivity remodeling depend on axonal and/or myelin changes. Materials and Methods: Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI) and Magnetization Transfer MRI at 3 T were performed in 10 patients in acute phase, at one and six months after stroke, which was affecting motor cortical and/or subcortical areas. Ten age- and gender- matched healthy volunteers were scanned one month apart for longitudinal comparison. Clinical assessment was also performed in patients prior to MRI. In the contra-lesional hemisphere, average measures and tract-based quantitative analysis of GFA and MTR was performed to assess axonal integrity and myelination along <b>motor</b> <b>connections</b> {{as well as their}} variations in time. Results and Conclusions: Mean and tract-based measures of MTR and GFA showed significant changes in a number of contralesional <b>motor</b> <b>connections,</b> confirming both axonal and myelin plasticity in our cohort of patients. Moreover, density-derived features (peak height, standard deviation-SD and skewness) of GFA and MTR along the tracts showed additional correlation with clinical scores than mean values.

Compared to electro-pneumatic friction brakes, braking with the traction motors can be regulated faster improving the performance of wheel slide protection.|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a severe}} neurodegenerative disease selectively affecting {{upper and lower}} motor neurons. Patients with ALS suffer from progressive paralysis and eventually die on average after three years. The underlying neurobiology of upper motor neuron degeneration {{and its effects on}} the complex network of the brain are, however, largely unknown. Here, we examined the effects of ALS on the structural brain network topology in 35 patients with ALS and 19 healthy controls. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the brain network was reconstructed for each individual participant. The connectivity of this reconstructed brain network was compared between patients and controls using complexity theory without - a priori selected - regions of interest. Patients with ALS showed an impaired sub-network of regions with reduced white matter connectivity (p =  0. 0108, permutation testing). This impaired sub-network was strongly centered around primary motor regions (bilateral precentral gyrus and right paracentral lobule), including secondary motor regions (bilateral caudal middle frontal gyrus and pallidum) as well as high-order hub regions (right posterior cingulate and precuneus). In addition, we found a significant reduction in overall efficiency (p =  0. 0095) and clustering (p =  0. 0415). From our findings, we conclude that upper motor neuron degeneration in ALS affects both primary <b>motor</b> <b>connections</b> as well as secondary <b>motor</b> <b>connections,</b> together composing an impaired sub-network. The degenerative process in ALS was found to be widespread, but interlinked and targeted to the motor connectome...|$|R

40|$|SummaryNeuropilins, {{secreted}} semaphorin coreceptors, {{are expressed}} in discrete populations of spinal motor neurons, suggesting they provide critical guidance information {{for the establishment of}} functional motor circuitry. We show here that motor axon growth and guidance are impaired in the absence of Sema 3 A-Npn- 1 signaling. Motor axons enter the limb precociously, showing that Sema 3 A controls the timing of motor axon in-growth to the limb. Lateral motor column (LMC) motor axons within spinal nerves are defasciculated as they grow toward the limb and converge in the plexus region. Medial and lateral LMC motor axons show dorso-ventral guidance defects in the forelimb. In contrast, Sema 3 F-Npn- 2 signaling guides the axons of a medial subset of LMC neurons to the ventral limb, but plays no major role in regulating their fasciculation. Thus, Sema 3 A-Npn- 1 and Sema 3 F-Npn- 2 signaling control distinct steps of motor axon growth and guidance during the formation of spinal <b>motor</b> <b>connections...</b>|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{it has become clear}} that the {{assessment}} of the quality of general movements (GMs) in foetus and young infant is a sensitive tool to evaluate the integrity of the young nervous system. GMs are movements in which all parts of the body participate. The hallmark of typical GMs is movement complexity and variation; in abnormal GMs movement complexity and variation is reduced or absent. Abnormal GMs may predict developmental outcome. Prediction on the basis of longitudinal series of GM assessments is best. Second best is prediction on the basis of an assessment at 'fidgety' GM age, i. e. at 2 - 4 months post-term. Definitely abnormal GMs at 'fidgety' age are related to cerebral palsy, mildly abnormal GMs to minor neurological dysfunction at school age. I it the present paper the hypothesis is advanced that GM complexity and variation are brought about by the transiently present cortical subplate and that abnormal GMs are the result of damage or dysfunction of the subplate and its efferent <b>motor</b> <b>connections</b> in the periventricular white matter.

40|$|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, which is known to affect upper and lower motor neurons. In contrast to the classical tenet that ALS represents the outcome of extensive and progressive impairment of a fixed set of <b>motor</b> <b>connections,</b> recent neuroimaging findings suggest that the disease spreads along vast non-motor connections. Here, we hypothesised that functional network topology is perturbed in ALS, and that this reorganization is associated with disability. We tested this hypothesis in 21 patients affected by ALS at several stages of impairment using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and compared the results to 16 age-matched healthy controls. We estimated functional connectivity using the Phase Lag Index (PLI), and characterized the network topology using the minimum spanning tree (MST). We found a significant difference between groups in terms of MST dissimilarity and MST leaf fraction in the beta band. Moreover, some MST parameters (leaf, hierarchy and kappa) significantly correlated with disability. These findings suggest that the topology of resting-state functional networks in ALS is affected by the disease in relation to disability.

40|$|Precise {{anatomical}} {{knowledge of}} the structure of the corpus callosum is important in split-brain research and during neurosurgical procedures sectioning the callosum. According to the classic literature, commissural fibers connecting the motor cortex are situated in the anterior part of the corpus callosum. On the other hand, more recent imaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging indicate a more posterior topography of callosal fibers connecting motor areas. Topographical knowledge is especially critical when performing disconnective callosotomies in epilepsy patients who experience sudden loss of leg motor control, so-called epileptic drop attacks. In the current study, we aim to precisely delineate the topography of the leg <b>motor</b> <b>connections</b> of the corpus callosum. Of 20 hemispheres obtained at autopsy, 16 were dissected according to Klingler's fiber dissection technique to study the course and topography of callosal fibers connecting the most medial part of the precentral gyrus. Fibers originating from the anterior bank of the central sulcus were invariably found to be located in the isthmus of the corpus callosum, and no leg motor fibers were found in the anterior part of the callosum.
