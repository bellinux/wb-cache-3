Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E

Because of this expense, firms sometimes do not always change their prices with every change in supply and demand, leading to nominal rigidity Generally, the effect on the firm of small shifts in price (by changes in supply and/or demand, or else because of slight adjustments in monetary policy) is relatively minor compared to the costs of notifying the public of this new information.

His paper [...] "Small <b>Menu</b> <b>Costs</b> and Large Business Cycles: A Macroeconomic Model of Monopoly," [...] published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1985, compared a firm's private incentive to adjust prices after a shock to nominal aggregate demand with the social welfare implications of that decision. The paper concluded that expansion in aggregate demand may either increase welfare or reduce it, but the welfare reduction is never greater than the menu cost. A contraction in aggregate demand, however, reduces welfare, possibly in an amount much larger than the menu cost. Put another way, from a social planner’s point of view, prices may be stuck too high, but never too low. This paper was a building block for work by Olivier Blanchard and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki on aggregate-demand externalities and for work by Laurence Ball and David Romer on the interaction between real and nominal rigidities.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} <b>menu</b> <b>cost</b> models for the rate of reversion to purchasing power parity. Recent <b>menu</b> <b>cost</b> models (Ball and Mankiw, 1994) imply that higher inflation is correlated with more rapid price adjustment. This means that reversion to PPP may be more rapid, the greater the rate of inflation. In order to test this proposition, PPI-deflated real exchange rates are examined {{to see if the}} rate of reversion to PPP is a function of inflation. Another implication, due to both Delgado (1991) and Greenwald and Stiglitz (1989), is that higher exchange rate volatility is associated with slower rates of reversion. I find that both of these propositions hold in panel data, although the second proposition is less robust...|$|R
40|$|A {{dominant}} {{explanation of}} price rigidity {{is the so-called}} "menu cost model" according to which small costs of changing prices may imply that firms keep nominal prices unchanged to nominal shocks which therefore have real effects.

This paper analyses the role of costs of adjusting both prices and quantities, and it is found that the "small cost" argument used to support <b>menu</b> <b>cost</b> models does not hold. The predictions of <b>menu</b> <b>cost</b> models only hold if price adjustment costs are larger than quantity adjustment costs.

5000|$|In the 1980s the key {{concept of}} using <b>menu</b> <b>costs</b> in a {{framework}} of imperfect competition to explain price stickiness was developed. The concept of a lump-sum cost (menu cost) to changing the price was originally introduced by Sheshinski and Weiss (1977) in their paper looking at the effect of inflation on the frequency of price-changes. The idea of applying it as a general theory of Nominal Price Rigidity was simultaneously put forward by several economists in 1985-6. George Akerlof and Janet Yellen put forward the idea that due to bounded rationality firms will not want to change their price unless the benefit {{is more than a}} small amount. This bounded rationality leads to inertia in nominal prices and wages which can lead to output fluctuating at constant nominal prices and wages. Gregory Mankiw took the menu-cost idea and focused on the welfare effects of changes in output resulting from sticky prices. Michael Parkin also put forward the idea. Although the approach initially focused mainly on the rigidity of nominal prices, it was extended to wages and prices by Olivier Blanchard and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki in their influential article Monopolistic Competition and the Effects of Aggregate Demand [...] Huw Dixon and Claus Hansen showed that even if <b>menu</b> <b>costs</b> applied to a small sector of the economy, this would influence {{the rest of the economy}} and lead to prices in the rest of the economy becoming less responsive to changes in demand.|$|E
5000|$|The rule also implies that, absent <b>menu</b> <b>costs,</b> a monopolistic firm {{will never}} choose {{a point on}} the inelastic portion of its demand curve. Furthermore, for an {{equilibrium}} to exist in a monopoly or in an oligopoly market, the price elasticity of demand must be less than negative one (...) (Mas-Colell) simply because the price elasticity of demand must be less than negative one for Marginal Revenue (MR) to be positive. The Mathematical Profit Maximization Conditions ("First Order Conditions") ensure the price elasticity of demand must be less than negative one; since no [...] "Rational Firm" [...] that attempts to maximize its profit would incur additional Cost (a positive Marginal Cost) in order to Reduce Revenue (when MR < 0).|$|E

50|$|Disequilibrium characterizes {{a market}} {{that is not in}} equilibrium. Disequilibrium can occur {{extremely}} briefly or {{over an extended period of}} time. Typically in financial markets it either never occurs or only momentarily occurs, because trading takes place continuously and the prices of financial assets can adjust instantaneously with each trade to equilibrate supply and demand. At the other extreme, many economists view labor markets as being in a state of disequilibrium - specifically one of excess supply - over extended periods of time. Goods markets are somewhere in between: prices of some goods, while sluggish in adjusting due to <b>menu</b> <b>costs,</b> long term contracts, and other impediments, do not stay at disequilibrium levels indefinitely, and many goods markets such as commodity markets are highly organised and liquid and have essentially instantaneous adjustment of their prices to equilibrium levels.|$|E

For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E
50|$|Many economists {{maintain}} that money neutrality {{is a good}} approximation for how the economy behaves {{over long periods of}} time but that in the short run monetary-disequilibrium theory applies, such that the nominal money supply would affect output. One argument is that prices and especially wages are sticky (because of <b>menu</b> <b>costs,</b> etc.), and cannot be adjusted immediately to an unexpected change in the money supply. An alternative explanation for real economic effects of money supply changes is not that people cannot change prices but that they do not realize that it is in their interest to do so. The bounded rationality approach suggests that small contractions in the money supply are not taken into account when individuals sell their houses or look for work, and that they will therefore spend longer searching for a completed contract than without the monetary contraction. Furthermore, the floor on nominal wages changes imposed by most companies is observed to be zero: an arbitrary number by the theory of monetary neutrality but a psychological threshold due to money illusion.|$|E
