He went straight back into the first team upon his recovery, and he was played mostly at centre-half, or in his preferred position at right-half.

The two {{had not spoken}} {{to each other about}} the lyrics ahead of time, {{and it turned out that}} the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> with the verse.

Tom came in after I had been <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect.

This guitar driven intro in Clinton Heylin's opinion made it one of Morrison's most memorable singles. [...] "Wild Night", which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as [...] "a great start to the album", was first recorded after the Astral Weeks sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on Tupelo Honey. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally [...] "a much slower number, but when we got to fooling around with it in the studio, we ended up doing it in a faster tempo." ...|$|E

This came about following his first few solo performances when he realised he did not wish people to consider him a singer-songwriter {{but as part of}} a band.

He was previously a member of the bands Black Belt Jones and Sir Killalot. After leaving Black Belt Jones he {{went on to become the}} bassist in the instrumental rock band The Redneck Manifesto of which he is still a member. He has occasionally toured as part of David Kitt’s live band, as well as in Conor J. O'Brien's band Villagers as a bass player and with his bandmates in The Redneck Manifesto. By 2003 Egan had developed Jape after spending a week at the family home of fellow Redneck, Niall Byrne, in Avoca, County Wicklow. [...] "I’ve been playing in bands since I was really young but I’ve always been <b>messing</b> <b>around</b> on the side with four-track tape recorders, experimenting with sounds". [...] "The chance to turn this “messing around” into something concrete came about when he was given the opportunity to decamp to Avoca, where fellow Redneck, Niall’s family own a house. Richie used it as a studio for a week." [...] "I listen to a lot of different styles of music, so I try to keep my finger in as many pies as possible.

500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still <b>messing</b> <b>around,</b> because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E
500|$|The mix of {{improvisation}} and R/funk elements {{is evident in}} [...] "Who Knows", which was the opening number for the second (after the brief [...] "Auld Lang Syne") and third shows. It is a loose jam rather than a structured song and during the performance for second show Hendrix teases the audience with [...] "I hope you don't mind us jamming a little bit, we're just <b>messing</b> <b>around...</b> seeing what we're gonna play next". [...] Built on Hendrix's guitar figure, [...] "Who Knows" [...] is framed by Cox's economical funk-blues bass line and Miles' steady drum beat, which Murray describes as [...] "a thick, lazy twitch". [...] Hendrix explores guitar phrases using different tones and effects between vocal sections. [...] According to Cox, Hendrix used a new combination of effects for the first time. [...] These included a Uni-Vibe phase shifter, an Octavia harmonizer (developed for him by Roger Mayer during the recording of his first album), a Fuzz Face distortion box, and a wah-wah pedal. [...] One mixture of them produces a [...] "whistling, shimmering, ring-modulated tone so rich with upper harmonics" [...] in the higher range, while in the lower range [...] "it almost sounds like 'Froggy Went a-Courtin''... all these [...] oct-intervals give it such a dramatic effect". [...] His use of the wah-wah employs [...] "rapid foot movement and wide sweeps [...] tend to make the melody fade in and out". [...] Also, by using a triplet rhythm with the pedal, a polyrhythm with the prevailing 4/4 beat is created. [...] The lyrics, some which borrow from other R songs, are also improvised and show considerable {{differences between the two}} renditions. [...] As it unfolds, there is an R vocal call and response section between Hendrix and Miles, then separate vocal sections for each, which Miles follows with scat singing. [...] During the middle section, most of the instrumentation drops out and returns with more Hendrix guitar tonal explorations before winding down at 8:23 (second show) and 9:32 (third show). [...] While McDermott feels that the jam is underdeveloped and biographer Harry Shapiro criticizes Miles' vocals, Shadwick and writer David Henderson focus on the [...] "easy groove" [...] and [...] "lilting flow". [...] Besides adding a fresh rhythmic element to his music, it also gives Hendrix more room to experiment with different approaches and sounds on guitar.|$|E
