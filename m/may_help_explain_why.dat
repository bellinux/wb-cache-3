5|$|Nonetheless, many stone Norman keeps made {{considerable}} compromises {{to military}} utility. Norwich Castle, for example, included elaborate blind arcading {{on the outside}} of the building and appears to have had an entrance route designed for public ceremony, rather than for defence. The interior of the keep at Hedingham could certainly have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective. Important early English and Welsh keeps such as the White Tower, Colchester, and Chepstow were all built in a distinctive Romanesque style, often reusing Roman materials and sites, and were almost certainly intended to impress and generate a political effect amongst local people. The political value of these keep designs, and the social prestige they lent to their builders, <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they continued to be built in England into the late 12th century, beyond the point when military theory would have suggested that alternative designs were adopted.|$|E

Overall, our analysis of a panel of European countries provides support for this expectation.

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that unemployment {{is one of the}} most negative outcome in life, carrying pecuniary as well as non-pecuniary psychological costs. Standard explanations of the demand for social protection have neglected these psychological costs and their impact on how workers wish protection to be delivered. Our paper aims at using some clues from behavioural economics to include these costs in the explanation of the demand for social protection in general and on-the-job protection in particular. Building on empirical evidence, we argue that loss aversion and hedonic adaptation <b>may</b> <b>help</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> workers, either employed or unemployed, ask for on-the-job protection and are willing to pay the cost of it. The main conclusion of our analysis is that on-the-job protection is a more effective means to provide protection to poorly educated workers than social public expenditure. As a consequence countries with (relatively) more poorly educated workers should be comparatively more prone to ask for protection trough on-thejob protection rather than through social public expenditure.
