5|$|In March 2011 an {{assessment}} of the Greyfriars site began to identify where the monastery had stood, and which land <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> for excavation. A desk-based assessment was conducted to determine the archaeological viability of the site, followed by a survey in August 2011 using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The GPR results were inconclusive; no clear building remains could be identified owing to a layer of disturbed ground and demolition debris just below the surface. The survey was useful in finding modern utilities crossing the site, such as pipes and cables.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that biogas (mainly methane) – produced from the anaerobic digestion {{of organic matter}} – is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British anaerobic digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill sites {{have the potential for}} a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential.|$|E
5|$|On a {{hard pitch}} in very cold weather, Small Heath had already conceded twice at Blackburn Rovers before Billy Ollis was injured {{midway through the}} first half and played no further part. The {{visitors}} put up a fight, but the numerical disavantage was too much for them and the final score of 9–1 remains the club's joint-record losing margin. With no competitive fixture scheduled for the next two weeks, the club undertook a tour. Their opening match, in Plymouth, was the first visit of a professional club to the south-west of England. The Home Park club had ambitions to bring professional league football to the region, and in front of a crowd of 4,000 their team performed well before conceding three second-half goals. Small Heath's tour ended with a 2–1 defeat at Manchester City, and they returned to a celebratory dinner in honour of the club's promotion to the First Division. The chairman presented medals to the players, congratulated them on their showing thus far, and proposed a toast to their health, in the hope that a full-strength team <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> by the next League match in ten days time.|$|E

25|$|Although the Judiciary Act of 1789 gave courts {{the power}} to issue writs, the writ of coram nobis {{developed}} slowly. The writ was acknowledged as early as 1834 by the United States Supreme Court when it recognized that its counterpart, the writ of coram vobis, <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> in state courts to challenge an error of fact. Despite this early acknowledgment, the writ of coram nobis, at least federally, was a rather archaic vehicle for relief. In 1881, the United States Supreme Court recognized {{the availability of the}} writ as common-law writ but acknowledged it was not utilized by the courts and even questioned its availability.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E
500|$|Tremaine paid a cent a {{word for}} stories, which was more {{than many of the}} other sf {{magazines}} that were crowding the field at the time; the respectable pay rate no doubt helped him, but it put the magazine under additional financial pressure. [...] Two other magazines launched at about the same time, Cosmic Stories and Stirring Science Stories, edited by Donald A. Wollheim, both paid nothing at all to writers, on the basis that if the magazines were successful, money <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> in the future. [...] This annoyed Tremaine, and Isaac Asimov, who gave Wollheim a story for Cosmic Stories, later recalled Tremaine telling him that [...] "any author who donated stories to Wollheim, and thus contributed to the destruction of competing magazines who paid, should be blacklisted in the field". [...] Asimov was sufficiently upset that he later obtained token payment from Wollheim so that he could assert he had been paid for his story.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, DC Comics {{acquired}} {{a line of}} characters from Charlton Comics. During that period, writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp, {{as he had done}} in his Miracleman series in the early 1980s. Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics' Mighty Crusaders <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbour. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them [...] "so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was". Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the Peacemaker, and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano. Giordano was receptive to the proposal, but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story. Moore said, [...] "DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional." [...] Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue with new characters. Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for the readers, but later changed his mind. He said, [...] "Eventually, I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough, so that they seemed familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader, then it might work." ...|$|E

De Havilland's Airco designs were to provide around 30% of all trainers, fighters and bombers used by Britain and the United States during the First World War.|$|E
2500|$|Estimates {{of direct}} costs for climate {{engineering}} implementation vary widely. In general, carbon dioxide removal methods {{are more expensive}} than the solar radiation management ones. In their 2009 report Geoengineering the Climate the Royal Society judged afforestation and stratospheric aerosol injection as the methods with the [...] "highest affordability" [...] (lowest costs). More recently, research into costs of solar radiation management have been published. [...] This suggests that [...] "well designed systems" [...] <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> for costs in the order of a few hundred million to {{tens of billions of dollars}} per year. [...] These are much lower than costs to achieve comprehensive reductions in CO2 emissions. Such costs would be within the budget of most nations, and even some wealthy individuals.|$|E

[...] The Court, additionally, hinted that other remedy <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> {{in the form of}} eliminating the license requirement for carry in the home, but that no such relief had been requested: [...] "Respondent conceded at oral argument that he does not 'have a problem with ... licensing' and that the District's law is permissible so long as it is 'not enforced in an arbitrary and capricious manner.' Tr. of Oral Arg. 74–75. We therefore assume that petitioners' issuance of a license will satisfy respondent’s prayer for relief and do not address the licensing requirement." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} of the vessel was controversial, with the community of Argentia proferred {{as a substitute for}} the colonial capital of St. John's. Reasons for this proposal included both a desire to protect the larger city from the conjectured debaucheries of sailors, and to protect the reservists, many of whom were married, from the temptations (including prostitution) which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> in the city. [...] In a time of tensions between Britain and France, Argentia also had the benefit of being closer to the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and it was felt beneficial to have a British military force in proximity to the French territory {{in the event of a}} dispute. [...] These objections were felt to be outweighed by cost, convenience, and accessibility of staff to the colonial government, and St. John's was chosen to host the ship.|$|E
2500|$|OBD-II {{provides}} {{access to}} data from the engine control unit (ECU) and offers a valuable source of information when troubleshooting problems inside a vehicle. The SAE J1979 standard defines a method for requesting various diagnostic data {{and a list of}} standard parameters that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> from the ECU. The various parameters that are available are addressed by [...] "parameter identification numbers" [...] (parameter IDs or PIDs) which are defined in J1979. For a list of basic PIDs, their definitions, and the formula to convert raw OBD-II output to meaningful diagnostic units, see OBD-II PIDs. Manufacturers are not required to implement all PIDs listed in J1979 and they are allowed to include proprietary PIDs that are not listed. The PID request and data retrieval system gives access to real time performance data as well as flagged DTCs. For a list of generic OBD-II DTCs suggested by the SAE, see Table of OBD-II Codes. Individual manufacturers often enhance the OBD-II code set with additional proprietary DTCs.|$|E

60|$|A Wesleyan mission {{had been}} {{established}} at Wangaroa, which he visited and assisted, and finding Mr. Leigh, the chief minister, very ill, offered him a passage to Sydney for advice, but this ship had scarcely weighed anchor before a great storm came on; the ship was lost, and the crew and passengers had to land in boats, and return for two months longer before a ship could be found to bring them home, and in this time he did all {{in his power to}} bring the Maories to agree to some settled form of government under a single chief; but though any chief, especially Hunghi, was quite willing to be that one, nobody would be anything secondary, and thus the project failed. He also set the missionaries the task of endeavouring to collect a fixed vocabulary and grammar, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> in future translations. The great kindness shown him at his shipwreck had greatly touched his heart, especially in contrast with the usage he was meeting with in Australia, for this was in the height of the persecution about Ring, which detained him at home for more than two years. During this time Mr. Williams was joined by his brother William, also a priest of the English Church, but the wars of the Maories had become so desperate that the peril of the missionaries had been much increased; indeed, the Wesleyans had had the whole of their premises ravaged, so that the minister came as a fugitive to find a refuge at Paramatta, as a guest of Mr. Marsden.|$|E
60|$|The personage who {{had handed}} the three batches {{of letters to}} the newspaper, told the Court how he had in 1885 {{compiled}} a pamphlet called Parnellism Unmasked, partly from materials communicated to him by a certain broken-down Irish journalist. To this unfortunate sinner, then {{in a state of}} penury little short of destitution, he betook himself one winter night in Dublin at the end of 1885. Long after, when the game was up and the whole sordid tragi-comedy laid bare, the poor wretch wrote: “I have been in difficulties and great distress for want of money for the last twenty years, and in order to find means of support for myself and my large family, I have been guilty of many acts which must for ever disgrace me.”(256) He had now within reach a guinea a day, and much besides, if he would endeavour to find any documents that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> to sustain the charges made in the pamphlet. After some hesitation the bargain was struck, a guinea a day, hotel and travelling expenses, and a round price for documents. Within a few months the needy man in clover pocketed many hundreds of pounds. Only the author of the history of Jonathan Wild the Great could do justice to such a story of the Vagabond in Luck—a jaunt to Lausanne, a trip across the Atlantic, incessant journeys backward and forward to Paris, the jingling of guineas, the rustle of hundred-pound notes, and now and then perhaps a humorous thought of simple and solemn people in newspaper offices in London, or a moment’s meditation on that perplexing law of human affairs by which the weak things (M146) of the world are chosen to confound the things that are mighty.|$|E
