50|$|Although hashish is {{sometimes}} eaten raw or mixed with boiling water, THC and other cannabinoids are more efficiently {{absorbed into the}} bloodstream when combined with butter and other lipids or, less so, dissolved in ethanol. Chocolates, brownies, space cakes, and <b>majoon</b> are popular methods of ingestion. The time to onset of effects depends strongly on stomach content, but is usually 1 to 2 hours, and may continue for a considerable length of time, whereas the effects of smoking or vaporizing cannabis are almost immediate, lasting a shorter length of time.|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis is {{a common}} {{dermatological}} disease affecting up to 1 - 2 % of the world′s population. It is associated with both organic and psychosocial complications like psoriatic arthropathy, nephritis, infection, hyperuricemia, hypoproteinemia, depression, and stress, and is responsible for hindering patients′ daily activities. The present {{study was conducted to}} assess the safety and efficacy of two pharmacopeial Unani formulations (<b>Majoon</b> Ushba and Roghane Hindi) in the management of psoriasis on scientific parameters. Thirty diagnosed psoriasis patients, satisfying the inclusion criteria, were selected for a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study in the Department of Moalajat (Medicine), National Institute of Unani Medicine, Bangalore. The patients were divided by the method of Random Table Numbers into test and control groups after obtaining informed consent. The experimental group comprised 20 patients to whom <b>Majoon</b> Ushba 5 g was administered orally twice daily and Roghane Hindi was applied locally twice daily. The control group comprised 10 patients who were given placebo drugs orally and topically. The duration of the trial was 8 weeks and follow-up was done fortnightly. The severity of psoriasis and efficacy of the drug was assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Scale. The results of both groups were compared and analyzed statistically. The study showed significant reduction in the PASI score in the test group (P < 0. 01) as compared to placebo. No obnoxious side effects were observed in the test group: toxicological parameters were within normal limits even after 2 months of treatment. It was therefore concluded that <b>Majoon</b> Ushba and Roghane Hindi are safe and effective in the management of psoriasi...|$|E
30|$|The Unani {{system of}} {{medicine}} {{is one of}} the commonly practiced treatment methods, which was followed by India and many other countries. As the name indicates, it originated from Greece. This system is {{based on the belief that}} there are four humors present in the human body - blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Every person has a unique humoral constitution, which represents his healthy state. Different types of herbal formulations are used in Unani system such as solid (Qurs, Habbs, Shafoof), semi-solid (Khamira, Itrifal, <b>Majoon),</b> and liquid (Sharbat) preparations (Bilal and Jamal, 2007).|$|E
40|$|Poisoning is a {{frequent}} cause of referral to medical emergencies and a major health problem around the world, especially in developing countries. We aimed to review the epidemiology and pattern of adult poisoning in Iran {{in order to facilitate}} the early diagnosis and management of poisoning. The pattern of poisoning is different in various parts of Iran. Pharmaceutical compounds were {{the most common cause of}} poisoning in most parts of Iran. Pesticide-related toxicities were more common in northern agricultural regions, whereas bites and stings were seen more commonly in southern Iran. Carbon monoxide poisoning was common in cities with many motor vehicles such as Tehran and in colder climates such as in northern and western regions due to inadequately vented gas appliances such as stoves and heaters. <b>Majoon</b> Birjandi (containing cannabis) is a unique substance used in eastern Iran. Poisoning by opioids, tramadol, and pesticides (organophosphate and aluminum phosphide) has remained a common hazard in Iran. Poisoning-associated morbidity and mortality rates vary by region and have changed over time due to the introduction of new drugs and chemicals. Early diagnosis and proper treatment may be lifesaving; thus, understanding the general pattern of poisoning in different regions is important...|$|E
