2500|$|In late 1873 Brooks read King Ren√©'s Daughter, a verse drama by Danish {{poet and}} playwright Henrik Hertz. In the story, the {{character}} of Iolanthe is a princess who is blind, but does not {{understand the nature of}} this condition because her parents had hidden the truth from her. She came to realize that she was blind on her sixteenth birthday. Brooks was inspired by this character, and created a butter sculpture, Dreaming Iolanthe, depicting the innocent girl just before learning the truth. This work was displayed in early 1874 at a Cincinnati gallery, to financial and critical success. During its two-week exhibition, about two thousand people paid admission to view it. An article appearing in The New York Times declared that the [...] "translucence [...] gives to the complexion a richness beyond alabaster and a softness and smoothness that are very striking", and that [...] "no other American sculptress has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> of such angelic gentleness as that of Iolanthe." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the February 16, 2015 {{episode of}} Raw, O'Neil <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> turn and {{reformed}} the Prime Time Players with Darren Young, effectively disbanding Slater Gator. Later that night, Slater stated on social media, [...] "I'm {{going to start}} focusing on ME!!! I'm better on my own... It's about time I get what I deserve," [...] cementing their breakup. Shortly afterwards, Slater debuted a shorter haircut. At WrestleMania 31, Slater competed in the 30-man Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which was won by Big Show. Slater returned to the scenes on the April 20, 2015 edition of Raw {{when he was at}} catering, only to receive an RKO through the table by Randy Orton. On the May 28, 2015 edition of Superstars, Slater picked up a victory against Adam Rose. Slater would appear mostly on Superstars and Main Event losing to the likes of Fandango, Neville, R-Truth, and Zack Ryder. Slater started appearing on Raw, trying to answer John Cena's United States Championship Open Challenge, but was denied each week.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the characters, props, {{and ideas}} in the novel were drawn from Baum's experiences. As a child, Baum {{frequently}} had nightmares of a scarecrow pursuing him across a field. Moments before the scarecrow's [...] "ragged hay fingers" [...] nearly gripped his neck, it would fall apart before his eyes. Decades later, as an adult, Baum integrated his tormentor into the novel as the Scarecrow. According to his son Harry, the Tin Woodman was born from Baum's attraction to window displays. He wished to make something captivating for the window displays, so he used an eclectic assortment of scraps to craft a striking figure. From a washboiler he made a body, from bolted stovepipes he made arms and legs, and {{from the bottom of}} a saucepan he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>face.</b> Baum then placed a funnel hat on the figure, which ultimately became the Tin Woodman. John D. Rockefeller was the nemesis of Baum's father, an oil baron who declined to purchase Standard Oil shares in exchange for selling his own oil refinery. Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz posited that Rockefeller inspired one of the Wizard's numerous faces. In one scene in the novel, the Wizard is seen as a [...] "tyrannical, hairless head". When Rockefeller was 54 years old, the medical condition alopecia caused him to lose every strand of hair on his head, making people fearful of speaking to him.|$|E
