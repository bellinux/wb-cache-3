The Dumbo, whose origins are in the United States, is characterized by having large, low, round ears on the sides of its head, and was named for resemblance to the fictional Dumbo the Elephant. The Manx rat is tailless due to a genetic mutation, and was named for the <b>Manx</b> <b>cat,</b> which shares this feature, though not necessarily due to the same mutation.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Manx</b> <b>cat</b> is a {{breed of}} cat {{noted for its}} genetic {{mutation}} that causes it to have a shortened tail. The length of this tail can range from a few inches, known as a [...] "stumpy", to being completely nonexistent, or [...] "rumpy". Manx cats display a range of colours and usually have somewhat longer hind legs compared to most cats. The cats {{have been used as}} a symbol of the Isle of Man on coins and stamps and at one time the Manx government operated a breeding centre to ensure the continuation of the breed.|$|E

6000|$|... [The {{truth of}} the {{principle}} of prepotency comes out more clearly when distinct races are crossed. The improved Shorthorns, notwithstanding that the breed is comparatively modern, are generally acknowledged to possess great power in impressing their likeness on all other breeds; and it is chiefly in consequence of this power that they are so highly valued for exportation. (14/6. Quoted by Bronn 'Geshichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 170. See Sturm 'Ueber Racen' 1825 s. 104-107. For the niata cattle see my 'Journal of Researches' 1845 page 146.) Godine has given a curious case of a ram of a goat-like breed of sheep from the Cape of Good Hope, which produced offspring hardly to be distinguished from himself, when crossed with ewes of twelve other breeds. But two of these half-bred ewes, when put to a merino ram, produced lambs closely resembling the merino breed. Girou de Buzareingues (14/7. Lucas 'L'Heredite Nat.' tome 2 page 112.) found that of two races of French sheep the ewes of one, when crossed during successive generations with merino rams, yielded up their character far sooner than the ewes of the other race. Sturm and Girou have given analogous cases with other breeds of sheep and with cattle, the prepotency running in these cases through the male side; but I was assured on good authority in South America, that when niata cattle are crossed with common cattle, though the niata breed is prepotent whether males or females are used, yet that the prepotency is strongest through the female line. The <b>Manx</b> <b>cat</b> is tailless and has long hind legs; Dr. Wilson crossed a male Manx with common cats, and, out of twenty-three kittens, seventeen were destitute of tails; but when the female Manx was crossed by common male cats all the kittens had tails, though they were generally short and imperfect.

5000|$|... "Manx syndrome" [...] or [...] "Manxness" [...] is a colloquial name {{given to}} the {{condition}} which results when the tailless gene shortens the spine too much. It can seriously damage the spinal cord and the nerves, causing a form of spina bifida, as well as problems with the bowels, bladder, and digestion. Very small bladders are indicative of the disease, and {{it is often difficult}} to diagnose. Death can occur quite suddenly, and some live for only 3-4 years; the oldest recorded was 5 years when affected with the disease. In one report, it was shown to affect about 30% of <b>Manx</b> <b>cats</b> studied, but nearly all of those cases were rumpies, which exhibit the most extreme phenotype. Such problems can be avoided by breeding rumpy <b>Manx</b> <b>cats</b> with stumpy specimens, and this breeding practice is responsible for a decline in spinal problems among modern, professionally bred <b>Manx</b> <b>cats</b> today. Most pedigreed cats are not placed until four months of age (to make sure that they are properly socialised) and this usually also gives adequate time for any such health problems to be identified. Feline expert Roger Tabor has stated: [...] "Only the fact that the Manx is a historic breed stops us being as critical of this dangerous gene as of other more recent selected abnormalities." ...|$|R

50|$|Since Manx kittens are {{naturally}} born with any tail length, from none to long, it was formerly common to surgically dock the longer tails {{a few days}} after birth. Although illegal in many jurisdictions today (including much of Europe), the practice was formerly recommended, although with the caveat that the commonness of the practice meant that many spurious <b>Manx</b> <b>cats</b> - i.e., random British cats - were altered to resemble the Manx, to defraud unwary buyers.|$|R

50|$|The Manx taillessness gene is {{dominant}} and highly penetrant; kittens from two Manx parents are generally born without any tail. Being homozygous for (having two copies of) the gene is usually lethal in utero, resulting in miscarriage. Thus, tailless cats can carry only one {{copy of the}} gene. Because {{of the danger of}} having two copies of the taillessness gene, breeders avoid breeding two entirely tailless <b>Manx</b> <b>cats</b> together. Because neither parent carries the tailless allele, a fully tailed Manx bred to another fully tailed Manx results in all fully tailed kittens.|$|R

On Isle of Man currency, Manx cats are the subject of the reverse of four special {{commemorative}} crown coins. The first two, issued in 1970 and 1975, are stand-alone releases in both copper-nickel and silver proofs, while the third, in 1988, inaugurated an ongoing series of annual cat coin issues that have also been produced in gold in various sizes; an almost-hidden <b>Manx</b> <b>cat</b> appears in the background on each of the 1989-onward releases featuring other breeds. A Manx, with a kitten, was the featured cat again in 2012. A <b>Manx</b> <b>cat,</b> in stylized Celtic knotwork art, also appears on the island's 1980 - 83 penny. The breed figures on numerous Isle of Man postage stamps, including a 2011 series of six that reproduce the art from Victorian era <b>Manx</b> <b>cat</b> postcards, a 1996 one-stamp decorative sheetlet, one stamp in a 1994 tourism 10-stamp booklet, a 1996 five-stamp series of Manx cats around the world, and a 1989 set of the breed in various coat patterns, plus two high-value definitives of 1983 and 1989.

Curly-furred <b>Manx</b> <b>cats</b> were all traceable to an outcross mating (to widen the Manx gene pool) in Australia which used a cream Persian male from European bloodlines.

5000|$|Regardless of coat length, the colours {{and coat}} {{patterns}} {{occurring in the}} breed today run the gamut of virtually all breeds due to extensive cross-breeding, though not all registries may accept all coats as qualifying for breeding or show. The most common coats are tabby, tortoiseshell, calico and solid colours. Widely divergent Manx specimens, including even a colour-point, blue-eyed, long-haired variant of evident Himalayan ancestry, have been celebrated on Isle of Man postage stamps since the 1980s, and recent publications often show marbled and spotted varieties. The original insular stock, however, were of less widespread variation. Lane, having [...] "seen {{a great many of}} them" [...] wrote of <b>Manx</b> <b>cats</b> that [...] "it is curious that the colours in this variety seem somewhat limited" [...] and that the breed [...] "does not comprise all the colours usually associated with other short-haired varieties". He reported only very common black, common black and white, common grey-striped tabby, uncommon tortoiseshell, and very rare all-white specimens in 1903. Calico and point-coloured are notably absent from this list, as are even today's common colourful tabbies. However, writing in England only five years later, Barton suggested that [...] "the Manx may be of any colour, but probably black is the most frequently met with." [...] According to CFA, entirely white <b>Manx</b> <b>cats</b> still remain extremely rare. In some cases, white Manx may be worth over US$4,000.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} cat breeds, the cat fancy has arrived through {{observation}} {{at a variety}} of widely held generalisations about the Manx breed as a whole. The Manx is considered a social and gregarious cat, and very attached to humans, but also shy of strangers. The breed is said to be highly intelligent, playful, and in its behaviour reminiscent of dogs. For example, like some Maine Coons and a few other breeds, <b>Manx</b> <b>cats</b> often learn to fetch small thrown objects. They may also follow their owners about like puppies, and are believed to be better able to learn simple verbal commands than most cats.|$|R
