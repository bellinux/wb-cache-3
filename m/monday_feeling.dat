Even though she knew Pete was {{probably}} not terribly suc-cessful, all she could think about was how sexy he was and how lucky she was to have met him. Filled with thoughts of seeing him that evening, and wear-ing her lucky bronze-colored sling back heels, she barely noticed Janice pop into her doorway before having a chance to turn her computer on. “It’s 9 : 15. You’re always here right at 8 : 00. I was concerned. A little bit longer and I would have called you just to make sure you were ok. ” Considering they had almost no relationship what-soever, she wondered why Janice was feigning thi...|$|E

The reason I {{selected}} Bodfish this week, though I was practically engaged to a man named Stevenson who lives out in Connecticut, was that I felt rundown and needed a real rest. I shall be all right on Monday." ...|$|R

5000|$|Two {{months before}} {{composing}} this first component part of Montag aus Licht, Stockhausen said: I {{have had the}} feeling {{for some time that}} Monday will be very different—very new for me too, because I have the <b>feeling</b> <b>Monday</b> is the reverse, because it's the birth. So it's the reverse of everything that I have done up to now. Most probably all the formulas will be upside-down, will be mirrored: like The Woman is in respect to the men. I think all the structural material all of a sudden is going to change drastically in the detail.|$|R

A reviewer from music website 13th Geek compared the track to her song [...] "Hands on Me", explaining in a further detailed review; [...] "The song evokes a summer feel similar to 'Hands On Me' but with a more relaxed and laid-back approach." [...] Patrick St. Michel, writing for The Japan Times, included the track {{as part of a}} discussion about the Westernized music influences throughout the entirety of Feel, stating [...] "nearly every track indulges in electronic trends, sometimes besting the American competition." [...] Michael McCarthy from Otakudx.com believed that the song's composition was [...] "progressive pop", saying [...] "It's not quite a dance song and it doesn't fit your traditional pop mold either." [...] In a detail review, he further explained the song's melody and structure:"It starts off with a bit of keyboards that lead to a series of rapid but somewhat quiet beats over which she sings softly, almost whispering, until she reaches the chorus and fulminating beats drop. [...] "What is life?" [...] she asks during the bilingual chorus, which simply ends with the word [...] "contrail." [...] After the chorus the beats quiet down again and she once again whisper-sings. It's really quite intoxicating, the way her airy vocals gently glide over the hypnotic but subtle beats. [...] "I didn't know then, what I know now," [...] a loud, robotic voice sings -- well, it's more like it just says the words about two thirds into the song. And that somehow makes it more intense when Namie sings the chorus again and asks [...] "What is life?"Lyrically, it is a self-empowerment anthem that discusses themes of confidence and hope.
