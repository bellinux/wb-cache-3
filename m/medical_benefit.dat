5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear <b>medical</b> <b>benefit</b> relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that 7–10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full <b>medical</b> <b>benefit</b> from taking tamoxifen due to their unique genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of deliberate cranial deformation or flattening {{is well documented}} among the pre-Columbian Maya peoples, and is evidenced from the Preclassic era onwards. By the use of cradleboards and other compression techniques applied to the growing skull from infancy, a variety of head-shapes were fashioned, with different regions and time-periods exhibiting a difference in style and ideal. The practice was applied to both males and females, and was not thought to be particularly associated with class or social standing. It was widely adopted however, {{to the point where}} one particular study which examined over 1,500 skulls drawn from across the Maya region determined that at least 88% exhibited some form of intentional cranial deformation. These practices have no known therapeutic value although they may have been intertwined with the expression of Maya cultural values, beliefs and identity. It is argued by some scholars in the field such as Vera Tiesler, that trepanation among the Maya was also imbued with a culturally-significant meaning apart from any <b>medical</b> <b>benefit.</b>|$|E
30|$|We create {{alternative}} {{indicators of}} informality for robustness. The first alternative definition combines self-employed workers and salaried workers. Under this definition, formal workers are those with <b>medical</b> <b>benefits,</b> or, if no information on <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> is available, those whose firm size {{is greater than}} 20, government workers, {{and those in the}} military. Self-employed workers, casual workers, workers without <b>medical</b> <b>benefits,</b> and workers whose firm size is less than 20 and for whom we do not have information on <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> are coded as informal. The second alternative definition of informality does not include information on <b>medical</b> <b>benefits,</b> so we use only firm size and separate workers into three categories: salaried formal, salaried informal, and self-employed workers. The third definition assumes all self-employed workers and workers in firms smaller than 100 employees are informal. The last alternative definition uses information on <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> only. Workers reporting <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> are coded as formal, while those without <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> are informal; we define as missing the formality status of workers for whom information on <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> is not available. This last definition is the most restrictive and has the largest fraction of missing values.|$|R
30|$|We {{construct}} our preferred indicator for informality using {{a combination}} of <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> and firm size. The availability of <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> best captures the concept of formality as firms complying with regulations. However, we do not always observe whether <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> are available in the data, so we supplement the informality definition based on <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> with a definition based on firm size. Indeed, lack of social benefits and small firm size {{have been shown to be}} correlated in other developing countries (Perry et al., 2007).|$|R
50|$|One main {{challenge}} {{to the implementation of}} MHPAEA is what is known as “carve-out” health benefits. This refers to mental health benefits that are purchased by employers separately from <b>medical</b> <b>benefits.</b> The “carve-out” vendor may be separate from any number of other vendors providing <b>medical</b> <b>benefits.</b> The law would require the “carve-out” vendor to ensure parity with <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> provided by a separate vendor or vendors. In addition, the legislation itself did not create a mechanism to regularly monitor or evaluate the enforcement or implementation of the act.|$|R
500|$|There is {{a long-running}} and {{vigorous}} debate over ethical concerns regarding circumcision, particularly neonatal circumcision for {{reasons other than}} intended direct <b>medical</b> <b>benefit.</b> There are three parties involved in the decision to circumcise a minor: the minor as the patient, the parents (or other guardians) and the physician. [...] The physician is bound under the ethical principles of beneficence (promoting well-being) and non-maleficence ("first, do no harm"), and so is charged with the responsibility to promote {{the best interests of the}} patient while minimizing unnecessary harms. Those involved must weigh the factors of what is in the best interest of the minor against the potential harms of the procedure.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Britain {{moved to}} a nationalized health care system, and so looked to ensure that each medical {{procedure}} covered by the new system was cost-effective and the procedure for non-medical reasons was {{not covered by the}} national healthcare system. Douglas Gairdner's 1949 article [...] "The Fate of the Foreskin" [...] argued that the evidence available at that time showed that the risks outweighed the known benefits. Circumcision rates dropped in Britain and in the rest of Europe. In the 1970s, national medical associations in Australia and Canada issued recommendations against routine infant circumcision, leading to drops in the rates of both of those countries. The United States made similar statements in the 1970s, but stopped short of recommending against it — simply stating that it has no <b>medical</b> <b>benefit.</b> Since then they have amended their policy statements several times with the current recommendation being that the benefits outweigh the risks, but they do not recommend it routinely.|$|E
500|$|Many {{guidelines}} and testing procedures have strict procedures for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals {{to decide when}} and how to receive their results and also to whom the results are made available. Financial institutions and businesses are faced with the question of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as for life insurance or employment. The United Kingdom's insurance companies have agreed that until 2017 they will not use genetic information when writing insurance policies under , but Huntington's is explicitly excluded from this agreement. [...] As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no <b>medical</b> <b>benefit</b> for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under legal age who is not judged to be competent is considered unethical in most cases.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Family and intergenerational {{perspectives}} {{might contribute}} {{to a better understanding}} of why young people in many European countries experience work impairment and end up being dependent on public benefits for life sustenance. The aim of this cohort study was to explore the relationship between the receipt of <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> in parents and their young adult offspring and the contributions of family health and family socioeconomic status. Methods: Baseline information on the health of 7597 adolescents and their parents who participated in the HUNT Study 1995 - 1997 was linked to national registers to identify long-term receipt of <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> for parents (1992 - 1997) and adolescents as they entered adulthood (1998 - 2008). We used logistic regression to explore the association between parent and offspring receipt of <b>medical</b> <b>benefits,</b> adjusting for family health and socioeconomic status. Results: Among adolescents, 13 % received <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> from age 20 - 29. Adolescents whose parents had received <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> (26 %) were more likely to receive such benefits themselves from age 20 - 29 compared with adolescents without benefit-receiving parents (age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2. 16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 86 - 2. 49). Adjustment for family health reduced this estimate considerably (to OR 1. 66, 95 % CI 1. 38 - 1. 99), whereas adjustment for family socioeconomic status had less impact. Conclusions: Adolescents whose parents receive <b>medical</b> <b>benefits</b> enter adult working life with an elevated risk of health-related work exclusion. Family health vulnerability appears to be a key to understanding this association, suggesting that more attention to intergenerational continuities of health could be a way to prevent welfare dependence in future generations. status: publishe...|$|R
