40|$|The recent {{comprehensive}} review of <b>Maccoa</b> <b>Duck</b> Oxyura maccoa biology by Clark (1964) has provlded the first detailed summary of the species 2 ̆ 7 reproductive behaviour patterns {{and other aspects of}} breeding in this little-studied stiff-tail. It has been evident that the evolutionary relationships of the <b>Maccoa</b> <b>Duck</b> to the other southern hemisphere stiff-tails and the northern species of Oxyura are still uncertain at best, as evidenced by the varied taxonomic treatment that the Maccoa has received from Delacour and Mayr (1945), who regarded it as a race of O. australis, from Boetticher (1952), who consldered it as a race of O. jamaicensis, and from Delacour (1959), who finally concluded that it represents a distinct species. There {{can be little doubt that}} the last approach is most realistic, but the question still remains as to which of the other species of Oxyura the Maccoa is most closely related. In 1961 I suggested that the Argentine Ruddy Duck O. vittata, the Australian Blue-billed Duck O. australis and the <b>Maccoa</b> <b>Duck</b> comprised an evolutionary group distinct from the other forms of Oxyura. Additional evidence supporting this view has since been summarized (Johnsgard 1967), when a comparison of male display patterns of the stiff-tails was undertaken. This survey was an admittedly preliminary one, since the author had never had an opportunity to study the displays of certain stiff-tails, including the Maccoa, and published descriptions were necessarily relied upon. Recently, unpublished notes, cine films, and other information on the Maccoa had been made available, and it has become increasingly apparent that the Maccoa is a species of unusual interest...|$|E
40|$|Black-headed Duck Masked Duck Ruddy Duck White-headed Duck <b>Maccoa</b> <b>Duck</b> Argentine Blue-billed Duck Australian Blue-billed Duck Musk Duck The stiff-tailed ducks are {{characterized}} by several unusual features {{in addition to their}} long, stiffened tail feathers that serve as underwater rudders. Among other adaptations are their very large feet, which are placed so far back on the body that it is difficult for these birds to walk on land. The body feathers are small, numerous, and have a grebe-like sheen, and the wings are so short that takeoff and flight is attained with difficulty. All of the species have relatively short and thick necks, which in males can be enlarged by the inflation of various internal structures during sexual display. Although all of the species exhibit some dimorphism of size or coloration, the plumage patterns are mostly shades of gray, ruddy brown, and black, with contrasting white markings largely limited to the head. Only one species, the masked duck, exhibits a distinct speculum, and this species is furthermore the only one that is able to attain flight easily. The downy plumage patterns are usually very {{similar to those of the}} adult females, which tend to be inconspicuously patterned with grays and browns. Nonbreeding plumages of males also closely resemble those of the females, and during this period the ruddy coloration of the typical forms is largely lost, as is the unusual blue color of the male 2 ̆ 7 s bill. Two species that do not fit this general pattern are the Australian musk duck and the South American black-headed duck. The musk duck may readily be considered a typical stiff tail that, under evolutionary pressures associated with a highly competitive mating system favoring strength and aggressiveness, has become remarkably large and has evolved bizarre male displays. However, the black-headed duck lacks many of the traits of the stiff-tailed ducks, and in many anatomical features more closely approaches the dabbling ducks. In addition to providing an apparent evolutionary link with that group, the black-headed duck is also the only species of Anatidae that seems to have become a total social parasite, abandoning its nest-building tendencies in favor of dropping its eggs in the nests of a variety of host species. In this sense it is one of the most specialized of all waterfowl species, although its parasitic adaptations are relatively primitive by comparison with those of some of the better-known species of social parasites...|$|E
