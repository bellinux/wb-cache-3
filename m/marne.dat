5|$|By {{the end of}} the Marne-Rheims offensive, the German {{manpower}} advantage {{had been}} spent and their supplies and troops were exhausted. The Allied general, General Ferdinand Foch, ordered a counteroffensive which led to the Second Battle of the <b>Marne,</b> after which victory he was promoted to Marshal of France. The Germans, recognising their untenable position, withdrew from the <b>Marne</b> to the north. Foch now tried to move the Allies back onto the offensive.|$|E

30|$|Because of its marls, the <b>Marnes</b> à Septaria is {{much more}} {{radioactive}} than the limestone, and the signal therefore increases directly at the transition to this formation. This unit and the <b>Marnes</b> à Ovoïdes are composed of blackish calcareous silty clays. A huge fracture zone (potentially a fault) affecting the <b>Marnes</b> à Ovoïdes is present in both wells (separated by 493  m). The thickness of this unit at Soultz-sous Forêts is therefore thinner than it is regionally.|$|R

5|$|In 1927, viticultural {{boundaries}} of Champagne were legally defined and split into five wine producing districts- The Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la <b>Marne.</b> This area covers 33,500 hectares (76,000 acres) of vineyards around 319 villages that {{are home to}} 5,000 growers who make their own wine and 14,000 growers who only sell grapes. The region is set to expand to include 359 villages in the near future.|$|E

From February to July, 1918, the German Army launched four major offensives, attempting to secure victory before the full American forces could be mobilized. The final offensive, started in July 1918, {{was an attempt to}} cross the <b>Marne,</b> in the area of Château-Thierry, but I Corps and other formations on the American lines held, and the attack was rebuffed.|$|E

Legislation was proposed in 2006 to license a repository by 2015, with operations expected in 2025.|$|E
5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the <b>Marne</b> départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
5|$|During its {{deployment}} to Iraq, {{the brigade}} undertook many responsibilities, including providing logistics for airdrops and major combat operations including Operation <b>Marne</b> Torch.

The brigade also dispatched optometry teams to soldiers {{in the region to}} ensure they had all the eyesight testing they needed.

5|$|The {{first day}} of the attack was a success, but on the second day, the Germans were {{reinforced}} with heavier weapons and were able to blunt the attack, inflicting high casualties. The force was successful despite heavy casualties, and German forces were forced to retreat. On 1 August, the corps arrived in the Vesle area near the <b>Marne</b> River, where it assumed command of the 3rd Division, 28th Division, and 32nd Division from the French XXXVIII Corps, placing side-by side with the U.S. I Corps for a few days. Troops continued to advance until September when they withdrew to form the new First United States Army.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914 he {{travelled}} to France as {{a mechanic}} with 3 Squadron after war was declared, which followed the German invasion of Belgium. It operated as a reconnaissance unit and McCudden began to fly as an observer. After stopping at Amiens for several days, the unit began reconnoitering enemy positions. 3 Squadron offered {{support to the}} British Army at the Battle of Mons in Belgium. That month McCudden saw his first German aircraft on 22 August. On 25 August the British began their retreat, south-west, toward Paris. 3 Squadron moved to no fewer than nine different landing grounds, often delaying departure until the enemy was only {{a mile or two}} behind. Eventually they settled at Melun, south of Paris. In the autumn, McCudden participated in locating German artillery positions as the Allied armies drove back the enemy at the First Battle of the <b>Marne</b> and First Battle of the Aisne. McCudden flew these missions with a rifle since aircraft lacked any fixed armament.|$|E

5|$|Mobilisation {{began at}} the onset of the war, in August 1914, at which time the 1st King's was based at Aldershot. Under command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.S. Bannatyne, the 1st King's boarded the SS Irrawaddy at Southampton. The {{battalion}} landed at Le Havre on 13 August with the 6th Brigade, 2nd Division, one of the original components of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The BEF first engaged the German Army at Mons, Belgium, after which it went into a retreat that was sustained until 5 September, when the Allies resolved to stand at the <b>Marne,</b> a river east of Paris. Having acted as a rearguard to the 2nd Division, the 1st King's and its brigade prevented a German force cutting off the 4th (Guards) Brigade, forming the rearguard at Villers-Cotteréts, and 70th Battery, Royal Field Artillery. The brigade extricated the guns, earning it praise from the 2nd Division's commanding officer, Major-General Monro.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} Paris, Banker {{and her team}} were posted to the {{headquarters}} of the Advance Section in Chaumont sur Haute <b>Marne,</b> which was then the headquarters of General John J. Pershing. Five months later, Baker was asked to move to the war front, to the First Army headquarters at Ligny-en-Barrois, south of Saint-Mihiel. On 25 August 1918, she moved to the war front with only five operators helping her. For this operation at Saint-Mihiel, Banker had to make a choice of the best operators for the job, she selected: Suzanne Prevot, Esther Fresnel, Helen Hill, Berthe Hunt, and Marie Lange. Equipped with gas masks and helmets, the women operated from trenches where the danger was real; despite this, those not chosen to go felt left out.|$|E
