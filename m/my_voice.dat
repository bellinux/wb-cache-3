5|$|The {{background}} vocals are {{an important}} part of the picture for me. That's why I like to do them myself a lot of the time, or initially I'll lay down the tracks. I'll double <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> or do a couple of tracks of my own voice. It's easy for me to match <b>my</b> <b>voice.</b> And then if I'm going to use other background singers, I'll let them go on top of mine.|$|E
5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took {{the easy way out}} and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E

25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

[...] Her husband was originally to give the address but he felt that she should do it; she later recalled, [...] "At that moment, it was not that I found <b>my</b> <b>voice.</b> Instead, it was as if <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> found me." [...] Her words summarized one of the goals and moral rationales of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and it became one of the more famous speeches of his administration. In May 2002, she made a speech to the people of Afghanistan through Radio Liberty. [...] In March 2005, she made the first of three trips to that country as First Lady.|$|E

500|$|According to musicologist Leonid Sabaneyev, Tchaikovsky was not {{comfortable}} with being recorded for posterity and tried {{to shy away from}} it.

500|$|Four years later, the children's father [...] "came to Stamps without warning" [...] and {{returned}} {{them to their}} mother's care in St. Louis. [...] At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told {{the rest of their}} family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. [...] Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. [...] Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing, as she stated, [...] "I thought, <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. [...] And then I thought I would never speak again, because <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> would kill anyone..." [...] According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.|$|E
500|$|Del Rey {{stated the}} use of her lower vocals on the tracks {{claiming}} that [...] "people weren't taking me very seriously, so I lowered <b>my</b> <b>voice,</b> believing that it would help me stand out. Now I sing quite low... well, for a female anyway." [...] The singer's first singles, [...] "Video Games" [...] and [...] "Born to Die" [...] were described variously as [...] "quasi-cabaret balladry", [...] "woozy and sometimes soporific soundtrack soul", [...] "pop", and [...] "indie pop".|$|E

And you know, just the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And I love the way it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E
