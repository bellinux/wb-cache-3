He does this for each photon he receives, recording the time, measurement basis used and <b>measurement</b> <b>result.</b> After Bob has measured all the photons, he communicates with Alice over the public classical channel. Alice broadcasts the basis each photon was sent in, and Bob the basis each was measured in. They both discard photon measurements (bits) where Bob used a different basis, which is half on average, leaving half the bits as a shared key.|$|E
2500|$|In quantum mechanics, {{energy of}} a quantum system is {{described}} by a self-adjoint (or Hermitian) operator called the Hamiltonian, which acts on the Hilbert space (or a space of wave functions) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the <b>measurement</b> <b>result</b> does not change in time over the [...] evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum Noether's theorem for energy-momentum tensor operator. Note that {{due to the lack}} of the (universal) time operator in quantum theory, the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, and merely holds in specific cases (see Uncertainty principle). Energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{paradox is}} that a {{measurement}} made on either of the particles apparently collapses {{the state of the}} entire entangled system—and does so instantaneously, before any information about the <b>measurement</b> <b>result</b> could have been communicated to the other particle (assuming that information cannot travel faster than light) and hence assured the [...] "proper" [...] outcome of the measurement of {{the other part of the}} entangled pair. In the Copenhagen interpretation, the result of a spin measurement on one of the particles is a collapse into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is taken to be random, with each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated. This means that the random outcome of the measurement made on one particle seems to have been transmitted to the other, so that it can make the [...] "right choice" [...] when it too is measured.|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the current {{division}} between field sampling and chemical analysis is counterproductive in terms of ensuring that geochemical <b>measurement</b> <b>results</b> are fit for their intended purpose. An integrated approach to the whole measurement process has many advantages including no dependence on the two assumptions that either the samples are necessarily representative if taken with a correct protocol, or that the <b>measurement</b> <b>results</b> can be assumed to be true values of chemical concentration. The <b>measurement</b> <b>results</b> then require values of measurement uncertainty, including that from sampling {{as well as from}} chemical analysis. This enables the user of the <b>measurement</b> <b>results,</b> rather than the producer, to judge their fitness for a specific purpose. Case studies are used to illustrate the practicality and benefits of this new approach, including the use of <b>measurement</b> <b>results</b> with optimal, but relatively high, levels of uncertainty to make reliable decisions. This contrasts with the traditional assumption that pursuit of the lowest possible measurement uncertainty is the best approach...|$|R
