5|$|After {{being as}} many as 13 games out of first place at the {{beginning}} of August, the Mariners <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> late-season comeback that, coupled with a late-season collapse by the California Angels, forced a tiebreaker between the two teams. The Mariners won the tiebreaker, 91, winning their first division title and postseason trip in franchise history.|$|E

5|$|In the 1850s, some tenant farmers formed {{associations}} {{to demand}} the three Fs: fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale.

They <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> demonstration against a local landlord in Irishtown and succeeded in getting him to lower his rents.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Marine Provisional Brigade, in {{conjunction}} with Task Force Hill, <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni on August 17. At first tenacious North Korean defense halted the Marines' push. The North Koreans then <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> counterattack following this in hopes of pushing the Marines back, but this failed disastrously. By nightfall on August 18, the North Korean 4th Division had been nearly annihilated and Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by US forces. The next day, {{the remains of the}} 4th Division withdrew completely across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left a large number of artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans used.|$|E

5|$|The Belgians began {{mobilisation}} on 25 August 1939 and by May 1940 <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> field army of 18 infantry divisions, {{two divisions}} of partly motorised Chasseurs Ardennais and two motorised cavalry divisions, a force totaling some 600,000 men. Belgian reserves {{may have been}} able to field 900,000 men. The army lacked armour and anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|The NK 4th Division {{had in the}} {{meantime}} constructed underwater bridges of sandbags, logs and rocks, finishing the first one the day before. It moved trucks and heavy artillery across the river over this bridge, as well as additional infantry and a few tanks. By the morning of 10 August close to two full North Korean regiments were across the river and occupying fortified positions. After a series of unsuccessful counterattacks, the threat to Yongsan necessitated more U.S. reinforcements. As U.S. casualties <b>mounted,</b> <b>a</b> frustrated Walker ordered the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the area. They <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni beginning at 08:00 on 17 August, unleashing all available heavy weapons: artillery, mortars, M26 Pershing tanks, and airstrikes.|$|E

5|$|A second {{expedition}} {{was mounted}} shortly thereafter, and Throsby's nephew Charles Throsby Smith, Wild and Vaughan further explored the Molonglo (Ngambri) and Queanbeyan (Jullergung) Rivers, {{becoming the first}} Europeans to camp at the site. However, they failed to find the Murrumbidgee, and Smith declared that the river did not exist. The issue of the Murrumbidgee was solved in 1821, when Charles Throsby <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> third expedition and successfully reached the watercourse, on the way providing the first detailed account of the land where Canberra now resides.|$|E
5|$|A ship of {{the line}} was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> battery of up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades. The ship {{of the line}} {{developed}} gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of line of battle tactics in the early 17th century {{and the end of}} the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.|$|E
5|$|After an unopposed landing, a mixed {{force of}} German reservists and half-trained Melanesian police <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> stout {{resistance}} {{and forced the}} Australians to fight {{their way to the}} objective. After a day of fighting during which both sides suffered casualties, Australian forces captured the wireless station at Bita Paka. The battle was Australia's first major military engagement of the war and the only significant action of the campaign; in its aftermath the remaining German forces on New Britain fled inland to Toma. Following a brief siege there the German garrison capitulated, ending resistance to the Australian occupation of the island.|$|E

5|$|Amid {{rumors that}} the team would be sold and/or relocated, the Mariners—who had had only two winning seasons (1991 and 1993) since {{beginning}} play in 1977—mounted a late-season comeback in 1995 to clinch their first postseason appearance in franchise history. They then <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit to force a deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, and finally a one-run 11th inning deficit that was overcome by the Double.|$|E
5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers <b>mounted</b> <b>a</b> torpedo {{attack against}} the rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine.|$|E
