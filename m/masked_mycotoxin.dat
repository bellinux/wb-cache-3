40|$|Masked mycotoxins" senso strictu are conjugates of mycotoxins {{resulting}} from metabolic pathways activated by {{the interplay between}} pathogenic fungi and infected plants. Zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin produced by Fusarium spp, was the first <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxin</b> ever described in the literature, but its biotransformation has been studied {{to a lesser extent}} if compared to other compounds such as deoxynivalenol. We presented herein the first application of organ and tissue culture techniques to study the metabolic fate of zearalenone in durum wheat, using an untargeted HR-LCMS approach. A complete, quick absorption of zearalenone by uninfected plant organs was noticed, and its biotransformation into a large spectrum of phase I and phase II metabolites has been depicted. Therefore, wheat organ tissue cultures can be effectively used as a biocatalytic tool for the production of masked mycotoxins, as well as a replicable model for the investigation of the interplay between mycotoxins and wheat physiology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDeoxynivalenol- 3 -β-d-glucoside (D 3 G), a plant phase II {{metabolite}} of the Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), {{occurs in}} naturally contaminated wheat, maize, oat, barley and products thereof. Although {{considered as a}} detoxification product in plants, the toxicity of this substance in mammals is currently unknown. A major concern is the possible hydrolysis of the D 3 G conjugate back to its toxic precursor mycotoxin DON during mammalian digestion. We used in vitro model systems to investigate the stability of D 3 G to acidic conditions, hydrolytic enzymes and intestinal bacteria, mimicking different stages of digestion. D 3 G was found resistant to 0. 2 M hydrochloric acid for at least 24 h at 37 °C, suggesting {{that it will not}} be hydrolyzed in the stomach of mammals. While human cytosolic β-glucosidase also had no effect, fungal cellulase and cellobiase preparations could cleave a significant portion of D 3 G. Most importantly, several lactic acid bacteria such as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus mundtii or Lactobacillus plantarum showed a high capability to hydrolyze D 3 G. Taken together these data indicate that D 3 G is of toxicological relevance and should be regarded as a <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Glycosylation is an {{important}} plant defense mechanism and conjugates of Fusarium mycotoxins often co-occur with their parent compounds in cereal-based food and feed. In case of deoxynivalenol (DON), deoxynivalenol- 3 -O-β-D-glucoside (D 3 G) {{is the most important}} <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxin.</b> The toxicological significance of D 3 G is not yet fully understood so that it is crucial to obtain this compound in pure and sufficient quantities for toxicological risk assessment and for use as an analytical standard. The aim of this study was the biochemical characterization of a DON-inactivating UDP-glucosyltransferase from rice (OsUGT 79) and to investigate its suitability for preparative D 3 G synthesis. Apparent Michaelis constants (Km) of recombinant OsUGT 79 were 0. 23 mM DON and 2. 2 mM UDP-glucose. Substrate inhibition occurred at DON concentrations above 2 mM (Ki = 24 mM DON), and UDP strongly inhibited the enzyme. Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + (1 mM) inhibited the enzyme completely. Sucrose synthase AtSUS 1 was employed to regenerate UDP-glucose during the glucosylation reaction. With this approach, optimal conversion rates can be obtained at limited concentrations of the costly co-factor UDP-glucose. D 3 G can now be synthesized in sufficient quantity and purity. Similar strategies may be of interest to produce β-glucosides of other toxins...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to give a {{comprehensive}} overview of the current knowledge on plant metabolites of <b>mycotoxins,</b> also called <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins.</b> Mycotoxins are secondary fungal metabolites, toxic to human and animals. Toxigenic fungi often grow on edible plants, thus contaminating food and feed. Plants, as living organisms, can alter the chemical structure of mycotoxins {{as part of their}} defence against xenobiotics. The extractable conjugated or non-extractable bound mycotoxins formed remain present in the plant tissue but are currently neither routinely screened for in food nor regulated by legislation, thus they may be considered <b>masked.</b> Fusarium <b>mycotoxins</b> (deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins, nivalenol, fusarenon-X, T- 2 toxin, HT- 2 toxin, fusaric acid) are prone to metabolisation or binding by plants, but transformation of other mycotoxins by plants (ochratoxin A, patulin, destruxins) has also been described. Toxicological data are scarce, but several studies highlight the potential threat to consumer safety from these substances. In particular, the possible hydrolysis of <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins</b> back to their toxic parents during mammalian digestion raises concerns. Dedicated chapters of this article address plant metabolism as well as the occurrence of <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins</b> in food, analytical aspects for their determination, toxicology and their impact on stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|<b>Masked</b> <b>mycotoxins</b> are plant {{metabolites}} of mycotoxins which co-contaminate common cereal crops. Since their discovery, {{the question}} has arisen if they contribute to toxicity {{either directly or indirectly}} through the release of the parent mycotoxins. Research in this field is rapidly emerging and the aim of this review is to summarize the latest knowledge on the fate of <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins</b> upon ingestion. Fusarium mycotoxins are the most prevalent <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins</b> and evidence is mounting that DON 3 Glc and possibly other masked trichothecenes are stable in conditions prevailing in the upper gut and are not absorbed intact. DON 3 Glc is also not toxic per se, but is hydrolyzed by colonic microbes and further metabolized to DOM- 1 in some individuals. Masked zearalenone is rather more bio-reactive with some evidence on gastric and small intestinal hydrolysis as well as hydrolysis by intestinal epithelium and components of blood. Microbial hydrolysis of ZEN 14 Glc is almost instantaneous and further metabolism also occurs. Identification of zearalenone metabolites and their fate in the colon are still missing as is further clarification on whether or not masked zearalenone is hydrolyzed by mammalian cells. New <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins</b> continuously emerge and it is crucial that we gain detailed understanding of their individual metabolic fate in the body before we can assess synergistic effects and extrapolate the additive risk of all mycotoxins present in food...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{biotransformation}} {{products of}} Zearalenone (ZON), a Fusarium mycotoxin, were elucidated using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

An array of 17 different metabolites, most prominently glucosides, malonylglucosides, dihexose- and hexose-pentose-disaccharides of ZON, α-Zearalenol and β-Zearalenol were detected in the samples. Time courses for the different ZON-metabolites were recorded and give a closer insight into the metabolism kinetic. A scheme proposing the ZON metabolism in A. thaliana is given.

40|$|Maize ear rot {{caused by}} several Fusarium species is an {{important}} fungal disease. Apart from yield losses, ear rot fungi can produce mycotoxins and masked forms in infected grains. Masked mycotoxins have received increased attention in view of their bioavailability and potential toxicity in animals and humans, but their presence and relevance in the field still remain undisclosed. To get a better insight, the present study assessed the presence of various Fusarium parent and masked mycotoxins, i. e. deoxynivalenol, 3 -acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15 -acetyldeoxynivalenol, deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside, zearalenone, alpha-zearalenol, beta-zearalenol, zearalenone- 14 -glucoside, zearalenone- 14 -sulfate, alpha-zearalenol- 14 -glucoside, beta-zearalenol- 14 -glucoside, T- 2 and HT- 2 toxin, in various commercial maize varieties grown under natural infection conditions in Flanders, Belgium. The {{results showed that the}} maize varieties were co-contaminated with both parent and masked mycotoxins. Moreover, a positive correlation between these forms was established. A higher contamination with a particular mycotoxin appeared to be coupled with an elevated load of another (<b>masked)</b> <b>mycotoxin.</b> The results highlight the importance to screen for multiple mycotoxins, both parent and masked, to guarantee food and feed safety. Furthermore, analysis was carried out to elucidate the distribution of the various mycotoxins in the field. The maize variety did not significantly influence mycotoxin accumulation, except for deoxynivalenol. Subdivisions in the field with higher mycotoxin levels for deoxynivalenol and its derivatives, zearalenone and its derivatives, and the sum of T- 2 and HT- 2 toxin were observed...|$|E
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that conjugates (‘masked mycotoxins’) may {{contribute}} to the total daily intake of hazardous mycotoxins. Therefore, there is an urgent need for rapid analysis methods that assess the level of both free and masked mycotoxins in food and feed. However, the analysis of masked mycotoxins by either immunoassays or instrumental methods, such as liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), is severely hindered by the lack of standards and the unpredictable cross-reactivity profiles of the available antibodies. In this work, 26 enzymes were explored for rapid hydrolysis of masked mycotoxins using deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside (DON- 3 G) as model compound. Following initial screening, the most promising enzyme, a fungal 1, 3 -ß-glucanase (laminarinase), was investigated in detail and found to be fit-for-purpose, providing complete conversions in minutes rather than hours according to LC-MS/MS analyses. As a proof of concept, the enzymatic pretreatment was applied to an extract of beer containing DON- 3 G. In addition, the feasibility of a fully automated enzymatic pretreatment of <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxin</b> standards in an autosampler was demonstrated in an imaging surface plasmon resonance immunoassay set-up. Such an automated pretreatment was found to be equally applicable to other mycotoxin conjugates, as shown by the conversion of zearalenone- 14 -ß-D-glucopyranoside and zearalenone- 14 -sulphate, in the latter case using a sulphatase enzyme. It is envisaged that laminarinase could be useful for other masked mycotoxins as well...|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{metabolism}} of masked or conjugated mycotoxins {{is poorly}} documented as standards are not commercially available and indirect analysis using hydrolytic enzymes {{is difficult to}} validate and cumbersome. We synthesised zearalenone- 14 -glucoside (ZEA- 14 G) chemically. Deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucuronide (DON- 3 GlcA) and glucuronides of 3 - and 15 -acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3 -and 15 -ADON-GlcAs), de-epoxydeoxynivalenol, zearalenone (ZEA), alpha- and beta-zearalenol (alpha- and beta-ZOL) were synthesised using rat microsomes. For the first time three ADON-GlcAs were synthesised: two 3 -ADON-GlcAs and one 15 -ADON-GlcA. After purification, the <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxin</b> and the metabolites were characterised by NMR (DON- 3 GlcA, ZEA- 14 G) or by full scan MS, MS/MS fragmentation, UV-spectra, beta-glucosidase and beta-glucuronidase treatment. In a first experiment, rats were fed orally DON- 3 -glucoside (DON- 3 G) and ZEA- 14 G, together with C- 13 -DON and C- 13 -ZEA and were sacrificed after 55 minutes. A total of 21 masked metabolites, metabolites and parent mycotoxins were quantified in rat organs. Whereas DON- 3 G was hardly hydrolysed in the stomach, ZEA was clearly formed from ZEA- 14 G. In a second experiment, 3 -and 15 -ADON were given orally to rats. The acetylated forms of DON were hydrolysed in the stomach, in contrast to DON- 3 G. Rats can directly glucuronidate ADONs without deacetylation. Neither DOM, alpha-or beta-ZOL nor their glucuronides could be quantified. Glucuronidated 3 -ADON accumulated in the small intestines, together with DON- 3 GlcA in rats fed orally with 3 - and 15 -ADON.

40|$|<b>Masked</b> <b>mycotoxins</b> {{are found}} in grains and derived foods {{as a result of}} plant phase II metabolism. Recently, <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins</b> senso strictu, {{together}} with other covalently or non-covalently conjugated forms, even formed upon processing, have been classified as modified mycotoxins. In this context, the issue of modified fumonisins is of great interest, on account of the wide range of factors affecting their formation and accumulation in maize pre- and postharvest. Fumonisins, indeed, may undergo modification in plants, along the growing season, but also during storage and drying of maize kernels, and upon processing. All these modifications strongly affect the analytical outcome, thus making more difficult the assessment of maize compliance. Since the ratio between free and modified fumonisins is affected by maize composition and environmental factors, a deeper knowledge on the phenomena driving the production and accumulation of free and modified forms in plants may support the selection of resistant hybrids. This review provides a critical picture {{of the state of the}} art on this topic, mainly focusing on those events occurring in field, identified as crucial in determining amount and partitioning of contamination. Nevertheless, knowledge on modified fumonisins is still in its dawn, on account of the wide range of factors involved. Anyway, reported results, taking altogether, clearly indicate that modified fumonisins should be included in the monitoring plans to have an overview of the possible contribution to human exposure. Furthermore, next efforts should focus on the events occurring in field and on the cross-talk between the plant and the fungus, to support the identification of resistant hybrids and to provide dat...|$|R

Acetyl and p -methoxybenzyl protection led to undesired results and were shown to be inappropriate.

Although the absolute structure of T 2 GlcGlc was not clarified, two glucose molecules were suggested to be conjugated at 3 -OH position in tandem when considering the structure of T- 2 toxin. On the other hand, the specification of the structure seems to be more complicated in the case of HT 2 GlcGlc, since HT- 2 toxin has two possible positions (at 3 -OH and 4 -OH) to be glusocylated.

Due {{to a lack}} of in vivo data, D 3 G has not been included in the various regulatory limits established for DON so far. The aim of our study was to contribute to the risk assessment of D 3 G by determination of its metabolism in pigs. Four piglets received water, D 3 G (116 μg/kg b. w.) and the equimolar amount of DON (75 μg/kg b. w.) by gavage on day 1, 5 and 9 of the experiment, respectively. Additionally, 15. 5 μg D 3 G/kg b. w. were administered intravenously on day 13. Urine and feces were collected for 24 h and analyzed for DON, D 3 G, deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucuronide (DON- 3 -GlcA), deoxynivalenol- 15 -GlcA (DON- 15 -GlcA) and deepoxy-deoxynivalenol (DOM- 1) by UHPLC–MS/MS. After oral application of DON and D 3 G, in total 84. 8 ± 9. 7 % and 40. 3 ± 8. 5 % of the given dose were detected in urine, respectively. The majority of orally administered D 3 G was excreted in form of DON, DON- 15 -GlcA, DOM- 1 and DON- 3 -GlcA, while urinary D 3 G accounted for only 2. 6 ± 1. 4 %. In feces, just trace amounts of metabolites were found. Intravenously administered D 3 G was almost exclusively excreted in unmetabolized form via urine. Data indicate that D 3 G is nearly completely hydrolyzed in the intestinal tract of pigs, while the toxin seems to be rather stable after systemic absorption.

The presence of DON was detected and determined in 5 (20 %) maize and 6 (25 %) wheat samples by both of the methods. Correlation between ELISA and HPLC results was established, with the correlation coefficients (r) of 0. 9691 and 0. 9735 for wheat and maize samples, respectively. The results obtained by ELISA method were significantly higher than those obtained by HPLC method. This fact can be explained by the presence of conjugated or <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins</b> in the samples, especially DON- 3 -glucoside (DON- 3 -Glc), which could not be determined by HPLC method due to the lack of external standards.

40|$|The {{development}} of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) /mass spectrometry (MS) methods for the simultaneous detection and quantification {{of a broad}} spectrum of mycotoxins has facilitated the screening of a larger number of samples for contamination with a wide array of less well-known “emerging” mycotoxins and other metabolites. In this study, 83 samples of feed and feed raw materials were analysed. All of them were found to contain seven to 69 metabolites. The total number of detected metabolites amounts to 139.

The selected monoclonal antibodies were tested for their target mycotoxins and for cross-reactivity with relevant metabolites and <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins.</b> In the triplex format, low levels of cross-interactions between the assays occurred at irrelevant high levels only. All three assays were influenced by the sample matrix of cereal extracts to some extent, and matrix-matched calibrations are recommended for quantitative screening purposes.

The triplex assay was critically compared to liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry using reference materials and fortified blank material. Results for the quantification of ochratoxin A and zearalenone were in good agreement. However, the fumonisin assay was, due to overestimation, only suitable for qualitative judgements.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: T- 2 toxin is a {{trichothecene}} mycotoxin produced when Fusarium fungi infect grains, especially {{oats and}} wheat. Ingestion of T- 2 toxin contaminated grain can cause diarrhea, hemorrhaging, and feed refusal in livestock. Cereal crops infected with mycotoxin-producing fungi form toxin glycosides, sometimes called <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins,</b> {{which are a}} potential food safety concern {{because they are not}} detectable by standard approaches and may be converted back to the parent toxin during digestion or food processing. The work reported here addresses four aspects of T- 2 toxin-glucosides: phytotoxicity, stability after ingestion, antibody detection, and the anomericity of the naturally occurring T- 2 toxin-glucoside found in cereal plants. T- 2 toxin-β-glucoside was chemically synthesized and compared to T- 2 toxin-α-glucoside prepared with Blastobotrys muscicola cultures and the T- 2 toxin-glucoside found in naturally contaminated oats and wheat. The anomeric forms were separated chro-matographically and differ in both NMR and mass spectrometry. Both anomers were significantly degraded to T- 2 toxin and HT- 2 toxin under conditions that mimic human digestion, but with different kinetics and metabolic end products. The naturally occurring T- 2 toxin-glucoside from plants was found to be identical to T- 2 toxin-α-glucoside prepared with B. muscicola. An antibody test for the detection of T- 2 toxin was not effective for the detection of T- 2 toxin-α-glucoside. This anomer wa...|$|R
40|$|Several {{preventive}} and {{corrective measures}} to minimize toxin contamination in agricultural commodities particularly by mycotoxins have been attempted. These {{can be divided}} into three broad categories: plant breeding, good agronomic practice and detoxification.. The focus of this current review is the evaluation of agronomic practises aimed to modulate “natural toxins”. In order to identify what is known about the agronomic effects and how they might potentially be manipulated to reduce toxin levels, it is necessary to analyse the relationship between toxins, crops and agricultural practises. In this discussion paper we will deal first with two major food crops (cereals and potatoes) and their food safety. We will then deal with agronomic factors and their effects on different crops, and also on fungal strains, and the occurrence of mycotoxins or the occurrence of inherent toxins on different food crops. Detoxification is considered outside the scope of this review. As starting point the two key food crops in Europe, cereals and potatoes, were selected. The intention was to develop an inventory of the current agronomic practices applied {{in order to reduce the}} concentration of inherent plant toxins and mycotoxins. With respect to food processing only those closely related to harvesting, storage, or domestic food preparation will be considered. Industrial food processing is outside the remit of this paper. Other topics considered include <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins,</b> mycotoxins boundaries and the environmental conditions that influence fungal growth. This review considers different fungal strains, the influence of climate (temperature), growth conditions, toxicity, data gaps and research needs, toxin interaction with other compounds, kinetics, sensitivity of the fungal population and possible polymorphism. Additional topics include the definition and comparison of agronomic factors, the application of plant protection products, hereafter referred to as pesticides, and the occurrence of mycotoxins. Other food crops will be also considered in relation to mycotoxins and inherent toxins and the influence of agronomic factors on the formation of such toxins. These include the mycotoxins, fusarium toxins particularly trichothecenes such as T 2 and HT 2, DON, fusarium toxin, ochratoxins and phenyl hydrazine derivatives (cultivated mushroom) and cyanogenic glycosides (cassava) ...|$|R
40|$|Trichothecenes, as a {{dominant}} group of Fusarium mycotoxins, have received lots of scientific attention {{due to their}} wide contamination of human food and animal feed. Besides native trichothecenes, their conjugated forms the so-called <b>masked</b> <b>mycotoxins,</b> have also been somewhat studied in recent years due to their potential harmful impact. Beer, as one cereal-derived beverage, encounters the threat of trichothecene contamination. During beer fermentation, trichothecenes may be biotransformed into metabolites, which could potentially exert toxicological implications on beer consumers. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the metabolic fate of several major trichothecenes, including T- 2 toxin (T- 2), HT- 2 toxin (HT- 2), deoxynivalenol (DON) and its masked form deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside (D 3 G) during beer fermentation by lager yeast. A four-day fermentation experiment was conducted with four analytes inoculated in 11. 5 °Plato wort at the initial stage of fermentation individually or as a mixture with various concentrations. A reliable and efficient method was developed for the kinetic study of trichothecenes by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry (LC-TQ-MS). After four-day fermentation, an approximate 10 - 40 % decrease of all analytes was observed. The missing trichothecenes were very likely bound with yeast cell wall or biotransformed to their masked forms metabolic reactions. Further identification of the masked metabolites was fulfilled by analysing concentrated samples with liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-Q-Tof-MS). Several putative masked metabolites were annotated, including D 3 G and acetyl-DON in DON-dosed samples, acetyl-T- 2 and HT- 2 in T- 2 -dosed samples and T- 2 / 3 -acetyl-HT- 2 in HT- 2 samples.

The second part description own work dealing digestibility selected mycotoxins was tested in rumen fluid in vitro. The three groups of barley crop with different fungicide treatment were included in the experiment. The first group served as the control one without fungicide treatment. The second group of barley (variant A) was treated with Hutton (0, 8 L/ha at BBCH 36) + Zantar (1, 5 L/ha at BBCH 65). The third group of barley (variant B) was treated with the combination of Hutton (0, 8 L/ha at BBCH 36) + Prosaro EC 250 (0, 75 L/ha at BBCH 65). In the original mass of barely, ten levels of mycotoxins were established. Subsequently, the samples were incubated in the machine Daisy II for 24 hours. The cellulase and pepsin enzymes were used in the incubation. Following mycotoxins were determined in the incubation fluid such as dexynivalenol, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside and 3 -acetyl-deoxynivalenol. In the variant A, the level of dexynivalenolu was higher by 36 %, zearalenone by about 2 %, deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside by 12 %, and 3 -acetyl-deoxynivalenol by 39 %. Low levels of the mycotoxins were found out in the variant B. Deoxynivalenol level was lower by 19 %, zearalenone by 30 %, deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside by 37 % (p < 0, 05). The 3 -acetyl-deoxynivalenol level was higher by 12 % in a comparison with the control group.

SMCD 2220 - 01 shown mycoparasitic lifestyle and is promising biological control agent against mycotoxin producing Fusarium pathogens (Vujanovic and Goh 2010; Kim and Vujanovic 2016). In addition to the biocontrol effect, SMCD 2220 - 01 was effective in reducing AUR mycotoxin production in red pigmented Fusaria by down-regulating AUR gene expression (Vujanovic and Goh 2011, Vujanovic et al. 2017).
