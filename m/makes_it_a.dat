5|$|The {{effective}} {{radiated power}} (ERP) of the Green Pine also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> possible candidate for conversion into a directed-energy weapon, by focusing pulses of radar energy on target missiles. The energy spikes are tailored to enter missiles through antennas or sensor apertures where they can fool guidance systems, scramble computer memories or even burn out sensitive electronic components.|$|E
5|$|The large {{magnitude}} of solar energy available <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> highly appealing source of electricity.

Its inertness <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> good choice for those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E

The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law.

5|$|Tantalum is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as tantalium, its {{name comes from}} Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology. Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It {{is part of the}} refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum. Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid {{are made from}} tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E
