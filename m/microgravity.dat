5|$|In 2014, 20 {{years after}} the {{production}} of this episode, NASA did indeed send ants to the International Space Station to conduct behavioral experiments about collective search in <b>microgravity.</b> The results of this experiment {{were published in the}} journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Howard is summoned for {{astronaut}} training by NASA. After {{his first}} day of training, he talks to Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) via webcam; he vomited while experiencing <b>microgravity.</b> Next, he is forced to go on overnight survival training, where he is spooned by an armadillo during a sandstorm. Bernadette goes to visit Howard in Houston, but finds his mother already there, taking care of him.|$|E
5|$|Outer space {{represents}} a challenging environment for human exploration {{because of the}} dual hazards of vacuum and radiation. <b>Microgravity</b> also has {{a negative effect on}} human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final phase was {{operational}} training for the astronauts. This focused on giving them hands-on experience using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of <b>microgravity</b> and rapid acceleration. The astronauts spent time in simulators, aboard cargo planes that simulated weightlessness, underwater to practice extravehicular activities (EVAs), and on visits to manufacturing plants {{to check on the}} progress of the hardware.|$|E
5|$|Kristall {{contained}} furnaces for use {{in producing}} crystals under <b>microgravity</b> conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft. Although they were never used in a Buran docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-Mir programme, providing a berthing location for US Space Shuttles.|$|E
5|$|The Axioms {{passengers}} {{have become}} obese and feeble due to <b>microgravity</b> and reliance on an automated lifestyle, including the ship's current captain, McCrea, who leaves the ship {{under the control}} of the robotic autopilot, AUTO. EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is unprepared for a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so humanity can recolonize it. However, AUTO orders his robotic assistant GO-4 to steal the plant to prevent this from happening.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance of the spacecraft over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged <b>microgravity</b> on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine {{how easy it was to}} control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter crew compartment. Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to try {{to determine if they}} worked in <b>microgravity.</b> A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E
5|$|Since Johnston's death, {{his field}} of {{volcanic}} eruption prediction has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are {{now able to}} predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in advance. Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity. In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They can also use carbon dioxide emission as a proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the ColdwaterI and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of InSAR (interferometry), surveys of networks of GPS monuments, <b>microgravity</b> surveys in which scientists measure the change in gravitational potential or acceleration because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, strain meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic eruptions.|$|E

25|$|Investigating {{the physics}} of fluids in <b>microgravity</b> will provide better models of the {{behaviour}} of fluids. Because fluids can be almost completely combined in <b>microgravity,</b> physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on Earth. In addition, examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding of superconductivity.|$|E

25|$|STS-65 Columbia {{launched}} from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 8, 1994, returning to Florida on July 23, 1994. The crew conducted the second International <b>Microgravity</b> Laboratory (IML-2) mission utilizing the long Spacelab module in the payload bay. The flight consisted of 82 experiments from 15 countries and six space agencies {{from around the}} world. During the record setting 15-day flight, the crew conducted experiments which focused on materials and life sciences research in a <b>microgravity</b> environment {{paving the way for}} future operations and cooperation aboard International Space Station. The mission was accomplished in 236 orbits of the Earth in 353 hours and 55 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{metabolism}} also changes. Normally, bone is {{laid down}} {{in the direction of}} mechanical stress. However, in a <b>microgravity</b> environment there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip and femur. Due to <b>microgravity</b> and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to <b>microgravity,</b> for an otherwise healthy adult. The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms which resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones are constantly being shed and regenerated through a well-balanced system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place—neither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to <b>microgravity.</b> This is a problem, because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body. Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery. This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region, because this is the region which carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to <b>microgravity.</b> Elevated blood calcium levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density. After a 3–4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density. New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise and medication may hold the potential to aid the process of growing new bone.|$|E

25|$|In January 1995, he {{was officially}} {{presented}} by Belgium as a Payload Specialist astronaut candidate for NASA’s Life and <b>Microgravity</b> Spacelab (LMS) - STS-78 mission. Four other candidates were presented respectively by the French Space Agency (CNES), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and ESA.|$|E
25|$|One {{downside}} of using neutral buoyancy to simulate <b>microgravity</b> is the {{significant amount of}} drag presented by water. Generally, drag effects are minimized by doing tasks slowly in the water. Another {{downside of}} neutral buoyancy simulation is that astronauts are not weightless within their suits, thus, precise suit sizing is critical.|$|E
25|$|Lind was the Payload Commander on {{his first}} and only flight, STS-51-B, {{launched}} April 29, 1985. He designed an experiment to capture the Earth's aurora.
