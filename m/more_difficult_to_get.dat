5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and it is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
25|$|Deaths {{often occur}} when the loss of {{consciousness}} caused by partial asphyxia leads to loss {{of control over the}} means of strangulation, resulting in continued asphyxia and death. While often asphyxiophilia is incorporated into sex with a partner, others enjoy this behaviour by themselves, making it potentially <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of dangerous situations.|$|E
25|$|Hikers {{who choose}} to follow the Little Sur River can walk {{upstream}} into the Little Sur River Gorge following a use trail that crosses the river multiple times.

Under the Derg business licenses became progressively <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> and traders' trucks were requisitioned for the transport of war-related materials to army bases in Eritrea. Permits of travel were required; convoys were introduced by 1976; and the road links to Asmara were virtually broken, largely by the ELF, by the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|However, {{like the}} No 1, the No 2 {{required}} a special detonator that {{was similar to}} the one used in the No 1. This made it even <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> adequate supplies of the No 2 to the troops and further tied up supplies. Arguably, the No 2 made the grenade problem worse for the British, as there had to be separate detonators for the No 1 and No 2 that could only be made by a small group of firms.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know what}} Color Field {{painting}} means. I {{think it was}} probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase means anything. Color Field painting?

6000|$|It was a <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> matter <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{officers}} than soldiers.

25|$|As already mentioned, dwarfs {{were allowed}} to have several high ranked jobs and could move up the ranks during their career. Old Kingdom reliefs depict dwarfs {{performing}} mainly easy, rather creative jobs, because their shortened and fragile stature did not allow for hard or dangerous physical work. Unsurprisingly then dwarfs mainly worked as jewelers, tailors, cup-bearers and even as zookeepers. As at other periods, dwarfs were particularly valued as treasurers or jewellers, as their very distinctive appearance would make any dishonest dealings on their part that much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away with.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s, HBO has {{produced}} original programming, which include dramatic and comedic series, {{in addition to}} its slate of theatrical films. Most of these shows are intended for adults (and, with limited exceptions, are typically assigned TV-MA ratings), often featuring high amounts of profanity, violence, sexual themes and/or nudity that would be much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on basic cable or over-the-air broadcast channels, out of fear of losing sponsors. However some of its original programs, primarily those produced before 2001, have also been aimed at families or children; most of these type of programs have migrated to HBO Family, though HBO has produced very few newer family-oriented series for either channel since that point. In a notable example, HBO ventured back into children's programming with its acquisition of the first-run and streaming rights to Sesame Street, a long-running children's television series that had previously aired on PBS {{for the vast majority of}} its run, in the aforementioned deal with Sesame Workshop that was announced in August 2015.|$|E
25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{the fit of}} the {{outcomes}} of our model to the experimental data suggests that, in a social dilemma situation, the incompleteness of the network structure may effectively erode conditional cooperation, by making <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for subjects <b>to</b> <b>get</b> accurate information about {{the decisions of the}} other group members.|$|R
5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, making it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for squirrels <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for crossbills <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|R
50|$|Location {{contributes}} to a child’s lack of access and attendance to primary education. In {{certain areas of the}} world it is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for children <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> school.

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Between You and Me" [...] {{received}} regular airtime on MTV and VH1. While the video was popular, however, the band found it more and <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> airplay on MTV {{for what they}} perceived as a bias against the Christian music scene. McKeehan explained that with [...] "Between You and Me", the group was able to [...] "sneak one past the goalie", but afterwards the DJs realized that [...] "this group's from the Christian market".|$|E
500|$|Several United States Senators {{screened}} the film.

New Mexico Democratic Senator Tom Udall planned to see the film saying [...] "It's such a powerful statement {{because of the way}} the movie is put together, I tell everybody, Democrat or Republican, they've got to go see this movie." [...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a consensus in Congress. Bingaman disputed this saying, [...] "It seems to me we were having great difficulty recruiting Republican members of Congress to support a bill before Al Gore came up with this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Jason Isaacs {{obtained}} {{the role of}} Michael Britten, the central character of the series. Gordon summated {{the premise of the}} character: [...] "He's a guy who goes to sleep, wakes up, he's with his wife, goes to sleep, wakes up, and he's with his son. [...] And so—and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes." [...] Killen thought that the premise behind the series would be relatable to audiences, making it easier to expand his fanbase. [...] "I think there were aspects of Lone Star that were <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a wider, broader audience interested in," [...] he articulated. [...] " [...] was somebody that you couldn't decide if you liked or hated, and I think that Britten's dilemma is something that we're not only sympathetic for, but somehow we want him to win." [...] The following month, producers approached Laura Allen to play Hannah Britten. Michaela McManus initially received the role of Hannah, but later received the role of Tara instead, whom Allen originally auditioned to play.|$|E
50|$|Educational inequalities in South Sudan can be {{attributed}} to a number of factors. The lack of funds and infrastructure, along with a poor and mostly illiterate population makes establishing an effective education system challenging.

The fraternity stood by the decision to dismiss Wu stating, [...] "Having an Oriental in the house would degrade [...] in the eyes of other fraternities and make it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> dates from the sororities." [...] Despite coming under increasing pressure after the story broke nationally, the administration asserted that it would not interfere with fraternities' selection processes. Wu received bids to pledge at two other fraternities, {{but it was not until}} the mid-1960s that racial and religious discrimination was outlawed in Greek organizations at Northwestern.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the split}} of SDS in 1969, Oughton and Ayers joined the Weatherman faction. Oughton's sense of herself made it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{along with her}} father; she saw her parents' lives in Dwight, Illinois as complacent and secure, and lives in the impoverished {{sections}} of Chicago and Detroit as chaotic. At this time, SDS protests became more violent and radical. Oughton and Ayers had been drifting apart since December 1968. Monogamy, according to Ayers, would interfere with his political work. Oughton replaced her old friends, and she abandoned teaching, for politics was now her life. Merrill Rosenberg told Oughton, [...] "Revolution means violence and risk, or it is only talk. The Weathermen's arguments pointed to their conclusion that the time was now to fight." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, in {{the last}} twenty years Orthodox Judaism has begun to develop roles for women as halakhic court advisors and congregational advisors. Rabbi Aryeh Strikovski (Machanaim Yeshiva and Pardes Institute) worked in the 1990s with Rabbi Avraham Shapira (then a co-Chief rabbi of Israel) to {{initiate}} the program for training Orthodox women as halakhic Toanot ("advocates") in rabbinic courts. They have since trained nearly seventy women in Israel. Strikovski states that [...] "The knowledge one requires to become a court advocate is more than a regular ordination, and now to pass certification is much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ordination."

2500|$|As pro {{attendance}} slackened at ABA events {{there was}} a very noticeable fall in coverage of ABA Nationals by the BMX press. This was {{due to the lack of}} top tier pros and conflicting schedules with large purse NBL races and ESPN's Pro Spectacular events. For example, after covering the ABA Winter Nationals in depth in its June 1983 issue, BMX Plus! magazine did not cover a major ABA race for the rest of 1983 except the Grand National in its March 1984 issue. ABA races only warranted brief comment and the listings of race results in its [...] "Checkpoint" [...] section. This was an addition but unrelated effect of the boycott initiated by BMX Action, then the most respected BMX magazine. As noted, BMX Action's boycott started over perceived slights by the ABA when it noticed what it perceived as bad press by the magazine. With a large drop of coverage by the magazines, it became <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> companies to sponsor ABA nationals, since the companies would not have the benefits of indirect advertising in the magazines.|$|E
2500|$|These did {{not happen}} often, but they were very {{dangerous}} when they did, and generally resulted in severe casualties among the crew and passengers and {{the complete loss of}} the boat. [...] Steamboat boiler explosions had been a common problem on the Mississippi River system well before the steamboats began serious operations in the Pacific Northwest in the 1850s. [...] By 1852, the problem had gotten so bad that Congress enacted a law setting out detailed standards for inspection of steamboats and licensing of officers. [...] Considerable work was done in the 1840s and 1850s to understand what caused boiler explosions, and these came down to many causes, including general wear and tear, inadequate or poorly designed equipment, overworked boilers that were too small for the engines, general lack of engineering skill among boiler operators, and excessive demands for performance from the vessel's captain or management. [...] People noticed early on that most of boiler explosions occurred just as steamboats were leaving (or sometimes arriving at) a landing. [...] This was true in two-thirds of the boiler explosions up to 1852. [...] Steam pressure was supposed to be reduced during a landing, but this would make it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off to a fast start, so too [...] often pressure was kept up even though the engines weren't running to relieve the pressure by use of the steam generated by the boiler. [...] Under these circumstances, boiler explosions were much more likely.|$|E
