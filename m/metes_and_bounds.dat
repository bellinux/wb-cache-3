40|$|<b>MetE</b> <b>and</b> MetH are two {{distinct}} enzymes that catalyze a similar biochemical reaction {{during the last}} step of methionine biosynthesis, MetH being a cobalamin-dependent enzyme whereas MetE activity is cobalamin-independent. In this work, we show that the last step of methionine synthesis in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum is under the transcriptional control of the master pathogenicity regulator HrpG. This control is exerted essentially on metE expression through the intermediate regulator MetR. Expression of <b>metE</b> is strongly <b>and</b> specifically induced {{in the presence of}} plant cells in a hrpG- <b>and</b> metR-dependent manner. <b>metE</b> <b>and</b> metR mutants are not auxotrophic for methionine and not affected for growth inside the plant but produce significantly reduced disease symptoms on tomato whereas disruption of metH has no impact on pathogenicity. The finding that the pathogen preferentially induces metE expression rather than metH in the presence of plant cells is indicative of a probable metabolic adaptation to physiological host conditions since this induction of metE occurs in an environment in which cobalamin, the required co-factor for MetH, is absent. It also shows that <b>MetE</b> <b>and</b> MetH are not functionally redundant and are deployed during specific stages of the bacteria lifecycle, the expression of <b>metE</b> <b>and</b> metH being controlled by multiple and distinct signals...|$|R

2500|$|All {{streets and}} avenues in Miami-Dade County follow the [...] "Miami grid," [...] {{with a few}} exceptions, most notably Coral Gables, Hialeah, and Miami Beach. The grid pattern was adopted after World War I as the common naming system proved too confusing, {{particularly}} for mail carriers. The grid pattern is laid out primarily in 1mi x 1mi format based on a survey technique called <b>metes</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounds.</b> Within those larger squares, individual developers and cities platted the lots differently, {{and they do not}} always cross the major roads that create the macro-grid. These major roads usually are [...] able to cross physical boundaries such as canals and highways, while the intermediate streets within them typically do not. [...] One off-grid neighborhood in Miami, The Roads, is thus named because its streets run off the Miami grid in an approximately 45-degree angle, and therefore all streets are known by their number with the suffix [...] "Road" [...] vs Street. Another busy off-grid road is Okeechobee Road (U.S. Route 27), which travels diagonally through the urban area from the northeast corner of Miami International Airport through Hialeah. Additionally, U.S. Route 1, known better locally as South Dixie Highway, Brickell Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard, does not follow grid pattern.|$|E

40|$|We {{isolated}} an Escherichia coli methionine auxotroph that {{displays a}} growth phenotype {{similar to that}} of known metF mutants but has elevated levels of 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, the metF gene product. Transduction analysis indicates that the mutant carries normal <b>metE,</b> metH, <b>and</b> metF genes; the phenotype is due to a single mutation, eliminating the possibility that the strain is a metE metH double mutant; and the new mutation is linked to the metE gene by P 1 transduction. Plasmids carrying the Salmonella typhimurium <b>metE</b> gene <b>and</b> flanking regions complement the mutation, even when the plasmid-borne metE gene is inactivated. Enzyme assays show that the mutation results in a dramatic decrease in metE gene expression, a moderate decrease in metH gene expression, and a disruption of the metH-mediated vitamin B 12 repression of the <b>metE</b> <b>and</b> metF genes. Our evidence suggests that the methionine auxotrophy caused by the new mutation is a result of insufficient production of both the vitamin B 12 -independent (<b>metE)</b> <b>and</b> vitamin B 12 -dependent (metH) transmethylase enzymes that are necessary for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine. We propose that this mutation defines a positive regulatory gene, designated metR, whose product acts in trans to activate the <b>metE</b> <b>and</b> metH genes...|$|R

40|$|Enzymes {{possessing}} catalytic zinc centers {{perform a}} variety of fundamental processes in nature, including methyl transfer to thiols. Cobalamin-independent (<b>MetE)</b> <b>and</b> cobalamin-dependent (MetH) methionine synthases are two such enzyme families. Although they perform the same net reaction, transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine (Hcy) to form methionine, they display markedly different catalytic strategies, modular organization, and active site zinc centers. Here we report crystal structures of zinc-replete <b>MetE</b> <b>and</b> MetH, both in the presence and absence of Hcy. Structural investigation of the catalytic zinc sites of these two methyltransferases reveals an unexpected inversion of zinc geometry upon binding of Hcy and displacement of an endogenous ligand in both enzymes. In both cases a significant movement of the zinc relative to the protein scaffold accompanies inversion. These structures provide new information on the activation of thiols by zinc-containing enzymes and have led us to propose a paradigm for the mechanism of action of the catalytic zinc sites in these and related methyltransferases. Specifically, zinc is mobile in the active sites of <b>MetE</b> <b>and</b> MetH, and its dynamic nature helps facilitate the active site conformational changes necessary for thiol activation and methyl transfer...|$|R

40|$|The Salmonella typhimurium <b>metE</b> <b>and</b> metR genes share {{a common}} control region, with overlapping, divergently {{transcribed}} promoters. A double gene fusion was constructed in which the metE promoter directs expression of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene and the metR promoter directs expression of the E. coli galK gene. By using an E. coli strain lysogenized with a lambda bacteriophage carrying the metE-lacZ metR-galK double fusion (lambda Elac.

The first class of mutations causes a simultaneous decrease in metE-lacZ expression by disrupting the normal MetR-mediated activation of the metE promoter. The mutations are located within a region extending from 17 to 34 base pairs upstream of the - 35 region of the metE promoter. Gel mobility shift assays and DNaseI protection experiments demonstrated that the MetR protein specifically binds to a 24 -base-pair region encompassing these mutations.
