25|$|Although the crown's {{plans for}} both the Toluca and Veracruz {{portions}} of the king's highway were ambitious, the actual results saw improvements only for a localized network. Even where infrastructure was improved, transit on the Veracruz-Puebla main road had other obstacles, with wolves attacking mule trains, killing animals, and rendering some sacks of foodstuffs unsellable because they were smeared with blood. The north-south Acapulco route remained a <b>mule</b> <b>track</b> through mountainous terrain.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} the route Owers {{surveyed}} departed from the <b>mule</b> <b>track.</b> The track descended down the ridge on a grade too steep for motor vehicles, so the road then proceeded along the ridge line. The 7th Field Company then encountered [...] of rock, {{which had to be}} drilled and blasted. The jeep track was abandoned at this point, but work continued on a <b>mule</b> <b>track,</b> which was advanced about [...] per day until mid-September, when the engineer units were withdrawn to Port Moresby due to the deteriorating tactical situation, with the Japanese closing in on Ioribaiwa. Work resumed on 28 September, but was abandoned in early October. Units working on the road were supplied by pack transport. Improvements to the road allowed 3-ton trucks to reach Owers' Corner on 28 September. The jeeps were then moved to a new line of communications running from Itiki through Subitana.|$|E
500|$|It {{was found}} that the mules were best-suited for the task, {{followed}} by the brumbies. Because the tracks were narrow, they taught the animals to walk in single file, led by a mounted rider at the front and trailed by one {{at the rear of the}} column. Each animal carried [...] of stores, which were packed in bags to facilitate their transfer to Papuan carriers. The Goldie River was bridged on 2 July, and the <b>mule</b> <b>track</b> was extended to Uberi.

The rock slopes are very steep (almost vertical) and the monastery buildings are built into the rock face. Though it looks formidable, the monastery complex has access from several directions, such as the northwest path through the forest, from the south along the path used by devotees, and from the north (access over the rocky plateau, which is called the “Hundred Thousand Fairies” known as Bumda (hBum-brag). A <b>mule</b> <b>track</b> leading to it passes through pine forest that is colorfully festooned with moss and prayer flags. On many days, clouds shroud the monastery and give an eerie feeling of remoteness.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} the front began to settle down. The siege of Poonch continued. An {{unsuccessful}} attack was launched by 77 Parachute Brigade (Brig Atal) to capture Zoji La pass. Operation Duck, the earlier epithet for this assault, was renamed as Operation Bison by Cariappa. M5 Stuart light tanks of 7 Cavalry were moved in dismantled conditions through Srinagar and winched across bridges while two field companies of the Madras Sappers converted the <b>mule</b> <b>track</b> across Zoji La into a jeep track. The surprise attack on 1 November by the brigade with armour supported by two regiments of 25 pounders and a regiment of 3.7-inch guns, forced the pass and pushed the tribal and Pakistani forces back to Matayan and later Dras. The brigade linked up on 24 November at Kargil with Indian troops advancing from Leh while their opponents eventually withdrew northwards toward Skardu. The Pakistani attacked the Skardu on 10 February 1948 which was repulsed by the Indian soldiers. Thereafter, the Skardu Garrison was subjected to continuous attacks by the Pakistan Army {{for the next three}} months and each time, their attack was repulsed by the Colonel Sher Jung Thapa and his men. Thapa held the Skardu with hardly 250 men for whole six long months without any reinforcement and replenishment. On 14 August Indian General Sher Jung Thapa had to surrender Skardu to the Pakistani Army. and raiders after a year long siege.|$|E

50|$|Barles is very compartmentalized, {{divided into}} valleys {{separated}} by high mountains and steep ridges.

50|$|Due to the {{presence}} of hiking trails and <b>mule</b> <b>tracks,</b> activities such as Nordic Walking and trekking are popular during the summer, or, in winter, walking using snow rackets and skiing. In particular, the Bassano's CAI27 has created for some years a lot of hiking trails which cross the area of Borso del Grappa.|$|R
60|$|Here Desmond {{consulted}} his map. There {{were two}} roads from Truxillo. Crossing the sierra, the main and shorter road came {{down upon the}} Tagus at Almarez.

60|$|Beyond Chosica civilization almost ceased. The road became {{little more}} than a <b>mule</b> <b>track,</b> and was in many places almost impassable by {{vehicles}} of any kind. Nothing could be wilder than the scenery they passed. At times rivers ran through perpendicular gorges, and the track wound up and down steep ravines. Sometimes they would all dismount, though Dias assured them it was not necessary; still, it made a change from the monotonous pace of little over two miles an hour at which the mules breasted the steep incline.|$|E

50|$|The {{so-called}} Market way (Via del Mercato) connects Locarno with Domodossola, {{through the}} Centovalli and the Val Vigezzo.

50|$|Rana Kishan Singh, {{who ruled}} {{the state from}} 1840 to 1867, {{developed}} the town of Arki in a planned manner.

6000|$|She {{required}} no urging {{to hasten}} her steps, but hurried breathlessly at his side. He {{had taken a}} new trail by which they left the wood {{at right angles with}} the highway, two miles away. Following an almost effaced <b>mule</b> <b>track</b> along a slight depression of the plain, deep enough, however, to hide them from view, he accompanied her, until, rising to the level again, she saw they were beginning to approach the highway and the distant roofs of Indian Spring. [...] "Nobody meeting you now," [...] he whispered, [...] "would suspect where you had been. Good night! until next week--remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the mean}} wine-shop of that hamlet Mr. Butler inquired his {{way by the}} simple {{expedient}} of shouting [...] "Tavora?" [...] with a strong interrogative inflection. The vintner made it plain by gestures--accompanied by a rattling musketry of incomprehensible speech that their way lay straight ahead. And straight ahead they went, following that <b>mule</b> <b>track</b> for some five or six miles until it began to slope gently towards the plain again. Below them they presently beheld a cluster of twinkling lights to advertise a township. They dropped swiftly down, and in the outskirts overtook a belated bullock-cart, whose ungreased axle was arousing the hillside echoes with its plangent wail.|$|E
60|$|Presently we {{recognise}} {{the fellow}} of the earthly Devil's Bridge, still intact as a footway, spanning the gorge, and old memories turn us off the road down the steep ruin of an ancient <b>mule</b> <b>track</b> towards it. It is our first reminder that Utopia too must have a history. We cross it and find the Reuss, for all that it has already lit and warmed and ventilated and cleaned several thousands of houses in the dale above, {{and for all that}} it drives those easy trams in the gallery overhead, is yet capable of as fine a cascade as ever it flung on earth. So we come to a rocky path, wild as one could wish, and descend, discoursing how good and fair an ordered world may be, but with a certain unformulated qualification in our minds about those thumb marks we have left behind.|$|E
50|$|This {{historic}} way {{starts in}} Domodossola and {{goes through the}} Valle Vigezzo and the Centovalli as far as Locarno. The track uses trails and <b>mule</b> <b>tracks</b> of the ancient Via del Mercato, the way on which merchants from Italy and Switzerland transported goods. In the early 20th century the Centovalli railway was built {{in order to develop}} commerce and nowadays it is a major tourist attraction.|$|R
50|$|At midnight it {{was found}} that the <b>mule</b> <b>tracks</b> {{followed}} by Albertone and Arimondi were converging; Arimondi stopped and sent Baratieri a message, that he was forced to let Albertone pass ahead.

6000|$|As I {{ascended the}} upper track two {{bandages}} men were {{coming down on}} led mules. It was mid-August, and they were suffering from frostbite. Across the great gap between the summits a minute traveller with some provisions was going up by wire to some post upon the crest. For everywhere upon the icy pinnacles are observation posts directing the fire of the big guns on the slopes below, or machine-gun stations, or little garrisons that sit and wait through the bleak days. Often they have no link with the world below but a precipitous climb or a [...] "teleferic" [...] wire. Snow and frost may cut them off absolutely for weeks {{from the rest of}} mankind. The sick and wounded must begin their journey down to help and comfort in a giddy basket that swings down {{to the head of the}} <b>mule</b> <b>track</b> below.|$|E
60|$|We camped {{with the}} 2nd Brigade {{on the night}} of the 6th, and next morning, while the stars were still shining, resumed the march. Five miles from Sarai the road dwindles to a <b>mule</b> <b>track,</b> and henceforward is not fit for wheeled traffic. In spite of this, the 10th Field Battery had succeeded in getting their guns along it, and had brought them safely to Panjkora. But {{soldiers}} will accomplish a good deal to get nearer the enemy. The scenery before the gorge of the river is reached is gloomy, but grand. Great cliffs tower up precipitously on the further bank and the path is cut in the face of the rock. The river, which flows swiftly by, plunges into a narrow cleft about a mile below the bridge, and disappears among the mountains. It abounds in fish, but is rapid and dangerous, and while the troops were encamped near it, two gunners lost their lives by falling in, and being carried down. Indeed, watching the dead bodies of several camels being swept along, swirled around, and buffeted against the rocks, it was not hard to understand these accidents.|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} Captain Maccario {{rose to his}} feet and called aloud. There was a murmur of voices, a clatter of arms, a rattle of stones, and a patter of feet, and the Sin Verguenza came out from the barranco like beasts from their lairs. The {{hillside}} fell steep beneath them, but they went down, flitting noiselessly, half‐seen shadows, while each man chose his own path, and not as troops would have done. Here and there the machetes cleared a way where it would take too long to go round, or there was a crackle of undergrowth when they plunged into a belt of trees. Then a <b>mule</b> <b>track</b> led them down to the level, and with a shuffle of broken boots and soft patter of naked feet they swung along the dusty carretera road. It wound away before them smelling of dew‐cooled earth, a faint white riband, past the shadowy tobacco and dusky sugar cane, and there was no stoppage when here and there a flat‐roofed house loomed up beside it. Then there was a murmur of warning, a drowsy “Viva la libertad!” and the column passed on; for the insurrection had taken hold, and the enemies of the Sin Verguenza were the men who had something to lose.|$|E
50|$|Two {{mountain}} passes lead South from the Rheinwald: the San Bernardino Pass into Misox valley and the Splügen Pass into Val San Giacomo in Italy. The San Bernardino Tunnel (Swiss Highway A13) was opened in 1967 and stays open all winter. <b>Mule</b> <b>tracks</b> on Mount Safierberg and Mount Valserberg connect the Rheinwald with its Northern neighbour Safien valley and Vals. Another trail leads through the Val Curciusa valley via Bocchetta di Curciusa Pass and then {{connects to the}} San Bernardino.|$|R
50|$|Declared {{a nature}} park in 2002, the Montsant Natural Park is a veritable {{symbol of the}} Priorat and of {{southern}} Catalonia. It is a compact massif, largely surrounded by cliffs and rocky slopes made up of Oligocene conglomerates. To get up there, choose your grau, {{one of the ways}} up and through the cliffs. Some are relatively easy, following old <b>mule</b> <b>tracks,</b> while others are only passable on foot, with dizzying views and some surprises. From the top there are magnificent views, over all the villages nestling at its foot.|$|R
5000|$|For centuries the 120 km long Hohe Tauern {{mountain}} range {{east of the}} Brenner Pass could only be crossed via steep and narrow <b>mule</b> <b>tracks.</b> A first step {{to open up the}} region was taken with the construction of the Tauern Railway until 1909, followed by the inauguration of the Grossglockner High Alpine Road in 1935. In the east, vehicles could cross the Niedere Tauern range via the Radstädter Tauern Pass and the Katschberg Pass on a road that had been in use at least since Roman times.|$|R

Both climbs were <b>mule</b> <b>tracks,</b> a demanding challenge on heavy, ungeared bikes ridden by men with spare tires around their shoulders and their food, clothing and tools in bags hung from their handlebars. The assistant organiser, Victor Breyer, stood at {{the summit of the}} Aubisque with the colleague who had proposed including the Pyrenees, Alphonse Steinès. The tour organiser, Henri Desgrange was confident enough after the Pyrenees to include the Alps in 1911.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Via Regina" [...] (“strada regia”, royal road, hence main road) {{was given}} to it much later on and is first {{documented}} in the year 1187.

For centuries it constituted a true “Lake Como system”, an articulate network of routes pointing northwards, to the Alpine passes, and southwards, towards Milan, the hub for the Po Valley.|$|R
