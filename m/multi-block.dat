We propose the Fast Proximal Augmented Lagragian Method (Fast PALM) which achieves the convergence rate $O(1 /K^ 2) $, compared with $O(1 /K) $ by the traditional PALM. In order to further reduce the per-iteration complexity and handle the <b>multi-blocks</b> problem, we propose the Fast Proximal ADMM with Parallel Splitting (Fast PL-ADMM-PS) method.

This was tested in the Peschanaya Square development (a territory north from the 1948 Posokhin-Lagutenko block). Using the flow methode of moving crews through a sequence of buildings in different completion stages and a moderate application of prefabricated concrete on otherwise traditional masonry, builders managed to complete typical 7-story buildings in 5–6 months. Instead of wet-stucco (which caused at least two months of delay), these buildings are finished with open brickwork outside, and a drywall inside; and from a quality of life consideration, these are true – and the last – Stalinist buildings.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the seismic}} {{behaviour}} of an archaeological monumental colonnade under earthquake actions is examined through planar numerical simulations (nonlinear finite element analyses). The colonnade has two storeys with multi-drum columns and <b>multi-blocks</b> segmented trabeations.

The ancient city of Pompeii in Italy, is a partially buried Roman town-city; after suffering many earthquakes in the past it was destroyed during a long catastrophic eruption of the Vesuvius volcano in 79 A.

Nowadays, the ruins of the ancient town present many partially collapsed buildings, not only as a result of other earthquakes during the last three centuries, but also as a consequence of rapid degradation of the archaeological material.

40|$|The {{auxiliary}} problem {{principle of}} augmented Lagrangian (APP-AL), proposed by Cohen and Zhu (1984), aims {{to find the}} solution of a constrained optimization problem through a sequence of auxiliary problems involving augmented Lagrangian. The merits of this approach are two folds. First, the core function is usually separable, which makes the subproblems at each step decomposable and particularly attractive for parallel computing. Second, {{the choice of the}} core function is quite flexible. Consequently, by carefully specifying this function, APP-AL may reduce to some standard optimization algorithms. In this paper, we pursue enhancing such flexibility by allowing the core function to be non-identical at each step of the algorithm, and name it varying auxiliary problem principle (VAPP-AL). Depending on the problem structure, the varying core functions in VAPP-AL can be adapted to design new flexible and suitable algorithm for parallel and distributed computing. The convergence and O(1 /t) convergence rate of VAPP-AL for convex problem with coupling objective and constraints is proved. Moreover, if this function is specialized to be quadratic, an o(1 /t) convergence rate can be established. Interestingly, the new VAPP framework can cover several variants of Jacobian type augmented Lagrangian decomposition methods as special cases. Furthermore, our technique works for the convex problem with nonseparable objective and <b>multi-blocks</b> coupled linear constraints, which usually can not be handled by ADMM...|$|R

40|$|Comunicación presentada al: "DCIS' 09 " celebrado en Zaragoza y organizado por la Universidad de Zaragoza (Unizar) del 18 al 20 de Noviembre del 2009. Address Event Representation (AER) is an {{emergent}} {{technology for}} assembling modular <b>multi-blocks</b> bio-inspired sensory and processing systems. Visual sensors (retinae) {{are among the}} first AER modules to be reported since {{the introduction of the}} technology. Spatial contrast AER retinae are of special interest since they provide highly compressed data flow without reducing the relevant information required for performing recognition. Reported AER contrast retinae perform a contrast computation based on the ratio between a pixel’s local light intensity and a spatially weighted average of its neighbourhood. This results in compact circuits, but with the penalty of all pixels generating output signals even if they sensed no contrast. In this paper we present a spatial contrast retina with bipolar output: contrast is computed as the relative difference between a pixel’s local light and its weighted spatial average. As a result, contrast includes a sign and the output will be zero if there is no contrast. Furthermore, an adjustable thresholding mechanism has been included, such that pixels remain silent until they sense an absolute contrast above the adjustable threshold. The pixel contrast computation circuit is based on Boahen’s Biharmonic operator contrast circuit, which has been improved to include mismatch calibration and adaptive current based biasing. As a result, the contrast computation circuit shows much less mismatch, is almost insensitive to ambient light illumination, and biasing is much less critical than in the original voltage biasing scheme. A full AER retina version has been fabricated. In the present paper we provide simulation and preliminary experimental results.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Traditional Balinese architecture is commonly related to culture and traditional reasoning. When subjected to several modem problems such as energy demand, pollution, and impact of urbanisation and tourism, traditional architecture becomes less attractive since the definitions behind traditional reasoning are not clear and can be interpreted in different ways. To understand this feature, the study of traditional Balinese architecture starts by using several key parameters such as wind engineering and heat transfer, as presented and used in several countries. The flow patterns around a cubic building have been studied by many researchers. The velocity profile at the model position and the local surface roughness are specific to each building model and cannot be estimated from general tests of a standard building shape, therefore specific velocity profiles and conditions are used in this particular study. The air flow around a cluster of traditional Balinese buildings is extremely complicated and difficult to determine by modelling an isolated building (via symmetric conditions) since the buildings are linked to each other. Full scale models of traditional buildings have been investigated by using CFD to predict the above aspects. Simulations using this method can be done more quickly and less expensively than with wind tunnel experiments, and are capable of delivering more detailed and comprehensive information about the flow structure. Two-dimensional models of traditional Balinese building arrangements are simulated by using a commercial code Fidap based on the finite element method to assess the effects of type of roof, fence and surface roughness. Three-dimensional models are simulated by using a commercial code CFX based on the finite volume method to verify some traditional definitions. A standard к-ε model is adopted because it needs less computational power and has achieved notable successes in calculating {{a wide variety of}} thin shear layer and recirculating flows without the need of adjustment of the model constants, but with the imposition of boundary conditions to reduce the over-prediction near windward edges. Adopting lower values of к and ε combined with <b>multi-blocks</b> is shown to reduce this over-estimation. For a cubic building, the results can be compared with several other turbulence models. It appears that traditional Balinese architecture has a strong and significant correlation with several engineering fields, therefore traditional communities can develop by considering the Tri Hita Karana concept in order to improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling loads, with corresponding energy savings.
