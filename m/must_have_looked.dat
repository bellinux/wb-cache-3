5|$|In 'The Clearing of the Woodlands', Hoskins {{argues that}} before the 15th century England <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> like one great forest, {{but most of the}} woods were cleared for arable or pasture in the 12th and 13th centuries. Under Henry II perhaps a third of the country was royal forest.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan that}} was issued to Roginsky between October and December <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> familiar: a drive westwards towards Tosno, Lyuban and Chudovo {{as part of}} a short encirclement, {{followed}} by an advance southwest to Luga. However, in the past year the German forces had grown weaker, the Soviets stronger, and the offensive would be launched on three attack axes.|$|E
25|$|King Robert II died at Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire on 19 April 1390 and the chronicler Wyntoun informs that Robert was not {{buried at}} Scone until 13 August 1390, {{only a day}} before his son John, Earl of Carrick was crowned King as Robert III. Fife was {{retained}} as Guardian of Scotland probably much against Buchan's hopes as he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> at some sort of volte-face on some of Fife's actions, particularly as Buchan reached his zenith of possessions under Carrick. On top of this, Bishop Bur turned to Thomas Dunbar, Sheriff of Inverness and son of the Earl of Moray to provide his protection. The events of May and June 1390 in the Laich of Moray were perhaps {{the result of a}} combination of factors that presented themselves to Buchan. Firstly, John Dunbar, Earl of Moray and his fellow northern landowner Sir David Lindsay of Glenesk both absented themselves from Moray to attend a substantial tourney at Richard II of England's court. In addition, Bishop Bur's involvement with Buchan's estrangement with his wife and then Bur's alignment with Moray presented an opportunity for revenge culminating in the destruction of Forres in May and then Elgin with its cathedral in June. His destruction of the church possessions in Elgin was complete—as well as the cathedral, the monastery of the Greyfriars, St Giles parish church and the Hospital of Maison Dieu were all put to flame. Church and state now came together to oppose him—excommunicated by Bur, Buchan had to appear at the Church of the Friars Preacher, in Perth in the presence of his brothers, King Robert III of Scotland and the Earl of Fife, and the council-general to plead for forgiveness—absolution was granted by bishop Walter Trail, Bishop of St Andrews.|$|E

Sharett [...] "fought a battle of {{telephones}} and cables," [...] Bauer writes, and on 11 June he and the Jewish Agency intelligence group were finally introduced to Brand. The discussion lasted several hours. Sharett wrote in a report of 27 June: [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> a little incredulous, for he said: 'Please believe me: they have killed six million Jews; {{there are only two}} million left alive.'"

2500|$|Following the Japanese {{military}} {{offensive against}} the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur {{to evacuate the}} islands. MacArthur reluctantly left, promising to send reinforcements that never came. In his autobiography, MacArthur recalled {{one of his last}} memories on leaving the Philippines was of Bunker:"On the dock I could see the men staring at me. I had lost 25 pounds living on the same diet as the soldiers, and I <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> gaunt and ghastly standing there in my old war-stained clothes - no bemedaled commander of inspiring presence. ... Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could shut my eyes and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. I could almost hear Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is {{a former}} Anglican church in the hamlet of Warminghurst in the {{district}} of Horsham, one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex. [...] The present building, which is no longer used for worship, has 13th-century origins, but a church may have existed on the site in the 11th century or earlier. [...] Often administered in connection with other churches in the rural area of West Sussex in which it was built–churches at nearby Steyning, Ashington and Thakeham were all involved with it at various times–its congregations declined and closure came first in the 1920s and then for good in 1979, when it was declared redundant. [...] Unlike many ancient churches in Sussex, it was not subject to restoration in the mid-19th century: its interior has been called [...] "the finest example in Sussex of how many <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> before the Victorian restorers". [...] After a period in which the Early English Gothic stone-built church fell into dereliction, prompting one Sussex historian to lament its [...] "unloved" [...] appearance, it was taken into the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. [...] English Heritage has listed the church at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance.|$|E
