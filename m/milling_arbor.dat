50|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of the workpiece may be affected with a built-up edge or dull tool. <b>Arbor</b> <b>Milling</b> can create an untempered martensitic layer {{on the surface of}} heat-treated alloy steels, about 0.001 in. thick. Other materials are affected very little by <b>arbor</b> <b>milling.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Arbor</b> <b>milling</b> is {{a cutting}} process which removes {{material}} via a multi-toothed cutter. An <b>arbor</b> <b>mill</b> {{is a type}} of milling machine characterized by its ability to rapidly remove material from a variety of materials. This milling process is not only rapid but also versatile.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} common {{standardized}} methods of mounting shell <b>mills</b> to their <b>arbors.</b> They overlap somewhat (not entirely) with the analogous joining of lathe chucks to the spindle nose.|$|R
50|$|<b>Arbor</b> <b>milling</b> is {{commonly}} performed on a horizontal milling machine. The tool {{is mounted on}} an arbor/mandrel (like an axle) that is suspended between the spindle and arbor support. This type of machine allows the tool {{to be placed in}} numerous positions in relation to the workpiece.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} tool styles used in <b>arbor</b> <b>milling</b> are: double angle, form relived, plane, and {{staggered}} tooth Among many other tool styles. The double {{angle milling cutter}} can make {{a wide variety of}} V shaped cuts with straight surfaces in the material. A form relieved milling cutter can produce U shaped cuts with curved surfaces, unlike the double angle cutter, into the material. A plane milling cutter can produce surfaces similar to a planer but can make varying contours across the material. A staggered tooth milling cutter can produce a rectangular groove in the material at varying depths and widths. The cutters can be stacked to mill combined profiles. The typical width of cuts made by <b>arbor</b> <b>milling</b> range from [...]25 in. to 6 in, and the typical depths range from [...]02 in. to [...]05 in.|$|R
50|$|The {{workpiece}} {{involved in}} <b>arbor</b> <b>milling</b> {{can be a}} flat material or a shaped material: either one can be worked with desirable results. The hardness of the materials milled should be no harder than Rockwell C25(Rockwell scale), but workpieces harder than this can be successfully milled. Materials with good or excellent machinability include aluminum, brass, mild steel, cast iron, and thermoset plastics. Though initially ductile, stainless steel tends to work harden and thus has only a fair compatibility with this milling process (though {{it is in the}} feasible range).|$|R
5000|$|This process {{progressively}} makes {{a surface}} to the user's specifications as {{the material is}} moved against the milling tool or the workpiece stays stationary while the <b>arbor</b> <b>milling</b> cutter moves across it to provide the desired shape. There {{are two types of}} milling that involve the directional movement of the workpiece, conventional and climb. If the workpiece is moving the opposite direction of the tool rotation this is called conventional milling. If the workpiece is moving the same direction as the tool rotation, this is called climb milling. http://class.et.byu.edu/mfg130/processes/descriptions/mechanicalreduction/arbormilling.htm ...|$|R
5|$|Since the university's {{establishment}} {{in the city}} in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 {{with the arrival of}} the Michigan Central Railroad, and a northâ€”south railway connecting Ann Arbor to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth, with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in <b>milling.</b> Ann <b>Arbor's</b> Jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, Beth Israel Congregation, was established in 1916.|$|R
50|$|West of Hanson Road, {{south of}} Algonquin Road, east of Randall Road, {{and north of}} County Line Roads {{are a variety of}} {{neighborhood}}s, mostly built in the late 1980s and the 1990s. These include Fieldcrest Farms, later phases of the High Hill Farms subdivision, Dawson <b>Mill,</b> Falcon Ridge, <b>Arbor</b> Hills, and Tunbridge. The Algonquin Village Hall and Police Department are located in the heart of this area. High Hill Park and Tunbridge Park serve neighborhood residents. Important streets in this area include Huntington Drive, Harnish Drive, and Stonegate Road. The Golf Club of Illinois abuts this area, as do several retail developments along Randall Road.|$|R
50|$|A {{horizontal}} mill has {{the same}} sort but the cutters are mounted on a horizontal spindle (see <b>Arbor</b> <b>milling)</b> across the table. Many horizontal mills also feature a built-in rotary table that allows milling at various angles; this feature is called a universal table. While endmills and the other types of tools available to a vertical mill {{may be used in}} a horizontal mill, their real advantage lies in arbor-mounted cutters, called side and face mills, which have a cross section rather like a circular saw, but are generally wider and smaller in diameter. Because the cutters have good support from the arbor and have a larger cross-sectional area than an end mill, quite heavy cuts can be taken enabling rapid material removal rates. These are used to mill grooves and slots. Plain mills are used to shape flat surfaces. Several cutters may be ganged together on the <b>arbor</b> to <b>mill</b> a complex shape of slots and planes. Special cutters can also cut grooves, bevels, radii, or indeed any section desired. These specialty cutters tend to be expensive. Simplex mills have one spindle, and duplex mills have two. It is also easier to cut gears on a horizontal mill. Some horizontal milling machines are equipped with a power-take-off provision on the table. This allows the table feed to be synchronized to a rotary fixture, enabling the milling of spiral features such as hypoid gears.|$|R
