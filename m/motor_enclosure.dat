50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized <b>motor</b> <b>enclosure</b> designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The FDM {{numerical}} simulation software, View-Cast system, {{was employed to}} simulate the mould-filling and solidification process in {{low pressure die casting}} (LPDC) of Al-alloy <b>motor</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The distribution of liquid fraction, temperature field and the solidification pattern of casting were revealed and the formation mechanism as well as distribution rule of the potential defects, namely gas pores and shrinkage pores, were predicted. Furthermore the solutions to eliminate them were presented. By reducing the pouring rate, the turbulent flow at the corner of casting had eased, so the gas pores could be eliminated. Then the force-cooling system was installed on the top of mould, which could reduce the volume of liquid islands efficiently so that the shrinkage defects can be decreased to its limit...|$|E
5000|$|TEFC motors are {{constructed}} {{with a small}} fan on the rear shaft of the motor, covered by a housing. This fan forces air over the motor frame fins, and cools the <b>motor.</b> The <b>enclosure</b> is [...] "Totally Enclosed". This means that the motor is dust tight, and has a moderate water seal as well. TEFC motors are not secure against high pressure water nor submersible. They are also not explosion proof without additional modifications.|$|R

40|$|There is {{relentless}} rising {{demand for}} wireless communication and radio frequency hardware in daily life. Applications of everyday wireless communication include: cell phones, smart devices/tablets, {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) tags, medical device location networks, wireless remote electronics, home networks, internet capable home appliances and home electronics. Each application requires a variety of radio frequency hardware to successfully communicate wirelessly. A new and interesting application of wireless communication is implementing a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system with wireless capabilities. The uses for such a HVAC system include: a wireless sensor network (WSN) that can facilitate energy savings operation modes and system status updates, system maintenance requests and updates, remote control of the system, and over the air firmware updates. ^ In this research, a standard HVAC blower motor is provided wireless communications features. Specific challenges of implementing this type of HVAC motor are considered. A standard printed control board (PCB) ultra-high frequency (UHF) F-antenna (FA) is taken and optimized for total gain, and bandwidth. After optimization, the antennas were built and tested using a vector network analyzer (VNA). The test results were then compared to the simulation results to for verification. Once the simulation results were verified, {{a new series of}} simulations were built to test varying environmental effects on the antenna such as the ones from: the PCB board enclosure material, the PCB enclosure material with a thin layer of water, placing the antenna inside the <b>motor</b> control board <b>enclosure,</b> the <b>motor</b> control board <b>enclosure</b> with power and signal connectors, and the orientation within the <b>motor</b> control board <b>enclosure.</b> This research shows the feasibility of implementing a PCB UHF FA to create a wireless HVAC motor, and the effectiveness of the simulation procedures used. ...|$|R
50|$|A Totally Enclosed, Fan-Cooled (TEFC) {{electric}} motor {{is a type}} of industrial electric <b>motor</b> with an <b>enclosure</b> that does not permit outside air to freely circulate through the interior of the motor. An external fan blows outside air over the frame of the motor to cool it. This motor is arguably the most commonly used motor in ordinary industrial environments. TEFC enclosed motors usually cost more than open motors, but offers increased protection against weather, dirt, and moisture.|$|R

40|$|During this semester's work term I designed, built, {{packaged}} {{and tested}} nine channels of isolation amplifiers {{for each of}} the Triple Axis Servo Motor Controllers to reduce the noise on the analog input and output signals from the motor controller that is under test. This assembly {{has to be able to}} be mounted inside each of the two <b>motor</b> controller <b>enclosures</b> so as not to disturb other components in there. This noise gets jumbled together with the signal and distorts the signal by amplifying it or decreasing the signal giving a false reading. Direct connection can also produce zero shifts in the data mechanical loading. This is referenced to as a "ground loop". This noise and ground loops must be reduced or eliminated. This report discusses how to reduce noise and ground produced when the motor controller analog output signals are connected to the data collecting system. The report outlines the parts needed to build the isolation amplifier and its connecting hardware. Another important topic to be discussed will be the actual testing of the isolation amplifier box to ensure correct operation. The operation of the isolation amplifier chip and motor controller will not be discussed in great detail, as that would be another project all by itself. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Future {{exploration}} of the moon and Mars will require systems capable of transporting both humans and cargo in reduced gravity environments. The combination of lunar regolith and reduced gravity creates issues for vehicular traction. NASA is interested in testing transportation systems in lunar environments to establish {{the relationship between the}} weight of a vehicle and its traction abilities on the lunar surface. The greater the mass of a vehicle, the better traction it will have in reduced gravity. However, a heavier vehicle requires more fuel to deliver the payload from the Earth to lunar orbit to the lunar surface and results in a costlier mission. NASA is especially interested in investigating ways to lower the weight of lunar exploration vehicles without compromising their traction. This experiment will observe how different wheel geometries interact with lunar regolith simulant under variable loads in lunar gravity. The project includes building a test apparatus with digital data acquisition, designing a test matrix, performing the experiment in lunar gravity, and sharing the experience with the community. Key components include a DC motor providing enough torque to overcome the static friction of the lunar regolith, software to control the <b>motor,</b> and an <b>enclosure</b> that houses the regolith and the wheel test apparatus. This project is a preliminary step for future research and experiments...|$|R
