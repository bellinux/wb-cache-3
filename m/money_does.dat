This disadvantage for the financially challenged of Germany is greater than in any other industrialized nation. However, the true reasons stretch beyond economic ones. The poor also tend to be less educated. After allowing for parental education, <b>money</b> <b>does</b> not {{play a major role in}} children's academic outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Black {{light is}} {{commonly}} used to authenticate oil paintings, antiques and banknotes. Black lights {{can be used to}} differentiate real currency from counterfeit notes because, in many countries, legal banknotes have fluorescent symbols on them that only show under a black light. In addition, the paper used for printing <b>money</b> <b>does</b> not contain any of the brightening agents which cause commercially available papers to fluoresce under black light. Both of these features make illegal notes easier to detect and more difficult to successfully counterfeit. The same security features can be applied to identification cards.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{deal with}} the foreign {{exchange}} risk is to engage in a forward transaction. In this transaction, <b>money</b> <b>does</b> not actually change hands until some agreed upon future date. A buyer and seller agree on an exchange rate for any date in the future, and the transaction occurs on that date, regardless of what the market rates are then. The duration of the trade can be one day, a few days, months or years. Usually the date is decided by both parties. Then the forward contract is negotiated and agreed upon by both parties.|$|E

[...] At first he said that [...] "the Constitution was wrong," [...] but he later {{said that he}} had misspoken. On November 15, 2011 McGovern introduced the People's Rights Amendment, a proposal to limit the Constitution's protections to only the rights of natural persons, and not corporations.

2500|$|Contains various laws {{concerning}} {{sale and}} exchange. The mere payment of <b>money</b> <b>does</b> not constitute the sale; and the buyer may legally cancel {{the sale and}} claim {{the return of the}} money, unless he has [...] "drawn" [...] the thing bought away from its place: this [...] "drawing" [...] ("meshikah") makes the sale final. Until such act is performed the seller is to some extent a shomer ḥinnam of the money paid. Similarly may the buyer become a shomer ḥinnam of the thing bought, if, on finding that he has been cheated, he wants to cancel the sale, to return the thing bought, and to claim the money back. What constitutes cheating ("onaah") is defined {{in the course of this}} chapter. (See Alienation).|$|E
2500|$|To hedge the {{counterparty}} risk of entering a CDS transaction, one practice {{is to buy}} CDS protection on one's counterparty. [...] The positions are marked-to-market daily and collateral pass from buyer to seller or vice versa to protect both parties against counterparty default, but <b>money</b> <b>does</b> not always change hands due to the offset of gains and losses by those who had both bought and sold protection. [...] Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the clearinghouse {{for the majority of}} trades in the US over-the-counter market, stated in October 2008 that once offsetting trades were considered, only an estimated $6billion would change hands on October 21, during the settlement of the CDS contracts issued on Lehman Brothers' debt, which amounted to somewhere between $150 to $360billion.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{study done}} by Aknin, Norton, & Dunn (2009), {{researchers}} asked participants from across the income spectrum to report their own happiness and to predict the happiness of others and themselves at different income levels. [...] In study 1, predicted happiness ranged between 2.4-7.9 and actual happiness ranged between 5.2-7.7. [...] In study 2, predicted happiness ranged between 15-80 and actual happiness ranged between 50-80. [...] These findings show that people believe that <b>money</b> <b>does</b> more for happiness than it really does. However, some research indicates that while socioeconomic measures of status do not correspond to greater happiness, measures of sociometric status (status compared to people encountered face-to-face on a daily basis) do correlate to increased subjective well-being, {{above and beyond the}} effects of extroversion and other factors.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is useful}} to know both when supervenience does and does not apply. For example, {{the value of a}} piece of paper <b>money</b> <b>does</b> not supervene on the micro-features of the paper it's made out of, because the value of the money is not just {{determined}} by internal features of the paper, but also by a broader distribution of social facts and institutions. The paper alone does not determine the value of the money, so supervenience does not obtain between the value and the paper (though it does obtain between the value of the money and some larger part of the world which includes the relevant social institutions). Some philosophical problems can be stated in terms of questions about supervenience. For example: do mental properties supervene on neural properties? Do the aesthetic properties of an art object supervene on physical properties of that object? ...|$|E
2500|$|The highly {{mixed results}} (along with similar {{results in the}} Dictator game) [...] {{have been taken to}} be both {{evidence}} for and against the so-called [...] "Homo economicus" [...] assumptions of rational, utility-maximizing, individual decisions. Since an individual who rejects a positive offer is choosing to get nothing rather than something, that individual must not be acting solely to maximize his economic gain, unless one incorporates economic applications of social, psychological, and methodological factors (such as the observer effect). Several {{attempts have been made to}} explain this behavior. Some suggest that individuals are maximizing their expected utility, but <b>money</b> <b>does</b> not translate directly into expected utility. Perhaps individuals get some psychological benefit from engaging in punishment or receive some psychological harm from accepting a low offer. [...] It could also be the case that the second player, by having the power to reject the offer, uses such power as leverage against the first player, thus motivating him to be fair.|$|E
