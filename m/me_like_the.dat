Here the {{situation}} is serious. Should any misfortune befall me I count on you, my friend, to care for Abdullah". In Hergé's revised edition, he adopts a more florid prose style: [...] "This is to tell you, oh highly esteemed friend, that I entrust to you Abdullah, my adored son. Because here the situation is serious. Should misfortune descend on <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> hawk on an innocent gazelle (for the world is made of life and death) I am sure that Abdullah will find you with warmth and affection, refuge and peace. And in doing this you will be performing a fragrant act before Allah." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with music webzine Pitchfork, Robyn was asked if [...] "Fembot" [...] represented a dislike for the notion that humans and robots are separate, and she responded by saying, [...] "The classic, dystopian theory about the future is not really as interesting to <b>me.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> book I, Robot is all about these robots that basically went nuts, and it's always because they were wrongly programmed by humans. It's like a mirror of our own psyche. It's almost like the wrong program could be a mental disease." [...] She elaborated that [...] "Fembot" [...] is not [...] "really about the future or about space or anything", {{saying that it is}} about the present time. [...] "Technology is becoming more organic, and using the word 'fembot' or 'robot' in a song makes things more human to me", she said. In {{an interview}} with music website Stereogum, she explained that the song also chronicles her personal experience of [...] "turning 30 and contemplating children". She elaborated, saying, ...|$|E

[...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I want you to see me, in your every dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as those first few times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E

500|$|Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{agreed that}} the episode was [...] "another solid 30 Rock", but was {{somewhat}} less positive, writing that it [...] "didn't quite slay <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> last few episodes have." [...] In addition, Lyons was not thrilled with [...] the Jenna character, reporting [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since we've seen Jenna do something redemptive – and I'd settle for anything not strenuously vacant and narcissistic. I get that that's her bit, but... that note is starting to drive me crazy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning also delivered a mixed review of the episode, writing that he laughed [...] "quite a bit" [...] but said it ultimately [...] "felt like it could have been so much more." [...] Canning also concluded his review by stating that it [...] "fell shy of being an absolute classic." [...] Writing for The Palm Beach Post Kevin D. Thompson said [...] "While last night's episode was far from unwatchable, it wasn't one of the show's best, either. But as I've written before, a so-so 30 Rock is still better than 99 percent of TV's other so-called comedies." [...] Thompson noted that he was not thrilled with the return of Dean Winters as Dennis, and called his plot with Liz and Jenna [...] "the show's least interesting plot".|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} the episode [...] "was 30 Rocks best episode of the season , if not the best episode ever from this young series." [...] Canning also said that [...] "this was just a fantastic, funny episode of 30 Rock. It was also an episode that once again proved the {{character}} of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), who was completely absent from this half-hour, simply isn't necessary when you've got Tracy Jordan talking to a pigeon on a trash can." [...] Canning rated this episode [...] "9.5 out of 10." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that [...] "it's not surprising that – in my opinion, at least – it fell juuuuuuust a bit short. It's {{almost as if the}} funniest parts of the Edie Falco story were played by [...] Wiig in the Lifetime movie." [...] He thought that [...] "the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Overall, [...] another splendid [...] My only beef was with the Verizon bit. 30 Rock normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, and it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> show was trying to have its cake and eat it, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith was {{influenced}} by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. [...] "When you stop and think about it, space is a very romantic thought. It is, to <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of Star Trek," [...] he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using [...] "Ilia's Theme" [...] (later re-recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as [...] "A Star Beyond Time" [...] with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the [...] "Director's Edition" [...] DVD release. Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark).|$|E

2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed {{to be acquainted with}} the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, it sounds to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see why anyone would want to publish it".|$|E
2500|$|Baudelaire had {{no formal}} musical training, and knew little of composers beyond Beethoven and Weber. Weber {{was in some}} ways Wagner's precursor, using the leitmotif and conceiving {{the idea of the}} [...] "total art work" [...] ("Gesamtkunstwerk"), both of which gained Baudelaire's admiration. Before even hearing Wagner's music, Baudelaire studied reviews and essays about him, and {{formulated}} his impressions. Later, Baudelaire put them into his non-technical analysis of Wagner, which was highly regarded, particularly his essay [...] "Richard Wagner et Tannhäuser à Paris". Baudelaire's reaction to music was passionate and psychological. [...] "Music engulfs (possesses) <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sea." [...] After attending three Wagner concerts in Paris in 1860, Baudelaire wrote to the composer: [...] "I had a feeling of pride and joy in understanding, in being possessed, in being overwhelmed, a truly sensual pleasure like that of rising in the air." [...] Baudelaire's writings contributed to the elevation of Wagner and to the cult of Wagnerism that swept Europe in the following decades.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are among}} them {{a few things that}} are not {{completely}} worthless. The music is a bit infantile, plain, spirited; but in the end, the people, our Spanish people, are something of all that. I believe that the people are right when they continue to be moved by Córdoba, Mallorca, by the copla of the Sevillanas, by the Serenata, and Granada. In all of them I now note that there is less musical science, less of the grand idea, but more color, sunlight, flavor of olives. That music of youth, with its little sins and absurdities that almost point out the sentimental affectation ... appears to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> carvings in the Alhambra, those peculiar arabesques that say nothing with their turns and shapes, but which are like the air, like the sun, like the blackbirds or like the nightingales of its gardens. They are more valuable than all else of Moorish Spain, which though we may not like it, is the true Spain.|$|E

Commenting on the {{all-around}} final, Khorkina said, [...] "If I didn't get over the disappointment, I wouldn't be Khorkina. I wouldn't be standing here with the gold medal. It still hurts a lot. It was cruel to all the participants, to vault on a nonstandard height. It's quite possible to get killed. The five centimeters could decide {{the future of a}} sports person.

2500|$|The Flatiron was {{to attract}} the {{attention}} of numerous artists. It was the subject of one of Edward Steichen's atmospheric photographs, taken on a wet wintry late afternoon in 1904, as well as a memorable image by Alfred Stieglitz taken the year before, to which Steichen was paying homage. (See below) Stieglitz reflected on the dynamic symbolism of the building, noting upon seeing it one day during a snowstorm that [...] "... it appeared to be moving toward <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> bow of a monster ocean steamer – a picture of a new America still in the making," [...] and remarked that what the Parthenon was to Athens, the Flatiron was to New York. When Stieglitz' photograph was published in Camera Work, his friend Sadakichi Hartmann, a writer, painter and photographer, accompanied it with an essay on the building: [...] "A curious creation, no doubt, but can it be called beautiful? Beauty is a very abstract idea ... Why should the time not arrive when the majority without hesitation will pronounce the 'Flat-iron' a thing of beauty?" ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the War of 1812, Miller raised a company of local men and traveled to Burlington, Vermont. He transferred to the 30th Infantry Regiment in the regular army of the United States with the rank of lieutenant. Miller spent most of the war working as a recruiter and on February 1, 1814, he was promoted to captain. He saw his first action at the Battle of Plattsburgh, where vastly outnumbered American forces overcame the British. [...] "The fort I was in was exposed to every shot. Bombs, rockets, and shrapnel shells fell as thick as hailstones", he said. One of these many shots had exploded two feet from him, wounding three of his men and killing another, but Miller survived without a scratch. Miller came to view the outcome of this battle as miraculous, and therefore at odds with his deistic view of a distant God far removed from human affairs. He later wrote, [...] "It seemed to me that the Supreme Being must have watched over the interests of this country in an especial manner, and delivered us from the hands of our enemies... So surprising a result, against such odds, did seem to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> work of a mightier power than man." ...|$|E

2500|$|As was {{the custom}} {{of the day in}} her social class, Lady Randolph played a limited role in her sons' upbringing, relying largely upon nannies, {{especially}} Elizabeth Everest. Winston worshipped his mother, writing her numerous letters during his time at school and begging her to visit him, which, however, she rarely did. He wrote about her in My Early Life: 'She shone for <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> evening star. I loved her dearly – but at a distance'. After he became an adult, they became good friends and strong allies, to the point where Winston regarded her almost as a political mentor, more as a big sister than as a mother. She was well-respected and influential in the highest British social and political circles. She was said to be intelligent, witty, and quick to laughter. It was said that Queen Alexandra especially enjoyed her company, although Jennie had been involved in an affair with her husband, the king, which was well known to Alexandra. Through her family contacts and her extramarital romantic relationships, Jennie greatly helped Lord Randolph's early career, {{as well as that of}} her son Winston. [...] In 1909 when American impresario Charles Frohman became sole manager of The Globe Theatre, the first production was His Borrowed Plumes, written by Lady Randolph Churchill. [...] Although Mrs. Patrick Campbell produced and took the lead role in the play, it was a commercial failure. [...] It was at this point that Mrs. Campbell began an affair with Lady Randolph's then husband, George Cornwallis-West.|$|E
2500|$|Boam {{abandoned}} King's parallel story {{structure for}} The Dead Zones screenplay, turning the plot into separate episodes. Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, [...] "King's book {{is longer than}} it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it's episodic. What I did was use that episodic quality, because I saw The Dead Zone as a triptych." [...] His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story, including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor. Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's [...] "triptych" [...] in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff track down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson. Boam said that he enjoyed writing the character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately give up his life for the greater good. [...] "It was this theme that made <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation," [...] he said. In Boam's first draft of the screenplay, Johnny doesn't die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this [...] "trick ending" [...] be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.|$|E
