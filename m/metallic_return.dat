50|$|These {{effects can}} be {{eliminated}} with installation of a <b>metallic</b> <b>return</b> conductor between the two ends of the monopolar transmission line. Since one terminal of the converters is connected to earth, the return conductor need not be insulated for the full transmission voltage which makes it less costly than the high-voltage conductor. The decision {{of whether or not}} to use a <b>metallic</b> <b>return</b> conductor is based upon economic, technical and environmental factors.|$|E

Among the configurations considered in this study, both asymmetrical monopolar/bipolar configuration with <b>metallic</b> <b>returns</b> regardless of grounding and low resistive-grounded/solidly grounded asymmetrical monopolar/bipolar configuration with ground return are effectively low-impedance grounded {{in terms of}} fast transients. Symmetrical monopolar configuration and inductive-grounded asymmetrical monopolar/bipolar configuration with ground return {{can be considered as}} effectively high-impedance grounded in terms of fast transients. The behaviour of the first {{travelling wave}}s is comparable between the configurations within the first group while only comparable to those when the series inductors are large.|$|R

40|$|The charge density wave (CDW) {{transition}} {{temperature in the}} quasi-one dimensional (Q 1 D) organic material of (Per) _ 2 Au(mnt) _ 2 is relatively low (TCDW = 12 K). Hence in a mean field BCS model, the CDW state should be completely suppressed in magnetic fields of order 30 - 40 T. To explore this possibility, the magnetoresistance of (Per) _ 2 Au(mnt) _ 2 was investigated in magnetic fields to 45 T for 0. 5 K < T < 12 K. For fields directed along the Q 1 D molecular stacking direction, TCDW decreases with field, terminating at about 37 T for temperatures approaching zero. Results for this field orientation are in general agreement with theoretical predictions, including the field dependence of the magnetoresistance and the energy gap, Δ_CDW. However, for fields tilted away from the stacking direction, orbital effects arise above 15 T that {{may be related to}} the return of un-nested Fermi surface sections that develop as the CDW state is suppressed. These findings are consistent with expectations that quasi-one dimensional <b>metallic</b> behavior will <b>return</b> outside the CDW phase boundary. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|The {{scheme is}} bipolar {{but unlike the}} Haenam-Cheju connection, which used a {{relatively}} conventional arrangement with two high-voltage cables and a sea return, Jindo-Jeju HVDC system uses <b>metallic</b> <b>return</b> {{with a total of}} four cables: three high-voltage cables and one medium-voltage cable. The high-voltage cables use mass-impregnated paper as the insulation material while the medium-voltage cable uses Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation.|$|E
40|$|If {{one of the}} {{two poles}} will trip for some reasons in a regular bipolar HVDC {{transmission}} without a return conductor, it is necessary to block the other pole temporarily during the transition to a monopolar operation with <b>metallic</b> <b>return,</b> this procedure will take 1 - 2 seconds and will affect the connected AC networks by extra disturbances. The object of this survey has been to answer the question if it is possible to have a balanced bipolar transmission without a return conductor and during a trip of one pole control it as an HVDC transmission with series connected converters by adding the by-pass switches and the logic for a series connected HVDC converter system which means that a shutdown of the transferred power during the transition phases is not necessary. The survey has been performed with the software PSCAD where an already existing series connected converter circuit had been modified to a bipolar system and the control logic for the transition phases has been created. There were some problems with various control signals between the software HiDraw and PSCAD, this was solved by different methods and the result shows {{that it is possible to}} have a transition between bipolar operation and monopolar operation with <b>metallic</b> <b>return</b> without the need to totally shut down the power transfer completely.

All the cables are assumed to have the same characteristic impedance in this paper. Note that in practical systems, the conductor and the insulating layer of the <b>metallic</b> <b>return</b> cables can have smaller diameters compared to those of the main cables due to lower requirements on the return cables.|$|E

Regardless the grounding location a monopole- symmetric system is always used for the HVDC Flexible system. During normal operating conditions, no current passes through grounding path thus it {{is no need to}} set special grounding pole, but when the DC line or converter fails, the whole system will stop running. Furthermore, it may forms a monopole asymmetric structure via grounding path or <b>metallic</b> <b>return,</b> which is similar to a pole of a traditional HVDC transmission system.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} methodology is used {{to analyse}} the travelling waves in a bipolar configuration with <b>metallic</b> <b>return.</b> First, the mutual coupling, in terms of very fast transient between the two poles is shown to be insignificant. Second, {{the influence of the}} number of the parallel branches in the same pole, is shown to be more pronounced in the low-frequency region, which implies that very fast transients are less influenced by the number of the parallel branches. Third, the series inductor at the cable terminal plays vital role in primary protection algorithms based on local measurements. Large series inductors give large margin in both voltage detection level and the time to identify the faulted cable. Fourth, the grounding impedances in a bipolar system have insignificant influences on the first travelling wave.|$|E
40|$|Sea {{electrodes}} {{have been}} used since the first HVDC subsea links were installed in the 1950 s and provide a simple proven solution for the return current path. Today around 30 % of the approximately 40 HVDC subsea links in service use sea electrodes as the return current path under normal or emergency operation conditions. This paper reviews the evolution of interconnectors with sea electrodes and the factors, such as location, environmental impact, current capacity and financial factors (cost, flexibility, losses) which need to be assessed before adopting a sea electrode. In particular findings from environmental studies undertaken on existing sea electrodes are reviewed, as well as, the detailed content of recent Environmental Impact Statements for HVDC projects with proposed sea returns.

40|$|HVDC grids are {{considered}} to be essential building blocks for the future upgrade of the existing AC power system and as a means to transport the expected massive amounts of renewable energy from remote sources to the load centers. HVDC systems exist for over 50 years, yet meshed DC grids do not exist so far. For point-to-point HVDC connections, there is a certain freedom in choosing the configuration and earthing scheme. For a grid, different converter arrangements and earthing schemes can be considered. The choices made will influence how the grid will look like, the components in the grid and their rating, the operating principles, the protection philosophy, {{the degree to which the}} grid is extensible and the overall reliability and inherent redundancy. Clearly, it will influence investment and operating costs as well. This paper provides a qualitative overview of potential grid configurations for DC grids (symmetrical monopole, asymmetrical monopole, bipolar schemes, with and without <b>metallic</b> <b>return</b> and combined systems). The possible earthing options for a meshed HVDC grid are part of this discussion. The extensibility and reliability of the HVDC grid are specifically dealt with. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite {{the many}} {{submarine}} telecommunications and power cables laid world-wide {{there are fewer}} than ten published studies of their environmental effects in the refereed literature. This paper describes {{an investigation into the}} effects of laying and operating the Basslink High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) cable and its associated <b>metallic</b> <b>return</b> cable across Bass Strait in South East Australia. Over more than 95 % of its length the cable was directly laid into a wet jetted trench given the predominantly soft sediments encountered. Underwater remote video investigations found that within two years all visible evidence of the cable and trench was gone at over a third of the transects at six deep water sites (32 – 72 m deep). At other deep water transects the residual trench trapped drift material providing habitat for the generally sparsely distributed benthic community. Diver surveys at both of the near shore sites (< 15 m deep) on the northern side of the Strait also found the cable route was undetectable after a year. On the southern side, where the cable traversed hard basalt rock near shore, it was encased in a protective cast iron half shell. Ecological studies by divers over 3. 5 years demonstrated the colonization of the hard shell by similar species occupying hard substrates elsewhere on the basalt reef. Magnetic field strengths associated with the operating cable were found to be within 0. 8 % of those predicted from theory with strength dropping rapidly with distance from the cable. Beyond 20 m the field was indistinguishable from background...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of installing a 1000 MW power link inside a railway tunnel infrastructure. In particular, the power link should be installed in a train running tunnel, which induces specific constraints like limited available space, limited time access for operation and maintenance of the transmission line due to the railway traffic. The possibility of using a separate emergency tunnel or a pilot one [1, 2] was not in the scope of the project. The actual challenge was to include the cable system whereas the tunnel was originally designed for railway operation only. The paper envisages several technical choices namely AC and DC technologies and demonstrates that the HVDC solution is the only possibility owing to space requirements inside the proper railway tunnel: two poles and a <b>metallic</b> <b>return</b> have been considered for HVDC. The paper highlights only some of the numerous technical issues that have been addressed, in particular: 	the electro-magnetic field (EMF) impact considering the possibility of installing both poles in the same tunnel or one pole per tunnel; 	the electro-magnetic compatibility between the high-speed railway supply and the DC link considering the possibility of harmonic contents in the DC-side and the screening effect provided by the metallic pole cable sheath; 	the safety in case of a pole short-circuit inside the tunnel: theoretical approach and short circuit experimental tests on 300 kV and 450 kV specimens; 	the transmission line fire behaviour inside the railway tunnel from a theoretical standpoint.

40|$|The multi-criteria {{procedure}} {{has already}} been presented in a previous CIGRÉ paper [1] and successfully applied to several existing and planned transmission lines [1  4]. In this paper it has been particularized {{to take into account}} a transmission link whose part of the route has a constrained passage inside a tunnel. The tunnel whose primary purpose could be railway or highway actually becomes a multipurpose system in which railway or road transport and electricity share the same structure. Multipurpose structures have deserved a very careful consideration by CIGRÉ Community that has started two Working Groups aiming at studying this technically challenging option. The harmonious growth of the electric grid requires tools for the evaluation of the social performance of new transmission investments, in terms of economic efficiency, environmental impact and technical capabilities. In particular conditions, like urban areas and possible presence of tunnels, the optimization in planning new Extra High Voltage (EHV) lines has required a methodology aimed at comparing the different technological options in the frame of the reference of different "exogenous" conditions. In this paper the multi-criteria procedure allows investigating on the most convenient (from an environmental and economic standpoint) transmission line option for an EHV link. To this aim, the following technical options have been taken into consideration: an AC mixed line composed of a cascade of overhead and cable lines, bipolar HVDC link with <b>metallic</b> <b>return</b> and an entirely AC XLPE cable line. A strong constraint of the considered lines is that the link must pass inside a multifunctional infrastructural tunnel or penetrate urban areas. For this reason an entirely overhead line has to be discarded. Various performance indicators have been defined. The technical ones are related to power losses (losses in the lines and in the conversion stations for HVDC) and effects of shunt reactive compensation for XLPE cables. The economic indicators take into consideration the installation costs, the costs for operation and maintenance (including the monetary value of active power losses) and those for dismantling {{at the end of the}} line life. With regard to the environmental impact, the indicators are referred to the magnetic field, land occupation and right of way requirements, the presence of compensation equipments, constraints on the use of land, acoustic and electromagnetic pollution, visual impact, disamenities and impacts during construction. The paper will yield two outputs: the best transmission technology from an economical standpoint and that from an environmental one so that each involved subject can clearly weigh the importance of two different results and the respective synergies...|$|E
