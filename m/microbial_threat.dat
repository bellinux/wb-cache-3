40|$|A {{first line}} of defense against {{pathogen}} attack for both plants and animals involves the detection of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), followed by the induction of a complex immune response. Plants, like animals, encode several receptors that recognize different MAMPs.

Responses to MAMP exposure evolve quantitatively in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana, perhaps in response to environment specific differences in <b>microbial</b> <b>threat.</b> Here, we sought {{to determine the extent to}} which the detection of two canonical MAMPs were evolving redundantly or distinctly within natural populations. Our results reveal negligible correlation in plant growth responses between the bacterial MAMPs EF-Tu and flagellin.

40|$|Although phylogenetically unrelated, {{filamentous}} oomycetes {{and fungi}} establish similar structures to colonize plants and they represent economically {{the most important}} <b>microbial</b> <b>threat</b> to crop production. In mutualistic interactions established by root-colonizing fungi, clear differences to pathogens can be seen, but there is mounting evidence that their infection strategies and molecular interactions have certain common features. To infect the host, fungi and oomycetes employ similar strategies to circumvent plant innate immunity. This process involves the suppression of basal defence responses which are triggered by the perception of conserved molecular patterns. To establish biotrophy, effector proteins are secreted from mutualistic and pathogenic microbes to the host tissue, where they play central roles in the modulation of host immunity and metabolic reprogramming of colonized host tissues. This review article discusses key effector mechanisms of filamentous pathogens and mutualists, how they modulate their host targets and the fundamental differences or parallels between these different interactions.

30|$|While most of {{the studies}} focused on lung in CF, a new focus is {{emerging}} which is the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is intensively studied in humans and has been linked to several diseases and phenotypes. The importance of this bacterial community especially relates to the maturation of the immune system. It was observed that the neonatal period is highly important to establish a mature immune system. CFTR mutations affect the gut and airway micro-environment inducing modifications in the colonization process of microorganisms {{even in the absence of}} antibiotics [3]. Patients suffering from CF present with intestinal dysfunction, pancreatic defect, and thicker mucus in the intestinal lumen that will affect the structure and function of this ecological niche [74 – 77]. It is well characterized that the establishment of a beneficial community in the gut is associated with systemic health and immunity at distal sites [78]. One of those distal sites is the lung which is the most important niche under constant <b>microbial</b> <b>threat</b> in CF. The influence of the gut microbiome on lung health has been termed the gut-lung axis. This theory relies on the fact that some microbes in the gut might affect directly the lung microbiome via seeding (during oesophageal reflux) or more likely indirectly via transported metabolites through the bloodstream or by influencing the systemic immune response.|$|E
40|$|Neutrophils {{are armed}} with both oxidant-dependent and –independent {{pathways}} for killing pathogens. Activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase constitutes an emergency response to infectious threat {{and results in}} the generation of antimicrobial reactive oxidants. In addition, NADPH oxidase activation in neutrophils is linked to activation of granular proteases and generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETosis involves the release of nuclear and granular components that can target extracellular pathogens. NETosis is activated during <b>microbial</b> <b>threat</b> and in certain conditions mimicking sepsis, and can result in both augmented host defense and inflammatory injury. In contrast, apoptosis, the physiological form of neutrophil death, not only leads to non-inflammatory cell death but also contributes to alleviate inflammation. Although there are significant gaps in knowledge regarding the specific contribution of NETs to host defense, we speculate that the coordinated activation of NADPH oxidase and NETosis maximizes microbial killing. Work in engineered mice and limited patient experience point to varying susceptibility of bacterial and fungal pathogens to NADPH oxidase versus NET constituents. Since reactive oxidants and NET constituents can injure host tissue, {{it is important that}} these pathways be tightly regulated. Recent work supports a role for NETosis in both acute lung injury and in autoimmunity. Knowledge gained about mechanisms that modulate NETosis may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to limit inflammation-associated injury...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{followed}} up on anecdotal and hearsay evidence that microbial collections were destroyed in the United States following the imposition of the regulations associated with the Select Agents and Toxins List, to validate or refute that information. Using a questionnaire, we documented 13 episodes of microbial collection destruction involving viral, bacterial, and fungal strains, which we believe is almost certainly an underestimate {{of the number of}} collections destroyed. In every case, the motivation for the destruction of the collection was a desire to avoid the perceived burdens of the regulatory environment associated with operating under the Select Agent Regulations. Some institutions that destroyed isolates considered, and in some cases tried, transferring their collections to registered institutions prior to collection destruction but desisted when confronted with transport regulations. Destruction of microbial collections represents a loss of strains and biological diversity available for biomedical research and future mechanistic, forensic, and epidemiologic investigations. Given the rapid evolution of microbial strains, the destruction of archival collections is a potentially irretrievable loss that was an unintended consequence of regulations to protect society against the nefarious use of biological agents. Furthermore, unregistered institutions continue to destroy newly acquired clinical isolates, thus preventing the establishment of new repository collections.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (mAbKT) and {{recombinant}} single-chain (scFvKT) anti-idiotypic antibodies {{were produced}} {{to represent the}} internal image of a yeast killer toxin (KT) characterized by {{a wide spectrum of}} antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. Pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, KT-cell wall receptors (KTR), have proven to be killed in vitro by mAbKT and scFvKT. mAbKT and scFvKT exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against KTR of infecting microorganisms. The swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against <b>microbial</b> <b>threat.</b> Thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mAbKT and scFvKT against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mAbKT and scFvKT generated by hybridoma and DNA recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a KT-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb KT 4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. These bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. RESULTS: According to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mAbKT and scFvKT. CONCLUSIONS: scFvKT exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the dawn}} of the {{antimicrobial}} drug era, resistance has shadowed the success of infectious disease therapy. In his 1945 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Alexander Fleming noted the danger of resistance: “It is not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin in the laboratory by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them, and the same thing has occasionally happened in the body…. Moral: If you use penicillin, use enough ” (1). Sixty years later, our understanding of resistance has grown vastly more sophisticated and the proliferation of new antimicrobial drugs has engendered an equally varied collection of resistance mechanisms (Figure). Resistance is now an important problem in virtually all areas of infectious diseases, including viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases. In a 2003 Institute of Medicine report, Microbial Threats to Health, antimicrobial resistance was noted as a paramount <b>microbial</b> <b>threat</b> of the twenty-first century (2). Some strains of pathogenic bacteria are now resistant to essentially all available antimicrobial drugs, and some remain susceptible to only one. At the same time, what once was an apparent deluge of antimicrobial drug development is now barely a trickle. The lack of new drug classes is a consequence of difficulties in discovery of new compounds that has persisted for many years. In addition, pharmaceutical companies are finding in industrialized nations more potent markets for other disease treatments and lower profit in nonindustrialized countries (3, 4). This trend is reflected {{in the absence of any}} novel class of antibacterial drug approved for use in the United States between 1968 and 2000. Indeed, most of the new drugs approved since 1968 have been chemical modifications of existing drugs. However, since 2000, two new drug classes have been approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (5, 6). Whether this trend will continue is unclear and does not obviate the need for more new classes...|$|E
40|$|Periodontal {{disease is}} {{associated}} with an inflammatory response to a pathogenic biofilm. The host response may cause gingival inflammation, which can progress to irreversible gingival recession, alveolar bone destruction and tooth loss. Enhanced understanding of the host-biofilm relationship may inform novel therapeutic approaches. A key molecule involved in inducing and mediating pro-inflammatory responses are the IL- 17 cytokine family. An in vitro model system potentially provides a platform to investigate biofilm interaction with epithelial cells. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop in vitro mono-species and multi-species biofilms and investigate the survival of biofilms in cell culture conditions, and simultaneously assess the epithelial response to the bacterial biofilms and planktonic cells with respect to viability, apoptosis and inflammatory mediators. This study also looked to determine whether IL- 17 A is expressed within and released from periodontal tissues and to investigate its role in the regulation of epithelial cell cytokine and chemokine production. Mono- and multi-species biofilms of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. mitis were developed, which were assessed for survival in cell culture conditions, recovery from biofilms and morphology. Gingival tissue from patients with chronic periodontitis or healthy controls were analysed for IL- 17 A gene expression by qPCR. Protein expression and cellular localization was determined by immunofluorescence. Single cell suspensions of gingival tissue were stimulated in vitro and IL- 17 A release assessed. Epithelial response after bacterial and IL- 17 A co-culture was assessed. The individual bacteria survived preferentially in multi-species biofilm compared with mono-species biofilm in cell culture conditions. The viability, apoptosis and inflammatory mediator response depended on the type (pathogen or commensal) and form (planktonic or biofilm) of bacteria. Diseased gingival tissues expressed significantly higher levels of IL- 17 A mRNA than healthy samples. IL- 17 A localised to mast cells in the inflamed gingival tissue, and was released in cell culture supernatants following stimulation. Stimulation of epithelial cells with IL- 17 A resulted in the transcriptional regulation and release of numerous cytokines and chemokines. The initial component of the entire investigation has provided a quantitative and qualitative assessment of both mono- and multi-species biofilms that can be used to investigate how oral biofilms interact with the host epithelium. The epithelial-biofilm co-culture model has demonstrated clear differences between (i) planktonic and biofilms, (ii) pathogens and commensals, and (iii) live and dead bacterial challenge. These observations and the utility of the model will provide a platform to investigate key questions relating to pathogen and host within the oral cavity and beyond. From this study, it appears that IL- 17 A plays an important role in the protective periodontal immune response to bacterial pathogens. The upregulation of acute inflammatory mediators (such as IL- 8) will promote neutrophil recruitment and potentiate the removal of any invading <b>microbial</b> <b>threat.</b> Therefore it is important to understand the benefits of this cytokine, before systemic therapeutic agents are used to antagonise its actions. The hope for the future is to unravel the details of the mechanisms involved and thereby identify novel therapeutic targets for inflammatory and infectious disease. ...|$|E

The types of information required are similar despite the identity of the new agent. The key to rapid control is rapid mobilization of research capabilities targeted at addressing critical knowledge gaps. In addition, longer-term research is needed to improve our ability to respond quickly to new <b>microbial</b> <b>threats</b> and help us become more proactive at anticipating and preventing emergence. The type of contingency planning used by the military in anticipating new threats serves as a useful framework for planning for new emergence...|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{biological}} rationale for social regulation of gene expression, this {{study sought to}} identify the specific immune cell types that are transcriptionally sensitive to subjective social isolation (loneliness). Using reference distributions {{for the expression of}} each human gene in each major leukocyte subtype, we mapped the cellular origin of transcripts found to be differentially expressed in the circulating immune cells from chronically lonely individuals. Loneliness-associated genes derived primarily from plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes, and, to a lesser extent, B lymphocytes. Those dynamics reflected per-cell changes in the expression of inducible genes and related more strongly to the subjective experience of loneliness than to objective social network size. Evolutionarily ancient myeloid antigen-presenting cells appear to have evolved a transcriptional sensitivity to socioenvironmental conditions that may allow them to shift basal gene expression profiles to counter the changing <b>microbial</b> <b>threats</b> associated with hostile vs. affine social conditions...|$|R
