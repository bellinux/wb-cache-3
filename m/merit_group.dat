On latest proofs yield bulls were 425  kg higher than merit bulls for Predicted Differences of first lactations, whereas merit bulls had an average Predicted Difference Type, which was 1 point higher than yield bulls.

40|$|Methods for calculating <b>Group</b> <b>Merit</b> (an {{average of}} genetic gain and gene diversity) Gain per year (GMG/Y) were {{developed}} {{for a number}} of breeding strategies involving recurrent cycles of balanced within-family selection. Optima were sought, considering resource deployment and age of selection, {{with the aid of a}} deterministic computer simulator. The breeding strategies compared comprised a single stage of selection (based on phenotype, clone or progeny testing) or two selection stages per breeding cycle. The latter involved a first stage of selection based on phenotype followed by a second stage based on clonal or progeny tests of those selected at the first stage. Genetic variance components, the number of plants deployed, cost and time components were all variable. When heritability is high, phenotypic selection is a superior breeding strategy, but at moderate or low heritability, it is inferior. Strategies including clonal testing were superior and it made little difference if the clone test was preceded by a phenotypic selection or not. A strategy based on progeny testing was improved by a first stage phenotypic selection. In the two-stage strategy, it seemed favourable to delay the phenotypic selection until about canopy-closure, at least if juvenile-mature correlation develops as for growth characters.

40|$|One of {{the most}} crucial stages in the new service {{development}} (NSD) process is concept selection, which is characterized by newly generated alternatives and vaguely defined concept evaluation criteria. Although {{a number of factors}} {{have been found to be}} influential, a lacuna remains as to how to make a strategic decision based on influential factors. This study proposes a systematic approach to evaluation of new service concepts (NSCs) by integrating the <b>merit</b> of <b>group</b> analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in modeling multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems and the strength of rough set theory (RST) in handling subjectivity in concept evaluation. The suggested approach is designed to be executed in four discrete stages. First of all, a hierarchical AHP model for the evaluation of NSCs is constructed in terms of strategy, finance, market, technology, and implementation. Second, pairwise comparisons are made among criteria and sub-criteria, and preferences to NSCs with respect to the sub-criteria are obtained by domain experts. Third, the individual judgments obtained at the preceding stage are aggregated into group judgments. Finally, the NSCs are prioritized based on risk propensity of decision makers. A case study of the video game service is presented to illustrate the suggested approach. We believe that our method can promote consensus building on the promising NSCs. close...|$|R

Using a pre–post-survey case series design, this study evaluates a novel learning activity {{designed to encourage}} self-reflection and cultural competence in an Australian interprofessional education context. Undergraduate health professional students in a large subject viewed three 7 – 15 minute videos featuring interviews with persons of a minority cultural, linguistic, or sexual group who were living with a disability or managing a health condition. Immediately afterwards, students in interprofessional groups completed a structured activity designed to promote interprofessional and cultural reflection. A localised version of a validated scale measured cultural competence {{before and after the}} learning activity. Results suggest the value of video-based learning activities based on real-life examples for improving cultural competence. Despite initially rating themselves highly, 64 % of students (n = 273) improved their overall cultural competence, though only by M = 0. 13, SD = 0. 08, of a 5 -point rating-scale interval.

Suggestions for improving the effectiveness of video-based cultural competence learning activities, based on qualitative findings, are provided. Overall the findings attest to the <b>merit</b> of <b>group</b> discussion in cultural competence learning activities in interprofessional education settings.

40|$|Linkable {{democratic}} group signatures (LDGS) [29] allow {{every member}} of a group to trace the identity of any other member who issued a signature while non-members (with the help of unique pseudonyms) are only able to link the signatures issued by the same signer {{without being able to}} trace the signer’s identity. LDGS avoid centralized management authorities (group managers) and grant each group member the power to trace and identify the signer. Although LDGS add nice properties to group signatures, allowing each member of the group to trace the signer’s identity requires a full trust in each group member not to trace or disclose the identity of the signer without a legal reason (e. g. a dispute). Such a requirement represents a major obstacle in practice. The existence of at least one saboteur member inside the group totally violates the anonymity attribute which is the main <b>merit</b> of <b>group</b> signatures. Such a traitor may reveal the identity of the signers to non-members without being detected. In this paper we introduce a simple, yet efficient traitors resistant LDGS (TR-LDGS) as a security improvement to the LDGS scheme of [29] to resist traitors in the sense that, the power to trace and disclose the identity of the signer must not {{be in the hands of}} each member. Instead, the power to trace and identify a signer will be distributed among the members of the group such that a fraction (majority) of the members may join together to trace and reveal the signer’s identity while no minority coalitions are able to perform this task or to disturb the correct and legal progress of this task...|$|R
