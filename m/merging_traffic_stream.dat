40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the influence of automation support on Air Traffic Controller performance, workload and Situation Awareness (SA). Controllers handle traffic through means of tactical control involving heading, speed and altitude instructions. Future Air Traffic Management (ATM) concepts, such as Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) and NextGen, promote the use of 4 D trajectories, thereby introducing a time-dimension to current control tactics (SESAR, 2007). At present, Amsterdam Area Control (ACC) delivers traffic over to Schiphol Approach control (APP) via three Initial Approach Fixes (IAFs) with a margin of plus or minus 120 seconds between the planned time and the actual time. This variability can make it difficult for APP controllers to <b>merge</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> and build a landing sequence, especially during peak periods. In the future, a change in delivery accuracy to less than plus or minus 30 seconds is foreseen thereby aiming to increase the punctuality of flights...|$|R

This paper discusses the experimental results on a generalized and protocol-independent self-similar traffic generator based on the RPG model of OPNET. The aggregation processes results from <b>merging</b> of multiple <b>traffic</b> traces with various Hurst parameters, where a large set of synthesized self-similar traffic traces have been used. We perform a wavelet-based analysis to investigate the behavior of these aggregated processes. The main conclusion is that the aggregated process still exhibits self-similarity, with Hurst parameter close to the largest one among the underlying separate source traffic. I...|$|R

Traffic Grooming in SONET DWDM ring network is solving a different problem packing <b>traffic</b> into multiple <b>streams</b> of <b>traffic</b> speed in the ring with the aim of saving the use of DWDM SONET devices. Traffic grooming is the process of grouping multiple telecommunication lines, which will determine the <b>merging</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> on each node. In this final project will simulate the planning of transport networks based on DWDM SONET ring network. In this case the traffic grooming will determine the optimization of DWDM SONET ring network planning.

40|$|Recent {{research}} in automated highway systems has ranged from low-level vision-based controllers to highlevel route-guidance software. However {{there is currently}} no system for tactical-level reasoning. Such a system should address tasks such as passing cars, making exits on time, and <b>merging</b> into a <b>traffic</b> <b>stream.</b> Our approach to this intermediate-level planning combines a distributed reasoning system (PolySAPIENT) with a novel evolutionary optimization strategy (PBIL). PBIL automatically tunes PolySAPIENT module parameters in simulation by evaluating candidate modules on various traffic scenarios. Since the control interface to the simulated vehicles is identical to that on the Carnegie Mellon Navlab vehicles, modules developed using this process can be directly ported to existing hardware. This method is currently being applied to the automated highway system domain; it also generalizes to many complex robotics tasks where multiple interacting modules must simultaneously be configured without individual module feedback. 1...|$|R

40|$|A new {{generalized}} bimodal <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> model deriving theoretically (i. e., via some underlying {{model of}} driver behavior) from (local) equilibrium solutions of a kinetic equation of vehicular traffic is presented and {{shown to have}} the correct flow behavior at jam density. This bimodal <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> model depends not only on parameters such as the desired speed w, the headway σ(0) at jam density and the minimum acceptable headway σ(w) at the desired speed {{but also on the}} probability η(k) that a vehicle located at a point at which the density is k will have a leading vehicle at spatial headway corresponding to the jam density.

Based on this new generalized bimodal <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> model, a novel mathematical theory underlying two-regime <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> models, one regime under uncongested free-flow conditions and another during queue discharge, is presented.

40|$|Abstract: Source <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> {{as well as}} {{aggregated}} traffic flows often exhibit long-range-dependent (LRD) properties. In this paper, we model each <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> component {{through the}} multiplicative multifractal counting process traffic model. We prove that the superposition of {{a finite number of}} multiplicative multifractal <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> results in another multifractal stream. This property makes the multifractal traffic model a versatile tool in modeling <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> in computer communication networks. There, a node is loaded by a traffic flow resulting from the superposition of source streams and aggregated LRD (and other) streams. The structure and the burstiness of the superimposed process is studied, and useful mathematical relations are obtained. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new class of traffic {{profiles}} that is better suited for metering bursty Internet <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> than the traditional token bucket profile. A good traffic profile should satisfy two criteria: first, it should consider packets from a conforming <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> as in profile with high probability to ensure a strong QoS guarantee; second, it should limit the network resources consumed by a non-conforming <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> to no more than that consumed by a conforming stream. We model a bursty Internet <b>traffic</b> <b>stream</b> as an ON/OFF stream, where both the ON-period and the OFF-period have a heavy-tailed distribution. Our study shows that the heavy-tailed distribution leads to an excessive randomness in the long-term session rate distribution. Therefore, it is inherently difficult for any profile that limits the long-term average session rate to give a strong QoS guarantee for the conforming <b>traffic</b> <b>streams.</b> Our simulation demonstrates that a token bucket profile that couples the average rate control and the burst size control has a weak QoS guarantee. Based on this result, we propose {{a new class}} of traffic profiles that decouples the long term average rate control from the burst size control. Compared to a token bucket profile, this profile improves the level of QoS for a conforming <b>traffic</b> <b>stream,</b> yet limits the “effective bandwidth” consumed by a non-conforming <b>traffic</b> <b>stream...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{motivation}} {{exists to}} formulate and implement new tools and methodologies {{to address the}} problem of congestion in the National Airspace System (NAS). This thesis presents a novel methodology for allocating aircraft among En Route flight levels as a means to mitigate air traffic congestion and stakeholder operating costs. The core of the methodology is a decision-aiding tool comprised of a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) that is solved using a an A* Search-based Branch & Bound framework. Two metrics, measuring cumulative delay reduction and fuel burn savings, are used to benchmark the performance of the methodology. A combination of these two metrics is also explored as a means to minimize overall airline operating costs. A subsection of the Northeast Corridor is modeled and forms part of the analytic structure used to quantify the potential benefits of the proposed methodology. Simulations are generated from these models in order to gain an understanding of the benefits as they relate to varying NAS conditions. The following scenarios were modeled: 1) A baseline single jetway corridor, 2) Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM), 3) Miles in Trail (MIT) restrictions on corridor traffic, and 4) the merging of Terminal Area air traffic with En route air traffic. Thus, this research also provides a preliminary, quantitative measure of the delay reduction, fuel burn savings and operating cost savings possible under each scenario, within a NAS corridor setting. Results indicate that 8. 5 minutes of delay reduction per flight can be achieved when minimizing air traffic delay. Similarly, 16. 47 kg/min of fuel burn savings per flight can be achieved when minimizing air traffic fuel burn. Instituting RVSM procedures result in an additional 45 % of delay(cont.) reduction. Imposing MIT restrictions result in a 41 % loss of delay reduction savings. These results were obtained for corridor simulations of 30 minutes in duration. Finally, the methodology is shown to be effective for use as a decision-aiding tool to <b>merge</b> air <b>traffic</b> <b>streams.</b> by Antonio Manuel Abad. Thesis (S. M.)
