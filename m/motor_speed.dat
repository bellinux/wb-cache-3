The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162dB. The Concept Design 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.|$|E

The goal {{of this paper is}} to know the performance of prototype control of {{alternating current}} <b>motor</b> <b>speed’s</b> variation based on MC (Magnetic Contactor), PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and microcontroller using remote control. The method of this paper was development aproach which consisted of need analysis, designing hardware and software, manufacturing of prototype hardware and software and testing of prototype performance. Data is collected by performance observation of prototype when it tested, then the data analyzed descriptively.

25|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>speed</b> can {{be changed}} because the torque curve of the motor is {{effectively}} modified {{by the amount of}} resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down. If the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed, the torque will be further reduced.|$|E
25|$|In a WRIM, {{the rotor}} winding {{is made of}} many turns of {{insulated}} wire and is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the <b>motor</b> <b>speed,</b> although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power {{that would otherwise be}} wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.|$|E
500|$|The 147 is the [...] "universal" [...] {{version of}} the 122, {{designed}} for many organs, and has a different amplifier input and <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> control, but is otherwise identical. The signal input is unbalanced, allowing a simpler connection to organs that have a built-in speaker system, such as the Hammond A100, or a Wurlitzer. The <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> switching uses a separate AC signal, rather than the DC voltage control of the 122. In operation, the noticeable differences between the 122 and the 147 are the 122's lower susceptibility to induced noise, and a delay between operation of the speed control and the actual change in speed. As with the 122 and 142, the 145 {{is identical to the}} 147, except that it is housed in a [...] cabinet, and thus slightly easier to move. As with the 122, Hammond-Suzuki manufactures a modern replacement, the 147A. The model X-77, released in 1968, was designed to accompany Hammond's new tonewheel / transistor organ, the X-66. It contained seven different tab controls and six speakers. It has a completely different interface from other Leslies, using a 12-pin amphenol connector.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{prominent}} test {{of executive}} dysfunction {{is known as}} the Trail-making test. This test is composed of two main parts (Part A & Part B). Part B differs from Part A specifically in that it assesses more complex factors of motor control and perception. Part B of the Trail-making test consists of multiple circles containing letters (A-L) and numbers (1-12). The participant’s objective for this test is to connect the circles in order, alternating between number and letter (e.g. 1-A-2-B) from start to finish. The participant is required not to lift their pencil from the page. The task is also timed as a means of assessing speed of processing. [...] Set-switching tasks in Part B have low motor and perceptual selection demands, and therefore provide a clearer index of executive function. Throughout this task, some of the executive function skills that are being measured include impulsivity, visual attention and <b>motor</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The first {{thyristor}} {{devices were}} released commercially in 1956. Because thyristors can control {{a relatively large}} amount of power and voltage with a small device, they find wide application in control of electric power, ranging from light dimmers and electric <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> control to high-voltage direct current power transmission. Thyristors {{may be used in}} power-switching circuits, relay-replacement circuits, inverter circuits, oscillator circuits, level-detector circuits, chopper circuits, light-dimming circuits, low-cost timer circuits, logic circuits, speed-control circuits, phase-control circuits, etc. [...] Originally, thyristors relied only on current reversal to turn them off, making them difficult to apply for direct current; newer device types can be turned on and off through the control gate signal. [...] The latter is known as a gate turn-off thyristor, or GTO thyristor. [...] A thyristor is not a proportional device like a transistor. In other words, a thyristor can only be fully on or off, while a transistor can lie in between on and off states. This makes a thyristor unsuitable as an analog amplifier, but useful as a switch.|$|E

40|$|Modular {{multilevel}} converters (MMC) have {{revolutionized the}} voltage-sourced converter-based high-voltage direct current transmission, {{but not yet}} got widespread application in medium-voltage variable-speed motor drives, {{because of the large}} capacitor voltage ripples at low <b>motor</b> <b>speeds.</b> In this paper, a novel hybrid MMC topology is introduced, which significantly reduces the voltage ripple of capacitors, particularly at low <b>motor</b> <b>speeds.</b> Moreover, this topology does not introduce any motor common-mode voltage; as a result, there are no insulation and bearing current problems. Additionally, the current stress can remain at rated value throughout the whole speed range; thus, no device needs to be oversized and converter efficiency can be ensured. Operating principle of this hybrid topology is explained, and control schemes are also developed. Validity and performance of the proposed topology are verified by simulation and experimental results...|$|R
50|$|To achieve full rated torque, the coils in a {{stepper motor}} must reach their full rated current during each step.
