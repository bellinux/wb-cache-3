5000|$|The {{stations}} transmitter {{was originally}} {{on the north}} side of the Courtney Campbell Causeway near Clearwater. Early in its return to 620 kHz it was able to increase its power by being the first AM radio station in the world to add a second tower and use placement and spacing along with divided power from the main tower to directionalize its broadcast coverage area. The state of the art at the time thought the signal was traveling west to the Mississippi River and then north to interfere with the WTMJ 620 kHz station in Milwaukee. The British engineer phased the new antenna array to produce a null to the radiated signal directly to wards Milwaukee. This fostered a new understanding of RF behavior, having been so successful the Federal Radio Commission in Atlanta reportedly phoned, demanding to know why the station was off the air. As late as the 1990s, the original tower bases remained in their field, the station having moved to straddling the west end of the Gandy Causeway with 501 foot towers on concrete pilings in the Tampa Bay salt water in the early 1950s at 5 kW. A radio war with Cuba granted it an STA to operate at 10 kW from the 1990s on to overcome deliberate retaliatory interference. All RF and electrical power and control cabling was run under the divided Gandy Highway in conduits that have an access manhole in the median and rise up out of the ground to the tower platform on the south side of Gandy [...] "Redneck Riviera" [...] Beach. The City of St. Petersburg eventually placed a channel 38 antenna on top of the north tower and a <b>microwave</b> <b>reflector</b> to deliver the programming to the transmitter building below. The weathered towers were replaced with shorter self supporters in the early 2000s with LED lighting.|$|E

The chief advantage of this approach would be the ability to manufacture the solar collectors in-situ without the energy cost and complexity of launch. Disadvantages include the much longer distance, requiring larger transmission systems, the required [...] "overbuild" [...] {{to deal with the}} lunar night, and the difficulty of sufficient manufacturing and pointing of reflector satellites.|$|R

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{described}} for computing the reflected or scattered field from a smooth body with inflection points. These inflections occur in certain directions at each surface point {{for which the}} total (Gaussian) curvature is zero or negative. For surface illumination {{in one of these}} critical directions, the usual reflection formulas obtained by the high-frequency approximation are inapplicable, and a shadow zone exists in the reflected field. Scattering into the shadow zone is treated, as well as specular reflection. This theory should have a variety of applications such as for certain optics problems, computer graphics modeling of three-dimensional shapes, and the design and analysis of specialized <b>microwave</b> <b>reflector</b> antennas...|$|E

The main advantage he envisions is construction largely from locally available lunar materials, using in-situ resource utilization, with a teleoperated mobile factory and crane {{to assemble the}} <b>microwave</b> <b>reflectors,</b> and rovers to assemble and pave solar cells, which would significantly reduce launch costs compared to SBSP designs.

40|$|International audienceTwo-dimensional {{two-phase}} heterostructures {{have been}} the subject of many investigations including computer simulations. An outstanding issue is the shape analysis of the reflectance for dielectric inclusions of arbitrarily complex geometry. We report on finite element numerical calculations to investigate the effects a fractal-shaped object having an intrinsic complex permittivity with a negative real part embedded in a host matrix with real and positive permittivity can have on reflectance and absorbance of a uniform plane wave impinging on it. The simulations were performed at a wavelength much larger than the length scales of the inhomogeneities. The reflectance and absorbance of the structures are shown to be highly sensitive to the details of the fractal metamaterial environment and to its intrinsic loss. We comment on how these results may be used to provide a quantitative framework for the design, selection, and optimization of artificial metamaterial <b>microwave</b> <b>reflectors</b> and other complex systems yet to be explored...|$|R

5000|$|For most {{microwave}} systems, {{a completely}} non-directional isotropic antenna (one which radiates equally and perfectly well {{in every direction}} [...] - [...] a physical impossibility) {{is used as a}} reference antenna, and then one speaks of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power) rather than ERP. This includes satellite transponders, radar, and other systems which use <b>microwave</b> dishes and <b>reflectors</b> rather than dipole-style antennas.|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{inexpensive}} processes {{have been}} developed for manufacturing lightweight, wide-aperture mirrors that consist mainly of reflectively coated, edge-supported polyimide membranes. The polyimide and other materials in these mirrors can withstand the environment of outer space, and the mirrors have other characteristics that make them attractive for use on Earth as well as in outer space: With respect to the smoothness of their surfaces and the accuracy with which they retain their shapes, these mirrors approach the optical quality of heavier, more expensive conventional mirrors. Unlike conventional mirrors, these mirrors can be stowed compactly and later deployed to their full sizes. In typical cases, deployment would be effected by inflation. Potential terrestrial and outer-space applications for these mirrors include large astronomical telescopes, solar concentrators for generating electric power and thermal power, and <b>microwave</b> <b>reflectors</b> for communication, radar, and short-distance transmission of electric power. The relatively low cost of manufacturing these mirrors stems, in part, from the use of inexpensive tooling. Unlike in the manufacture of conventional mirrors, {{there is no need for}} mandrels or molds that have highly precise surface figures and highly polished surfaces. The surface smoothness is an inherent property of a polyimide film. The shaped area of the film is never placed in contact with a mold or mandrel surface: Instead the shape of a mirror is determined by a combination of (1) the shape of a fixture that holds the film around its edge and (2) control of manufacturing- process parameters. In a demonstration of this manufacturing concept, spherical mirrors having aperture diameters of 0. 5 and 1. 0 m were fabricated from polyimide films having thicknesses ranging from < 20 m to 150 m. These mirrors have been found to maintain their preformed shapes following deployment...|$|R

The mission requirements, developed around high resolution, large area mapping of soil moisture for global crop forecasting, are reviewed. These mission requirements, along with system design requirements, dictate {{the need for a}} reflector in excess of 700 meters in diameter. Conceptual designs for supporting structures and subsystems, including attitude and surface control, are summarized...|$|R
40|$|Nano- and pico-satellites in low {{earth orbit}} (LEO), unlike their larger counterparts, have more {{stringent}} limitations on antenna design due to power constraints that govern the operational frequency and size that defines the mass and volume constraints. High bandwidth applications use higher frequencies and require higher transmission power. High gain antennas can reduce the transmission power requirements. CubeSat’s with body-mounted solar cells are limited in power generation due to limited surface area. Deployable solar panels offer {{a solution to the}} limited power by maximizing the surface area of solar cells exposed to solar radiation. The metallic deployable solar panel support structure can be exploited to behave as an electrical ground and <b>microwave</b> signal <b>reflector</b> for a high gain antenna in several configurations. This paper presents multiple novel high-gain S-band antennas that exploit the structure of a 3 U CubeSat equipped with deployable solar panels for gain improvement. The configuration of the satellite is designed to operate in a low drag configuration by operating outside of the passive gravity gradient stabilized attitude by using passive or active attitude control. Gain improvements of more than 3 dB are obtained through careful packaging. The antenna configurations have a gain of more than 7 dBi and bandwidth of more than 10 MHz. Analysis is provided with considerations of power, satellite coverage, as well as attitude stability. This technique of improving antenna gain can be extended to higher as well as lower frequency of operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} component of radially polarized electric {{field in the}} focal region has attracted particular attention in the laser optics due to its several special characteristics, namely, the directional characteristic on propagation axis, strong intensity and small focal size when tightly focused with high-numerical-aperture optical system, which find applicationssuch as particle acceleration, molecule microscopy, material processing, and particle trapping. It has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated that paraboloidal reflector creates smaller focal size compared with lens. Comparatively {{little attention has been}} paid to its microwave version since, in microwave regime, the directional property in focal region has not been the main interest. Only very recently, after the introduction of planar slot antenna which can generate microwaves with focusing for near field scanning, the {{longitudinal component}} of radially polarized microwavewith the slot antenna has been experimentally investigated. However, the focusing of radially polarized <b>microwave</b> with paraboloidal <b>reflector</b> is much more versatile in applications as in the optical regime. The experimental observation of this longitudinal component is newly performed in this work with a configuration of two-paraboloidal-mirror system. This longitudinal field of microwave and the two-mirror system can also be exploited in some applications such as microwave scanning, microwave acceleration in free space, and creating Bessel-like beamwhich can be used in high resolution tomography, micro-manipulation in optical regime and long range communication in microwave regime. Two applications, microwave particle acceleration and quasi Bessel beam, are investigated in this work. A new method of ultratight focusing acceleration is proposed and a more precise analysis of quasi Bessel beam with variable cone angles is demonstrated...|$|R
