5|$|A Little <b>More</b> <b>Personal</b> (Raw) {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, who praised Lohan's ambition, despite considering it a weak album. The album charted mildly compared to Speak, debuting (and also peaking) at number twenty on the US Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 82,000 copies, and also peaking {{at the same}} position on the Digital Albums chart. However, A Little <b>More</b> <b>Personal</b> (Raw) was certified Gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 500,000 copies. It was also certified Gold in Taiwan. Lohan promoted the album with a few television appearances, including at MTV's Total Request Live, The Ellen Show and the 2005 American Music Awards.|$|E

2500|$|More's {{popularity}} {{recovered in}} the 1960s through West End stage performances and television roles, especially following {{his success in}} The Forsyte Saga (1967). Critic David Shipman said <b>More's</b> <b>personal</b> notices for his performance on stage in The Secretary Bird (1968) [...] "must be among the best accorded any light comedian during this century".|$|R

5|$|Hartmann, a Dutch {{administrator}} of the Kedu region, continued Cornelius's work, and in 1835, the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> than official. Hartmann did not write any reports of his activities, in particular, the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of Buddha in the main stupa. In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty.|$|E

5|$|The record {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, with several publications praising {{it as their}} best album since Mechanical Animals; although others were critical of both its length and <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> lyrical themes. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, and was their second consecutive number one on Billboards Top Hard Rock Albums. It also peaked at number six on European Albums, and within the top 20 in 18 other territories.|$|E

5|$|After {{recording}} several {{songs for}} her movie soundtracks, Lohan signed with Casablanca Records. Lohan's debut studio album, titled Speak, {{was released in}} December 2004 {{and became the first}} high-seller from Casablanca in several years, selling 1 million copies in the United States alone and peaking at number four on the Billboard 200. Though the album received mostly lukewarm reviews, it was certified platinum and sold over 4 million copies worldwide. Lohan's second album, titled A Little <b>More</b> <b>Personal</b> (Raw), was released in December 2005 and featured darker material than her debut had. The album received mixed reviews, and it was certified gold.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{determined}} that London {{should have a}} permanent orchestra of similar excellence were Sir John Reith, director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1928 they opened discussions about jointly setting up such an ensemble, but after 18 months of negotiations {{it became clear that}} the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities. Beecham demanded <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> control of the orchestra and repertoire than the BBC was willing to concede, and his priorities were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio. The BBC went ahead without him, and under its director of music, Adrian Boult, launched the BBC Symphony Orchestra in October 1930, to immense acclaim.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, Gaudí was working on numerous projects simultaneously. They reflected his shift to a <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> style inspired by nature. In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his Casa Calvet. During {{the first decade of the}} century Gaudí dedicated himself to projects like the Casa Figueras (Figueras house, better known as Bellesguard), the Park Güell, an unsuccessful urbanisation project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed the Casa Batlló (Batlló house) and the Casa Milà (Milá house), two of his most emblematic works.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a period}} of {{personal}} and legal troubles with drug addiction, Gil Scott-Heron recorded and released his first album of original material in sixteen years, I'm New Here (2010), {{with the assistance of}} XL Recordings-label head Richard Russell. Produced by Russell, the album served as a departure from Scott-Heron's earlier work, both musically and thematically, eschewing its soul, jazz, and funk styles and social commentary for <b>more</b> <b>personal,</b> reflective lyrics with ruminations on love, loss, and identity, set to contemporary electronic music. It was well received by fans and music critics, who viewed it as a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like a photo album, so every single scene is kind of like a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's <b>more</b> <b>personal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kraft's {{world record}} {{initially}} came under scrunity, {{as it appeared}} that he touched the snow with his backside as {{he was forced to}} squat down on essentially flat ground. However, slow-motion replay analysis confirmed that his landing was valid, albeit with only millimetres to spare. A week later, Planica caught up to Vikersund with a plethora of <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> bests, and three athletes – including Kraft, twice – landing jumps of or beyond 250m. Kamil Stoch would claim the current hill record of 251.5m, with the season finale competition drawing an attendance of 16,500.|$|E

5|$|Maeser {{included}} the Monitorial System from Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster in his teacher training courses. This system suggested that more advanced students monitored the less advanced students {{and that the}} layout of a classroom should allow one teacher to oversee {{a large number of}} students. Maeser believed that this system was flawed, however, because it focused on developing efficiency and disregarded individuality. Maeser argued that the teacher have <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> interactions with students. He implemented his monitorial organization so that each student would be responsible for something or someone else. Students were forced to look outside themselves, creating responsibility and organization.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{throughout}} 2003, Blink-182 marks {{a departure}} from the band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements into their usual pop punk sound. These elements were inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E
5|$|Skirth {{gave the}} memoir to his {{daughter}} Jean in 1975, two years {{before his death in}} 1977 Although for many years she found it too upsetting to read in full, she felt that it was a story that should be shared with others, and in 1999 she donated four of the five ring binders, containing the bulk of the memoir but excluding its <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> sections, to the Imperial War Museum in London, where they remain to this day.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{publication}} of Summer Cooking, David was wooed away from her regular column in Harpers by Vogue magazine, which offered her more money and more prominence—a full central page with a continuing column following, and a full page photograph. The new contract meant she also wrote for Vogues sister magazine House & Garden. Audrey Withers, the editor of Vogue, wanted David to write <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> columns than she had done for Harper's, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients {{and from time to time}} £100 for research trips to France.|$|E
5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} tell a story but {{reflects}} {{different aspects of the}} Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> and intimate reflection.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics {{focus on}} human {{struggle}} and self-determination, A Beautiful Lies lyrics are <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> {{and the music}} introduces screaming vocals. The transformation that resonates throughout the album reflects the personal and artistic changes experienced by the band members {{before and during the}} creation of the record. The album widened the band's sound by combining elements from progressive rock, hard rock and emo. Such alternative rock style has been compared to bands like The Cure, U2 and The Smashing Pumpkins.|$|E
