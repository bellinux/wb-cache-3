500|$|Sherman's public {{assessment}} of California Chrome's poor performances {{was that he}} was still growing and learning how to be a racehorse. [...] But several things began to change. In the fall of 2013, Alberto's younger brother, Willie Delgado, an experienced rider and trainer whose career in Maryland was in the doldrums, moved to California and within a couple of months became the horse's morning exercise rider. At roughly the same time, Alberto was taken off the horse as jockey. In December, California Chrome began wearing a new type of horseshoe. He had developed low heels, and his farrier, Judd Fisher, found a particular style of glued-on horseshoe with a durable, hard, rim pad that raised a horse's heels was suitable for fixing the problem. Instead of gluing it on, Fisher custom-drilled holes into the shoe so it could be nailed to the horse's feet {{in the manner of a}} traditional <b>metal</b> <b>shoe.</b> According to Fisher, nailing on the shoes raised the soles of the horse's feet a little bit farther off the ground. It may have been a contributing factor to California Chrome's subsequent series of wins. Aside from that issue, Sherman described the horse's hooves as generally healthy.|$|E

50|$|Each {{hopper car}} had wheels that were {{equipped}} with an ordinary air brake. The air brakes consist of a <b>metal</b> <b>shoe</b> that presses against the flange of the wheels when the air brakes are activated. The slower a wheel moves, the more efficiently the friction can convert to traction instead of heat. The faster a wheel moves, the more efficiently friction converts the other way around. Thus, air brakes work optimally when traveling at speeds under 25 mph as this is {{the speed at which}} traction is gained more than heat via the input of friction. The effectiveness of the air brakes on MJLBP-11's fully loaded hopper cars (100 tons each on a 2.2% grade) would have had only a limited effect on the braking potential of the train, becoming exponentially weaker and hotter as the speed of the train increased.|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce golf turf damage the {{traditional}} <b>metal</b> spike golf <b>shoe</b> has been redesigned, but shoe-ground biomechanical evaluations have utilised artificial grass surfaces. Twenty-four golfers wore three different golf shoe traction designs (traditional metal spikes, alternative spikes, and a flat-soled shoe with no additional traction) when performing shots with a driver, 3 iron and 7 iron. Ground action forces were measured beneath the feet by two natural grass covered force platforms. The maximum vertical force recorded at the back foot with the 3 iron and 7 iron was 0. 82 BW (body weight) and at the front foot 1. 1 BW approximately in both the metal spike and alternative spike golf shoe designs. When using the driver these maximal vertical values were 0. 49 BW at the back foot and 0. 84 BW at the front foot. Furthermore, as performance of the backswing and then downswing necessitates a change in movement direction the range of force generated during the complete swing was calculated. In the <b>metal</b> spike <b>shoe</b> the vertical force generated at the back foot with both irons was 0. 67 BW and at the front foot 0. 96 BW with the 3 iron and 0. 92 BW with the 7 iron. The back foot vertical force generated with the driver was 0. 33 BW and at the front foot 0. 83 BW wearing the <b>metal</b> spike <b>shoe.</b> Results indicated the greater force generation with the irons. When using the driver the more horizontal swing plane associated with the longer club reduced vertical forces at the back and front foot. However, the mediolateral force generated across each foot in the metal and alternative spike shoes when using the driver was greater than when the irons were used. The coefficient of friction was 0. 62 at the back and front foot whichever shoe was worn or club use...|$|R
