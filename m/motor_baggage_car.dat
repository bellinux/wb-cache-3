2500|$|Although {{passengers}} generally {{were not}} allowed access to the <b>baggage</b> <b>car,</b> they were included in {{a great number of}} passenger trains as regular equipment. The <b>baggage</b> <b>car</b> is a car that was normally placed between the train's motive power and the remainder of the passenger train. [...] The car's interior is normally wide open and is used to carry passengers' checked <b>baggage.</b> <b>Baggage</b> <b>cars</b> were also sometimes commissioned by freight companies to haul less-than-carload (LCL) shipments along passenger routes (Railway Express Agency was one such freight company). Some <b>baggage</b> <b>cars</b> included restroom facilities for the train crew, so many <b>baggage</b> <b>cars</b> had doors to access them just like any other passenger <b>car.</b> [...] <b>Baggage</b> <b>cars</b> could be designed to look like the rest of a passenger train's cars, or they could be repurposed box cars equipped with high-speed trucks and passenger train steam and air connections. A special type of <b>baggage</b> <b>car</b> came equipped with doors on one end to facilitate transport of [...] large pieces of equipment and scenery for Broadway shows and other productions.
