Fearing he <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and kill them all, the sergeant had Johns wait, in the dark, at the nearby Mil's Restaurant.

25|$|On March 17, 2010 Sports Illustrated's Jon Heyman {{reported}} Rangers manager Ron Washington failed a MLB {{drug test}} in 2009. First-time offending non-playing personnel who fail {{a drug test}} or admit to using drugs are not suspended and are subject to counseling and a substance-abuse program. After taking the test Washington called the MLB offices and informed them the test <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> positive. Washington then informed the front office of the Rangers about the test. Washington called a team meeting {{the morning of the}} story to inform the players about the failed test.|$|E
2500|$|When the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League {{started to}} operate in 1946, López stayed with Magallanes for the rest oh his career and also managed the team in part of that season. He batted a paltry [...]216 average and three homers in 28 games, while his 23 RBIs ranked him fourth in the new circuit despite missing {{significant}} playing time due to recurrent injuries. He also realized that his pitching arm was gone, and though he <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> {{for a couple of}} games, he could never again pitch effectively at all, giving up three earned runs on four hits and five walks, while striking one in his final three innings of work. Interestingly, López became the first player to pinch-hit a home run in VPBL history in that season, when he belted his blast off Vargas' ace pitcher Roy Welmaker.|$|E

2500|$|After {{her final}} departure, {{numerous}} rumours circulated in the British press predicting the character's {{return to the}} soap. In 2005 {{it was reported that}} EastEnders producers were attempting to lure Gillian Taylforth back with the offer of a £200,000 a year pay cheque. Gillian said: [...] "I've always wanted to go back because I love EastEnders — I have great friends in the cast and always enjoyed working with Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell)." [...] However, in January 2006 it was announced that the character was being killed off-screen in a storyline to facilitate the return of her young son Ben to his father Phil Mitchell. Taylforth has commented: [...] "I was a bit upset at first because it was 13 years of my life and I didn't like the thought of being killed off. I thought she <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to see Ian and have some illness. But that's the way it goes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, in an {{interview}} with Gamasutra, Rockstar executive Dan Houser revealed the studio may focus on a sequel for Bully once Max Payne 3 is released. [...] "Contrary to a lot of people, we like to {{take a little bit of}} time at the end of a game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see what we should do in the next game," [...] he said. [...] "So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with those guys -- even though it is a property that, like Max, we adore and <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do Max, and then we will see what we can do with Bully." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. {{reviews of}} Brothers in Arms were more positive. Writing for Spin magazine, E. Brooks noted that [...] "Mark Knopfler {{may be the}} most lyrical of all rock guitarists, and when the {{intensity}} of his words approaches that of his ravishing stratocaster licks, the song soars. That doesn't happen as often as I'd like on this new album by a band I've cared about for a long time, but I find myself returning to certain cuts the way one <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to a favorite chair." [...] He singled out the [...] "haunting ballad" [...] "Your Latest Trick", the [...] "acerbic satire of vid-rock culture" [...] in [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] and the [...] "outstanding craftsmanship in the words and music" [...] of the title track, which was [...] "not a new message, but at least something other than sex, cars, or drugs is being talked about here. Take that {{and the quality of the}} musicianship, and you've got a lot." [...] Debby Bull gave the album a mixed review for Rolling Stone magazine, praising the [...] "carefully crafted" [...] effort, writing, [...] "The record is beautifully produced, with Mark Knopfler's terrific guitar work catching the best light". Although she found the lyrics literate, Bull noted that the scenarios [...] "aren't as interesting as they used to be on records like Making Movies". Despite the production values and notable contributions from guest artists like drummer Omar Hakim and the Brecker Brothers, Bull concluded that [...] "the music lacks the ache that made Knopfler's recent soundtracks for Comfort and Joy and Cal so powerful." [...] In Rolling Stones end-of-year round-up of 1985's key albums, Fred Schruers said that [...] "Knopfler's nimble, evocative guitar style and gentle vocalizing are still as appealing as the were on previous scenario-rich albums".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} that, Daddy" [...] {{her voice sounded}} so ridiculously calm; [...] "but we can't afford to wait. He <b>might</b> never <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> you see, and then I should have missed him." ...|$|R
