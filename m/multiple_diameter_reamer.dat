5000|$|Reamed {{holes are}} used to create holes of precise {{circularity}} and size, for example with tolerances of -0/+0.02 mm(.0008") This will allow the force fitting of locating dowel pins, which need not be otherwise retained in the body holding them. Other holes, reamed slightly larger in other parts, will fit these pins accurately, but not so tightly as to make disassembly difficult. This type of alignment is common in the joining of split crankcase halves such as are used in motorcycle motors and boxer type engines. After joining the halves, the assembled case may then be line bored (using what is in effect a large <b>diameter</b> <b>reamer),</b> and then disassembled for placement of bearings and other parts. The use of reamed dowel holes is typical in any machine design, where any two locating parts have to be located and mated accurately to one another - typically as indicated above, to within 0.02 mm or less than [...]001".|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{we present}} model for {{effective}} and fast design of both squarely and hexagonal InP NW arrays {{to achieve the}} highest light harvesting for photovoltaic application. Geometrical dimensions for vertically aligned single, double, and <b>multiple</b> <b>diameters</b> of NW arrays are investigated. Compared with time-consuming FDTD simulations, our predicted maximal short-circuit current densities with calculated three-dimensional NW arrays remain tolerances below 2.2 % for all cases. For single diameter NW arrays, the optimal diameter is 184  nm which is only 4  nm difference to the reported highest efficiency InP NW solar cells. In the <b>multiple</b> <b>diameter</b> NW arrays, the diameters {{of the rest of}} NWs are optimized to satisfy the conditions that they support only one resonant mode and the corresponding wavelengths match the absorption valley of the major NWs. Moreover, the FR of the NW array is optimized to be 0.2 by creating an effective medium layer which is regardless of the diameter, periodicity, and arrangements of NWs. Compared with the optical modeling, the predicted highest short-circuit current densities for single diameter NW arrays lie within 0.33 and 0.1 % tolerance for squarely and hexagonal NW array. The arrangements of NW array have little influence on the light absorption with optimal geometrical parameters, but the coupling among neighboring NWs becomes serious for <b>multiple</b> <b>diameter</b> NWs at large FR value. Squarely arranged four diameter NW arrays were also presented and the highest short-circuit current densities predicted to be 33.13  mA/cm 2 with a low tolerance of 2.2 %.

5000|$|The {{geometry}} {{of a hole}} drilled in metal by a twist drill may not be accurate enough (close enough to a true cylinder of a certain precise diameter) and {{may not have the}} required smooth surface finish for certain engineering applications. Although modern twist drills can perform excellently in many cases—usually producing sufficiently accurate holes for most applications—sometimes the stringency of the requirements for the hole's geometry and finish necessitate two operations: a drilling to slightly undersize, followed by reaming with a reamer. The planned difference between the drill <b>diameter</b> and the <b>reamer</b> <b>diameter</b> is called an allowance. (It allows for the removal of a certain small amount of material.) The allowance should be < 0.2 mm (.008 in) for soft materials and < 0.13 mm (.005 in) for hard materials. Larger allowances can damage the reamer. The drilled hole should not be enlarged by more than 5% of the drilled diameter. Drilling followed by reaming generally produces hole geometry and finish that is as close to theoretical perfection as possible. (The other methods of hole creation that approach nearest to perfection under certain conditions are boring single-point boring and internal cylindrical grinding.) ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Insertion of rigid uniplane bent femoral nails {{through the}} piriform fossa has been {{reported}} to cause neurovascular complications. New nails were designed for more lateral entry points. However, these may be associated with a higher risk of iatrogenic fractures. This study investigated if two differently bent nails with more lateral entry points induce higher cortical bone strains than a uniplane bent nail introduced through the piriform fossa. Methods: Three groups of 8 cadaveric femurs were instrumented using the following nail systems and entry points: Cannulated Femoral Nail, piriform fossa; Antegrade Femoral Nail, trochanteric tip; and helical nail, lateral of the trochanteric tip. During insertion, the maximum principal bone strains were recorded at 9 locations at the proximal femur and the diaphysis. The occurrence of iatrogenic fractures or fissures was documented. Results: The highest strains recorded were between 2000 and 4500 µm/m and mainly located at the posterior aspect of the greater trochanter and at the medial side of the entry point. In most of these cases fissures or fractures occurred, the number of which was higher for the trochanteric tip group as compared with the other groups. This was thought to be due to the thin cortical walls {{as a result of the}} larger <b>reamer</b> <b>diameter</b> in this group. Low strains (below 2000 µm/m) occurred at the medial cortex where the laterally inserted nails were expected to impinge. Conclusions: Bone strains at the medial impingement location were low for all nails. Entry portals with thin cortical walls due to, for example, larger <b>reamer</b> <b>diameters</b> and a small greater trochanter seem to be more susceptible to insertion accuracy, which may influence strain and fissure or fracture occurrence. Furthermore, we do not recommend determination of the entry point of laterally inserted nails based solely on anatomic landmarks of the greater trochanter because this may influence insertion accuracy. This implies that biplanar imaging is important for accurate and safe insertion of laterally started nails...|$|R

Motivated by this challenge, a carbon nanotube (CNT) based multiple spectrum IR camera was developed, which used nano-size CNT as the functional element of IR detectors, integrating into a novel camera architecture.

IR detectors using multi-wall CNT (MWCNT), comprising of CNTs with <b>multiple</b> <b>diameters,</b> demonstrated that they can effectively detect multiple-spectrum IR signals at room temperature, which is difficult for detectors using planar materials due to the high noise and single bandgap energy of bulk semiconductors.

40|$|ABSTRACT Absorption {{of water}} in {{concrete}} is often described by the simple linear water uptake vs. square-root-of-time law. However, a deviation from this behaviour is frequently seen depending on factors such as initial water content, water/binder ratio and specimen thickness. The deviation increases with thickness (typically from 25 to 100 mm) and is seen even for very dry specimens with capillary pores. We have applied Laplaces law for suction created under a curved meniscus between air and water to series of pipes with different lengths and radii. The resulting analytical model was first compared with numerical simulations at abrupt reduction or increase of pipe radius showing good agreement. Then a complete second order equation describing {{the relation between the}} capillary suction and the suction time was developed. Varying geometries of the pipes of the capillary system were investigated including the effects on the flow rate of varying combination of lengths, radii and sequence. The results showed that largest flow reductions occurred with very narrow sections causing a blocking, reducing the capillary flow rate vs. square root of time {{in the same manner as}} in concrete.

50|$|Crown spread is {{a measure}} of the {{footprint}} or plan area of the crown of the tree expressed as a diameter. The most basic crown spread measurement is the average length of two lines across the crown area. The first measurement is made along the longest axis of the crown from one edge to the opposite edge. A second measurement is taken perpendicular to the first line through the central mass of the crown. The two values are averaged to calculate crown spread. A second method is to take a series of four or more spokes running from the side of the center of the trunk to the edge of the crown. The more spokes measured the better the crown size is represented. The crown spread is twice the average of all of the spokes. For trees in open areas, crown spreads can also be measured where high-enough-resolution photos are available using Google Earth. There are length measurements tools built into the program that will allow <b>multiple</b> <b>diameters</b> across the crown to be measured or averaged.

This {{is part of}} an on-going research effort centered on a test facility that assembles 1 inch x 2 m identical struts into an 8 m diameter x 1. 5 m deep platform truss. A detailed description of the test facility was published. The end-effector being used for the LaRC assembly demonstration is quite suitable for the Precision Segmented Reflector or other precision applications. These require high stiffness provided by mechanical joint preloads. Stiffness obtained in this manner is only required and provided over a load range far less than the ultimate strength of the strut tubes. Beyond this useful range, truss behavior is somewhat unpredictable. Mechanically preloaded joints of this type are less suitable for applications such as the Aero Brake where predictable strength and stiffness are required over a greater fraction of the load bearing capacity of component parts. Preliminary studies of the Aerobrake support truss indicate that struts of at least 3 different diameters and various lengths would improve performance. The double-ended end-effector currently in service is designed for only one diameter and length. Anticipated single-ended versions can accommodate varying lengths but not <b>multiple</b> <b>diameters.</b> Tradeoff considerations for welded joints relative to their mechanically preloaded counterparts are presented. Conclusions from this research are as follows: (1) repair by cut and re-weld on the original weld site should be research; (2) welded joints, though repairable, should not be used where high repair frequencies are anticipated; and (3) welded joints should be considered for an Aero Brake truss...|$|R
50|$|Nesting Baskets are {{a series}} of {{lightship}} baskets made of diminishing size designed to fit neatly inside one another. Nesting baskets began being made early on aboard the Nantucket Lightships. The smallest baskets can be the size of a thimble with only a half-inch <b>diameter</b> to <b>multiple</b> feet in <b>diameter.</b> In nesting basket sets though it is more common to see a range between a two-inch diameter basket and a fourteen-inch diameter.|$|R
