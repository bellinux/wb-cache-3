50|$|Boċċi is the <b>Maltese</b> <b>version</b> of the Italian game of bocce, French pétanque and British bowls. Other than certain {{differences}} in {{rules and the}} ground on which the game is played, {{one of the most}} obvious differences between Maltese boċċi and foreign equivalents is the shape of the bowls themselves which tend to be cylindrical rather than spherical in shape. Many small clubs (usually called Klabbs tal-Boċċi in Maltese) can be found in Maltese and Gozitan localities, and are usually well-frequented and are quite active on a local and European level.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{military}} presence meant a market of a garrison {{and their families}} and, later, mass tourism from the UK. British food products, condiments and sauces like English mustard, Bovril, HP Sauce and Worcestershire sauce are still a subtle but pervasive presence in Maltese cooking. Other imports were only nominal. While the Maltese word [...] "aljoli" [...] {{is likely to be}} a loan word, the <b>Maltese</b> <b>version</b> of the sauce does not include any egg as in aioli; instead it is based on herbs, olives, anchovies and olive oil. Similarly, while the Maltese word [...] "taġen" [...] is related to [...] "tajine" [...] in Maltese the word refers exclusively to a metal frying pan.|$|E

The various transcriptions documented since 1725 constitute an indirect reflex of the complex trajectory which written Maltese underwent until it achieved its present codified form. peer-reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Peter Caxaro was {{virtually}} unknown {{until he was}} made famous in 1968 by {{the publication of his}} Cantilena by the Dominican Michael Fsadni and Godfrey Wettinger. It was Michael Fsadni who discovered the Cantilena on September 22, 1966, {{at the back of the}} third page from the last in the first of Reverend Brandan Caxaro’s notarial registers (1533-1536), currently numbered R175, in the Notarial Archives, Valletta. Caxaro’s work was actually transcribed by Rev. Brandan himself in its original <b>Maltese</b> <b>version.</b> The discovery was encountered with enthusiasm within scholarship circles since it had eventually given Maltese literature its greatest boost for a very long time. It had taken the authors about two years before they were able to present Caxaro’s Cantilena to the general public.|$|E

40|$|Background: Investigating {{beliefs about}} {{medicines}} {{has been of}} interest over the past years, with studies aiming to better understand theoretical reasons behind development of such beliefs. Objective: This study aimed to produce a culturally and contextually appropriate version of the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) in the Maltese language and to assess its psychometric properties. Methods: Medication beliefs were evaluated using the BMQ which {{is divided into two}} sections: BMQ-General (sub-scales: Overuse and Harm, 4 items per sub-scale) and BMQ-Specific (sub-scales: Necessity and Concerns, 5 items per sub-scale). Following translation/back translation, the <b>Maltese</b> <b>version</b> of the BMQ was applied to patients having asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease or depression who attended out-patients’ clinics at the main state general hospital in Malta between June and September 2013. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, alpha, was used to determine internal consistency of the BMQ and Principal Component Analysis using Varimax rotation with Kaiser normalisation was carried out to analyse component loading of the items on the respective sub-scales. Results: The <b>Maltese</b> <b>version</b> of the BMQ showed acceptable internal consistency for the harm scale (alpha= 0. 56), the necessity scale (alpha= 0. 73) and the concerns scale (alpha= 0. 66), however the overuse scale gave poor internal consistency (alpha= 0. 48) due to the item on natural remedies which posed some difficulty in the Maltese sample. The final solution for Principal Component Analysis yielded a four-factor structure representing the 4 sub-scales of the BMQ, with results being comparable to previous studies out in different languages. Conclusion: The <b>Maltese</b> <b>version</b> of the BMQ was found to have acceptable psychometric properties for the beliefs about medicines in the Maltese population...|$|E

40|$|Lorenzo Hervas y Panduro (1735 - 1809) was a Spanish Jesuit, polyglot, and renowned philologist. His undisputed {{masterpiece}} is the 22 -volume cosmological tract entitled Idea dell'Universo, Cesena, 1778 - 92. Volumes XVII (Catalogo delle lingue conosciute, 1784), XX (Vocabolario poligloto, 1787), u XXI (Saggio pratico delle lingue, 1787) of this encyclopedia contain {{substantial information}} on the Maltese language, including some interesting word-lists. In the latter work, he even provides the <b>Maltese</b> <b>version</b> of the Pater Noster. Hervas based much of his deliberations on what he read in Agius de Soldanis' Della Lingua Punica, Rome, 1750; those words {{not found in the}} Gozitan's opus are therefore more attention-grabbing. In his works, Hervas always refers to Maltese as 'Punico-Maltese'; however, 'en passant', he also tries to demonstrate its affinity with other Semitic languages such as Hebrew, Ethiopic, and Arabic. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman, 1997) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used measures of mental health in children and young people and has been translated into more than forty languages. This paper discusses the translation of the SDQ in Maltese and explores the structure and use of the teacher and parent Maltese translations. 4797 school teachers and 2865 parents completed the Maltese teacher and parent SDQ respectively. The results indicate that the Maltese SDQ, particularly the teacher version, meets the basic psychometric properties which make it a useful index of social, emotional and behaviour difficulties and prosocial behaviour amongst Maltese children and young people. Exploratory factor analysis suggests that the <b>Maltese</b> <b>version</b> clearly discriminates between difficulty and prosocial behaviour, and that it may be closer in fit to a three factor model, namely internalized difficulties, externalized difficulties and prosocial behaviour. While there are a number of variations, which may be explained by the local educational and socio-cultural context, Maltese mean scores are quite comparable with international SDQ norms. In view of a number of limitations, however, the use of the Maltese SDQ needs to be used with caution and further research into its psychometric properties is suggested...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{two studies}} conducted {{over several years}} {{in the field of}} psychological wellbeing within the National Health System in Malta. The thesis is entitled' Assessing and promoting psychological wellbeing among healthcare employees'. The first study in this project aimed at assessing the psychological wellbeing of all the healthcare employees working within the NHS in Malta while the second study aimed at promoting psychological wellbeing {{with a small group of}} physiotherapists working within an NHS Outpatients Clinic in Malta. A further aim of this thesis was to learn more about the possibility of emancipatory change through empowerment, drawing from a Participatory Action Research (PAR) design. Incorporating the two studies exemplified the values in Counselling Psychology, in taking a detailed assessment of the context and the lived experience of the people being studied and then helping in bringing about a change in the situation for the better through co-participation and empowerment of the research participants. The experience of conducting this research has 'enabled the researcher to further develop the value of pragmatism as a way of appreciating the use of both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. Pragmatism also allowed the researcher to embrace methods that were appropriate and is thus resonant with the value system of the researcher to be driven by the aims of the research. Empowerment was a recurring theme within the two studies. Together, the two studies can be seen as a research endeavour with three aims: 1. To assess and explore the psychological wellbeing of the employees working within the Maltese National Health System. 2. To translate and examine the factor structure of the <b>Maltese</b> <b>version</b> of the GHQ- 28. 3. An attempt to enhance the current situation in a way that could potentially lead to further positive changes in the future through the empowerment of the participants themselves and the insights they gain during this process. Study 1 assessed the wellbeing of employees from different occupational groups who filled in the General Health Questionnaire - 28 (N= 1 13 1). Furthermore, in this study five focus groups were conducted with two directors, five physiotherapists, five nurses, nine nursing officers and four health inspectors. The use of a mixed methods research design provided more depth to the analysis as the qualitative data complemented the quantitative data. This provided the basis for Study 2 in which a Participatory Action Research design was utilized with a small group of five physiotherapists. The outcome of this research benefited other employees within the organization, and can be further applied with other occupational groups. The relative lack of empirical research about the psychological wellbeing of health care employees in Malta to date highlights the significance of this thesis. The findings from this thesis will contribute to the understanding of the significance of utilizing PAR as an intervention designed to promote psychological wellbeing within organizations. Furthermore, the experience of the participants in working within this particular organization may be generalized to other related settings. This thesis can be an inspiration to those who aspire to empower others within the organization. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
