In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow geodesics of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of gravity is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the <b>mechanical</b> <b>resistance</b> of matter prevents us from doing so.|$|E

40|$|A new mean of {{assembling}} steel to aluminiumwas developed, following previouswork by Germanworkers [1]. In this newmethod, a laser-induced aluminium {{melt pool}} spreads and wets a solid steel, to generate, after solidification a sound and resistant interface layer. Joint properties were investigated, {{in terms of}} surface aspects, interface microstructures and <b>mechanical</b> <b>resistances</b> under tensile testing, for non-galvanized and galvanized DC 04 steels. Thermal and diffusional finite element (FE) simulations were also carried out to calculate temperature history at interfaces, and reaction layer thickness. The 2 – 20 m thick reaction layers formed all along the interface {{were found to be}} mostly composed of Fe 2 Al 5 intermetallic compound with a high hardness (1200 HV) and rather low ductility (presence of solidification cracks). The presence of a 10 m thick Zn layer on the steel was shown to have a beneficial influence on the wetting characteristics of the joint, despite the formation of occluded pores in the melt pool due to Zn vaporisation. FE thermal modelling evidenced 760 – 1020 ◦C wetting temperatures at the interface between DC 04 low carbon steel and 6016 aluminium sheets, with time maintains of the melt pool in the 0. 2 – 0. 5 s range, resulting in high-speed reaction kinetics. Using these temperature data, diffusion calculations were shown to provide a rather good prediction of intermetallic thicknesses. Tensile tests were considered on aluminium–steel lap joints and evidenced higher <b>mechanical</b> <b>resistances</b> (220 N/mm linear tensile strength) on galvanized steels, provided that fluxing of the steel surfacewas carried out prior to welding to avoid zinc vaporisation. Comparatively, non-galvanized assemblies exhibited much lower <b>mechanical</b> <b>resistances</b> (170 N/mm resulting in a 90 MPa interfacial shear strength). It was concluded that the laser-induced wetting technique is a rather effective way for generating Al-steel joints without filler material, and that it should be considered as a competitive technique versus solid assembly modes (friction stir welding...) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Needlepunched {{nonwoven}} geotextiles {{are widely}} used for various civil engineering applications. These applications are required to perform more than one function, i. e., filtration, separation, protection, drainage, and reinforcement. Reinforcement is a complex phenomenon and strongly depends upon the fabric’s dimensional and mechanical properties {{in addition to the}} soil–geotextile interaction. In this study, the effect of process parameters including web area density, punch density, and depth of needle penetration has been investigated on dimensional (area density and thickness) and <b>mechanical</b> (puncture <b>resistance</b> and tensile strengths in the machine and cross-machine directions) properties of needlepunched nonwoven geotextiles. These process parameters are then empirically related with the fabric properties using multiple regression technique. The anisotropic characteristics of needlepunched nonwoven geotextiles tensile properties have also been discussed.
