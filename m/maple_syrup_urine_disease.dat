40|$|Abstract. Inherited {{metabolic}} diseases identified {{currently in}} humans exceed 500, from {{which more than}} 100 are inborn errors in amino acids metabolism. Phenylketonuria (PKU) and <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>urine</b> <b>diseases</b> (MSUD) are autosomal recessive disorders caused by deficiency of enzymes implicated in the metabolism of phenylalanine (Phe) and branched chain aminoacids. PKU and MSUD lead to mental retardation unless the newborns are maintained on strict diet, free of Phe and, respectively of branched chain aminoacids. The early diagnosis of these two diseases is extremely important for the newborns life. An ID-GC/MS method is proposed for the quantitation of Phe, Tyr, Leu, Val and Tyr in blood spots. Aminoacids are extracted from blood spots (20 µl blood) prelevated from newborns on filter paper with methanol:HCl and derivatized as N-trifluoroacetyl butyl esters. A Trace DSQ Thermo Finnigan quadrupole mass spectrometer in the EI mode coupled with a Trace GC and a capillary column Rtx- 5 MS was used. Two temperature programs were used for scan mode and SIM (selected ion monitoring) mode. The method was applied for control subjects and PKU patients. All the BIA positive patients {{have high levels of}} Phe (89 - 143 µg/ml). The Phe/Tyr ratio was 0. 60 for control samples and ranged between 1. 86 and 4. 63 in the PKU patients. The proposed ID-GC/MS method is minimum invasive, sensitive, rapid and inexpensive and allows the simultaneous quantitation of several aminoacids in small blood samples. This method can be used for the newborns screening for PKU and MSUD...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{quantitative}} analysis of amino acids forms {{an important part}} of targeted metabolic profiling as deviations from normal amino acid profiles can be indicative of several inborn metabolic disorders. A variable-length method development strategy for HPLC analysis on superficially porous particle columns using UV detection is proposed for the separation of 21 primary amino acids. This strategy consists of the evaluation of a large set of gradient and mobile phase compositions on short columns with different stationary phase properties to rapidly determine the best separation conditions leading to the highest number of separated peaks. These conditions are subsequently used to optimize the separation on a longer column length benefitting from its higher separation performance. A minimum critical resolution of 2. 0 and a maximum analysis time of 10 min were imposed to allow for accurate, robust and rapid quantitation of all amino acids over a large linear range. For amino acids playing a key role in commonly encountered amino acid and urea cycle disorders, a minimum critical resolution of 2. 5 was pursued. Mass spectrometry was used for fast peak tracking during the method development procedure. It was demonstrated that the retention behavior of the studied amino acids is more pressure than temperature dependent. This allowed performing the entire method development strategy at the same maximum pressure on all column lengths, while preserving the retention profile, resulting in a significant time profit for the initial scouting runs. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by analyzing serum samples of several neonates diagnosed with metabolic disorders such as <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>urine</b> disorder, phenylketonuria and citrullinemia. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{molecular}} bases of <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> <b>urine</b> dis-ease by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA se-quence, and the genome of the affected enzyme. The branched chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) activity in the pa-tient was 4. 2 - 4. 5 % of the control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E 2 subunit of BCKDH (M, 52, 000) was ab-sent and another protein band with an M, of 49, 000 was pres-ent. We amplified the cDNA of the E 2 subunit obtained from the patient's cell using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNA, in which a 78 -bp deletion was identified. The consanguineous parents and a sister had two species of mRNA; the one corresponding to the normal E 2 subunit {{and the other with}} a 78 -bp deletion, whereas findings in a brother were normal. The molecular size of the translation products as deduced from the abnormal mRNA sequence was compatible with an abnormal protein band (M, 49, 000) de-tected in the patient's cells by immunoblot analysis. Analysis of genomic DNA of BCKDH-E 2 subunit revealed that the 78 -bp deletion in the mRNA was caused by an exon skipping due to a single base deletion in the 5 '-splice donor site. As a result ofthe mutation, part ofthe inner E 2 core domain was omitted. The specified region of the inner E 2 core domain was highly homologous to the region of the E 2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutalate dehydrogenase. These ob-servations imply the biological importance of the region in the inner E 2 core domain ofBCKDH to maintain normal function of the activity. (J. Clin. Invest. 1991. 87 : 1207 - 1211.)

40|$|AbstractMaple <b>syrup</b> <b>urine</b> <b>disease</b> (MSUD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by defective {{function of the}} mitochondrial branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex. Mutations in both alleles of any of three genes for component proteins result in the clinical phenotype. Two discrete mutant alleles for the E 1 β subunit of the decarboxylase component in a proband with MSUD are defined and parental origin of each allele identified. The maternal mutation, an A to T transversion at nucleotide 526 in the coding sequence, potentiates an asparagine to tyrosine change at position 126 (N 126 Y). The paternal mutant allele contains a C to T transition at nucleotide 970 introducing a stop codon (R 274 *). Western blot analysis revealed a 75 % reduction in the E 1 β-N 126 Y protein and an absence of the R 274 * truncated protein in proband cells. Both mutant proteins could be synthesized, imported into mitochondria, and processed in vitro. Functional analysis of the mutant proteins provided new information {{on the role of}} E 1 β in the activity of BCKD. In vivo the E 1 β-N 126 Y protein associated into macromolecular complexes indistinguishable from those formed with the wild type E 1 β protein. However, catalytic activity of these complexes in proband cells was < 1 % of wild type activity. Alignment comparisons with other thiamin pyrophosphate-requiring enzymes suggests the N 126 Y substitution could interfere with interactions of the protein with the cofactor causing inactivity. The truncated E 1 β-R 274 * protein is unstable and not found in mitochondria from the patient derived cells...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundMaple <b>syrup</b> <b>urine</b> <b>disease</b> (MSUD) {{is a rare}} {{inborn error}} of {{metabolism}} caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex. Mutations {{in any one of}} the three different genes encoding for the BCKD components, namely, BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT, may be responsible for this disease. In Taiwan, few MSUD cases were diagnosed clinically, and most of these patients are from Aboriginal tribes. Materials and methodsTo identify and detect the carrier frequency of MSUD in Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes, we performed biochemical and molecular studies from peripheral blood in MSUD patients and dried blood on filter paper in the enrolled screened populations. ResultsHomozygous A 208 T and I 281 T of BCKDHA were found in two patients from Hans (non-Aboriginal Taiwanese), respectively; compound heterozygous mutations of the DBT gene [4. 7  kb deletion/c. 650 - 651 insT (L 217 F or L 217 fsX 223) and c. 650 - 651 insT/c. 88 - 89 delAT] were found in two patients from Amis, respectively, after direct DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism studies. There were no cases of deleted 4. 7 -kb heterozygote out of 302 normal people (Hans, n =  125; Atayal, n =  156; and Saisiyat, n =  21); by contrast, the DBT mutations c. 650 - 651 insT and deleted 4. 7 -kb heterozygote were noted in 2 / 121 and 1 / 121, respectively, from the general population of the Amis, a southeastern Taiwanese tribe. ConclusionAlthough the Taiwanese Austronesian Aboriginal tribes are considered to share a common origin, different gene preferences of MSUD were noted. The novel DBT mutation c. 650 - 651 insT was more prevalent than the deleted 4. 7 -kb heterozygote in the Amis population. The reported 4. 7 -kb deletion indicating a possible founder mutation may be preserved in the southern and eastern, but not in northern Aboriginal tribes of Taiwan...|$|R
