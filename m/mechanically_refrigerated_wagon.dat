5000|$|With {{the opening}} of the Meishin Expressway between Nagoya and Kobe in 1965 and the Tomei Expressway between Tokyo and Nagoya in 1968, JNR faced {{increasing}} competition for freight transport from road hauliers. JNR therefore developed the [...] "10000 series" [...] freight wagons (KoKi 10000 and KoKiFu 10000 container flat wagons, ReSa 10000 and ReMuFu 10000 <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagons,</b> and WaKi 10000 bogie vans) capable of operating at 100 km/h. Express freight services formed of these wagons were introduced on the Tokaido Main Line and Sanyo Main Line from October 1966 using Class EF65-500 electric locomotives built in 1965. These locomotives were designed to be used in pairs hauling 1,000-tonne freight trains, but as pairs of locomotives drew excessive current from the overhead wires, 1,000-tonne freight trains had to be split into 600-tonne and 400-tonne sections when operating on the Sanyo Main Line. This led to the need for a new locomotive design that would be capable of hauling 1,000-tonne trains singly.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{most of the}} A82 {{is single}} carriageway, and the local {{geography}} means a detour can be a significant distance, there {{is a history of}} strong protest about closing the road. In August 2011, John Grieve, owner of Lochleven Shellfish Company, attempted to challenge Transport Scotland's plans to close the A82 overnight five days a week, for a period of up to three weeks, around the village of Onich, between Glencoe and Fort William. The Scottish Herald reported that, if the road closed, a journey from Oban to Fort William, normally 44 miles km, would require diverting via Loch Tay and Ballinluig, a journey of 166 miles km. Stewart MacLean from the A82 Partnership said, [...] "The proposal to close the road is ludicrous because there is no reasonable detour ... There are commercial vehicles running all the time. The delivery vehicles, the fish farm lorries, <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagons,</b> they all need to get through." [...] In April 2013, Transport Scotland announced further plans to close the A82 at Onich for resurfacing, but they postponed the work due to an adverse reaction from local business owners.|$|R

50|$|If the {{temperature}} is decreased, the metabolic activity in the fish from microbial or autolytic processes can be reduced or stopped. This is achieved by refrigeration where {{the temperature}} is dropped to about 0 °C, or freezing where {{the temperature is}} dropped below -18 °C. On fishing vessels, the fish are <b>refrigerated</b> <b>mechanically</b> by circulating cold air or by packing the fish in boxes with ice. Forage fish, which are often caught in large numbers, are usually chilled with refrigerated or chilled seawater. Once chilled or frozen, the fish need further cooling to maintain the low temperature.

40|$|Este trabajo presenta un estudio de campo sobre confort térmico basado en la concepción adaptativa, para la determinación de las temperaturas y rangos de confort térmico de sujetos habituados a espacios enfriados mecánicamente en viviendas con aire acondicionado (AA) en el clima cálido y húmedo de la ciudad de Maracaibo (Venezuela) y las consecuentes implicaciones energéticas que tiene la satisfacción de esa demanda de confortabilidad en el sector residencial de la ciudad. Para la estimación de la temperatura de confort (Tc) y el rango de temperaturas de confort se aplican diferentes metodologías de análisis estadístico, las cuales son comparadas con las respectivas calculadas con el índice PMV; se analizan también otros aspectos asociados a la confortabilidad térmica, tales como las respuestas en las diferentes escalas de valoración de la confortabilidad, las preferencias, experiencias y expectativas térmicas de los sujetos. Las implicaciones energéticas se determinan en base al consumo de la energía eléctrica residencial debido exclusivamente a la variación de la Tc, entre la obtenida inicialmente en espacios naturalmente ventilados (NV) en Maracaibo (Bravo y Gonzalez 2001 a) y la determinada ahora en espacios con AA. Para ello, se utiliza una metodología que es el resultado de la modificación parcial de la propuesta por Yamtraipat et al (2006). Entre los resultados y conclusiones derivadas de este estudio se encuentra que el 57 % de las personas prefieren las mismas condiciones confortables experimentadas en los ambientes con AA y solamente un 30 % prefieren experimentar ambientes ligeramente fríos y ligeramente calientes. Mientras tanto, las estimaciones de la Tc, y el respectivo rango, varían de {{acuerdo a}} la metodología empleada. Con la convencional metodología adaptativa, la Tc se estima en 25 °C en un amplio rango de 6 °C, entre 22 °C y 28 °C; mientras que con la metodología denominada “método de los promedios de los intervalos de las sensaciones térmicas” (Gómez-Azpeitia et al, 2007), la misma Tc se estima en 24 °C, en un rango estrecho de 22, 5 °C a 25, 5 °C y en un rango ampliado de 21 °C a 27 °C (amplitud 6 °C), donde se encuentran las tres cuartas partes de las personas del estudio. Ambas Tc son muy próximas a la temperatura operativa optima de 24, 5 °C (rango de 23 °C a 26 °C) establecida por las normas internacionales ISO 7730 : 1994 y ASHRAE 55 : 1992 para el verano en climas templados. Sin embargo, la Tc estimada con los valores de PMV resulta ser {{superior}} en 1 °C y 2 °C a la Tc estimada con la metodología adaptativa (25 °C) y con el metodo de los promedios de los intervalos (24 °C), respectivamente. Con la metodología aplicada y la muestra del estudio se estima que de haberse registrado una Tbsint igual o próxima a 28 C (equivalente a la Tc en espacios NV en Maracaibo) en todos los espacios medidos (con Tbsint entre 19 C y 29 C), el ahorro total de la energía anual seria de 1. 648, 1 GWh en un ano respecto al consumo de AA en el año 2007 (2. 522, 3 GWh en un ano), mientras que el ahorro de energía asumiendo Tbsint de 24 C y de 25 C, resultan en 651, 9 GWh en un ano y 425, 7 GWh en un ano, respectivamente. Esto significa respectivos consumos adiciones de energía eléctrica equivalentes al 60, 4 % y 74, 2 %. Finalmente, los hábitos o conductas adoptadas por las personas de este estudio, sumado a las predominantes manifestaciones de confortabilidad en ambientes enfriados mecánicamente, redundan en mayores adaptaciones a condiciones de frio y exigencias de temperaturas de confort más bajas, con su consecuente consumo energético para proveerlas. ABSTRACT This investigation presents {{a study on}} thermal comfort following the adaptive approach for {{the determination of the}} thermal comfort temperatures and ranges of subjects accustomed to <b>mechanically</b> <b>refrigerated</b> spaces in dwellings with air conditioning (AA) systems in the hot and humid weather of the city of Maracaibo (Venezuela) and the ensuing energy use implications it has on the satisfaction of such demand of comfortability in the residential sector of the city. For the estimation of the comfort temperature (Tc) and the range of comfort temperatures different statistical analysis methodologies were used, which are then compared to the respective values calculated with the PMV index, also discusses other aspects related with thermal comfortability were analyzed, such as the responses on the different scales of perception of thermal comfortability, preferences, experiences and expectations of the analyzed subjects. The energetic implications are determined through the residential energy consumption related exclusively with the variation of the Tc between the originally calculated for naturally ventilated (NV) spaces in Maracaibo (Bravo y Gonzalez 2001 a) and the one calculated on the present study with AA. For this, a new methodology was developed by partially modifying the Yamtraipat et al (2006) proposal. Among the results and conclusions of this study are that 57 % of the studied subjects prefer the same comfortable conditions experienced on AA environments and only a 30 % prefer to experience slightly cooler or warmer environments. Also, estimations of the Tc and its respective range vary according to the used methodology. With the conventional adaptive methodology, the Tc is estimated in 25 °C {{with a wide range of}} 6 °C, between 22 °C and 28 °C, while using the “thermal sensation intervals averages method” (Gomez-Azpeitia et al, 2007) the Tc is estimated in 24 °C on a narrow range between 22. 5 °C and 25. 5 °C and a widened range of 21 °C to 27 °C (6 °C in amplitude), a range where. of the studied subjects are located. Both Tc are very close to the optimum operation temperature of 24. 5 °C (with a range between 23 °C and 26 °C) established on the ISO 7730 : 1994 and ASHRAE 55 : 1992 international norms for the summer on warm climates. However, the estimated Tc with the PMV indexes results to be 1 °C and 2 °C above the Tc estimated with the adaptive methodology (25 °C) and the thermal sensation intervals averages method (24 °C), respectively. With the applied methodology and this study sample, its estimated that if a Tbsint equal or close to 28 °C (equivalent to the Tc in NV spaces in Maracaibo) was registered in all measured spaces (with Tbsint between 19 °C and 29 °C) the total yearly energy savings would be of 1. 648, 1 GWh in a year with respect to the AA consumption in the year 2007 (2. 522. 3 GWh in a year), while the energy savings assuming a Tbinst of 24 °C and 25 °C result in 651. 9 GWh and 425. 7 Gwh in a year, respectively. This means that the respective additional electrical energy consumption amount to 60. 4 % and 74. 2 %, respectively. Finally, the habits or behaviors adopted by the subjects analyzed on this study, added to the predominant manifestations of comfortability in <b>mechanically</b> <b>refrigerated</b> environments result in greater adaptations to colder conditions and lower thermal comfort temperature demands, with the consequential increase in power consumption to meet them...|$|R
