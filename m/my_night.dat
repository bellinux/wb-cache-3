Similarly, Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes {{gave the}} song a mixed review, writing: [...] " [...] the less said about the phrase 'swag goo' the better; 'Party', the song on which those unfortunate words appear — Kanye West providing that unfortunate pun — is otherwise wonderful, but yet some errors are too grievous to forgive." [...] Andy Kellman from Allmusic stated, [...] " [...] What's most surprising is that a song titled 'Party' quickly settles into a low-watt groove and remains there." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com added, [...] "Kanye West and Andre 3000 provide interesting vocal color for 'Party' but the song itself is just a variant on the 'this is <b>my</b> <b>night</b> to be bad' theme." [...] A negative review came from Al Shipley of The Village Voice who wrote that [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] were [...] "among the album's worst and most unrepresentative songs".|$|E

2500|$|Khan {{entered the}} García fight as a heavy {{favourite}} {{and through the}} first two rounds and most of the third he outlanded García while García was finding the range. However, the tide turned against Khan very late in the third round as García was able to land a hard counterpunch off a missed right. Khan hit the canvas and suddenly had to fight to stay alive as García's punch to the neck and jaw badly hurt him. Only the bell saved Khan from a second knockdown and García kept pressing early in round four, forcing Khan to take a second standing eight count after he touched the canvas with his glove. Khan regrouped and was temporarily able to go back at García, but with less than a minute left in the round Khan was dropped a third time. Referee Kenny Bayless stopped the fight despite Khan assuring him he could continue, deciding enough was enough. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It wasn't <b>my</b> <b>night.</b> I was coming in with my hands down and Danny took advantage of that. He countered very well against me." [...] According to CompuBox stats, Khan landed 92 of 206 punches thrown (45%), with 46 jabs and 46 power shots landed. García landed 65 of his 216 thrown (30%), 60 of which were power shots. Khan earned $950,000, while García had a $520,000 purse. Nevada State Athletic Commission announced the fight generated a total gate of $426,152 from 3,147 tickets sold. The fight averaged 1.3 million viewers on HBO World Championship Boxing.|$|E
