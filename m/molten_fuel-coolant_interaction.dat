40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the review and evaluation by experts {{of the current}} understanding of the <b>molten</b> <b>fuel-coolant</b> <b>interaction</b> (FCI) issues covering the complete spectrum of interactions, i. e., from mild quenching to very energetic interactions including those {{that could lead to}} the alpha-mode containment failure. Of the eleven experts polled, all but two concluded that the alpha-mode failure issue was resolved from a risk perspective, meaning that this mode of failure is of very low probability, that it is of little or no significance to the overall risk from a nuclear power plant, and that any further reduction in residual uncertainties is not likely to change the probability in an appreciable manner. To a lesser degree, discussions also took place on the broader FCI issues such as mild quenching of core melt during non-explosive FCI, and shock loading of lower head and ex-vessel support structures arising from explosive localized FCIs. These latter issues are relevant with regard to determining the efficacy of certain accident management strategies for operating reactors as well as for advanced light water reactors. The experts reviewed the status of understanding of the FCI phenomena in the context of these broader issues, identified residual uncertainties in the understanding, and recommended future research (both experimental and analytical) to reduce the uncertainties...|$|E

Abundant field evidence indicates that rhyolitic and dacitic phreatomagmatism occurs in nature, {{but it has not}} been possible until now to generate laboratory MFCI explosions from the interaction between high-silica melts and water under laboratory conditions. The high viscosity of these melts apparently prevents formation of an effective hydrodynamic premix of melt and water, the documented precursor of experimental explosive MFCI caused by mafic melts. Our new experiments utilized samples from a rhyolitic tuff ring volcano in Mexico (Tepexitl). An experimental approach was developed, in which premixing conditions were generated by mechanical deformation of the melt, leading to brittle-type fragmentation at the melt-water interface. Physical measurements recorded during laboratory explosion provide quantitative evidence for rhyolitic explosive MFCI. Additionally, a comparison of experimentally produced particles with natural ones from Tepexitl deposits show nearly identical chemical/mineralogical composition, grain size, and grain morphology. Detailed textural analysis confirmed the presence of phreatomagmatically produced particles in both experimental and natural analog particles. The results from this series of experiments indicate that under natural conditions, stress-induced magma fracturing can lead to a critical magma-water-interface growths and trigger phreatomagmatic explosions of high-silica magma. The water source for these eruptions may include shallow aquifers, surface water bodies, strong precipitation, and intrusion into ice or wet, unconsolidated sediments...|$|E

40|$|Background: Steam explosions {{may occur}} in {{nuclear power plants}} by <b>molten</b> <b>fuel–coolant</b> <b>interactions</b> when the {{external}} reactor vessel cooling strategy fails. Since this phenomenon can threaten structural barriers as well as major components, extensive integrity assessment research is necessary to ensure their safety. Method: In this study, the influence of yield criteria was investigated to predict {{the failure of a}} reactor cavity under a typical postulated condition through detailed parametric finite element analyses. Further analyses using a geometrically simplified equivalent model with homogeneous concrete properties were also performed to examine its effectiveness {{as an alternative to the}} detailed reinforcement concrete model. Results: By comparing finite element analysis results such as cracking, crushing, stresses, and displacements, the Willam–Warnke model was derived for practical use, and failure criteria applicable to the reactor cavity under the severe accident condition were discussed. Conclusion: It was proved that the reactor cavity sustained its intended function as a barrier to avoid release of radioactive materials, irrespective of the different yield criteria that were adopted.

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} {{of water at}} volcanic vents can have dramatic effects on fragmentation and eruption dynamics, but {{little is known about}} how the {{presence of}} particulate matter in external water will further alter eruptions. Volcanic edifices are inherently "dirty" places, where particulate matter of multiple origins and grainsizes typically abounds. We present the results of experiments designed to simulate non-explosive interactions between molten basalt and various "coolants," ranging from homogeneous suspensions of 0 to 30 mass% bentonite clay in pure water, to heterogeneous and/or stratified suspensions including bentonite, sand, synthetic glass beads and/or naturally-sorted pumice. Four types of data are used to characterise the interactions: (1) visual/video observations; (2) grainsize and morphology of resulting particles; (3) heat-transfer data from a network of eight thermocouples; and (4) acoustic data from three force sensors. In homogeneous coolants with ~ 20 % sediment, heat transfer is by forced convection and conduction, and thermal granulation is less efficient, resulting in fewer blocky particles, larger grainsizes, and weaker acoustic signals. Many particles are droplet-shaped or/and "vesicular," containing bubbles filled with coolant. Both of these particle types indicate significant hydrodynamic magma-coolant mingling, {{and many of them are}} rewelded into compound particles. The addition of coarse material to heterogeneous suspensions further slows heat transfer thus reducing thermal granulation, and variable interlocking of large particles prevents efficient hydrodynamic mingling. This results primarily in rewelded melt piles and inefficient distribution of melt and heat throughout the coolant volume. Our results indicate that even modest concentrations of sediment in water will significantly limit heat transfer during non-explosive magma-water interactions. At high concentrations, the dramatic reduction in cooling efficiency and increase in mingling help to explain globular peperite, and provide information relevant to analyses of premixing associated with highly-explosive <b>molten</b> <b>fuel-coolant</b> <b>interactions</b> in debris-filled volcanic vents...|$|R
40|$|Magmatic {{plumbing}} {{systems of}} monogenetic volcanic fields comprise an interconnected network of sills, dykes and inclined sheets; however, the morphology, distribution and emplacement mechanisms of these shallow plumbing systems are often overlooked {{due to the}} lack of observable field data. Using seismic data provides an opportunity to understand these systems and integrate seismic-scale features with macro-scale observations from the field. Using a seismic dataset from the Faroe-Shetland Basin, NW Scotland, the Ben Nevis Monogenetic Volcanic Field (BNVF), this research provides an insight into how monogenetic volcanic fields are fed, and how the distribution of edifices can be primarily influenced by the structure of the substrate. By comparing the seismic data with field observations from three separate field studies, this research focuses in on the shallow, ductile zone (< 1 km) between the feeding intrusion(s) and the volcanic edifice, in order to determine the processes that occur during emplacement at a sub-seismic scale. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the features of very shallow plumbing systems (< 200 m) within a variety of water-saturated settings, including: passive and dynamic peperite (blocky and fluidal); R-T structures; clastogenic dykes; gas cavities; slurry cavities; protopillows and subsurface pillows; volcaniclastic injectites; and magma lobes and fingers. The range of features displayed within the four case studies demonstrates that a variety of processes affect the emplacement of magma in the ductile zone. These processes include: (1) exploiting preferential horizons by host-rock fluidisation; (2) exploiting boundaries in the host-rock by the rotation of principal stresses; (3) explosive magmatic degassing; (4) cooling–contraction fragmentation; (5) explosions caused by rapid vapourisation of porewater; (6) a variety of <b>molten</b> <b>fuel-coolant</b> <b>interactions</b> (non-explosive to highly explosive); and (7) density contrasts. Monogenetic volcanic fields and their plumbing systems have been identified in reflective seismic data in exploratory offshore sedimentary basins (e. g.

40|$|Vapor {{explosion}} as {{a result}} of <b>Molten</b> <b>Fuel-Coolant</b> <b>Interactions</b> (MFCI) postulated to occur in certain severe accident scenarios in a nuclear power plant presents a credible challenge on the plant containment integrity. Over the past several decades, a large body of literature has been accumulated on vapor explosion phenomenology and methods for assessment of the related risk. Vapor explosion is driven by a rapid fragmentation of high-temperature melt droplets, leading to a substantial increase of heat transfer areas and subsequent explosive evaporation of the volatile coolant. Constrained by the liquid-phase coolant, such rapid vapor production in the interaction zone causes pressurization and dynamic loading on surrounding structures. While such a general understanding has been established, the triggering mechanism and subsequent dynamic fine fragmentation have yet not been clearly understood. A few mechanistic fragmentation models have been proposed, however, computational efforts to simulate such phenomena generated a large scatter of results. In order to develop a mechanistic understanding of thermal-hydraulic processes in vapor explosion, it is paramount to characterize dynamics of fragmentation of the hot liquid (melt) drop and vaporization of the volatile liquid (coolant). In the present study, these intricate phenomena are investigated by performing well-controlled, externally triggered, single-drop experiments, using advanced diagnostic techniques to attain visual information of the processes. The methodology’s main challenge stemming from the opaqueness of the molten material surrounded by the vapor film and rapid dynamics of the process, was overcome by employing a high-speed digital visualization system with synchronized cinematography and X-ray radiography system called SHARP (Simultaneous High-speed Acquisition of X-ray Radiography and Photography). The developed image processing methodology, focus on a separate quantification of vapor and molten material dynamics and an image synchronization procedure, consists of a series steps to reduce the effect of uneven illumination and noise inherited of our system, further segmentation, i. e. edge detection, and extraction of image features, e. g. area, aspect ratio, image center and image intensity (radiography). Furthermore, the intrinsic property of x-ray radiation, namely the differences in linear mass attenuation coefficients over the beam path through a multi-component system, which translates the image intensity to a transient projection of the molten material morphology, was exploited. A methodology for the quantitative analysis of the x-ray images, i. e. transient maps of the fragmented melt, was developed. Its uncertainties were evaluated analytically and experimentally pointing towards the need to minimize the X-ray scattering and noise inherited from the optical system, for a more accurate quantification and a larger calibrated thickness range. Analysis of the data obtained by the SHARP system and image processing procedure developed provided new insights into the physics of the vapor explosion phenomena, as well as, quantitative information of the associated dynamic micro-interactions. The qualitative analysis, based on the matched radiograph and photographic images, describe the bubble and melt interrelated progression granting information on the phenomenological micro-interaction of the vapor explosion process. The dynamics of the initially disturbed vapor film is composed by multiple cycles, where the vapor bubble grows to a maximum diameter and collapses. X-ray radiographs show that during the first bubble expansion, the melt undergoes deformation/pre-fragmentation but does not follow the bubble interface during the subsequent expansion; suggesting no mixing between coolant and melt. Coolant entrainment occurs when the expanded bubble collapses leading to fine fragmentation of the molten material due to explosive evaporation. The vapor bubble expansion, fed by these fragments at the boundary, reaches its critical size, and start collapsing. The remaining melt is accountable for the following cycle. Bubble dynamics analysis shows a strong correlation between energetics of the subsequent explosive evaporation and the high temperature molten material drop (tin) deformation/partial fragmentation during the first bubble growth. The data suggest that this pre-fragmentation may have been responsible in providing an adequate mixing condition that promotes coolant entrainment during the bubble collapse stage. The SHARP observations followed by further analysis leads to a hypothesis about a novel phenomenon called pre-conditioning, according to which dynamics of the first bubble-dynamics cycle and the ability of the melt drop to deform/pre-fragment dictate the subsequent explosivity of the so-triggered drop.

40|$|One might {{conclude}} that in deep submarine environments, where hydrostatic pressure is in excess of water's critical pressure, waterlmagma interaction does not produce expanding vapor and explosive behavior cannot occur. This conclu-sion {{is supported by the}} apparent paucity of hydroclastic material in samples recovered from deep submarine environments. Analog <b>molten</b> <b>fuel-coolant</b> inter-action (MFCI) experiments, however, demonstrate explosive dynamics for condi-tions where water is pressurized above its critical pressure before interaction; MFCI theory further indicates this explosive potential. Thermodynamic predic-tions show that the conversion of thermal to mechanical energy is only high enough to support explosive behavior for a narrow range of waterlmagma mass ratios. In submarine environments, apparent mass ratios are too high for explosive behavior, but effective mass ratios (those determined from the water and magma directly involved during interaction) depend upon characteristic times, deter-mined by the sound speed of the water and interface geometry. At high pressure, a supercritical fluid film grows at the waterlmagma contact surface and can become unstable. With instability the film oscillates, rapidly expanding and col-lapsing, with a periodicity of milliseconds or less. Each film collapse imparts kinetic energy into the magma, causing magma fragmentation, especially where quench contraction has weakened the magma. With fragmentation more magma surface area is exposed to water, and the film growth/collapse process escalates. When perturbed by some external pressure wave, the unstable film is prone to a detonation-like phenomenon that causes rapid, localized vapor expansion even at high ambient pressure. 1...|$|R

This research has resulted in resolution of issues from a risk perspective (e. g., containment failure attributable to an energetic <b>fuel-coolant</b> <b>interaction</b> or the so-called alpha-mode failure, direct containment heating from high-pressure melt ejection, etc.), implementation of severe accident management strategies (e. g., flooding drywell in a Mark-I containment to prevent liner failure), and improved assessment of the source term and uncertainties associated with hydrogen production (both inand ex-vessel). An unresolved issue that has received increased attention in recent years relates to melt coolability (in particular, ex-vessel coolability) and consequent containment integrity and fission product release into the environment. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Melt Coolability and Concrete Interaction (OECD-MCCI) program is experimentally investigating the effectiveness of cooling ex-vessel core debris using an overlying water pool. This paper discusses the significance of the OECD-MCCI program in relation to severe accident uncertainties. Specifically, this paper discusses the important findings of the experimental program with regard to an assessment of epistemic uncertainties in coolability and core-concrete interaction (CCI) models that are used to extrapolate the results to plant conditions. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA steam {{explosion}} may occur during a severe accident, when the molten core comes {{into contact with}} water. The pressurized water reactor and boiling water reactor ex-vessel {{steam explosion}} study, which was carried out with the multicomponent three-dimensional Eulerian <b>fuel–coolant</b> <b>interaction</b> code under {{the conditions of the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Steam Explosion Resolution for Nuclear Applications project reactor exercise, is presented and discussed. In reactor calculations, the largest uncertainties in the prediction of the steam explosion strength are expected to be caused by the large uncertainties related to the jet breakup. To obtain some insight into these uncertainties, premixing simulations were performed with both available jet breakup models, i. e., the global and the local models. The simulations revealed that weaker explosions are predicted by the local model, compared to the global model, due to the predicted smaller melt droplet size, resulting in increased melt solidification and increased void buildup, both reducing the explosion strength. Despite the lower active melt mass predicted for the pressurized water reactor case, pressure loads at the cavity walls are typically higher than that for the boiling water reactor case. This is because of the significantly larger boiling water reactor cavity, where the explosion pressure wave originating from the premixture {{in the center of the}} cavity has already been significantly weakened on reaching the distant cavity wall...|$|R
40|$|Test E 8 {{simulated}} {{a hypothetical}} $ 3 /s transient overpower accident in an LMFBR using seven (plutonium, uranium) oxide fuel {{elements of the}} FTR type. The test elements were pre-irradiated in the PNL- 10 assembly in EBR-II to 5 at. % burnup at 30 kW/m. The pre-irradiation in EBR-II caused a fuel-restructuring range characteristic of a low-to-moderate power microstructure for FTR. Failure predictions indicated that fuel with this microstructural characteristic would fail at a lower energy deposition than fuel irradiated at higher power. Data from test-vehicle sensors, hodoscope, and postmortem examinations were used to construct {{the sequence of events}} occurring within the test zone. The sequence occurred incoherently across the test cluster, the initial event occurring abruptly at about 29 times nominal power level at an estimated stored energy of about 925 kJ/kg with 50 % of the fuel above the solidus at the suspected failure site. After the initial failure, about 2 % of the total mass of test fuel was ejected above the original top of the active fuel column. Sodium voiding occurred rapidly. A fuel-debris blockage also apparently prevented further fuel dispersal. Inherent test-vehicle limitations, loss of flow-tube geometry, and nontypical power generation after failure may have caused a departure from the fuel motion predicted for FTR conditions. No violent <b>fuel-coolant</b> <b>interaction</b> or associated work-energy conversion to the coolant was observed...|$|R
40|$|In the SARNET Containment topic {{three issues}} of severe {{accident}} phenomenology are treated which endanger the containment integrity {{in an early}} stage of the accident by pressure increase due to fast heat transfer: hydrogen combustion, explosive melt water reaction, and direct containment heating. Progress in activities dealing with the hydrogen issue was achieved by performing experiments addressing these subjects: - hydrogen combustion with defined concentration gradients, - hydrogen mitigation via recombiners and the issue of self-ignition within a recombiner, - thermal-hydraulic phenomena in the containment (steam injection, condensation, sprays), - interaction between Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners and containment atmosphere. The experimental results are being used for benchmark simulations with both lumped parameter codes and CFD codes. The modeling results were discussed in numerous workshops with focus on large scale application. The experimental progress concerning the <b>Fuel-Coolant</b> <b>Interaction</b> (FCI) issue was delayed by the relocation of the KROTOS test facility to CEA, Cadarache. Calculation work in preparation of the planned tests was performed by several partners with different CFD codes. Based on existing experimental data the issues of material effect (alumina ¿ corium) and specific melt entry conditions are being investigated by code calculations. Concerning the Direct Containment Heating issue (DCH) a significant database has been established for different European reactor plants. Benchmark exercises have identified promising modeling approaches in the CONTAIN code but also revealed necessary improvements in modeling in ASTEC. JRC.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} and constructed which enabled material to be melted and heated to a maximum temperature of 1000 C and then flooded with a pre-heated liquid. A series of experiments to investigate the thermal interaction between molten metals (aluminium, lead and tin) and sub-cooled water were conducted. The cooling rates of the molten materials under conditions of flooding were measured with a high speed-thermocouple and recorded with a transient recorder. A simplified model for calculating heat fluxes and metal surface temperatures was developed and used. Experimental results yielded boiling heat transfer in the transition film and stable film regions of the classic boiling curve. Maximum and minimum heat fluxes were observed at nucleate boiling crisis and the Leidenfrost point respectively. Results indicate that heat transfer from molten metals to sub-cooled water {{is a function of}} temperature and coolant depth and not a direct function of the physical properties of the metals. Heat transfer in the unstable transition film boiling region suggests that boiling dynamics in this region where a stationary molten metal is under pool boiling conditions at atmospheric pressure would not initiate a <b>fuel-coolant</b> <b>interaction.</b> Low heat fluxes around the Leidenfrost point would provide efficient fuel-coolant decoupling by a stable vapour blanket to enable coarse mixing of the fuel and coolant to occur without appreciable loss of thermal energy from the fuel. The research was conducted by Gareph Boxley and was submitted for the degree of PhD at the University of Aston in Birmingham in 1980...|$|R
50|$|At {{the point}} at which the corium relocates to the lower plenum, Haskin, et al relate that the {{possibility}} exists for an incident called a <b>fuel-coolant</b> <b>interaction</b> (FCI) to substantially stress or breach the primary pressure boundary when the corium relocates to the lower plenum of the reactor pressure vessel ("RPV").This is because the lower plenum of the RPV may have a substantial quantity of water - the reactor coolant - in it, and, assuming the primary system has not been depressurized, the water will likely be in the liquid phase, and consequently dense, and at a vastly lower temperature than the corium. Since corium is a liquid metal-ceramic eutectic at temperatures of 2200 to 3200 K, its fall into liquid water at 550 to 600 K may cause an extremely rapid evolution of steam that could cause a sudden extreme overpressure and consequent gross structural failure of the primary system or RPV. Though most modern studies hold that it is physically infeasible, or at least extraordinarily unlikely, Haskin, et al state that there exists a remote possibility of an extremely violent FCI leading to something referred to as an alpha-mode failure, or the gross failure of the RPV itself, and subsequent ejection of the upper plenum of the RPV as a missile against the inside of the containment, which would likely lead to the failure of the containment and release of the fission products of the core to the outside environment without any substantial decay having taken place.|$|R
