50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcat</b> (Lynx rufus escuinapae) is a {{subspecies}} of the bobcat, {{from the}} cat family Felidae. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcat</b> is most {{commonly found in}} the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Nayarit.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{threats to}} the <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcat</b> are habitat destruction, illegal {{trapping}} and shooting, and militarization of the U.S. - Mexico border. Although the bobcat {{was added to the}} U.S. Endangered Species List in June 1976, a delisting of the <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcat</b> species was proposed in 2003. An official proposition to delist the species was made a few years later, although the species still remains on the list.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcat</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} Mexico, but primarily in Baja, western Mexico, and southward from the Sonoran desert. [...] The creature {{is also found}} in the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Nayarit, as well as parts of Sonora, Jalisco, Durango, San Luis Potosí, Nuevo León, Hidalgo, Morelos, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Tamaulipas, Michoacán, Guerrero, Veracruz, and Oaxaca. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcat</b> lives in a variety of areas, including forests, coastal swamps, deserts, and scrublands. The animals are nonmigratory and are territorial. The territory of a male <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcat</b> may stretch for a few miles and overlap with several female bobcat and male bobcat territories. The female Mexican bobcat's territory rarely overlaps with another female's territory.|$|E
500|$|This {{subspecies}} {{division has}} been challenged, given {{a lack of}} clear geographic breaks in their ranges and the minor differences between subspecies. The latest revision of cat taxonomy based on phylogeographic and genetic studies recognises only two subspecies, although the status of <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcats</b> (Lynx rufus esquinapae and Lynx rufus oaxacensis) remains under review: ...|$|R
40|$|Bartonella henselae is {{the main}} agent of cat scratch disease in humans and {{domestic}} cats are the main reservoir of this bacterium. We conducted a serosurvey to investigate the role of American wild felids as a potential reservoir of Bartonella species. A total of 479 samples (439 serum samples and 40 Nobuto strips) collected between 1984 and 1999 from pumas (Felis concolor) and 91 samples (58 serum samples and 33 Nobuto strips) collected from bobcats (Lynx rufus) in North America, Central America and South America were screened for B. henselae antibodies. The overall prevalence of B. henselae antibodies was respectively 19. 4 % in pumas and 23. 1 % in bobcats, with regional variations. In the USA, pumas from the southwestern states {{were more likely to}} be seropositive for B. henselae (prevalence ratio (PR) = 2. 82, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 55, 5. 11) than pumas from the Northwest and Mountain states. Similarly, adults {{were more likely to be}} B. henselae seropositive than juveniles and kittens (PR = 1. 77, 95 % CI = 1. 07, 2. 93). Adult pumas were more likely to have higher B. henselae antibody titers than juveniles and kittens (p= 0. 026). B. henselae antibody prevalence was 22. 4 % (19 / 85) in bobcats from the USA and 33. 3 % (2 / 6) in the <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcats.</b> In the USA, antibody prevalence varied depending on the geographical origin of the bobcats. In California, the highest prevalence was in bobcats from the coastal range (37. 5 %). These results suggest a potential role of wild felids in the epidemiological cycle of Bartonella henselae or closely related Bartonella species...|$|R
5|$|Its wild creatures include black bear, <b>bobcat,</b> <b>Mexican</b> wolves, elk, Gila monsters, coyotes, rattlesnakes, cougars, skunks, and red foxes, {{as well as}} cranes, golden eagle, red-tailed hawk, {{and great}} horned owls. In keeping with Navajo tradition, none of the zoo's birds were {{captured}} {{for the purpose of}} being exhibited, but were rather rescued after sustaining injuries from vehicles or electrical lines and are thus unable to fly; the majority of the other specimens are also non-releasable and unable to survive in the wild due to being orphaned or having been confiscated as illegal pets from their former owners.|$|R
50|$|Mexican bobcats are {{carnivores}} and eat rodents, jackrabbits, collared peccaries, birds, deer, and white-nosed coatis. On occasion {{they will}} hunt snakes, lizards, and scorpions. They are solitary, nocturnal animals and are rarely seen by humans. The animals gather briefly {{once a year}} to mate. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcat</b> breeding season can take place anytime during the year and is not strictly limited to spring. The female gives birth to a litter of two to three kittens, which she raises on her own. The species generally lives for ten to twelve years.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>bobcat</b> is the {{smallest}} of the bobcat subspecies and grows to about twice the size of a housecat. It is similar in appearance to the lynx except for the tail, which is darker in color. Adults of this species range from nine to thirty pounds. [...] The coat color of this animal varies from light gray to reddish brown. The coat is covered in more spots than that of the northern species of bobcat and has shorter, denser hair then its northern cousin. This species has the distinctive black stripes of fur on the forelegs and a black tip on the tail along with black tipped ears and a whiskered face. A tuft of fur frames the animal's face.|$|E
25|$|Mexico City {{has three}} zoos. Chapultepec Zoo, the San Juan de Aragon Zoo and Los Coyotes Zoo. Chapultepec Zoo {{is located in}} the first section of Chapultepec Park in the Miguel Hidalgo. It was opened in 1924. Visitors can see about 243 {{specimens}} of different species including kangaroos, giant panda, gorillas, caracal, hyena, hippos, jaguar, giraffe, lemur, lion, among others. Zoo San Juan de Aragon is near the San Juan de Aragon Park in the Gustavo A. Madero. In this zoo, opened in 1964, there are species that are in danger of extinction such as the jaguar and the Mexican wolf. Other guests are the golden eagle, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, caracara, zebras, African elephant, macaw, hippo, among others. Zoo Los Coyotes is a 27.68-acre (11.2 ha) zoo located south of Mexico City in the Coyoacan. It was inaugurated on February 2, 1999. It has more than 301 specimens of 51 species of wild native or endemic fauna from the Mexico City. You can admire eagles, ajolotes, coyotes, macaws, <b>bobcats,</b> <b>Mexican</b> wolves, raccoons, mountain lions, teporingos, foxes, white-tailed deer.|$|R
