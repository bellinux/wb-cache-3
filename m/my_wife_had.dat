2500|$|During {{his time}} at Liverpool, Voronin heavily criticized the {{standard}} of lifestyle in England and Great Britain in general {{and in particular the}} city of Liverpool. Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> to go back to Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent and sometimes I have absolutely no clue what the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem." ...|$|E

We are both intimate friends of Mr. Renshaw, to whom <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> work <b>has</b> always given complete satisfaction. And now, without the slightest warning, comes this peremptory dismissal from P. Maloney. Who is P. Maloney? Where is Mr. Renshaw?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Walda Nagasta most lovely woman! No wonder King Solomon {{love her}} mother. If Barung's daughter, <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>had</b> been like her, think I run through great river into rising sun with Fung." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I do {{not need}} to say anything: you can see it all in <b>my</b> face. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>has</b> the farthing. Do not be afraid--she will not throw it away.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> some anxious {{hours in}} conjecturing where I spent my afternoons. I {{thought it best}} not to tell her; women do not {{understand}} these things. Poor girl!--she had one shock out of it.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked and}} it was Yva's face that was pressed against my own, and Yva's eyes that gazed into mine. Only she was garbed as <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> been, and on her bosom hung the changeful necklace.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> {{just come}} down from an {{interview}} with a pale, faded-looking young woman in rusty black attire, who had called upon me on the very common supposition that I was an editor of the [...] "Atlantic Monthly." ...|$|E

2500|$|From October to November 2016, BoA {{starred in}} JTBC's romance melodrama <b>My</b> <b>Wife's</b> <b>Having</b> an Affair this Week. This marked BoAâ€™s {{return to the}} small screen after an absence of three years.|$|R
60|$|The man's face changed, and {{he looked}} anxiously at me. I {{did not know what}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> been saying, but I had seen by her manner that she had been {{threatening}} him, and I shook my uplifted fist.|$|E
60|$|I {{showed her}} the little piece of calico that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> given me. She {{looked at it and}} handed it back to me. Then she took down a great roll of red calico and spread it out on the counter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{trying for}} your nerves. I {{know what it}} is. We're {{different}} from the last generation; they thought nothing of it. When Charles was born my dear old father was out hunting all day. When <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> George, it made me as nervous as a cat!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you give}} me my life?" [...] asked the outlaw. [...] "Promise that I go free, and you shall have it back, if it be indeed true that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>has</b> taken it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will warrant they have!" [...] Rufino said. [...] "When <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>has</b> made up {{her mind}} {{to get to the bottom}} of a matter, she will tease and coax till she succeeds.|$|R

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> taken Ida {{out of the}} {{way when}} the first {{complaining}} note from Mrs. Talboys had been heard ascending the hill.

60|$|I {{suggested}} that his annuities might possibly {{be put into}} some more satisfactory shape--that I had trustworthy lawyers with whom I would put him in communication--that he had best come to London to see to these matters--and that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> a large house where she would most gladly entertain the two gentlemen.|$|E
60|$|That was all--not {{an object}} having {{commercial}} value, no papers--nothing. But this {{was enough to}} clear up {{the mystery of the}} strong-room. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> early divined the existence and purpose of that apartment, and with the skill amounting to genius had effected an entrance by loosening the two stones in the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop, my lord," [...] says Mr. Deuceace, very humble: [...] "I {{shall not}} share your hospitality--but--but {{you know my}} condition; I am penniless--you know {{the manner in which}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>has</b> been brought up--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} see," [...] he continued, [...] "what particular claim <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>has</b> had upon you.

5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>Wife's</b> <b>Having</b> an Affair this Week [...] {{was a hit}} due to its {{gripping}} {{story and}} expressive acting from seasoned actors, {{making it one of}} the highest rated cable dramas and JTBC's first hit drama.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right." [...] I {{gave him}} a ten-dollar note which I had loose in my pocket; it was one that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> {{told me to get}} changed at the grocery near the station, and I had walked off to the old temple, or the old cockpit, and {{forgotten}} about it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course not, Father,' he {{interposed}} hurriedly. 'I {{was only}} wondering where <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> gone, and thought maybe--I guess she's up at Mrs. Stanton's on French Gulch. Nice weather, isn't it? Heard the news?

6000|$|Roberts: [...] "Why, I didn't {{know the}} cook by sight, you see. <b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>had</b> engaged her up-town, and {{appointed}} her {{to meet me}} here, without reflecting that I had never seen her, and wouldn't know who she was, when I did see her; she partly expected to be here herself, and so I didn't reflect, either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{hundred pounds}} {{more or less}} matters little to me," [...] he said; [...] "and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>has</b> set her heart on them. It's every man's duty to please his wife--isn't it, Mrs. Brabazon?--I offer you three hundred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do it," [...] {{decided the}} man. [...] "I'll help, {{and you can}} do most of the work. But <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>has</b> gone fishing for red eels to-day, so some of you will have to mind the children." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>has</b> {{gone down}} to her people, so I'm 'en garcon' for a few days. If you've nothing better to do, come and dine to-night at seven, {{and go to the}} theatre. It's ages since I saw you.|$|R
