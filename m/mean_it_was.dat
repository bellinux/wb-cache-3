It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} battle of San Lorenzo is {{acknowledged}} in Argentine historiography as an important battle for Argentine independence, it had little military influence in the conflict. Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Martín fought in it, as {{the size of the}} forces involved and the length of the clash would normally <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> considered a military engagement rather than a real battle and it did not influence the development of the Argentine War of Independence. This victory did nothing to prevent further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18, 1813 and yet another one at San Fernando on August 22. William Brown ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} such plats {{depicting}} naval actions and expeditions that {{are attributed to}} Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it {{was presented to the}} king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the Mary Rose that sank at the Battle of the Solent 19 July 1545 does not <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessarily started before this date, since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549. The galleasses, the Antelope, Hart, Bull and Tiger, all present in the second roll, were still being built around March 1546, and the Hart was not at sea until October that year. At the same time the Galley Blanchard, captured from the French 18 May 1546 is not included.|$|E

25|$|The cup was {{probably}} designed for drinking from at feasts, or more specifically Bacchic cult celebrations, where {{the lack of}} a foot, also a feature found in other cage-cups, may <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> passed around, as elaborate cups often were in medieval cultures. Alternatively other cage cups were almost certainly used, suspended, as oil lamps, where the dichroic effect of this cup would show to advantage.|$|E
25|$|Two XP-51s (41-038 and 41-039) {{set aside}} for testing arrived at Wright Field on 24 August and 16 December 1941 respectively. The small size of this first order {{reflected}} the fact that what had been known as the USAAC up until late June 1941 was still a relatively small, underfunded peacetime organization. After the late-June 1941 reorganization of the USAAC into the United States Army Air Forces, roughly {{six months before the}} attack on Pearl Harbor changed the outlook for the United States regarding involvement in global hostilities against the Axis literally overnight, priority had to be given to building as many existing fighters - P-38s, P-39s, and P-40s - as possible while simultaneously training pilots and other personnel, which meant evaluation of the XP-51 did not begin immediately. However, this did not <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> neglected, or testing and evaluation mishandled.|$|E

He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fun.

[...] Latta also felt that despite being familiar with the setting, Gaiman never utilized the period to its full potential.

500|$|The Indian Mahayana {{schools were}} {{divided on the}} issue of the {{possibility}} of reflexive awareness (svasaṃvedana). Dharmakīrti accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogacara school, comparing it to lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects. This was strictly rejected by Mādhyamika scholars like Candrakīrti. Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by emptiness, they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> self validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness. These views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker Śāntarakṣita. In Śāntarakṣita's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the two truths doctrine. Thus he states: [...] "By relying on the Mind-Only system, know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on this Middle Way system, know that no self exists at all, even in that [...]" ...|$|E

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically.

I <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. Only when she saw the film did she know what was being said. On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E

500|$|The Pavilion Theatre {{was built}} in 1960 on a {{peninsula}} of reclaimed land between the harbour and the esplanade, after the Ritz Theatre was destroyed by fire in 1954. The Pavilion was {{owned and operated by}} Weymouth and Portland Borough Council, providing a venue for local community groups and schools, and hosting seasonal 'end-of-the-pier' entertainment and year-round shows and events. It was announced in 2006 that the Pavilion complex and [...] of its surroundings would be entirely redeveloped from 2008 to 2011, in time for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The proposed complex was to include a refurbished theatre, a World Heritage Site visitors' centre, a new ferry terminal, a 140-bed 4-star hotel, an underground car park, a shopping arcade, offices, around 340 luxury apartments, 110 affordable homes, public squares, promenades, and a 290-berth marina. Delays to the project <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unlikely to be completed in time for the 2012 Summer Olympics and the redevelopment never took place. In November 2012 Weymouth and Portland Borough Council announced the intended closure and demolition of the theatre, with the site closing on 31 May 2013. Following a formal tender process the theatre was leased to local businessman Phil Say and reopened on 13 July 2013. Weymouth Pavilion is now operated by Weymouth Pavilion CIC as a not-for-profit organisation.|$|E
500|$|Stone {{met with}} Tom Cruise about playing Bud Fox, but the {{director}} had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role. Stone liked the [...] "stiffness" [...] of Sheen's acting style {{and used it}} to convey Bud's naivete. Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in Romancing the Stone and was looking for something dark and edgy. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted Richard Gere but the actor passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Stone remembers, [...] "I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn't act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone". Nevertheless, Stone found out that [...] "when he's acting he gives it his all". Stone said that he saw [...] "that villain quality" [...] in Douglas and always thought he was a smart businessman. Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} part. It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I’d never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I <b>mean,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unbelievable". For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.|$|E
500|$|According to Betty Cortina of People magazine, Dreaming of You {{marked a}} shift that abrogated the singer being marketed {{as part of}} her band and billed Selena as an American solo artist in [...] "the most {{fundamental}} way for her". From 1989, Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla became Selena's principal music producer and songwriter, and remained so throughout her career. Because Quintanilla III was working on the singer's follow-up recording to Amor Prohibido (1994), he could not produce the crossover album. He was asked to meet with several producers in New York and choose one who would best [...] "fit with Selena's style". Dreaming of You was the first album Selena's family did not produce. They had decided to step down before the recording sessions and allow professional pop producers to work with her. Quintanilla III and Selena flew to Nashville, Tennessee, and met with Keith Thomas, who had prepared the instrumental parts for the song called [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] but had not yet completed the vocal parts, so he sang it for them. Selena and Quintanilla III immediately liked it; Quintanilla III said he wanted Selena to include it on her album. [...] Recording sessions began in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Selena had to return later when Thomas could provide additional vocals. Selena and her husband Chris Pérez arrived at the studio on March 24, 1995 to finish recording the song. In a 2002 interview, Pérez said Thomas provided Selena with a cassette of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] and said she had the song [...] "on loop" [...] and she [...] "must have heard it a hundred times". He believed it had an [...] "effect on her" [...] because [...] "she went into the studio the next day to actually do the recording and just was nailing things left and right and [...] was letting her do her thing and I <b>mean</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an incredible thing to watch".|$|E
