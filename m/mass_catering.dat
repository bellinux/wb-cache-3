40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the demand for the {{introduction}} of fish products in public canteens (schools, hospitals and nursing-homes) has grown due to their good nutritional proprieties. The particular health conditions and sensitivity of some groups of consumers exposes them to greater risks of food poisoning. It is therefore important to monitor the raw materials that end up in <b>mass</b> <b>catering</b> implementing strategies of <b>mass</b> <b>catering</b> control, both with self-monitoring strategies and with regular controls performed by the competent health authorities. The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the overall quality of seafood dealt out from public catering services located in Northeast Italy. In this paper we illustrate the results of microbiological analysis performed on 135 fish samples (58 % of samples were raw fishes, 27 % cooked fishes, 6 % raw fish products, 9 % cooked fish products) and species identification performed on 102 fish samples. Additionally, 135 environmental swabs were collected to determine the effectiveness of cleaning and sanitation of food contact (cutting boards, cooking equipment and food processing surfaces) and non-contact (refrigerator wall and handle, tap lever) surfaces. Of raw seafood samples, 24 % had total aerobic mesophilic bacteria count > 105 CFU/g and for Enterobacteriaceae the faecal contamination was excluded since no Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli were isolated. Just 3. 8 % of raw seafood samples resulted positive for Listeria monocytogenes. The results of swab samples of cooking utensils and surfaces showed that sanitation practices should be improved. Molecular analysis for fish species identification revealed a mislabelling for 25 % of sampled fishes.

40|$|Introduction. public {{catering}} (also {{known as}} <b>mass</b> <b>catering)</b> {{is an area}} of nutrition of the population by which the frequency ofnutrition-related diseases can be significantly mitigated with the introduction of effective preventive measures. this hypothesisis supported by several studies from all over the world. the analysis of these studies enables a more accurate view on the efficiency of regulative legal measures adopted with regard to public catering. Aim. the aim {{of this study was to}} study legal regulations of different countries that are similar to hungarian ministerial decreeno. 37 / 2014 (iV. 30) emmi on the nutritional regulations of public catering, as well as to compare the results of our survey,conducted in order to assess the efficacy of the aforementioned hungarian legal act, with data concerning nutrition of childrenfrom other countries, with the emphasis on slovakia. Material and methods. the study was conducted between november 2015 and march 2016. 173 hungarian catering managers,as well as 53 hungarian and 40 slovak school children who regularly eat meals provided by public catering, participated in ourstudy. All the participants were selected randomly. We processed and aggregated the data obtained and performed statisticaltests, using microsoft excel and the r project software. We compared the menus available in schools to the applicable legalregulations and analysed them, using the nutriCompÉtrend sport 3. 03 (hungarian version of nutriComp diet sport 3. 03) software. Results. We discovered that the main factor which influenced the opinion of children on their meals was their taste, but external factors influencing their perception of the meal (such as the appearance of the meal, its taste, general cleanliness, beingfamiliar with the food served, healthiness of the meal and presence of friends) were also important, which was independentfrom their country of origin. the participating hungarian children more frequently than slovak children described their mealsas undersalted. only a small percentage of the participants studied the menu attentively. energy content and nutritive valueof the meals offered by public catering services differed significantly and the analysed menus failed to meet the governmentalrecommendations accurately in both countries. energy content and salt content were not consistent with the recommendationsin both countries. even though the majority (87 %) of the public catering service kitchens in hungary introduced some required technical ortechnological alterations during the grace period allowed by the decree no. 37 / 2014 emmi, the majority of them (62 %) stillneeded further alterations at the time of the study in order to fully comply with the decree, as declared by managers of thecatering services that participated in our study. Conclusions. one of the most important problem at the time of the study was the need of modernization that should be pursued as soon as possible by the majority of the catering facilities. the taste of meals provided by <b>mass</b> <b>catering</b> is currently farfrom optimal and, therefore, development in formulation is needed, including introduction of new technologies and new rawmaterials. the analysis of our results proved that the demand for <b>mass</b> <b>catering</b> services depends on the quality of the food provided and on external factors influencing the perception of the meal, and that there is demand for the development of healthymeals. Complying with the operating law and satisfying the expectations of the consumers are not easy tasks and, therefore,cooperation between all the subjects that contribute to the public catering chain is important.

Result: Separate kitchen and Onsite solid waste storage containers/receptacles were available in 4 (16 %) establishments. Provision for heating devices for cooked food was available in 5 (20 %) establishments. Wash basin present with soap were available in 10 (40 %) of the food establishments. Sweeping and washing floor with water and disinfectant was done in 8 (32 %) food establishments. Male and female food handlers ’ have equal percentage of morbidity and this difference was not statistically significant (χ 2 = 0. 0329, p= 0. 84), but anaemia was significantly higher among female food handlers (χ 2 = 6. 30, p= 0. 01). Poor hygienic practices were significantly associated with presence of infectious diseases like ARI, diarrhoea, dysentery and skin infections. (χ 2 = 5. 71, p= 0. 017). Conclusion: Food establishments in the study area were found to have poor sanitation and were not maintained well. The health status and the level of personal hygiene of the food handlers in the eating establishments were found to be unsatisfactory. There is need of enforcement of sanitary provisions and educating the food handlers about personal hygiene...|$|E
40|$|In the {{proceedings}} of an iPOPY seminar, some results of the research project were presented. First of all, Anne-Kristin Løes and Benjamin Nölting give {{an overview of the}} iPOPY project and its first results. This outline of the holistic research approach helps locate the challenges of the supply side of POPY, some crucial aspects of which are analyzed in the following papers. Political strategies are highly relevant for changing the “politicized market” of public food procurement. Thorkild Nielsen, Niels Heine Kristensen and Bent Egbert Mikkelsen reflect on whether and how organic food in schools and kindergartens can be described as a part of an ecological modernization strategy in Denmark. They discuss how it has merged with more economically and technically approach in public catering policy. Organic production has to be certified and labeled along the supply chain in order to maintain trust in organic premium products. Since January 1 st 2009, organic certification in Europe is subject to the new Council Regulation (EC) No 834 / 2007 of 28 June 2007. This regulation specifically excludes so-called <b>mass</b> <b>catering</b> operations. It is up to EU member states to apply national rules or private standards insofar as these comply with community law. The paper of Carola Strassner presents {{the state of the art}} and upcoming changes of organic certification of out-of-home catering in Germany with regard to Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Italy. Finally, supply chains of organic school food have to be organised in a sustainable way in order to serve high quality food to pupils. Stefano Bocchi, Roberto Spigarolo, Marco Valerio Sarti, and Benjamin Nölting present a best practice case of controlled food chains (filiera controllata) from Italy, the European champion of organic school food. From the province and the city of Piacenza in the region of Emilia-Romagna, we can learn a lot about a short and certified organic food-chain, a wide range of regional and organic products provided through a shared logistic organisation among local partners, and specific tender procedures...|$|E
