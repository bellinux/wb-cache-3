Far-Western analyses provided further evidence for direct interaction between VP 26 and VP 51.

Both <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> were found to be required for virus particle assembly and secretion. The placement of stop codons after each of the first three AUG codons in the pre-S region allowed efficient translational initiation at downstream AUG codons to produce novel N-terminally truncated pre-S/S proteins. These proteins could substitute for pre-S/S protein in the production of enveloped virus production, but not in the production infectious virus. A mutant defective in myristylation of the pre-S/S protein produced reduced amounts of enveloped virus, and this virus was not infectious. Mutants defective in the pre-S/S protein accumulated high levels of covalently closed circular viral DNA (cccDNA) compared with the wild type or with a mutant defective in only the S protein. Hyperamplification of cccDNA resulted in high levels of viral RNA, consistent with the proposed role of cccDNA as the transcriptional template. Myristylation of the pre-S/S protein was not required for control of cccDNA amplification, and mutants that produced N-terminally truncated pre-S/S proteins displayed higher levels of cccDNA.

40|$|The use of inactivated {{influenza}} virus {{for the development}} of vaccines with broad heterosubtypic protection requires selective inactivation techniques that eliminate viral infectivity while preserving structural integrity.

By this approach, the transmembrane domains of viral <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> are selectively targeted by the hydrophobic photoactivatable compound 1, 5 -iodonaphthyl-azide (INA). This probe partitions into the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope and upon far UV irradiation reacts selectively with membrane-embedded domains of proteins and lipids while the protein domains that localize outside the bilayer remain unaffected. INA treatment of influenza virus blocked infection in a dose-dependent manner without disrupting the virion or affecting neuraminidase activity. Moreover, the virus maintained the full activity in inducing pH-dependent lipid mixing, but pH-dependent redistribution of viral <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> into the target cell membrane was completely blocked.

The single Cys residue (Cys- 8) in the M ectodomain was crucial for heterodimerization and virus infectivity. Mutagenesis of any of the five Cys residues in the GP 5 ectodomain or removal of the single GP 5 N-glycosylation site also rendered the full-length clone noninfectious. However, an analysis of revertants yielded an exceptional pseudorevertant in which residues 52 to 79 of the GP 5 ectodomain had been deleted and the original Cys- 80 →Ser mutation had been maintained. Consequently, this revertant lacked the GP 5 N-glycosyation site (Asn- 56) and retained only a single cysteine residue (Cys- 34).

Within them, the envelope protein VP 19 exists as a homotrimer, while another <b>major</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> VP 28, mainly exists as a homotetramer. The most notable feature is that the majority of MPCs include VP 26 and VP 24, suggesting that these two proteins might serve as hub proteins to recruit low-abundance proteins to MPCs and play crucial roles in the process of protein complex formation. Furthermore, we found significant evidence for interactions between several low-abundance proteins, such as VP 52 B/VP 38 /VP 33 and VP 12 /VP 150. The result of this study may promote the further research on WSSV envelope assembly.

40|$|VP 33, also termed VP 281, VP 37 or VP 36 B, {{is a minor}} <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> {{of white}} spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV). Because of its low abundance and lack of a transmembrane domain, we hypothesized that VP 33 {{is likely to be}} attached to the viral envelope by interaction with other <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> In this study, we employed far-western blotting and pull-down assays to demonstrate that VP 33 interacts with itself, as well as with VP 24, {{which is one of the}} four <b>major</b> viral <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> Moreover, a gel-filtration analysis was performed to show that this self-interaction led to the formation of stable VP 33 tetramers. These results implied that VP 33 tetramers were anchored to the viral envelope through interaction with VP 24, suggesting that VP 33 may participate in the formation of the WSSV envelope.

In this study, VP 38, a viral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> {{was expressed}} as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, and a polyclonal antibody against VP 38 was obtained. Far-Western blotting and GST pull-down showed that VP 38 interacted directly with VP 24, a <b>major</b> WSSV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> In addition, to delineate the interaction region of VP 38 with VP 24, GST-VP 38 n (aa 1 - 142) and GST-VP 38 c (aa 143 - 309) were expressed. The GST pull-down assay revealed that VP 38 binds via its C-terminal region to VP 24. The result implies that VP 38 may participate {{in the formation of}} the WSSV envelope...|$|R
40|$|Antisera {{produced}} in mice recognize primarily type-specific antigenic determinants {{on both the}} major core protein, p 30, and the <b>major</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins,</b> gp 70 and p 15 (E), of the endogenous leukemia viruses (MuLV) of BALB/c mice. Three different mouse sera were investigated in detail. (i) Antisera prepared in C 57 BL/ 6 mice against the AKR leukemia K 36 reacted with the gp 70, p 15 (E), and p 30 proteins of MuLV. Certain pools of the C 57 BL/ 6 anti-AKR K 36 serum contained antibodies which serologically distinguished the p 30 proteins of N-ecotropic, B-ecotropic, and xenotropic BALB/c MuLV. (ii) Antisera prepared in BALB/c mice against the BALB/c sarcoma 1315 contained antibodies that reacted with a type-specific antigen of the 1315 MuLV gp 70 that is not found on other BALB/c MuLV. (iii) The normal sera of multiparous BALB/c mice contained antibodies that reacted with gp 70 and p 15 (E) proteins of ecotropic MuLV. Sera from some of these mice contained antibodies that serologically distinguished the gp 70 of N-ecotropic and B-ecotropic BALB/c viruses. These results emphasize the utility of mouse antisera in the serological typing of MuLV. Furthermore, the antigenic differences observed in the p 30 and gp 70 proteins should be of particular use in the future analysis of recombinant BALB/c MuLV...|$|R
