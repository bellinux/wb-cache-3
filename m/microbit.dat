50|$|After a {{successful}} roll-out of the micro:bit across the UK, the BBC are handing {{over the future}} of the BBC micro:bit to the newly formed, not-for-profit, <b>Microbit</b> Education Foundation. The Foundations CEO Zach Shelby, formerly Vice President of Marketing for Internet of Things at ARM Holdings, is set to increase the uptake of the BBC micro:bit in education throughout Europe and then the rest of the World.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded by John Wiley and Alan Ackerman as <b>Microbits</b> Peripheral Products (MPP), a {{provider}} of interface products for the Atari 8-bit family.The {{two of them were}} friends in high school when they developed various computer hardware for the school computers, and were best known for a 300 baud modem and a printer interface. The company was successful for some time, but a number of factors led to its bankruptcy around 1986, and its reformation as Supra, initially selling hard drives for the Atari ST. Originally from Albany, Oregon, they later moved to Vancouver, Washington.|$|R
40|$|A fully {{instrumented}} laboratory {{drilling rig}} {{was designed and}} used to drill a variety of rock types with impregnated diamond <b>microbits.</b> The rocks, selected to represent {{a wide range of}} properties, were characterised by optical petrography and by the measurement of uniaxial compressive strength and relative abrasion resistance. A computer controlled electronic data logging system was used to record the power consumption, the rotational velocity, the bit thrust, the torque and the penetration rate. Tests were conducted under set thrust and under set rate of advance conditions to determine the effect of varying the bit pressure, rotational velocity, diamond mesh size and concentration, and rock type on the dependent drilling variables of diamond wear, bit wear, rock fracture, torque, power consumption, penetration rate and reactive load. The drilling efficiency was monitored by calculating the specific energy of drilling from the power consumption corrected for the power losses in the machine and from the generated torque, the latter being more sensitive. The diamond wear on a used bit was evaluated under the optical microscope by classifying each exposed stone into one of ten wear categories. The rock fracture was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy of the drilled surfaces, and by particle size distribution analysis of the drilling detritus. On the basis of the results a performance model for impregnated diamond bit drilling was formulated in which a critical stress threshold per actively drilling diamond must be exceeded for steady drilling to take place with any specific combination of bit and rock type. The optimum drilling thrust at which the specific energy is at a minimum and the penetration rate at a maximum for a given rock and bit configuration, occurs marginally above the thrust required for all the exposed diamonds to be in contact with the rock. The effective bit pressure and the rock type characteristics are crucial determinants for diamond wear type development and hence for the drilling performance within the operating range. The transition from suboptimal to optimal drilling conditions has been described in terms of the characteristic diamond wear, the specific energy, and the coefficient of friction between the bit and the rock. The mechanism of diamond wear and rock fracture are discussed with reference to the results of the optical and (ii)) scanning electron microscopy of worn diamonds and the rock detritus. It is concluded that a variety of rock properties affects the drilling performance, sometimes unpredictably and that the realistic drilling of any specific rock is necessary to determine its resistance to drilling. The necessary approach is demonstrated in detail for a single rock type, norite, for which it is shown the transition takes place at a pressure of approximately 400 MPa per actively drilling stone irrespective of the diamond size or concentration. A discussion of rock drillability testing demonstrates that experimental drilling with <b>microbits</b> has a valid role in the realistic evaluation of drillability and {{in the study of the}} complex fracture and wear mechanisms that must be understood for the application and rational design of appropriate bits...|$|R
40|$|Drill bits having {{cutting edges}} formed of {{a matrix of}} {{sintered}} metal powder impregnated with diamond bort (the so called "impregnated" diamond bits) {{have the potential to}} greatly increase the economy of diamond drilling, due to low production costs and long bit life resulting from reconditioning of the cutting edges. However, little detailed research into the performance of impregnated bits has been conducted, and the capacity to predict their field behaviour is limited. As a contribution to the knowledge of impregnated bit performance, this project has studied basic relationships between thrust, rotational speed and the penetration of diamond bits into rock, with particular attention paid to the development of techniques suitable for laboratory testing using miniature impregnated bits. A conventional bench drill and a radial arm drill were modified and instrumented to enable operating conditions to be controlled and drilling parameters to be measured and monitored, for microscale and fullscale drilling using impregnated drill bits. Bit performance and drilling characteristics were studied for four rock types, and rock drillability studies were carried out on seven rock types. Statistical relationships between penetration rate, specific energy, torque and drilling distance that were determined enable projection of drilling data from a standard "sharp" condition. A wear measuring device was developed to assess matrix wear of the impregnated <b>microbits.</b> Reconditioning was done by drilling medium-strength, abrasive Stawell sandstone. Initial penetration rate increases linearly with increases in thrust and/or rotational speed, but only within a limited range, depending on rock type and the other operating parameters. Matrix contact with the rock surface, "clogging" of the diamonds, time-dependency, and strength of diamonds and the diamond-matrix bond play important roles in these phenomena. Comparison of rock drillability between that of microscale and fullscale bits shows a straight-line relationship indicating the possibility to predict drilling performance in the field. Uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength, and Sklerograf hardness {{can be used as a}} preliminary, but not reliable guide, to predict drillability. Petrographic characteristics and the relative scale of diamond size to grain size of minerals affect rock drillability. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
