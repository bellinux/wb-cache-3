5|$|Okapis are herbivores, {{feeding on}} tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They prefer {{to feed in}} treefall gaps. Staple foods {{comprise}} shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; <b>monocotyledonous</b> plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae and Violaceae.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum (common names white trillium, large-flowered trillium, {{great white}} trillium, white wake-robin, French trille blanc) is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the family Melanthiaceae. A <b>monocotyledonous,</b> herbaceous perennial, it is native to eastern North America, from northern Quebec to the southern parts of the United States through the Appalachian Mountains into northernmost Georgia and west to Minnesota. It also thrives on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. There are also several isolated populations, such as in Nova Scotia and Iowa.|$|E
5|$|The Liliaceae are characterised as <b>monocotyledonous,</b> perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous in {{the case}} of Medeoleae) {{flowering}} plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged (inflorescence) along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of 'petals', that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts (superior). There are three fused carpels (syncarpus) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E
25|$|BCTV {{has been}} known to affect more than 300 plant species from 44 {{different}} families. Sugar beets are known to be the main host for this virus but it also affect many plants including beans, celery, spinach, melons, peppers, squashes, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Younger plants seem to be more susceptible to damage and developed more symptoms from the virus compared to adult plants. It has been shown that the BCTV tend to infect more dicotyledonous hosts while no <b>monocotyledonous</b> plants have been recognized as a host for this virus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monocotyledonous</b> {{plants have}} two {{additional}} {{structures in the}} form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a coleoptile that forms the first leaf while the radicle is covered with a coleorhiza that connects to the primary root and adventitious roots form from the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between radicle and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumscription}} of Asparagales {{has been}} a source of difficulty for many botanists from the time of John Lindley (1846), the other important British taxonomist of the early nineteenth century. In his first taxonomic work, An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany (1830) he partly followed Jussieu by describing a subclass he called Endogenae, or <b>Monocotyledonous</b> Plants (preserving de Candolle's Endogenæ phanerogamæ) divided into two tribes, the Petaloidea and Glumaceae. He divided the former, often referred to as petaloid monocots, into 32 orders, including the Liliaceae (defined narrowly), but also most of the families considered to make up the Asparagales today, including the Amaryllideae.|$|E
25|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} (Meloidogyne spp.) {{are one of}} {{the three}} most economically damaging genera of plant-parasitic nematodes on horticultural and field crops. Root-knot nematodes are distributed worldwide, and are obligate parasites of the roots of thousands of plant species, including <b>monocotyledonous</b> and dicotyledonous, herbaceous and woody plants. The genus includes more than 90 species, with some species having several races. Four Meloidogyne species (M. javanica, M. arenaria, M. incognita, and M. hapla) are major pests worldwide, with another seven being important on a local basis. Meloidogyne occurs in 23 of 43 crops listed as having plant-parasitic nematodes of major importance, ranging from field crops, through pasture and grasses, to horticultural, ornamental and vegetable crops. If root-knot nematodes become established in deep-rooted, perennial crops, control is difficult and options are limited.|$|E
500|$|Ornithophilous flowers {{need to be}} {{conspicuous}} to birds. Birds {{have their}} greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the visual spectrum, so red is particularly conspicuous to them. Hummingbirds may {{also be able to}} see ultraviolet [...] "colors". The prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor entomophilous (insect-pollinated) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers. Each of the two subfamilies of hummingbirds, the Phaethornithinae (hermits) and the Trochilinae, has evolved in conjunction with a particular set of flowers. Most Phaethornithinae species are associated with large <b>monocotyledonous</b> herbs, while the Trochilinae prefer dicotyledonous plant species.|$|E
500|$|Root nodules {{containing}} Rhizobium bacteria {{have been}} found on R. regia trees in India. [...] The presence of rhizobia-containing root nodules is usually associated with nitrogen fixation in legumes; {{this was the first}} record of root nodules in a <b>monocotyledonous</b> tree. [...] Further evidence of nitrogen fixation was provided by the presence of nitrogenase (an enzyme used in nitrogen fixation) and leghaemoglobin, a compound which allows nitrogenase to function by reducing the oxygen concentration in the root nodule. [...] In addition to evidence of nitrogen fixation, the nodules were also found to be producing indole acetic acid, an important plant hormone.|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{noted that}} the {{essential}} nectar, secreted to attract insects, seemed also {{in some cases to}} act as an excretion: [...] "It is in perfect accordance with the scheme of nature, as worked out by natural selection, that matter excreted to free the system from superfluous or injuring substances should be utilised for purposes of the highest importance." [...] Homologies of the flowers of orchids showed them all to be based on [...] "fifteen groups of vessels, arranged three within three, in alternating order". He disparaged the idea that this was an [...] "ideal type" [...] fixed by the Omnipotent Creator, but attributed it instead to its [...] "descent from some <b>monocotyledonous</b> plant, which, like so many other plants of the same division, possessed fifteen organs, arranged alternately three within three in five whorls; and that the now wonderfully changed structure of the flower is due to a long course of slow modification,—each modification having been preserved which was useful to each plant, during the incessant changes to which the organic and the inorganic world has been exposed".|$|E
500|$|The lily family, Liliaceae, {{consists}} of fifteen genera and about 705 known species (Christenhusz & Byng 2016 [...] ) of flowering plants within the order Liliales. They are <b>monocotyledonous,</b> perennial, herbaceous, often bulbous geophytes. Plants {{in this family}} have evolved with {{a fair amount of}} morphological diversity despite genetic similarity. Common characteristics include large flowers with parts arranged in threes: with six colored or patterned petaloid tepals (undifferentiated petals and sepals) arranged in two whorls, six stamens and a superior ovary. [...] The leaves are linear in shape, with their veins usually arranged parallel to the edges, single and arranged alternating on the stem, or in a rosette at the base. Most species are grown from bulbs, although some have rhizomes. First described in 1789, the lily family became a paraphyletic [...] "catch-all" [...] group of petaloid monocots that did not fit into other families and included a great number of genera now included in other families and in some cases in other orders. Consequently, many sources and descriptions labelled [...] "Liliaceae" [...] deal with the broader sense of the family.|$|E
500|$|The {{diversity}} of characteristics complicates description of Liliaceae morphology, and confused taxonomic classification for centuries. The diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance (see Evolution). The Liliaceae family are characterised as <b>monocotyledonous,</b> perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous {{in the case}} of Medeoleae) flowering plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae.

The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is superior, i.e. placed above the attachment of the other parts. There are three fused carpels (syncarpous) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind-dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E
2500|$|Typha [...] is a genus {{of about}} 30 species of <b>monocotyledonous</b> {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Typhaceae. These plants have many common names, in British English as bulrush, or reedmace, in American English as cattail, punks, or corn dog grass, in Australia as cumbungi or bulrush, in Canada as bulrush or cattail, and in New Zealand as raupō. Other taxa of plants may be known as bulrush, including some sedges in Scirpus and related genera.|$|E
2500|$|Poaceae or Gramineae is a {{large and}} nearly {{ubiquitous}} family of <b>monocotyledonous</b> flowering plants known as grasses. [...] Poaceae includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and cultivated lawns and pasture. Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath. With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species, Poaceae are the fifth-largest , following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.|$|E

60|$|Lythrum salicaria. Description of {{the three}} forms. Their power and complex manner of {{fertilising}} one another. Eighteen different unions possible.

60|$|Considering these several facts, {{there can}} hardly be a doubt that both these species of Pontederia are heterostyled and trimorphic. This case is an {{interesting}} one, for no other <b>Monocotyledonous</b> plant {{is known to be}} heterostyled. Moreover, the flowers are irregular, and all other heterostyled plants have almost symmetrical flowers. The two forms differ somewhat in the colour of their corollas, that of the short-styled being of a darker blue, whilst that of the long-styled tends towards violet, and no other such case is known. Lastly, the three longer stamens alternate with the three shorter ones, whereas in Lythrum and Oxalis the long and short stamens belong to distinct whorls. With respect to the absence of the mid-styled form {{in the case of the}} Pontederia which grows wild in Southern Brazil, this would probably follow if only two forms had been originally introduced there; for, as we shall hereafter see from the observations of Hildebrand, Fritz Muller and myself, when one form of Oxalis is fertilised exclusively by either of the other two forms, the offspring generally belong to the two parent-forms.|$|E
60|$|Ever since fossil {{plants have}} been {{collected}} and studied, the broad fact has been apparent that the early plants--those of the Coal formation--were mainly cryptogamous, while in the Tertiary deposits the higher flowering plants prevailed. In the intermediate secondary epoch the gymnosperms--cycads and coniferae--formed a prominent part of the vegetation, and as these have usually been held {{to be a kind}} of transition form between the flowerless and flowering plants, the geological succession has always, broadly speaking, been in accordance with the theory of evolution. Beyond this, however, the facts were very puzzling. The highest cryptogams--ferns, lycopods, and equisetaceae--appeared suddenly, and in immense profusion in the Coal formation, at which period they attained a development they have never since surpassed or even equalled; while the highest plants--the dicotyledonous and <b>monocotyledonous</b> angiosperms--which now form the bulk of the vegetation of the world, and exhibit the most wonderful modifications of form and structure, were almost unknown till the Tertiary period, when they suddenly appeared in full development, and, for the most part, under the same generic forms as now exist.|$|E
60|$|The {{liability}} of plants {{to be affected}} in their fertility by slightly changed conditions is the more remarkable, as the pollen when once in process of formation is not easily injured; a plant may be transplanted, or a branch with flower-buds be cut off and placed in water, and the pollen will be matured. Pollen, also, when once mature, may be kept for weeks or even months. (18/85. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1844 page 215; 1850 page 470. Faivre gives a good resume on this subject in his 'La Variabilite des Especes' 1868 page 155.) The female organs are more sensitive, for Gartner (18/86. 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss' etc. s. 252, 338.) found that dicotyledonous plants, when carefully removed so {{that they did not}} in the least flag, could seldom be fertilised; this occurred even with potted plants if the roots had grown out of the hole at the bottom. In some few cases, however, as with Digitalis, transplantation did not prevent fertilisation; and according to the testimony of Mawz, Brassica rapa, when pulled up by its roots and placed in water, ripened its seed. Flower-stems of several <b>monocotyledonous</b> plants when cut off and placed in water likewise produce seed. But in these cases I presume that the flowers had been already fertilised, for Herbert (18/87. 'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 2 1847 page 83.) found with the Crocus that the plants might be removed or mutilated after the act of fertilisation, and would still perfect their seeds; but that, if transplanted before being fertilised, the application of pollen was powerless.|$|E
6000|$|We {{said just}} {{now that the}} {{classification}} of objects should follow those of their properties which indicate not only the most numerous, but also the most important peculiarities. What is here meant by importance? It has reference to the particular end in view; and the same objects, therefore, may admit with propriety of several different classifications. Each science or art forms its classification of things according to the properties which fall within its special cognizance, or of which it must take account {{in order to accomplish}} its peculiar practical end. A farmer does not divide plants, like a botanist, into dicotyledonous and <b>monocotyledonous,</b> but into useful plants and weeds. A geologist divides fossils, not like a zoologist, into families corresponding to those of living species, but into fossils of the paleozoic, mesozoic, and tertiary periods, above the coal and below the coal, etc. Whales are or are not fish according to the purpose for which we are considering them. “If we are speaking of the internal structure and physiology of the animal, we must not call them fish; for in these respects they deviate widely from fishes; they have warm blood, and produce and suckle their young as land quadrupeds do. But this would not prevent our speaking of the whale-fishery, and calling such animals fish on all occasions connected with this employment; for the relations thus arising depend upon the animal’s living in the water, and being caught {{in a manner similar to}} other fishes. A plea that human laws which mention fish do not apply to whales, would be rejected at once by an intelligent judge.”(224) ...|$|E
6000|$|The rapidity {{of growth}} {{is so great}} in this climate, that within eight months from the {{commencement}} of the improvements, a great change had already taken place. The grounds bore a park-like appearance; broad shady walks had replaced the narrow winding paths that ran in distorted lines over the ground, and a large Palmetum, or collection of tall and graceful palms of various kinds, occupied several acres at {{one side of the}} garden; whilst a still larger portion of ground was being appropriated to a picturesque assemblage of certain closely allied families of plants, whose association promised to form a novel and attractive object of study to the botanist, painter, and landscape gardener. This, which the learned Director called in scientific language a Thamno-Endogenarium, consists of groups of all kinds of bamboos, tufted growing palms, rattan canes (Calami), Dracaenae, plantains, screw-pines, (Pandani), and such genera of tropical <b>monocotyledonous</b> plants. All are evergreens of most vivid hue, some of which, having slender trailing stems, form magnificent masses; others twine round one another, and present impenetrable hillocks of green foliage; whilst still others shoot out broad long wavy leaves from tufted roots; and a fourth class is supported by aerial roots, diverging on all sides and from all heights on the stems, every branch of which is crowned with an enormous plume of grass-like leaves.* [Since I left India, these improvements have been still further carried out, and now (in the spring of 1853) I read of five splendid Victoria plants flowering at once, with Euryale ferox, white, blue, and red water-lilies, and white, yellow and scarlet lotus, rendering the tanks gorgeous, sunk as their waters are in frames of green grass, ornamented with clumps of Nipa fruticans and Phoenix paludosa.] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} next arises, whether, as all Kinds {{must have}} a place among the classes, so all the classes in a natural arrangement must be Kinds? And to this I answer, certainly not. The distinctions of Kinds are not numerous enough {{to make up the}} whole of a classification. Very few of the genera of plants, or even of the families, can be pronounced with certainty to be Kinds. The great distinctions of Vascular and Cellular, Dicotyledonous or Exogenous and <b>Monocotyledonous</b> or Endogenous plants, are perhaps differences of kind; the lines of demarcation which divide those classes seem (though even on this I would not pronounce positively) to go through the whole nature of the plants. But the different species of a genus, or genera of a family, usually have in common {{only a limited number of}} characters. A Rose does not seem to differ from a Rubus, or the Umbelliferæ from the Ranunculaceæ, in much else than the characters botanically assigned to those genera or those families. Unenumerated differences certainly do exist in some cases; there are families of plants which have peculiarities of chemical composition, or yield products having peculiar effects on the animal economy. The Cruciferæ and Fungi contain an unusual proportion of nitrogen; the Labiatæ are the chief sources of essential oils, the Solaneæ are very commonly narcotic, etc. In these and similar cases there are possibly distinctions of Kind; but it is by no means indispensable that there should be. Genera and Families may be eminently natural, though marked out from one another by properties limited in number; provided those properties are important, and the objects contained in each genus or family resemble each other more than they resemble any thing which is excluded from the genus or family.|$|E
