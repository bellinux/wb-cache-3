The results indicated that although downwash from the canard reduced the wing lift at angles of attack up to approximately 16 deg, the total lift was substantially greater with the canard on than with the canard off. At angles of attack above 16 deg, the canard delayed the wing stall. Changing canard deflection had essentially no effect on the total lift, since the additional lift generated by the canard deflection was lost on the wing due to an increased downwash at the wing from the canard...|$|E

However, static margin is still commonly used as a preliminary guideline for establishing adequate pitch stability in piloted airplanes. Here a dynamic margin is defined to be the distance that the airplane’s stick-fixed maneuver point lies aft of the center of gravity, expressed as a fraction of the pitch radius of gyration. A proposed minimum-dynamic-margin constraint is shown to agree with the short-period-frequency requirements used in recent military specifications to an accuracy of about 2 %. For some airplanes, this stability constraint is shown to differ from the 5 %-minimum-static-margin guideline by more than 400 %.

As Reynolds number was increased, untrimmed L/D increased, the angle of attack for maximum L/D decreased, drag creep was reduced significantly, and drag divergence Mach number increased slightly. Data repeatability for both modes of operation of the NTF (air and cryogenic nitrogen) was generally very good, and nonadiabatic wall effects were estimated to be small.

Directional stability data were obtained at M= 3. 51 for angles of attack of approximately 0 deg and 10 deg. These data, with summary data and typical schlieren photographs, are presented with only a brief analysis. The data indicate that the controls are effective throughout the Mach number range and lift-coefficient range (CL = - 0. 15 to 0. 7, approximately) of the tests. There is a severe break in the pitching-moment curve at M= 2. 29 which might result in a pitch-up condition in flight, and also a large forward movement of the aerodynamic center with increasing Mach number that produces neutral longitudinal stability at M= 3. 51 for the moment center used in this investigation.

Three canards, ranging in exposed planform area from 17. 5 to 30. 0 percent of the wing reference area, were employed in this investigation. The canards were either located in the plane of the wing or in a position 18. 5 percent of the wing <b>mean</b> <b>geometric</b> <b>chord</b> above the wing plane. Most data obtained were for a model with a 60 deg leading-edge-sweep wing; however, a small amount of data were obtained for a 44 deg leading-edge-sweep wing. The model utilized two balances to isolate interference effects between wing and canard. In general, it was determined that at angle of attack for all configurations investigated with the canard in the plane of the wing an unfavorable interference exists which causes the additional lift on the canard generated by a canard deflection to be lost on the wing due to an increased downwash at the wing from the canard. Further, this interference decreased somewhat with increasing Mach number. Raising the canard above the plane of the wing also greatly decreased the interference of the canard deflection on the wing lift. However, at Mach 2. 86 the presence of the canard in the high position had a greater unfavorable interference effect at high angles of attack than the canard in the wing plane. This interference resulted in the in-plane canard having better trimmed performance at Mach 2. 86 for the same center-of-gravity location. Prepared at Langley Research Center. "December 1971.

40|$|Conceptual wing design {{analysis}} methods are combined with numerical optimization to find minimum drag wings subject to constraints on lift, weight, pitching moment, and stall speed. Minimum drag tip extensions and winglets are compared using nonlinear optimization. The minimum drag trapezoidal tip device {{depends on the}} ratio of the maneuver lift coefficient to the cruise lift coefficient, although the difference in performance is small. The importance of accounting for the depth of the wing structural box in the weight model, and including constraints on stall speed are highlighted. C-wings are investigated for their potential to enhance performance beyond that offered by wings with winglets. C-wings are found to be a reasonable design alternative for tailless aircraft with requirements for nose-up pitching moment about the aerodynamic center. This may be especially true for span-constrained or low sweep designs. Optimizing C-wing designs introduces several subtleties into the optimization process including the necessity of evaluating the maneuver load at various lift coefficients, and constraining the wing skin thickness. Finally, the method is applied to wings with active load alleviation. Active load alleviation allows reductions in drag on the order of 15 %, however further analysis of the structural dynamics is necessary to more fully quantify the results.
