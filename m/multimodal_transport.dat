40|$|Transport {{planners}} and policymakers are increasingly considering <b>multimodal</b> public <b>transport</b> and travel demand management (TDM) strategies {{to stem the}} unsustainable travel behaviour trends associated with modern-day, car-dominated travel. <b>Multimodal</b> public <b>transport,</b> however, implies that people change transport mode, which may mean that {{they can no longer}} implement their usual activity patterns, perhaps even resulting in increased car use. The quality of public transport is determined not only by the quality of the main transport mode, but also by the before (access) and after (egress) modes. The interconnectivity of the different modes also becomes important in order to realise a trip. An important question from a policy perspective is, therefore, how people make decisions regarding location, activity scheduling and mode choice when faced with <b>multimodal</b> public <b>transport</b> alternatives. These decisions span different time horizons; the long-, medium- and short-term implications of <b>multimodal</b> public <b>transport</b> are addressed in the AMADEUS research programme, of which this dissertation forms part. National travel survey data for The Netherlands were used to address some of the research questions. An extensive activity diary data collection exercise was undertaken during April to September 2000 in the Utrecht-Almere-Amsterdam urban region of The Netherlands to collect detailed, multimodal activity-travel data. The data collection exercise relied on a specifically designed activity travel diary to capture the detailed stages of public transport. The results suggest that <b>multimodal</b> public <b>transport</b> users have distinctly different characteristics compared to other transport mode users. Considering the relationship between the different time elements, it was found that access, egress and line-haul times are not necessarily influenced by the same variables, while the interconnectivity ratio (access plus egress divided by total trip time) showed different distribution curves for different multimodal chains. Assuming that people make least uncertain decisions first, the results suggest that mode choice ranks lower on the chain of travel behaviour decisions and that individuals make activity scheduling and participation decisions before they make mode choice decisions. The results of this dissertation can be used to inform {{planners and}} policymakers about the implications of public transport and travel behaviour...|$|R

30|$|The case-study {{problem has}} been dealing with one {{main part of the}} company’s whole {{distribution}} network that involves approximately 20 % of its total market, which is used to illustrate the interest and functionality of the model. Computational experiments show the functionality of the model and suggest that potential distribution cost savings of 6 - 10 % would be possible to achieve through modality alteration over links of the distribution network. Furthermore, to highlight certain features of the model and the effect of the model’s parameters on empty container management, an extensive sensitivity analysis is presented. The proposed model captures many time-varying parameters, which makes it possible to quantify the trade-offs between different criteria of the ECR problem. The model includes many practical considerations needed for ECR distribution networks: meeting demand and supply requirements, <b>multimodal</b> <b>transports,</b> cleaning processes, transport and storage capacity, internal and external locations, various types of ports, terminals, and depots, etc. However, there are several possibilities for extending the model proposed in this study.|$|R

40|$|International audienceLeveraging on {{the recent}} {{availability}} of open data about public transports, the last generation of smartphone applications provide highly personalised guidance to passengers during their trips. This smart assistance definitely improves the passenger comfort and streamlines their trips, especially in case of infrastructure incidents and/or multimodal trips. However, there are important limitations stemming from the unidirectional flow of information going from transport operators to passengers: (1) waste of computing resources, partially defeating the purpose of sustainability, and (2) missed opportunities of optimisations by the transport operators, which do not exploit detailed real-time passengers information. This paper presents ongoing work towards smarter and more sustainable <b>multimodal</b> <b>transports</b> based on a full-duplex ecosystem in which passengers and transport operators actively exchange information and react correspondingly. As first steps in this direction, we show how this integration can lead to greener computing applications by varying the balance between the smartphone and the cloud, and present a few concrete optimisations enabled in this model, during the trip itself or on a longer term by improving the transport infrastructure. We illustrate this ecosystem with a smartphone/cloud application prototype, and elaborate the remaining challenges for fully implementing this vision, including issues like interoperability, scalability, and acceptability...|$|R

The study was made in two stages using customers: first, {{they were asked to}} evaluate their satisfaction with the <b>multimodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> system; second, to evaluate their comparative satisfaction with the segmented/“uni-modal” freight {{transport system}} against five major freight transport performance indicators. Customers were also asked to identify and rank top ten problems of freight transport logistics in Ethiopia. Data were analyzed using SPSS and excel sheets with descriptive statistics and the results were depicted using charts and tables.
