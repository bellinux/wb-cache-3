25|$|At times, Don Eleuterio {{has been}} accused of mistreating his son, {{particularly}} because he never changes the family diet; since the only decent cooking recipe Eleuterio knows was the one he learned as attendant of a mess hall while in the Army (and since cooking anything more extravagant would be, in his view, effeminate), he feeds his son steamed white rice, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> canned corn every single day (and sometimes for both lunch and dinner).|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of the potato {{in the second half}} of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food and by the mid-19th century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk. A typical family, consisting of a man, a woman and four children, would eat [...] of potatoes a week. Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental unsophistication to cooking, such as the Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, a type of potato pancake, or colcannon, a dish of <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> kale or cabbage.|$|E
500|$|The {{ingredients}} {{are given in}} verse by a Cornishman from Bodmin, during William Sandys' 1846 tour around Cornwall. Sandys also includes a story of Christmas-time in Cornwall which includes the pie served with <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> pilchards. In [...] "Verses Occasioned by Ben Tyrrell's Mutton Pies", published in 1772, Thomas Warton also confirmed that the squab pie was mutton based and came from Cornwall. The Devon author, William Crossing, writing in 1911, discusses a short folk rhyme about squab pie: [...] "Mutton, onions, apples and dough, Make a good pie as any I know." [...] He does not say, however, from where he heard it. In the [...] song [...] "Glorious Devon" [...] written by Sir Edward German in 1905, several Devonshire dishes receive praise: [...] "Squab pie, junket and cider brew, Richest cream of the cow, What 'ud Old England without 'em do?" ...|$|E

2500|$|To liven up the {{neighborhood}} and provide patrons with {{a place to go}} before and after performances, Mirvish bought and renovated a nearby warehouse building, which he turned into a restaurant. To cut costs, [...] "Ed's Warehouse" [...] at King Street West and Duncan Street served a set meal: prime rib, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> peas. Along the same street, Mirvish later opened Ed's Seafood, Ed's Folly, Ed's Chinese, Ed's Italian Restaurant and Old Ed's, which attracted local residents to the previously neglected King Street area and served 6,000 meals a night. As the neighbourhood became revitalized, many other restaurants opened nearby, often serving a wider range of foods than Ed's restaurants and achieving greater popularity; consequently, one by one, Ed's restaurants closed down. The last was Ed's Warehouse, which shut its doors in 2000.|$|E

Today eel is often included {{to meet the expectations}} of unsuspecting diners. There is Bratkartoffeln (pan-fried potato slices), Finkenwerder Scholle (Low Saxon Finkwarder Scholl, pan-fried plaice), Pannfisch (pan-fried fish with mustard sauce), Rote Grütze (Low Saxon Rode Grütt, related to Danish rødgrød, a type of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with cream, like Danish rødgrød med fløde) and Labskaus (a mixture of corned beef, <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> beetroot, a cousin of the Norwegian lapskaus and Liverpool's lobscouse, all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal that used to be the main component of the common sailor's humdrum diet on the high seas).|$|E

For this competition, HouseGuests were given false {{statements}} that revolved around numbers, and had {{to determine whether the}} correct answer was more or less than the given answer; the first HouseGuest to reach seven points would be the winner. Adam was the winner. On Day 57, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "A True Big Brother Mash" [...] food competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to make pathways out of <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> gravy in an attempt to fill up containers to earn food for the week. Later that day, Adam chose to nominate Sharon and Sheila for eviction. On Day 58, HouseGuests competed in [...] "The Rainmaker" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given an event from earlier this season, and were required to find rocks in the backyard stating when the event happened. The last HouseGuest to bring the correct answer each round was eliminated. Ryan was the winner of the Power of Veto. Following this, the other members of Team Christ began to become suspicious of Natalie, feeling she was aligned with almost everyone in the house. On Day 60, Ryan chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Sheila from the block, with James being nominated in her place. On Day 63, James became the eleventh HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of three to zero. He became the fourth member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E

6000|$|It rained all night, and in {{the morning}} we were forced to get out in a cold, wet dawn. It was a grim start, dismal and portentous, {{bringing}} the realities of the trail very close to us. While I rustled the horses out of the wet bush, partner stirred up a capital breakfast of bacon, evaporated potatoes, crystallized eggs, and graham bread. He had discovered at last the exact amount of water to use in cooking these [...] "vegetables," [...] and they were very good. The potatoes tasted not unlike <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes,</b> <b>and</b> together with the eggs made a very savory and wholesome dish. With a cup of strong coffee and some hot graham gems we got off in very good spirits indeed.|$|E
60|$|Supper was all ready, and Tur-il-i-ra {{sat down}} to the table on a chair which was bigger than some houses, while Ting-a-ling sat cross-legged on a napkin, {{opposite}} to him. The Giant had everything nice. There {{was a pair of}} roast oxen, besides a small boiled whale, and a great plate of fricasseed elks. As for vegetables, there were boat-loads of <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes,</b> <b>and</b> turnips, and beans; and there was a pie which was as big as a small back-yard. The Giant had a splendid appetite, and before supper was over he had eaten up most of these things. As for little Ting-a-ling, he had only got half way through his third grain of boiled rice, when the Giant was done. But he could eat no more; and after scooping up about a drop of wine in a little cup he carried with him, he drank the health of Tur-il-i-ra, and then they went out on the front porch, where the Giant ordered his big pipe to be brought, and he had a smoke. When Tur-il-i-ra had finished his pipe, and Ting-a-ling had nearly sneezed himself to death, and the whole atmosphere, for about a mile around the castle, was foggy with smoke, they went in to bed.|$|E

60|$|During {{the time}} I resided in this place, I enjoyed a luxury I {{have never met}} with either before or since--the true bread-fruit. A good deal {{of it has been}} planted about here and in the {{surrounding}} villages, and almost every day we had opportunities of purchasing some, as all the boats going to Amboyna were unloaded just opposite my door to be dragged across the isthmus. Though it grows in several other parts of the Archipelago, it is nowhere abundant, and the season for it only lasts a short time. It is baked entire in the hot embers, and the inside scooped out with a spoon. I compared it to Yorkshire pudding; Charles Allen said it was like <b>mashed</b> <b>potatoes</b> <b>and</b> milk. It is generally {{about the size of a}} melon, a little fibrous towards the centre, but everywhere else quite smooth and puddingy, something in consistence between yeast-dumplings and batter-pudding. We sometimes made curry or stew of it, or fried it in slices; but it is no way so good as simply baked. It may be eaten sweet or savory. With meat and gravy it is a vegetable superior to any I know, either in temperate or tropical countries. With sugar, milk, butter, or treacle, it is a delicious pudding, having a very slight and delicate but characteristic flavour, which, like that of good bread and potatoes, one never gets tired of. The reason why it is comparatively scarce is that it is a fruit of which the seeds are entirely aborted by cultivation, and the tree can therefore only be propagated by cuttings. The seed-bearing variety is common all over the tropics, and though the seeds are very good eating, resembling chestnuts, the fruit is quite worthless as a vegetable. Now that steam and Ward's cases render the transport of young plants so easy, it is much to be wished that the best varieties of this unequalled vegetable should be introduced into our West India islands, and largely propagated there. As the fruit will keep some time after being gathered, we might then be able to obtain this tropical luxury in Covent Garden Market.|$|E
