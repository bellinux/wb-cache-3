They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug noses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good {{breeding}} could overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting; they were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; I knew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly and finally, to <b>my</b> <b>thinking</b> it would be base flattery to call them immoral.|$|E

[...] In 2000, Nunn secured an acquittal for actor Woody Harrelson, who came to Lee County, Kentucky, and planted hemp seeds in open defiance of Kentucky's law forbidding the cultivation of hemp. [...] Later, he traveled to South Dakota where, {{at the base of}} Mount Rushmore, he publicly presented an Oglala Lakota leader with bales of hemp after the tribe's crop was confiscated by officers from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.|$|E

500|$|Spelunky (2008), {{released}} {{shortly after}} {{the formation of the}} Berlin Interpretation, {{is considered to be a}} major contribution to the growth of indie-developed roguelike-likes. Spelunky was developed by Derek Yu, who wanted to take the deep gameplay that is offered by roguelikes and combine it with the ease and pick-up-and-play of a platformer. The result was a platform game incorporating the notion of permadeath in which the player takes an explorer character through randomly-generated underground caves. The intent was to create [...] "deep" [...] gameplay in which the game could be replayed over and over again, with the randomly generated situations driving the need for the player to develop novel, emergent strategies on the fly. [...] Developer Jason Rohrer stated that Spelunky [...] "totally revamped <b>my</b> <b>thinking</b> about single-player videogame design".|$|E
500|$|Independent Film, Holley's debut solo album, was self-released by {{the singer}} in 2008.

It was reported in October 2008 that Holley had been conducting workshops {{on the art of}} audition. He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, and then you get married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and what I want to let people know is {{that there are so many}} jobs out there. <b>My</b> <b>thinking</b> is, if you're a musician and you can make music instead of digging a ditch, make it." ...|$|E
500|$|Orr feuded with Toronto rookie defenceman Pat Quinn that season. In a late season game, Orr {{attempted}} {{to knock the}} puck loose from Maple Leafs goaltender Bruce Gamble and Quinn cross-checked Orr to the ice. Orr kicked Quinn and Quinn kicked Orr. On-ice officials broke it up, but the feud continued into the 1969 playoffs. The Bruins {{finished second in the}} NHL's East Division and drew the Maple Leafs in the first round. In the first game, in Boston, Quinn caught Orr with his head down during a rush, and caught him with an open-ice hit, knocking Orr unconscious. Quinn, assessed five minutes for elbowing, was attacked in the penalty box by a fan and Quinn swung at the fan with his stick, breaking the glass. When Quinn returned, the Boston fans showered garbage onto the ice. Orr was carried out on a stretcher to the dressing room where he revived after the concussion. According to a Boston police officer at the scene, [...] "The fans here don't like anybody to touch Orr. He's their Frank Merriwell and Jack Armstrong rolled into one. To <b>my</b> <b>thinking,</b> it looked like a clean check." [...] The game degenerated into a brawl after the score reached 10–0 for the Bruins. The Bruins went on to sweep the Maple Leafs before losing in six games to the Montreal Canadiens in the second round. Orr returned for the third game against Toronto, getting two assists as the Bruins won their first games in Toronto since 1965.|$|E

Schultz's News and Views radio show was very similar to his WDAY Viewpoint program and quickly grew into a regional broadcast dominating the North Dakota airwaves, with additional listeners in South Dakota, western Minnesota, Montana, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. His political views leaned towards the right during the early years, and Schultz told the Los Angeles Times that he [...] "lined up with the Republicans because they were anti-tax and I {{wanted to make a}} lot of money." [...] His political views became more liberal after he visited a Salvation Army cafeteria in 1998 and later took his radio show on the road riding in a 38-foot motor home.

2500|$|He {{initially}} {{refrained from}} visiting the shrine as a sitting Prime Minister. He did not visit at all {{during his first}} term from September 2006 to September 2007, unlike his predecessor Koizumi, who had visited yearly while in office. Abe's not visiting the shrine prompted a Japanese nationalist named Yoshihiro Tanjo to cut off his own little finger in protest and mail it to the LDP. While campaigning for {{the presidency of the}} LDP in 2012, Abe said that he regretted not visiting the shrine while Prime Minister. He again refrained from visiting the shrine {{during the first year of}} his second stint as Prime Minister in consideration for improving relations with China and Korea, whose leaders refused to meet with Abe during this time. He said on 9 December 2013 that [...] "it is natural that we should express our feelings of respect to the war dead who sacrificed their lives for the nation... but it is <b>my</b> <b>thinking</b> that we should avoid making [...] political and diplomatic issues."

2500|$|Later that day, the Supreme Court {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it had ordered the army to remove Zelaya from office. The Supreme Court stated [...] "The armed forces, in charge of supporting the constitution, acted to defend the state of law and {{have been forced to}} apply legal dispositions against those who have expressed themselves publicly and acted against the dispositions of the basic law". On 30 June, the military's chief lawyer, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza Membreño, showed a detention order, signed 26 June by a Supreme Court judge, which ordered the armed forces to detain the president, identified by his full name of José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, at his home in the Tres Caminos area of the capital. It cited him for treason and abuse of authority, among other charges. Colonel Inestroza later stated that deporting Zelaya did not comply with the court order: [...] "In the moment that we took him out of the country, in the way that he was taken out, there is a crime. Because of the circumstances of the moment this crime occurred, {{there is going to be}} a justification and cause for acquittal that will protect us." [...] He said the decision was taken by the military leadership [...] "in order to avoid bloodshed". He said [...] "What was more beneficial, remove this gentleman from Honduras or present him to prosecutors and have a mob assault and burn and destroy and for us to have to shoot?" [...] Colonel Inestroza also commented that Zelaya's allegiance to Hugo Chávez was hard to stomach and [...] "It would be difficult for us, with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government. That's impossible. I personally would have retired, because <b>my</b> <b>thinking,</b> my principles, would not have allowed me to participate in that." ...|$|E
