Nimbus 5 carried an Electrically Scanning <b>Microwave</b> <b>Radiometer</b> and Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer. Both were used to study Ava. The main data provided by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions.

25|$|Harrison, Peebles, Yu and Zel'dovich {{realized}} that the early universe {{would have to have}} inhomogeneities at the level of 10−4 or 10−5. Rashid Sunyaev later calculated the observable imprint that these inhomogeneities would have on the cosmic microwave background. Increasingly stringent limits on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background were set by ground based experiments during the 1980s. RELIKT-1, a Soviet cosmic microwave background anisotropy experiment on board the Prognoz 9 satellite (launched 1 July 1983) gave upper limits on the large-scale anisotropy. The NASA COBE mission clearly confirmed the primary anisotropy with the Differential <b>Microwave</b> <b>Radiometer</b> instrument, publishing their findings in 1992.

2500|$|When a {{tropical}} disturbance becomes suspect for development as {{a tropical}} or subtropical cyclone, the NHC assigns the system a temporary tracking ("Investigation") number and requests the 53d WRS {{to determine if the}} winds are blowing in a counterclockwise rotation, indicating a [...] "closed cyclonic circulation".

The low-level wind and pressure fields provide an accurate picture for NHC forecasters. Investigative missions are usually flown during daylight and may be timed to arrive in the investigative area at first light in the morning or last light in the evening. Weak pressure gradients, large areas of calm, and light winds in areas of heavy convective activity often make vortex fixes difficult to obtain in areas of weak circulation, challenging the skills of the crews.|$|E
