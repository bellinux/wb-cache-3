25|$|Promising {{alternatives}} to Pt-based catalysts are Metal/Nitrogen/ Carbon-catalysts (M/N/C-catalysts). To achieve high power density, or output of power over {{surface area of}} the cell, a volumetric activity of at least 1/10 that of Pt-based catalysts must be met, along with good mass transport properties. While M/N/C-catalysts still demonstrate poorer volumetric activities than Pt-based catalysts, the reduced costs of such catalysts allows for greater loading to compensate. However, increasing the loading of M/N/C-catalysts also renders the catalytic layer thicker, impairing its mass transport properties. In other words, H2, O2, protons, and electrons have greater difficulty in migrating through the catalytic layer, decreasing the voltage output of the cell. While high microporosity of the M/N/C catalytic network results in high volumetric activity, improved mass transport properties are instead associated to <b>macroporosity</b> of the network.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the relationships between macropore network characteristics, hydraulic properties and state variables and measures of preferential transport in undisturbed columns sampled from four agricultural topsoils of contrasting texture and structure. Macropore network characteristics were computed from 3 -dimensional X-ray tomography images of the soil pore system. Non-reactive solute transport experiments were carried out at five steady-state water flow rates from 2 to 12 mm h − 1. The degree of preferential transport was evaluated by the normalised 5 % solute arrival time and the apparent dispersivity calculated from the resulting breakthrough curves. Near-saturated hydraulic conductivities were measured on the same samples using a tension disk infiltrometer placed {{on top of the}} columns. Results showed that many of the macropore network characteristics were inter-correlated. For example, large <b>macroporosities</b> were associated with larger specific macropore surface areas and better local connectivity of the macropore network.

Columns with smaller <b>macroporosities,</b> poorer local connectivity of the macropore network and smaller near-saturated hydraulic conductivities exhibited a greater degree of preferential transport.

An intensive field survey provided a refined Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for surface and subsurface topography.

The basal spacing of the GIC was increased from 8. 3 Å to 12 in the gallery height. The ejection of interlayer SO 3 molecules by the heating for 1 minute at 950 oC resulted in an exfoliated graphite (EG) with surprisingly high expansion in the direction of c-axis. The expansion ratios of the exfoliated graphites were increased greatly between 220 times and 400 times compared to the original graphite particles, and the bulk density was in the range of 0. 0053 to 0. 01 g/cm 3, depending on reaction time.

By employing the characterization techniques of SAXS, FE-SEM, and physical adsorption of N- 2 in combination with alpha(s) -plot method, the structural properties and external morphologies of large-pore mesoporous organosilicas were critically examined and {{compared with that of}} their pure-silica counterparts synthesized under similar conditions.

40|$|AbstractA {{rigorous}} {{simulation of}} the investment casting process (including view factor calculations) is tedious and time consuming. During the initial simulation stage, one needs to analyze quickly {{a large number of}} process designs to select the most promising ones for more rigorous analysis. Toward this end, a new model was developed for the solidification heat transfer analysis of investment castings. The model is based on an approach that considers the geometric as well as the solidification parameters that dominate the heat transfer and the sequence of solidification and takes into account the radiation heat losses from the mold surface. A new and efficient scheme is developed for the calculation of view factor distribution on the mold surface, which governs the radiation loss. This scheme is generally applicable for models with finite difference representation. The model is capable of predicting the solidification time profile in the casting and can be used for quick estimation of defects like hot spots which lead to <b>macroporosities.</b> Although the proposed model is approximate, it makes only a modest sacrifice in accuracy while making tremendous savings in computation time.

40|$|New {{data from}} {{observations}} of asteroid mutual perturbation events, observations of asteroid satellites, and spacecraft encounters have revolutionized {{our understanding of}} asteroid bulk density. Most asteroids appear to have bulk densities that are well below the grain density of their likely meteorite analogs. This indicates that many asteroids have significant porosity. High porosity attenuates shock propagation, strongly affecting the nature of cratering and greatly lengthening the collisional lifetimes of porous asteroids. Analysis of density trends suggests that asteroids are divided into three general groups: (1) Asteroids that are essentially solid objects, (2) asteroids with <b>macroporosities</b> around 20 % that are probably heavily fractured, and (3) asteroids with macroporosities> 30 % that are loosely consolidated “rubble pile ” structures. 1. OVERVIEW: THE DENSITY AND POROSITY OF ASTEROIDS Data {{from a number of}} sources indicate that many asteroids have significant porosity. In some cases, porosities are large enough to affect asteroid internal structure, gravity field, impact dynamics, and collisional lifetimes. Porosity can also affect a range of asteroid physical properties including thermal diffusivity, seismic velocity, cosmic ray exposure, and dielectric permeability. The thermal and seismic effects can in turn affect asteroid internal evolution, metamorphism, shock dissipation, and elastic properties, which can determine whether colliding asteroids accrete or disrupt. The study of asteroid bulk density, along with supporting studies of meteorite porosity and physical properties, is just beginning. These data are bringing new 1 views of asteroid belt structure and evolution. This chapter will review some of the basic data accumulated on asteroid bulk density and meteorite grain densities. Using these data we will estimate the porosities of asteroids, outline the implications of high porosity on internal structure, examine how porous asteroids respond to impacts and shock, and interpret these data to characterize the distribution of porous objects in the asteroid belt...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} process {{conditions}} on coal pyrolysis and char reactivity is systematically studied using the thermogravimetric reactor equipped with in-situ video microscopy imaging (TGA/VMI). This system provides a complete time-registered {{record of the}} history of single coal particles as they are sequentially pyrolyzed and combusted in the reactor. Three coals are investigated: Illinois # 6, Utah Blind Canyon, and Wyodak-Anderson seam. An image analysis procedure was developed to monitor the transient swelling pattern of the two plastic coals (Illinois and Utah). Particle swelling increases with increasing pyrolysis heating rate and increasing particle size. When pyrolyzed in reactive atmospheres, these coals exhibit less plasticity and less "bubbling", but they swell more. The maximum devolatilization rate occurs during the stage of vigorous "bubbling. " Since the Wyodak coal is not plastic, it does not swell during pyrolysis. Process conditions affect char ignition behavior. Particles will ignite more easily when the observed reaction rates are high and heat removal rates are low. During combustion in the presence of intraparticle diffusional limitations, we observed that large char particles and chars produced at high pyrolysis heating rates ignite more easily. Increased particle sizes slow the heat removal rates, while high pyrolysis heating rates produce chars with larger <b>macroporosities</b> and macropore surface areas thus enhancing the reaction rates. Chars produced in reactive pyrolysis atmospheres appear to be more reactive and ignite more easily. Experiments at low temperatures show that the pyrolysis heating rate, particle size, and pyrolysis atmosphere do not affect the reactivity pattern in the kinetic control regime. We also developed a steady-state mathematical model for char particle ignition. Model parameters were obtained from structural measurements for the Illinois # 6 chars. The model predicts that the ignition temperature decreases with decreasing gas flow rate and increasing pyrolysis heating rate, increasing oxygen concentration and increasing particle size. Model predictions are in excellent agreement with our experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Two {{major factors}} hampering the broad use of rapid prototyped {{biomaterials}} for tissue engineering applications are {{the requirement for}} custom-designed or expensive research-grade three-dimensional (3 -D) printers and the limited selection of suitable thermoplastic biomaterials exhibiting physical characteristics desired for facile surgical handling and biological properties encouraging tissue integration. Properly designed thermoplastic biodegradable amphiphilic polymers can exhibit hydration-dependent hydrophilicity changes and stiffening behavior, which may be exploited to facilitate the surgical delivery/self-fixation of the scaffold within a physiological tissue environment. Compared to conventional hydrophobic polyesters, they also present significant advantages in blending with hydrophilic osteoconductive minerals with improved interfacial adhesion for bone tissue engineering applications. Here we demonstrated the excellent blending of biodegradable, amphiphilic PLA-PEG-PLA (PELA) triblock co-polymer with hydroxyapatite (HA) and the fabrication of high-quality rapid prototyped 3 -D macroporous composite scaffolds using an unmodified consumer-grade 3 -D printer. The rapid prototyped HA-PELA composite scaffolds and the PELA control (without HA) swelled (66 % and 44 % volume increases, respectively) and stiffened (1. 38 -fold and 4 -fold increases in compressive modulus, respectively) in water. To test {{the hypothesis that the}} hydration-induced physical changes can translate into self-fixation properties of the scaffolds within a confined defect, a straightforward in vitro pull-out test was designed to quantify the peak force required to dislodge these scaffolds from a simulated cylindrical defect at dry vs. wet states. Consistent with our hypothesis, the peak fixation force measured for the PELA and HA-PELA scaffolds increased 6 -fold and 15 -fold upon hydration, respectively. Furthermore, we showed that the low-fouling 3 -D PELA inhibited the attachment of NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts or MSCs while the HA-PELA readily supported cellular attachment and osteogenic differentiation. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of rapid prototyping biphasic PELA/HA-PELA scaffolds for potential guided bone regeneration where an osteoconductive scaffold interior encouraging osteointegration and a non-adhesive surface discouraging fibrous tissue encapsulation is desired. This work demonstrated that by combining facile and readily translatable rapid prototyping approaches with unique biomaterial designs, biodegradable composite scaffolds with well-controlled <b>macroporosities,</b> spatially defined biological microenvironment, and useful handling characteristics can be developed...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{possible}} end results to uni-directionally freezing a suspension of particles. First, the ice-growth proceeds as a planar front, pushing particles in front like a bulldozer pushes {{a pile of}} rocks. This scenario usually occurs at very low solidification velocities (< 1 μm s−1) or with extremely fine particles because they can move by Brownian motion away from the front. The resultant structure contains no <b>macroporosity.</b> If one were to increase the solidification speed, {{the size of the}} particles or solid loading moderately, the particles begin to interact in a meaningful way with the approaching ice front. The result is typically a lamellar or cellular templated structure whose exact morphology depends on the particular conditions of the system. It is this type of solidification that is targeted for porous materials made by freeze-casting. The third possibility for a freeze-cast structure occurs when particles are given insufficient time to segregate from the suspension, resulting in complete encapsulation of the particles within the ice front. This occurs when the freezing rates are rapid, particle size becomes sufficiently large, or when the solids loading is high enough to hinder particle motion.To ensure templating, the particles must be ejected from the oncoming front. Energetically speaking, this will occur if there is an overall increase in free energy if the particle were to be engulfed (Δσ > 0).|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of branched copolymers with precise composition, specifically {{the ratio of}} methacrylic acid (MAA) to ethylene glycol (EG) has been demonstrated. These polymers were used to stabilise dodecane oil-in-water emulsion droplets. It was demonstrated in the literature that branched copolymers containing a 1 : 1 ratio of MAA:EG formed pH-responsive emulsions, capable of triggered inter-droplet hydrogen bonding to form engineered emulsions (EE). The effect of varying this ratio on the rate of engineered emulsion formation, and the resulting strength and stiffness of the emulsion droplet aggregates was investigated. This control over systems is exemplified by the demonstration of selective acid-triggered assembly of binary mixtures of droplets stabilised by polymer containing only EG functionality with droplets stabilised by polymers containing only MAA functionality. EEs stabilised using a branched copolymer containing a 1 : 1 ratio of MAA:EG were produced and allowed to dehydrate, leading to the removal of water from droplet interstitial sites. The resulting single-phase materials are known as polymer-structured oils (PSOs), held structurally by the inter-droplet polymer-polymer interactions. These polymer boundaries provide enough of a barrier between droplets to prevent coalescence upon the removal of water, allowing reversible hydration of PSOs to reform EEs. The production of large volume, well-defined EEs produced via the hydrolysis of glucono-δ-lactone (GδL) to gluconic acid in an emulsion’s water phase was investigated. This process provides a homogeneous pH trigger {{for the formation of}} EEs, eliminating the slow diffusion of HCl. A homogeneous pH trigger also allows the formation of EEs to be studied in situ using rheology. A comparison between GδL and a conventional HCl trigger is presented. Branched copolymer-stabilised ethyl acetate o/w emulsions were used as templates in the production of both pH-responsive, surface-functionalised poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) colloidal nanoparticles and non-responsive PMMA particles via an emulsion-solvent-evaporation technique. Lowering of the solution pH can trigger the reversible aggregation of these highly dispersed pH-responsive colloids into 3 D structures with internal <b>macroporosities</b> dictated by the method of dehydration employed. The colloids can also co-encapsulate various hydrophobic molecules without any effect on particle stability and pH-responsiveness. The production of multi-responsive emulsion droplets via the encapsulation of oleophilic, magnetic Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles within a stable, surface-functionalised dodecane o/w emulsion was investigated. Droplet surface functionality allowed the formation of EE on lowering the pH, and encapsulated nanoparticles gave both the free-flowing and aggregated emulsions magnetic-responsiveness. The rate of aggregation and gel strength of multi-responsive EEs is compared to that of a standard pH-responsive emulsion...|$|R
40|$|Most asteroids in {{the size}} range of {{approximately}} 100 m to 100 km are rubble piles, aggregates of rocky material held together mainly by gravitational forces, and only weak cohesion. They contain high <b>macroporosities,</b> indicating {{a large amount of}} void space in their interiors. How these voids are distributed is not yet known, as in-situ measurements are still outstanding. In this work, a model to create rubble pile asteroid simulants for use in SPH impact simulations is presented. Rubble pile asteroids are modelled as gravitational re-aggregating remnant fragments of a catastrophically disrupted parent body, which are represented by spherical pebbles. It is shown that this approach allows to explicitly follow the internal restructuring of rubble pile asteroids during impact events, while preserving the expected properties of the bulk asteroid as known from observations and experiments. The bulk behaviour of asteroid simulants, as characterized by the stability against disruption and fragment size distribution, follows the expected behaviour and is not sensitive to the exact distribution of voids in the interior structure, but rather to the void fraction as the amount of consolidated void space in between the constituent fragment pebbles. No exact a priory knowledge of the fragment size distribution inside the body is therefore needed to use this model in impact simulations. Modelling the behaviour of the large-scale rubble pile constituents during impact events is used as a tool to infer the internal structure of asteroids by linking surface features like hills or pits to the creation of sub-catastrophic craters. In this work, the small rubble pile asteroid (2867) Šteins is analysed. The flyby of the Rosetta spacecraft at Šteins has revealed several interesting features: the large crater Diamond close to the southern pole, a hill like feature almost opposite to the crater, and a catena of crater pits extending radially from the rim of the crater. A possible link between these two structures and the cratering event is investigated in a series of impact simulations varying the interior of a plausible shape of Šteins prior to the event that formed crater Diamond. A connection between the cratering event and the hill is shown to be highly unlikely. Therefore, the hill is most likely a remnant of the formation of Šteins. Its size therefore helps to infer the initial size distribution of fragments forming the asteroid. The formation of a fracture radially from the crater can be observed for rubble pile simulants with highly collimated voids. This fracture could plausibly form the catena of pits observed on Šteins. This can therefore serve as a link between observable surface features and Šteins internal structure. The interior of Šteins is most likely an aggregate of fragments that themselves are only lightly fractured, and large void spaces might be found inside the asteroid. As Šteins seems to be a good example of a YORPoid, an asteroid that has been evolved to a top-like shape by radiative forces due to the YORP effect, this gives first insights in the distribution of voids in the interior of this class of rubble pile asteroids...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of calcium}} {{phosphate}} cements (CPC) is restricted by {{their lack of}} <b>macroporosity</b> and poor drug release properties. To overcome these two limitations, incorporating degradable polymer microparticles into CPC is an attractive option, as polymer microparticles could help to control drug release and induce <b>macroporosity</b> after degradation. Although few authors have yet tested synthetic polymers, the potentiality of polysaccharides’ assuming this role has never been explored. Low-methoxy amidated pectins (LMAP) constitute valuable candidates because of their biocompatibility and ionic and pH sensitivity. In this study, the potentiality of a LMAP {{with a degree of}} esterification (DE) of 30 and a degree of amidation (DA) of 19 was explored. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the influence of LMAP microspheres within the composite on the cement properties, drug release ability and final <b>macroporosity</b> after microspheres degradation. Three LMAP incorporation ratios, 2 %, 4 % and 6 % w/w were tested, and ibuprofen was chosen as the model drug. In comparison with the CPC reference, the resulting composites presented reduced setting times and lowered the mechanical properties, which remained acceptable for an implantation in moderate-stress-bearing locations. Sustained release of ibuprofen was obtained on at least 45 days, and release rates were found to be controlled by the LMAP ratio, which modulated drug diffusion. After 4 months of degradation study, the resulting CPC appeared macroporous, with a maximum <b>macroporosity</b> of nearly 30 % for the highest LMAP incorporation ratio, and interconnectivity between pores could be observed. In conclusion, LMAP appear as interesting candidates to generate macroporous bone cements with tailored release properties and <b>macroporosity</b> by adjusting the pectin content within the composites...|$|E

40|$|Measurement of {{soil water}} {{retention}} capacity by the conventional pressure plate technique always gives a substantial view of soil porosity distribution. The structural orientation is {{observed in the}} beginning (higher water retention at 9. 8 to 98 hPa water head pressure indicates greater proportion of <b>macroporosity)</b> of the soil moisture characteristic curve obtained from the water retention measurement. Since, tillage practices generally increase soil porosity, the correlation between soil hydraulics and porosity distribution would expect to be different for different tillage systems. In general, <b>macroporosity</b> increase with the adoption of conservative tillage or no tillage system but the changes can be varied with the seasonal variation. In our study, winter ploughing retains more water at the range of 9. 8 to 98 hPa than Strip tillage, No-till residues in and No-till residues out. So, we can conclude that there is certainly increase in <b>macroporosity</b> in ploughing than other conservation practices of reduced tillage and no tillage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to analyze the effect of integrated crop-livestock systems on soil hydraulic properties, and test the potential use of these properties as physical quality indicators of a Cerrado Oxisol. The field study was conducted at Embrapa Cerrados, Planaltina, DF, Brazil, considering soil layers of: 0 - 5, 10 - 15, 20 - 25 and 40 - 45 cm. Crop-livestock systems caused significant changes in soil bulk density, volumetric soil-water content, soil penetration resistance, total porosity, <b>macroporosity,</b> effective microporosity, unsaturated pores and available water. An increase was observed in both soil resistance and bulk density for all systems {{in comparison to the}} cerrado. However, higher soil resistance did not appear as a limiting factor for annual crops growth in a rotation sequence. Total porosity and <b>macroporosity</b> were higher in the cerrado, and in the systems with no-tillage in relation to conventional tillage. Soil penetration resistance, <b>macroporosity,</b> bulk density and available soil-water properties are reliable indicators of the soil physical quality...|$|E
40|$|Tillage {{influences}} first {{soil structure}} and then soil organisms such as earthworms, which are highly {{involved in the}} creation of soil <b>macroporosity.</b> This study assessed the temporal dynamics of earthworm-related <b>macroporosity</b> in two ploughed and one unploughed cropping systems. Three sampling dates were chosen: one month before ploughing, and one and five months after the event. Earthworm communities, able to rebuild the <b>macroporosity,</b> were sampled one and five months after ploughing. Before ploughing, the burrow continuity, i. e., the number of burrows with a vertical length greater than 5 cm, was not significantly different in the three systems. It was stable between the three sampling dates in the unploughed system but it decreased by 65 % and 46 % after ploughing (i. e., in two months) in the organic and the conventional systems, respectively. Five months after ploughing, the burrow continuity remained between two and four times lower than in the unploughed living mulch cropping system. Earthworm biomass was higher and burrow system characteristics (i. e. burrow volume and continuity) were more stable over time in the non-tilled with a living mulch cropping system than in the tilled systems. Earthworm-produced <b>macroporosity</b> was thus substantially decreased after ploughing in conventional and organic systems and had still not totally recovered 5 months later. This can lead to large functional consequences on soil structure and thus on air and water fluxes in the soil...|$|E
40|$|The {{limiting}} {{factors of}} the Brazilian savanna physical environment {{have been largely}} discussed. Soil morphology is fundamental to understand the behavior of soil water flow, soil physical properties and soil-landscape relationships. The {{aim of this study}} is to relate soil micro and macromorphologic attributes to soil water retention on a toposequence under native savanna woodland (cerradão) in a permanent plot of 320 m ´ 320 m installed in Assis, SP, Brazil. Samples collected at five points within the toposequence were used to determine the soil <b>macroporosity</b> by means of image analyses, estimated total porosity, chemical analysis, particle size distribution analysis and soil water retention. From the summit down to the footslope, the soils were classified as Rhodic Haplustox, Typic Haplustox and Epiaquic Haplustult, presenting a gradual color transition and a sandy loam texture. In the surface horizons, the higher organic matter content and the high total <b>macroporosity</b> determined a lower soil bulk density and lower water retention. In the Oxisols, the high soil <b>macroporosity</b> results from the packing of microaggregates in the oxic horizon. In the Ultisol, the lower total porosity in the deeper horizons resulted in a higher water retention and an imperfect water drainage. The water retention conditions on the slope influenced the morphological differences in soil color and structure. The low water retention on the surface and oxic horizons, conditioned by the high total <b>macroporosity,</b> is one of the factors that may define the vegetal pattern of the savanna woodland within the permanent plot...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of lithophysae in some units of Topopah Spring Tuff at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, the U. S. high level nuclear waste repository, have a detrimental {{effect on the}} engineering properties of the rock mass and its performance. The lithophysae were formed by pockets of gas trapped within the falling volcanic ash that formed the tuff units. The porosity associated with the lithophysae is termed <b>macroporosity</b> {{because of the large}} pore size as compared with traditional rock pores. In this paper, lithophysae-rich tuff and analog models (both cylindrical and cubic) made of plaster of Paris containing artificially created cavities were tested to assess the effect of <b>macroporosity</b> on both the uniaxial compressive strength and failure modes of the specimens. As expected, compressive strength decreases with increasing porosity due to lithophysae in tuff and cavities in plaster analog specimens. Failure modes of cylindrical specimens were also investigated. The failure modes observed were grouped into four distinct categories: spalling, axial splitting, shear failure and web failure. The failure modes transition from spalling through web failure as the percentage of <b>macroporosity</b> within the specimen increased...|$|E
40|$|<b>Macroporosity</b> {{is often}} used in the {{determination}} of soil compaction. Reduced <b>macroporosity</b> can lead to poor drainage, low root aeration and soil degradation. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and test different models to estimate macro and microporosity efficiently, using multiple regression. Ten soils were selected within a large range of textures: sand (Sa) 0. 07 - 0. 84; silt 0. 03 - 0. 24; clay 0. 13 - 0. 78 kg kg- 1 and subjected to three compaction levels (three bulk densities, BD). Two models with similar accuracy were selected, with a mean error of about 0. 02 m³ m- 3 (2 %). The model y = a + b. BD + c. Sa, named model 2, was selected for its simplicity to estimate Macro (Ma), Micro (Mi) or total porosity (TP) : Ma = 0. 693 - 0. 465 BD + 0. 212 Sa; Mi = 0. 337 + 0. 120 BD - 0. 294 Sa; TP = 1. 030 - 0. 345 BD 0. 082 Sa; porosity values were expressed in m³ m- 3; BD in kg dm- 3; and Sa in kg kg- 1. The model was tested with 76 datum set of several other authors. An error of about 0. 04 m³ m- 3 (4 %) was observed. Simulations of variations in BD as a function of Sa are presented for Ma = 0 and Ma = 0. 10 (10 %). The <b>macroporosity</b> equation was remodeled to obtain other compaction indexes: a) to simulate maximum bulk density (MBD) as a function of Sa (Equation 11), in agreement with literature data; b) to simulate relative bulk density (RBD) as a function of BD and Sa (Equation 13); c) another model to simulate RBD as a function of Ma and Sa (Equation 16), confirming the independence of this variable in relation to Sa for a fixed value of <b>macroporosity</b> and, also, proving the hypothesis of Hakansson & Lipiec that RBD = 0. 87 corresponds approximately to 10 % <b>macroporosity</b> (Ma = 0. 10 m³ m- 3) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of clay content in soil-pore structure {{development and the}} relative importance of <b>macroporosity</b> in governing convective fluid flow are two key challenges toward better understanding and quantifying soil ecosystem functions. In this study, soil physical measurements (soil-water retention and air permeability) and x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning were combined and used from two scales on intact soil columns (100 and 580 cm(3)). The columns were sampled along a natural clay gradient at six locations (L 1, L 2, L 3, L 4, L 5 and L 6 with 0. 11, 0. 16, 0. 21, 0. 32, 0. 38 and 0. 46 kg kg(- 1) clay content, respectively) at a field site in Lerbjerg, Denmark. The water-holding capacity of soils markedly increased with increasing soil clay content, while significantly higher air permeability was observed for the L 1 to L 3 soils than for the L 4 to L 6 soils. Higher air permeability values observed for 580 - than 100 -cm(3) soil columns implied a scale effect and relatively greater importance of macropores in convective fluid flow at larger scale. Supporting this, x-ray CT showed that both interaggregate pores and biopores (pores formed by earthworms and plant roots) were present at L 1 to L 3 in decreasing order, whereas only interaggregate pores were observed at L 4 to L 6. <b>Macroporosity</b> inferred from x-ray CT to quantify pores > 1 mm decreased from 2. 9 to 0. 1 % from L 1 to L 6. A progressive improvement was observed in the linear relationship (R- 2 increasing 0. 50 - 0. 95) of air permeability with total air-filled porosity, CT-inferred <b>macroporosity,</b> and CT-inferred limiting <b>macroporosity</b> (minimum <b>macroporosity</b> for any quarter of soil column).

40|$|Estimation of hydraulic: {{properties}} or soils having macropores is difficult, yet {{very important}} for describing soil-water flow dynamics. Conventional approaches of defining <b>macroporosity</b> based on pore size may not be generally successful quantitatively relating <b>macroporosity</b> to the dynamics of water flow. A definition or <b>macroporosity</b> based on water flux at different degrees or water saturation {{can be expected to}} be more useful. This study attempted to quantify the functional <b>macroporosity</b> of field soil from In situ measurements of water content, 6 (z, t), during drainage of an initially field-saturated soil. The soil was assumed to be a two-domain water flow system comprised of macropores, which dominate the early drainage process, and the matrix pore space, which is responsible for drainage occurring after macropores are emptied. The unit hydraulic gradient approach of calculating hydraulic productivity was extended and applied to the two-domain system. Field-measured data for a well-drained Wahiawa soil (clayey, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Tropeptic Eutrustox) in Hawaii are used to test the approach. The partitioned hydraulic conductivities obtained for the two domains appeared qualitatively realistic, and when summed, resulted in a composite saturated conductivity which was close to that measured by the in situ instantaneous profile method. In addition, the macosporosites obtained from drainage calculations for three soil depths were very similar to those obtained from water retention measurements on undisturbed soil cores from the same field site. The proposed approach thus appears to be a promising method for evaluating hydraulic properties for a well-drained soil profile containing macrospores...|$|E
