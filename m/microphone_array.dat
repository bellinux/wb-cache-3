40|$|<b>Microphone</b> <b>arrays</b> have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} interest over the last few decades since they have the potential to solve many important problems such as noise reduction/speech enhancement, source separation, dereverberation, spatial sound recording, and source localization/tracking, to name a few. However, the design and implementation of <b>microphone</b> <b>arrays</b> with beamforming algorithms is not a trivial task when it comes to processing broadband signals such as speech. Indeed, in most sensor arrangements, the beamformer tends to have a frequency-dependent response. One exception, perhaps, is the family of differential <b>microphone</b> <b>arrays</b> (DMAs) that have the promise to form frequency-independent responses. Moreover, they have the potential to attain high directional gains with small and compact apertures. As a result, this type of <b>microphone</b> <b>arrays</b> has drawn much research and development attention recently.

30|$|Recent {{years have}} seen great {{interest}} {{in the design of}} steerable broadband beamformers for <b>microphone</b> <b>arrays</b> [7 – 14]. Among the proposed design approaches, some are tailored to specific array configurations, such as differential <b>microphone</b> <b>arrays</b> [7] and spherical <b>microphone</b> <b>arrays</b> [8]. Comparatively, the Farrow-structure-based steerable broadband beamformers (FSBBs), also known as the polynomial beamformers [12], are particularly interesting in some applications, since they are applicable to arbitrary array configurations, and moreover, their passbands can be steered online with just one single parameter [10]. In practice, there usually exist some mismatches among microphones, such as gain and phase errors [15]. Unfortunately, the FSBBs are highly sensitive to microphone mismatches. Therefore, the design of FSBBs robust against microphone mismatches has drawn attention recently.|$|R
