25|$|The {{implementation}} of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 resulted in {{the expansion of the}} <b>maquiladora</b> industry and created new opportunities for employment for women outside of the home and in the factories. The availability of cheap labor was attractive for business owners to open factories in Mexico and the availability of employment attracted many, especially women, to border towns such as Ciudad Juárez. Research has shown correlations between economic and political issues and violence against women along the border.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the murder}} victims in Ciudad Juárez have been <b>maquiladora</b> employees. Despite the {{expansion}} of the maquila industry, Juárez still remained a relatively poor and undeveloped city lacking infrastructure in some parts such as electricity and paved roads. As a part of their daily commute, many women maquila workers walk through such areas to and from company buses creating vulnerability to be victimized. In addition, the increased involvement of women in the labor force may also be a contributing factor to the victimization of women and girls because of the competition for economic resources in decades in which male unemployment has been high.|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at {{studying}} {{the emergence of the}} <b>maquiladoras</b> in Mexico, their evolution, characteristics and stages of development. The theoretical background of the <b>maquiladoras</b> is considered from the position of the product life cycle theory. As one of the preconditions for the emergence of the socalled «golden age» of the <b>maquiladoras</b> served a powerful devaluation of the Mexican peso in the mid 1990 's. Along with this, a number of authors have noted the non-obviousness of economic successes in the whole economy of Mexico. The current stage is characterized by the transition of the <b>maquiladoras</b> from assembling and simple productions towards the producing innovative products and marketing their own brands. It is noted that among the investors in the <b>maquiladoras,</b> in contrary to the American TNCs, the number of companies from Southeast Asia and Europe is still growing. The author concludes that {{in the middle of the}} 1990 's the <b>maquiladoras</b> were transformed from the special economic cross-border trade along with investments with the United States, which had a local character, into a classical free trade zone. The article contains an attempt to extrapolate the experience of the <b>maquiladoras</b> on interaction in the creation of a free trade zone with the US-market, against the background of the growing competition from Southeast Asian countries at the US-market, considering the current trade relations of Ukraine with the EU...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} examines {{the relationship between}} violence towards women and participation in work in the <b>maquiladoras</b> along the United States-Mexico border. I have found that women and young girls {{who work in the}} <b>maquiladoras</b> are subjected to sexual harassment at work and the threat of murder when they leave work. The first part of this paper discusses the background of the <b>maquiladoras</b> and gives {{a detailed description of the}} associated violence. The second part of this paper discusses possible motives and explanations for the violence. Therefore this paper addresses two questions: First, why are the <b>maquiladoras</b> the site of such gender based violence? Second, why do the murders continue? The use of sociological theory, more specifically intersectionality theory, determines the answers to these questions...|$|R
25|$|Maquiladoras (manufacturing {{plants that}} take in {{imported}} {{raw materials and}} produce goods for domestic consumption and export on behalf of foreign companies) have become the landmark of trade in Mexico. This sector has benefited from NAFTA, in that real income in the <b>maquiladora</b> sector has increased 15.5% since 1994, though from the non-maquiladora sector has grown much faster. Contrary to popular belief, this should be no surprise since maquiladora's products could enter the US duty-free since the 1960s industry agreement. Other sectors now benefit from the free trade agreement, and the share of exports from non-border states has increased in the last 5 years while the share of exports from maquiladora-border states has decreased.|$|E

Several vehicles were washed away due to the floods. In contrast to roads, there was little railway damage. There was minor impact to the nation's airports, limited to some damage to air traffic equipment. Seaports also sustained minor damage, although many lost electronic equipment. Hurricane Mitch left widespread power outages after damaging more than [...] of power lines and several power plants. About 11% of Honduras's telephone lines were damaged during the storm. Landslides and flooding contaminated aqueducts in several cities, including 1,600systems in rural areas. Many cities sustained damage to their water network, and about 70% of Honduras lost access to fresh water after the storm, although many rural areas had already been experiencing water shortages. The combined damage to transportation, communication, utilities, including power and water, was estimated at $665million. Communications were disrupted after power outages, and there were also fuel and water shortages. Flooding damaged or destroyed industrial areas of Honduras, which affected exports and domestic products. Six <b>maquiladora</b> factories were damaged in the northern portion of the country, and one was destroyed in La Ceiba. Many businesses shut down, leaving many people unemployed who already lost their homes. Mitch also destroyed 123health facilities nationwide and wrecked 4,835classrooms, or 23%, of the classrooms. As a result, most classes that would have gone until November30 were ended about a month early, allowing teachers to assist in helping others.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the <b>maquiladora</b> program {{was in place}} far before NAFTA, in some sense dating {{all the way back}} to 1965.

5000|$|Since {{globalization}} and physical restructuring {{have contributed to}} the competition and advent of low-cost offshore assembly in places such as China, and countries in Central America, <b>maquiladoras</b> in Mexico have been on the decline since 2000: According to federal sources, approximately 529 <b>maquiladoras</b> shut down and investment in assembly plants decreased by 8.2 percent in 2002 after the imposition of countervailing duties on Chinese products, not available in North America, that were part of the electronics supply chain. Despite the decline, over 3,000 <b>maquiladoras</b> still exist along the 2,000 mile-long United States - Mexico border, providing employment for approximately one million workers, and importing more than $51 billion in supplies into Mexico. Research indicates that maquiladoras' post-NAFTA growth is connected to changes in Mexican wages relative to those in Asia and in the United States, and to fluctuations in U.S. industrial production. As of 2006, <b>maquiladoras</b> still accounted for 45 percent of Mexico’s exports. [...] <b>Maquiladoras,</b> in general, are best represented among operations that are particularly assembly intensive.|$|R

[...] The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's [...] "magnet status" [...] for people who have come from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty.

50|$|Mexico {{possesses}} a strong system of labor laws, yet enforcement {{of these laws}} within the <b>maquiladora</b> industry is often lax.⁠⁠ While most people who were employed under the original Bracero Program were men, the majority of <b>maquiladora</b> employees are young women. Women are preferred to men, because women typically work more. Some <b>maquiladora</b> operators have admitted a preference for women also because women often display a greater level of patience and higher dexterity than men in performing the repetitive work of an assembly plant.
