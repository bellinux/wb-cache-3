5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory <b>marking</b> (<b>spraying</b> urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|R

5000|$|Gordon and Bullock {{meet with}} museum curator, Thatch (Jerry Dixon), who tells them that apart from {{stealing}} the painting, two other paintings had question <b>marks</b> <b>spray</b> painted on them. Gordon realizes the question marks are above the artists' names, [...] "Marché" [...] and [...] "LaRue". As Marché means market and LaRue means road, Gordon deduces Market Street. Also, the stolen painting has an exploding train {{on it and}} is called [...] "Bloody Monday", Gordon finally realizes there is a bomb {{at the train station}} on Market Street. They arrive at the train station where they discover an explosive device in a locker. Gordon throws the device in an open stone column before it detonates.|$|R

500|$|Production {{designer}} Oliver Scholl and {{his team}} worked with lead builder Pierre Bohanna to develop concept art for several battle suit options based on contemporary, real-world powered exoskeleton initiatives, such as those supported by DARPA. When director Doug Liman chose a design, the team built an aluminum prototype frame that had pivot points and hinges. Costume designer Kate Hawley contributed a gritty aesthetic design for the color palettes and surface treatments. While the design {{was meant to be}} utilitarian, it was also created so the actors could be seen in the suits and also run in them. The team created a foam mock-up of Tom Cruise so the frame could be tailored for him. The team handcrafted [...] material and [...] material battle suits in the course of almost five months. There were three versions of the battle suits: [...] "grunts, dogs, and tanks". The battle suit for Blunt's character had red slash <b>marks</b> <b>sprayed</b> on to reflect a Joan of Arc quality.|$|R
40|$|Rabies {{transmitted}} by domestic dogs {{is a serious}} yet neglected public health threat in many underserved communities in Africa and Asia. Achieving 70 % vaccination coverage in dog populations through annual mass vaccination campaigns is {{an effective means of}} controlling the disease in these communities. Evaluating the extent to which this target coverage is achieved requires either accurate pre-campaign estimates of the dog population size or accurate estimates of the coverage attained by conducting post-vaccination surveys. Short-term marking of dogs by applying visible marks may be useful to achieve these estimates, but will be affected by the performance of the marking methods. We evaluated the longevity and visibility of two readily-available livestock marking methods applied to owned, free roaming dogs. We applied two types of <b>marks</b> (<b>spray</b> and crayon) with three different colours (red, blue and green) to each of 21 dogs and compared the time of persistence of the marks over several weeks. Two independent observers assessed the visibility and colour of the marks. Each dog was observed over eight to 37 days (median: 28 days). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and semi-parametric log-rank tests were performed separately for both observers. <b>Spray</b> <b>marks</b> remained visible significantly longer (median of 24 days for both observers) compared with crayon marks (medians of 10 and 13 days). After 10 days, 90 % of <b>spray</b> <b>marks</b> were still visible, compared with only 46 % of crayon marks. Visibility of marks was reduced in darker-coloured dogs. Colours of marks were frequently misclassified, and agreement between observers on the colours of the marks was low (Cohen’s kappa coefficient = 0. 27). The livestock marker spray can effectively be used to mark dogs that are physically restrained, for example during vaccination campaigns. Resight surveys should be conducted within a short a time as possible after marking; however, our results suggest that loss of marks will not have a significant impact if surveys are conducted within 5 - 7 days after <b>marking</b> with the <b>spray.</b> Results that depend on observers’ abilities to distinguish between the three colours which we evaluated may not be reliable.

5000|$|Scent marking, {{also known}} as {{territorial}} <b>marking</b> or <b>spraying</b> when this involves urination, is a behaviour used by animals to identify their territory. Most commonly, this is accomplished by depositing strong-smelling substances contained in the urine, faeces, or, from specialised scent glands located on various areas of the body. Often, the scent contains pheromones or carrier proteins such as the major urinary proteins to stabilize the odours and maintain them for longer. [...] The animal sniffing the scent frequently displays a flehmen response to assist in detecting the mark.|$|R
