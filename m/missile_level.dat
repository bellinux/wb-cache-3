50|$|Henson and Rodriguez {{make it to}} the {{extraction}} vehicle. There, they prepare to rescue Nightingale and Ellis, but Rodriguez is bitten by a zombie who was locked {{in the back of the}} van by the soldier assigned to guard it. Henson executes Rodriguez, and the duo arrive in front of the science building as Nightingale and Ellis fight their way through a horde of zombies. Ellis and Nightingale saved by Henson, but the blood sample vial is destroyed in the process. They are forced to turn back, with ten minutes before the military releases the <b>missile</b> <b>level</b> the campus, and fight their way back to the confinement room. They retrieve a second vial, but Henson is bitten on the ankle. She remains behind and commits suicide, as Nightingale and Ellis escape before the missile strikes the campus and only Ellis made it out but Nightingale trapped surrounded by zombies. Bart breaks free from the dormitory by amputating his hand and forces Ellis to hand over the vial. Bart decides to kill Ellis anyway, Nightingale survives and kills Bart. His dying action is to pull the pin on a hand grenade, destroying the vial in the process. Nightingale is wounded but uncertain of whether she's infected. Ellis refuses to execute her, as the two leave together and headed to the city, finding that the infection has spread to the rest of the city.|$|E
5000|$|In each city, {{the player}} drives an armored sports car {{equipped}} with surface-to-air missiles and rapid-fire guns. Player performance {{is measured by}} the number of kills. The player may use money earned in the game to upgrade the car's engine, tires, chassis, guns, and <b>missiles.</b> <b>Level</b> completion requires capturing one to four flags, and then passing through the exit. The game has four difficulty levels: Rookie, Amateur, Professional, and World Class. To complete the game, the player must play through all cities twice at the [...] "World Class" [...] difficulty setting.|$|R
25|$|Like many early {{missiles}} of the era, the Stooge was boosted to {{the approximate}} altitude of the attacker and then flown onto an intercept course. Flares located in fairings {{on the wing}} tips provided a bright source for the operator to track visually. After launch the <b>missile</b> <b>levelled</b> off and a simple gyroscope-controlled autopilot, located in the forwards portion of the fuselage, kept the Stooge flying in a straight line. Control of first the elevators and then, 3 seconds later, the ailerons were released to the operator - the delay necessary for the gyro control to stabilise first. Using radio control, the operator would fly the missile into a position {{in front of the}} target, and then adjust the path in order to collide with the target. Control was via the ailerons and elevator, the vertical stabilizer did not contain a movable rudder.|$|R

In the event that anti-aircraft cannons are active near the drop zone, the HALO technique also minimizes the parachutist's exposure to flak.|$|R
40|$|The tests {{described}} in this report were performed in my presence. The test results reported are fairly and accurately described, {{to the best of}} my knowledge, and observations and conclusions apply only to the specimens tested and under the testing conditions. Tests were performed per ASTM Standard E 1886 (2005). The size of the specimen was determined by the Florida Department of Community Affairs, Division of Emergency Management, Bureau of Preparedness and Response. The missiles used in the tests were representative of <b>Missile</b> <b>Level</b> D. The metal mesh and its welded connection to the test frame resisted penetration of the 2 x 4 and passed the requirement of a 3 inch diameter solid sphere not passing through after impact. There were signs of distress at the weld points. This was evidenced by breaking of the metal mesh strands adjacent to the welds. Specifics for the welded connections that caused better test performance of the system are noted in the Conclusions section of this report...|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot complimented the game's playability, {{but said}} it was soured by the {{repetitive}} objectives: [...] "...each new challenge is roughly {{the same as the}} previous... you fly around, use your radar to locate your targets, lock on, and destroy them with your heat seeking <b>missiles.</b> Each new <b>level</b> brings a sense of deja vu that can make the Eiffel Tower level feel the same as the Grand Canyon level." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gameplay {{involves}} {{being the}} pilot of an Apache Helicopter, and shooting enemies down {{in the style of}} a vertical scrolling shooter. Large red gunships can be shot down to gain power-ups for the helicopter in order to upgrade the guns and have it fire homing <b>missiles.</b> Each <b>level</b> features a midboss and a boss, and both must be destroyed in order to advance to the next level. The style of the levels as the player advances alternates between [...] "Shooting Mode" [...] and [...] "Exploration Mode," [...] where the latter involves levels set in a fantasy-like setting and are the only level types that provide no power-ups to the player and give the player the ability to switch their altitude.|$|R
40|$|Two {{research}} institutes TNO Defence, Security and Safety and DRDC-Valcartier {{have worked}} together on the improvement of modeling and simulation tools for the functioning of supersonic air intakes for realistic ramjet engines of tactical missiles. The emphasis laid on complex rectangular intake designs making use of an internal bleed system and on incorporating the functioning of air intakes at off-design conditions (below and above the design Mach number and at angle-of-attack {{with respect to the}} freestream velocity). In order to generate air intake performance data validated CFD-strategies were pursued. Two-and three dimensional CFD studies were performed and in order to validate the numerical results, a wind tunnel test campaign was conducted. The understanding of ramjet air intakes was greatly enhanced over the years and validated numerical approaches were successfully obtained. Furthermore insight in the influence on the availability of accurate intake performance data on ramjet engine and <b>missile</b> performance <b>levels</b> was gained. © 2009 by TNO Defence, Security and Safety...|$|R

50|$|Superman's {{return to}} Metropolis is greeted with ecstatic applause by most, but Lois Lane seems {{somewhat}} hesitant {{to put her}} faith in him again. Soon after his return however, Metallo attacks the city with an army of robotic beings. Superman is forced to fight both the supervillain and his minions. The lesser opponents are of little consequence to the Kryptonian, but Metallo is another matter. Superman and Metallo go hand-to-hand where Metallo transforms into a towering monstrosity that Superman cannot directly touch because his kryptonite-laced body will cause the Man of Steel to temporarily lose his stamina. Superman compensates for this by throwing vehicles at the villain. Realizing that {{he is about to}} be defeated, Metallo fires a large <b>missile</b> to <b>level</b> the city, but Superman intercepts the projectile and hurls it into the stratosphere. Superman shows Metallo no mercy, gathering all of his powers and charging the villain, tearing through his body and ripping out his power source.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two modes}} with four {{difficulty}} levels; level 1 {{is considered to}} be the easiest (normal speed and enemy performance) while level 4 is the hardest (fast speed and enemies are likely to cheat death). The first mode allows players to simply compete against an opponent while the second mode brings in a series of small snakes that emerge when players take too long conquering a <b>level.</b> <b>Missiles</b> can be launched when the player collects them on the field. White numbers help the player develop a longer body while black numbers make the body shorter.|$|R
5000|$|A month later, the {{university}} has a full-fledged outbreak, which is confirmed by AMC reconnaissance teams. Jake Ellis, an agent for AMS, goes in search of fellow agent Alexandra [...] "Nightingale" [...] Morgan. He finds her on a date at a restaurant, where she must execute several infected people before she returns to base with Ellis. They are ordered to retrieve a blood sample from the originally infected specimen on campus; <b>missiles</b> will <b>level</b> the campus at midnight, {{regardless of whether the}} agents are still present or not. She assigns a gender-mixed Special Forces team of U.S. Marines to provide them with backup. Ellis openly questions the competence of the soldiers, leading to friction between the two units. Upon arrival at CVU, the soldiers encounter zombies. One soldier panics and another becomes infected after his gun jams. When the others discover his injury, they sever his infect arm, but he turns and infects the team medic; both are executed by Ellis. The team continues forward into {{the university}} proper.|$|R

50|$|In the {{multiplayer}} mode of Nightfire {{players can}} play in many different levels, including Fort Knox, from Goldfinger, Atlantis and the sub docking pen from The Spy Who Loved Me, and many Nightfire related levels, including Drake's castle, Drake's underwater base, and Drake's secret <b>missile</b> silo. Other <b>levels</b> include Skyrail and Ravine. The player may choose to play against AI bots with customizable reaction time, speed, and health. The amount of usable bots vary in the console version. In the GameCube and Xbox version, up to six bots may be used. In the PlayStation 2 version, up to four bots may be used and up to four humans can play. In the PC version, up to 12 bots may be used. The PC version also has an online multiplayer mode.|$|R
50|$|The game is staged as {{a series}} of levels of {{increasing}} difficulty; each level contains a set number of incoming enemy weapons. The weapons attack the six cities, as well as the missile batteries; being struck by an enemy weapon results in destruction of the city or missile battery. Enemy weapons are only able to destroy three cities during one level. A level ends when all enemy weaponry is destroyed or reaches its target. A player who runs out of missiles no longer has control over the remainder of the level. At the conclusion of a level, the player receives bonus points for any remaining cities (50 points times scoring level, 1 to 6) or unused missiles (5 points times scoring level, 1 to 6). Between <b>levels</b> <b>missile</b> batteries are rebuilt and replenished; destroyed cities are rebuilt only at set point levels (usually every 10,000 or 12,000 points).|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis seeks to use probability models {{to investigate the}} effects and value of battle damage assessment (BDA) information availability on sequential tasks encountered in the defense against <b>missile</b> attacks. Different <b>levels</b> of information will have different impacts {{on the outcome of}} the battle. Additional information could increase the effectiveness of the defensive weapon system. On the other hand, the enemy could use deception techniques, electronic warfare (EW) and Decoy measures on the information-gathering methods to disrupt the acquisition of information which would decrease the effectiveness of defensive weapons. In the models, we show how to best allocate limited resources; i. e. the available kill time, to maximize the reward. We define a measure of effectiveness (MOE) for information which can be used for evaluating information value and decision making. We discuss different strategic alternatives and information value for both defenders and attackers in electronic warfare (EW). [URL] Commander, Republic of China Nav...|$|R
2500|$|Although the People's Liberation Army Air Force is {{considered}} large, {{most of its}} fleet consists of older generation J-7 fighters (localized MiG-21s and Mig-21BIs), raising doubts over the PLAAF's ability to control Taiwan's airspace {{in the event of}} a conflict. Since mid-1990s PRC has been purchasing, and later localizing, SU-27 based fighters. There are over 170 of these Russian fighters and Chinese J11A variants. They have increased the effectiveness of PLAAF's Beyond Visual Range (BVR) capabilities. The introduction of 60 new-generation J10A fighters is anticipated to increase the PLAAF's firepower. PRC's acquisition of Russian Su30MKKs further enhanced the PLAAF's air-to-ground support ability. The ROC's air force, on the other hand, relies on Taiwan's fourth generation fighters, consisting of 150 US-built F-16 Fighting Falcons, approximately 60 French-built Mirage 2000-5s, and approximately 130 locally developed IDFs (Indigenous Defense Fighters). All of these ROC fighter jets are able to conduct BVR combat missions with BVR <b>missiles,</b> but the <b>level</b> of technology in mainland Chinese fighters is catching up. [...] Also the United States Defense Intelligence Agency has reported that few of Taiwan's 400 total fighters are operationally capable.|$|R
50|$|Chicken Invaders: The Next Wave (or Chicken Invaders 2) is {{the second}} game in the series. It can be played by one or two players. The player takes command of the same lone {{spacecraft}} of the previous and must eliminate the chicken infestation of the solar system. The game features eleven levels, moving inwards from Pluto, each of which consists of 10 waves of attacking hostiles. In all the waves, chickens attack by dropping eggs which have to be dodged. The player can collect different items that help them in the game. Primary weapons may be changed by collecting parcels. Power-ups may also be collected to upgrade the primary weapon. Weapons may be upgraded up to eleven levels. The eleventh level however, is only acquired by collecting ten power-ups. Player may collect and accumulate drumsticks to get missiles, powerful weapons that can wipe out an entire wave. In all levels, except in the asteroid belt level, the ninth wave has a bonus (usually a new weapon, or extra firepower) awarded for not using <b>missiles</b> throughout the <b>level,</b> while the last wave features a boss. The game also comes in a Christmas Edition.|$|R
50|$|Missile 15A was {{launched}} on April 5, following two aborted launch attempts on March 28 and April 1, {{the latter being}} called off when a propellant leak started a fire on the launch pad. Because aerodynamic heating was believed to have caused the electrical malfunctions on 13A and 11A, more insulation and resistors were added around the vernier wiring (the verniers were also added to the roll program for the first time) and the fairing around the engine nozzles extended. The flight was uneventful until T+96 seconds when a momentary drop in B-1 thrust occurred. Total engine shutdown occurred at T+105 seconds and the Atlas fell into the Atlantic Ocean, remaining structurally intact until impact. Postflight analysis concluded that a bearing in the LOX turbopump gearbox had come loose, resulting in shutdown of the pump and loss of thrust. The Atlas A program concluded with the flight of 16A on June 3, which mostly completed its mission objectives, although several hardware malfunctions occurred. The pneumatic system experienced difficulties and helium bottle pressure was nearly down to zero at BECO. This {{was thought to be}} caused by a valve sticking open that allowed helium to enter the LOX tank uncontrollably, although the boil-off valve operated correctly and opened to vent the tank and prevent excessive pressure buildup. Telemetry data for the propellant utilization system was erratic or nonexistent for most of the flight, and the guidance tracking beacon failed at T+69 seconds; it was thought to have been torn off the <b>missile.</b> The pressure <b>level</b> in the turbopump gearbox was also modified slightly to prevent a recurrence of the malfunctions on 13A and 15A.|$|R
