5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> {{in the design of}} modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> that {{negatively}} affects {{maintenance is}} the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, {{resulting in the}} theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries.

American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The single <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of}} the most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lahtzanit was {{the first}} {{defensive}} fortification of the Bar Lev Line to be captured, over one hour {{after the start of}} the assault. Israeli casualties were 60 killed and 26 captured; Egyptian losses were 23 killed, including one officer, and 7 wounded, including two officers. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> leading to the capture of the fort was its isolation on all sides, and the speed with which the infantry reached and seized the firing ramp east of the fort before Israeli tanks occupied it. In contrast to the capture of Fort Lahtzanit, the attempt to capture Fort Orkal by the 135th Brigade went awry, and el-'Abassi was forced to commit a reserve infantry company on the west bank to help seize the fort. The company crossed at 4:00p.m. on October 6, and the following day Fort Orkal was captured.|$|E
5|$|From 1848 {{to the end}} of the 19th century, local Polish and Czech people co-operated, united {{against the}} Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire and later of Austria-Hungary. At the end of the century, ethnic {{tensions}} arose as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia. About 60,000 people arrived between 1880 and 1910. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate. They worked in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled. Almost all of them assimilated into the Czech population. Many of them settled in Ostrava (west of the ethnic border), as heavy industry was spread through the whole western part of Cieszyn Silesia. Even today, ethnographers find that about 25,000 people in Ostrava (about 8% of the population) have Polish surnames.|$|E

5|$|The attacks {{also caused}} {{extensive}} damage to Japan's urban areas. Approximately 40percent {{of the urban}} area of the 66 cities subjected to area attacks were destroyed. This included the loss of about 2.5million housing units, which rendered 8.5million people homeless. The urban area attacks reduced {{the morale of the}} Japanese population, and postwar surveys conducted by the USSBS found that air attacks were the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> in convincing the Japanese that the war had been lost. During the final months of the war the raids also contributed to the deterioration of the Japanese social fabric. However, civilian morale did not collapse due to the bombing, and post-war investigations found that most Japanese had remained willing to continue the war if necessary.|$|E
5|$|The favored {{temperature}} {{range of the}} roughtail stingray is , which is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> determining its distribution. It conducts seasonal migrations off the eastern United States: from December to May, this ray is found over the middle and outer parts of the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Florida, with larger rays occurring further south than smaller ones. In the spring, the population moves north of the Cape and towards the coast into bays, inlets, and saltier estuaries, though preserving the north-south gradient of body sizes. A similar migration, from shallow coastal waters in summer to deeper offshore waters in winter, apparently occurs in the Mediterranean. Pregnant females tend to be found apart from other individuals.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{air raids}} {{significantly}} influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender. While the USSBS did not state that any single factor caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air {{attacks on the}} home islands as the single <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> which influenced their decision to end the war. In particular, Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki stated {{that the combination of}} the conventional B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his justifications for authorizing the surrender. To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war. The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion spent on bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government spent on the war.|$|E

5|$|From 1848, the {{national}} {{consciousness of the}} local people grew and from 1848 {{to the end of}} the 19th century local Poles and Czechs co-operated, uniting against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire, and later of Austria-Hungary. Various Polish clubs were founded. Most schools were Polish, followed by German and Czech. At the end of the century, ethnic tensions appeared as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia, when about 60,000 people arrived and settled between 1880 and 1910. They settled mainly in the Ostrau region, but also in Zaolzie. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate, and worked mostly in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people, the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled, more readily assimilating into the Czech population which was demographically dominant in the Ostrava region in the heart of Czech Silesia. The social structure of the territory was generally divided along ethnic lines. Germans were economically strongest, mostly owners, Czechs were mostly clerks and other officials, and Poles were mostly manual workers, miners, and metallurgists. This structure had changed over time but in 1921 it was still very similar, with 61.5% of Poles working as labourers.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Operation Matterhorn was not successful. The nine raids {{conducted}} against Japan via {{bases in}} China succeeded only in destroying Ōmura's aircraft factory. XXBomber Command lost 125 B-29s {{during all of}} its operations from bases in India and China, though only 22 or 29 were destroyed by Japanese forces; {{the majority of the}} losses were due to flying accidents. The attacks had a limited impact on Japanese civilian morale but forced the Japanese military to reinforce the home islands' air defenses {{at the expense of other}} areas. These results did not justify the large allocation of Allied resources to the operation, however. Moreover, the diversion of some supply aircraft flown between India and China to support XXBomber Command's efforts may have prevented the Fourteenth Air Force from undertaking more effective operations against Japanese positions and shipping. The official history of the USAAF judged that the difficulty of transporting adequate supplies to India and China was the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> behind the failure of Operation Matterhorn, though technical problems with the B-29s and the inexperience of their crews also hindered the campaign. The adverse weather conditions common over Japan also limited the effectiveness of the Superfortresses, as crews that managed to reach their target were often unable to bomb accurately due to high winds or cloud cover.|$|E
