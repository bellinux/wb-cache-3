50|$|The {{mitre saw}} {{combines}} {{the features of}} a <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> with a backsaw.|$|E
5000|$|A backsaw {{is often}} used in {{combination}} with a <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> to produce precisely angled cuts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mitre</b> <b>box,</b> a {{woodworking}} tool used to guide a hand saw to make precise mitre cuts in a board.|$|E
50|$|In the past, <b>mitre</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{constructed}} mostly of wood. Some have had metal guides fitted to reduce wear on the slots. Today, <b>mitre</b> <b>boxes</b> {{are also available}} in other materials such as moulded plastic and cast aluminium.|$|R
50|$|When {{carpenters}} used to {{make their}} own mitre boxes, it was common to use a <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> until its guide slots became worn and then make a new one out of scrap timber. There is still a case to be made for making one today; for example, if an odd size (say, 175mm) cornice is to be fixed, then a custom <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> with a bottom board that is 175mm wide would ensure that the cornice sits true while the cuts are being made to it. The three pieces of timber that form the <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> are nailed together, and the top steadying pieces are fixed with smaller panel pins. The angles are marked (at any angle, not necessarily 45 degrees) and the guide slots are cut with the same saw that will be used {{for the rest of the}} cutting.|$|E
5000|$|In a taping of The New Yankee Workshop, {{handyman}} Norm Abram says [...] "Remember {{to watch}} your fingers when you're working a <b>mitre</b> <b>box...</b> Man Law." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} form of a <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> is a 3-sided box which is open at the top and the ends. The box is made wide enough to {{accommodate}} the width of the boards to be cut. Slots are cut in the walls of the box at the precise angle at which the cut is to be made. These slots provide the guide for the saw to follow. Most commonly, the slots in the <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> are cut at 45 degrees and 90 degrees.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> (US spelling, [...] "miter box") is a wood {{working tool}} used to guide a hand saw to make precise mitre cuts in a board.|$|E
5000|$|Mitre-box saw: a {{saw with}} a blade 18-34 inches long, held in an {{adjustable}} frame (the <b>mitre</b> <b>box)</b> for making accurate crosscuts and mitres in a workplace; ...|$|E
50|$|In use, {{the board}} to be cut {{is placed in the}} box and {{the point at which the}} board is to be cut is lined up with the {{appropriate}} slot in the <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> wall. A backsaw is the most common kind of saw used for this operation. The cut is started by placing the saw blade in the slot and drawing the saw back and forth. The slot guides the cut all the way through so that the result is a cut that is perpendicular to the face or edge of the board (depending upon the desired orientation of the cut) and at the appropriate angle. For precise work, a board cut in a <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> might then be further adjusted on a shooting board.|$|E
50|$|The contestants must {{install a}} nailing edge around their {{windows and doors}} in order to install trim and baseboards. Again, all contestants {{have access to a}} chop saw, {{although}} Jeff and Terry are the only ones seen using it (with everyone else cutting using their <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> and their crosscut saw - none of the contestants have a proper miter saw).|$|E
5000|$|Mitre saw [...] - [...] often {{referred}} to as a large backsaw (20-30 inches or 60-90 cm) used either in a wooden or metal <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> or in a metal frame which allowed cutting mitres of any specified angle. Note that not all mitre saws are backsaws, and the electric mitre saw (or chop saw) has largely taken its place today.|$|E
50|$|God is a 1917 {{sculpture}} by Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. It {{is an example}} of readymade art, a term coined by Marcel Duchamp in 1915 to describe his found objects. God is a 10Â½ inch high cast iron plumbing trap turned upside down and mounted on a wooden <b>mitre</b> <b>box.</b> The work is now in the Arensberg Collection in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.|$|E
50|$|Continued {{expansion}} in the steering product market followed with the introduction in 1995 of the Pailton <b>Mitre</b> <b>box</b> or Bevel box, a device to allow 90 degree changes in direction of the steering input shaft with low backlash and no universal joint phasing allowing the steering box to be positioned in a place more favourable to the steering gear for actuation, while still placing the steering column {{in the best position}} for the driver.|$|E
50|$|From {{this point}} P.A.'s {{trajectory}} upward was virtually uninterrupted, {{and he became}} the most important figure in Rockford's industrial, commercial, and civic development for the next 31 years. Altogether, P.A. would come to own stock in fifty Rockford-based companies. He {{was one of the}} founders of the Swedish Building and Loan Association. Peterson served as president of Sundstrand Corporation. His diverse interests included Rockford Drop Forge, Rockford Class Bending Works, Rockford Life Insurance, Rockford <b>Mitre</b> <b>Box,</b> Mechanics' Machine, Haddorff Piano, Mechanics Tool, National Lock and Free Sewing Machine.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} new research indicating that some artworks attributed to other {{artists of the}} period can now either {{be attributed to the}} Baroness, or raise the possibility that she may have created the works. One work, called God (1917) had {{for a number of years}} been attributed to the artist Morton Livingston Schamberg. The Philadelphia Museum of Art, whose collection includes God, now credits the Baroness as a co-artist of this piece. However, according to the scholar Francis Naumann, it is reasonable to conclude, based on the works known to have been made by her, that the Baroness most likely came up with the concept of combining the two elements of the sculpture (a cast iron plumbing trap mounted upside down on top of a wooden <b>mitre</b> <b>box)</b> and provided the title, while Schamberg assembled and photographed the piece.|$|E
40|$|Postmortem {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) scans {{were performed on}} the brains of 12 victims of fatal head injuries. These were compared with neuropathological studies of the entire brain. The first six subjects were imaged with the brain in situ and comparison was also made with antemortem computed tomography (CT). The brains from the subsequent six subjects were removed at autopsy, fixed in formalin and then imaged in a <b>mitre</b> <b>box</b> designed to overcome the problems encountered in the pilot study. Although both CT and MR imaging (MRI) detected all clinically relevant haemorrhagic lesions, many pathologically significant lesions were missed. MRI detected many more lesions than CT, but still failed to visualize areas of non-haemorrhagic axonal injury. Nigel R Jones, Peter C Blumbergs, Christopher J Brown, A.
