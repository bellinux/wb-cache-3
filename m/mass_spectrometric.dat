5|$|Neon is {{the first}} p-block noble gas, and the first element with a true octet of electrons. It is inert: {{as is the case}} with its lighter analogue, helium, no {{strongly}} bound neutral molecules containing neon have been identified. The ions +, +, and + have been observed from optical and <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometric</b> studies. Solid neon clathrate hydrate was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures 0.35–0.48 GPa and temperatures ca. –30°C. Ne atoms are not bonded to water and can freely move through this material. They can be extracted by placing the clathrate into a vacuum chamber for several days, yielding ice XVI, the least dense crystalline form of water.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometric</b> detection methods.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} {{specimen}} of alvarezsaurid, from the species Shuvuuia deserti, preserved down-like, feathery, integumental structures covering the fossil. Schweitzer et al. (1999) subjected these filaments to microscopic, morphological, <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometric,</b> and immunohistochemical studies {{and found that}} they consisted of beta-keratin, which is the primary protein in feathers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{aspects of}} bird biology are {{difficult}} to study in the field. These include the study of behavioural and physiological changes that require a long duration {{of access to the}} bird. Non-destructive samples of blood or feathers taken during field studies may be studied in the laboratory. For instance, the variation in the ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes across latitudes makes it possible to roughly establish the origins of migrant birds using <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometric</b> analysis of feather samples. These techniques can be used in combination with other techniques such as ringing.|$|E
25|$|Ronald Hamilton {{suggested}} in his paper The Silent Fire: ODAP {{and the death}} of Christopher McCandless that itinerant traveler Christopher McCandless may have died from starvation after being unable to hunt or gather food due to lathyrism induced paralysis of his legs caused by eating the seeds of Hedysarum alpinum. In 2014, a preliminary lab analysis indicated that the seeds did contain ODAP. However, a more detailed <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometric</b> analysis conclusively ruled out ODAP and lathyrism. Further studies showed that McCandless' death can be attributed to amino acid L-Canavanine, proven to exist in Hedysarum alpinum.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{mobility}} spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS/MS or IMMS) is {{a technique}} where ions are first separated by drift time through some neutral gas under an applied electrical potential gradient before being introduced into a mass spectrometer. Drift time {{is a measure of}} the radius relative to the charge of the ion. The duty cycle of IMS (the time over which the experiment takes place) is longer than most <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometric</b> techniques, such that the mass spectrometer can sample along the course of the IMS separation. This produces data about the IMS separation and the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions in a manner similar to LC/MS.|$|E

[...] Presolar grains that consist of diamonds {{are only a few}} nanometers in size and are, therefore, called nanodiamonds. Because of their small size, nanodiamonds are hard to investigate and, although they are among the first presolar grains discovered, relatively little is known about them. [...] The typical sizes of other presolar grains are in the range of micrometers.|$|E
