40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the academic performance}} of <b>migrant</b> students in China and explores determinants of their performance. The paper compares academic performance, student backgrounds and measures of school quality between private schools attended only by <b>migrant</b> children in Beijing (Beijing <b>migrant</b> schools) and rural public schools in Shaanxi province. Furthermore, we employ multivariate regression to examine how individual characteristics and school quality affect <b>migrant</b> student performance and the achievement gap between <b>migrant</b> students and those in rural public schools. We find that although <b>migrant</b> students outperform students in Shaanxi's rural public schools when they initially arrive in Beijing, they gradually lose ground to rural students due to the poorer school resources and teacher quality in their schools. Additional analysis comparing <b>migrant</b> students in <b>migrant</b> schools to <b>migrant</b> students in Beijing public schools demonstrates that given access to better educational resources, <b>migrant</b> students may be able to significantly improve their performance.
