25|$|On March 2 Kentucky {{traveled}} to Athens to for its second meeting with Georgia. Facing the largest second-half deficit of its so-far perfect season, Kentucky clamped down defensively, ripped off a 14 to 0 run and defeat Georgia 72 to 64. Georgia's Yante <b>Maten</b> tipped in a miss {{of his own}} shot on the second attempt to put the Bulldogs up 56 to 47 with just over 9 minutes remaining. Towns and Aaron Harrison were huge down the stretch, combining for 12 of the 14 points during the decisive run. Towns had seven, including a three-point play with 2:53 left that put Kentucky ahead to stay. Harrison chipped in with five, and Cauley-Stein {{came up with a}} huge dunk off a missed free throw to give the Wildcats a four-point play on one possession. On March 7 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face Florida on senior night in the regular season finale. Kentucky embraced its milestone following the 67 to 50 victory over the Gators. The Wildcats gathered at midcourt and donned their blue T-shirts with 31-0 Not Done Yet in white. Kentucky became the first team from a Power 5 conference to achieve a perfect record during the regular season in over twenty-five years.|$|E

He {{was to be}} buried in the conventual church of the London Greyfriars. He desired them to arrange that 24 poor men's children 'such as can say our lady <b>matens</b> or the psalme of Deprofundis' should bear torches at his funeral, and that the five orders of Friars, the priests of the Fraternities and of St Augustine Papey, and the 60 priests and company of the Fraternity of Parish Clerks of London should accompany his funeral procession. He provided for many masses of requiem and dirige, for his soul and for the souls of his wives, to be sung by the priors and convents of Elsing Spital (St. Mary within Cripplegate), of St Mary Spital without Bishopsgate and of the London Charterhouse, the Abbots of Faversham, Boxley and Stratford, the Franciscan friars at Greenwich and Richmond, and the two Lazar houses; and there were plenty of charitable bequests to be made. This will was proved on 28 May 1523.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find out how, when and why the pre-school {{teachers}} work with the meaning that the food has for our bodies. The method used for this survey was to interview six pre-school teachers to try to find out when they work with passing on this knowledge to the children, how they choose to work with this topic and why they think it’s important to spread awareness among the children in preschool about this. The result of the study showed that the pre-school teachers see them selves as strong influences when it comes to giving the children in pre-school a good foundation and a healthy attitude towards food. The pre-school has a responsibility for the childrens knowledge of good food and how its related to good health and well-being but the study also showed that pre-school teachers consider them selfes to have too little knowledge when it comes to this subject and this inhibits them from giving the children any profound knowledge more than that milk is good for our skeleton och vegetables and fruit keeps us healthy.  Syftet med denna undersökning har varit att ta reda på hur, när och varför förskollärare, inom förskolan, arbetar med <b>matens</b> betydelse för kroppen. Metoden som användes för undersökningen var kvalitativa intervjuer av sex stycken förskollärare där det skulle undersökas hur de förmedlar vidare sin kunskap till barnen, hur de jobbar med och runt detta ämne och varför det är viktigt att barnen inom förskolan får ta del av denna kunskap. Resultatet av denna undersökning visade att förskollärare ansåg sig ha en stark roll gällande att lägga en bra grund och ge barnen en sund inställning till mat.

2500|$|On February 3 Kentucky hosted Georgia at Rupp Arena, {{defeating}} the Bulldogs 69 to 58. The Bulldogs were without leading scorer and rebounder Marcus Thornton, {{who was out}} due to a concussion. Andrew Harrison scored 23 points and combined with Towns for key baskets down the stretch that helped Kentucky pull away. Harrison's layup with 3:58 remaining provided a 62 to 54 lead before baskets by Georgia's Yante <b>Maten</b> and Nemanja Djurisic pulled the Bulldogs to 63 to 58 with 2:06 left. Towns' short jumper with 1:33 left got the lead to seven, and Tyler Ulis and Harrison each added two free throws {{in the final minute}} for the Wildcats. On February 7 Kentucky traveled to Gainesville to face arch-rival Florida. Florida swept all three meetings in 2014, winning in Lexington, in Gainesville and in the SEC Tournament. Both teams advanced to the Final Four in 2014, but had gone in different directions in 2015. Florida entered the game one game over [...]500 and struggling mightily through the beginning of SEC play. Aaron Harrison scored 23 points, Towns added 19 and the Wildcats remained unbeaten with a 68 to 61 victory over the Gators before a national television audience on ESPN's College GameDay. Florida led by nine {{in the first half and}} used a 6 to 0 run to go up 44 to 42 midway through the second half. However, Cauley-Stein's dunk proved to be the turning point. Florida's Devon Robinson turned the ball over on one end, and Cauley-Stein was the beneficiary on the other. He caught a pass in transition near the foul line, took two steps and then slammed it over Robinson. He was fouled on the play and made the free throw to put Kentucky ahead for good. Free throws were huge down the stretch, too. Kentucky closed out the game from the charity stripe and finished 21 of 22 from there. On February 9 traveled to Baton Rouge face LSU before another national television audience on ESPN. Frustrated by the way his team was playing, coach Calipari told them he hoped they'd lose. They almost did. Towns redeemed himself after drawing a technical foul for hanging on the basket and the ire of his coach by hitting a go-head jump hook with 1:30 left and grabbing a clutch offensive rebound against LSU in the final minute to help Kentucky stay unbeaten, {{defeating the}} Tigers 71 to 69. Calipari explained that he wanted to make sure his team won't lose elimination games in March over senseless fouls, so even as his assistants pleaded with him to call timeout, he just watched and joined in the ear-ringing frenzy at the sold out Pete Maravich Assembly Center during a stunning 21 to 2 LSU run that gave the Tigers a 66 to 60 lead. LSU's Keith Hornsby had a shot to win it for LSU in the final seconds, but his off-balance 3 bounced off the outside of the rim, and Kentucky was victorious. On February 14 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face off against South Carolina for the second time this season. After holding South Carolina to 27 percent shooting in last month's meeting, Kentucky limited the Gamecocks to just 13 of 55 from the field (24 percent) this time. Kentucky had a strong start that put South Carolina in a hole that steadily deepened. The Wildcats led 26 to 6 with 8:21 left in the first half and never eased off in overwhelming South Carolina on both ends. It was 43 to 18 at halftime, and Kentucky poured it on against a Gamecocks squad looking to build off a five-point win over Missouri. On February 17 Kentucky traveled to Knoxville to face arch-rival Tennessee. Booker had 18 points and seven rebounds as Kentucky picked up its defense in the second half and pulled away for a 66 to 48 victory over the Volunteers. The victory set a new record for the historic program as they became 26–0 for the first time, though the Wildcats finished the 1953–54 season with a 25–0 mark. On February 21 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to defeat Auburn 110 to 75. Towns scored 19 points to lead six Kentucky players in double figures. The Wildcats recorded their highest scoring total since 2002 in the blowout win over the Tigers. The victory also extended their best start ever and equaled the 1995–96 squad's school-record 27-game winning streak. At halftime Kentucky hoisted legendary player Tony Delk's #00 jersey in the rafters. On February 25 Kentucky traveled to Starkville to face Mississippi State. Kentucky looked slightly mortal for most of the first half, letting a 14-point lead evaporate to 33 to 27. Ulis hit a 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer to push the Wildcats' advantage to 36 to 27. They had a few more careless defensive moments early in the second half, which helped Mississippi State briefly make things interesting. Mississippi State's Craig Sword's pass to a wide-open Roquez Johnson led to an easy layup, pulling the Bulldogs within 41 to 37 with 15 minutes remaining. Kentucky responded with the next six points by pounding the ball into the paint and using its significant size advantage to pull away for the win. Lyles scored a 18 points, and Kentucky was victorious 74 to 56. On February 28 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face off against nationally ranked Arkansas. The Razorbacks entered the game ranked No. 16/18 in the AP and USA Today Coaches polls. This was the first ranked opponent since they defeated Louisville in late December. Arkansas also entered the game on a three-game win streak over Kentucky. The Wildcats seized the tempo from the start with a quick pace that knocked the Razorbacks on their heels. Lyles started things off with a lob dunk from Towns (eight points, five rebounds), who followed with a putback basket. Aaron Harrison (nine points, seven rebounds) soon added a 3-pointer to get a sellout crowd into the game, and Kentucky had plenty more in an energetic if chippy first half by both teams. Arkansas went 0 for 9 from long range and shot 30 percent overall while getting outrebounded 24 to 18 through 20 minutes as Kentucky built a 42 to 26 halftime lead. At one point in the second half the lead swelled to 31 points. The Wildcats clinched the Southeastern Conference regular-season title defeating the Razorbacks 84 to 67.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the Trait Anxiety Inventory for Sports (TAIS), {{measuring}} competitive trait anxiety in sport situations, and to confirm its reliability and validity. For the theory and framework of competitive anxiety, Spielberger 2 ̆ 7 s State-Trait Anxiety Model and Martens 2 ̆ 7 study in sport psychology were used. TAIS (from- 2) consisting of 68 items was administerd to 202 male and 297 female college athletes who participated in the 35 TH Intercollegiate Athletic Games in the Kyusyu District from June to August and from October to November, 1985. Furthermore, in order to examine reliability and validity, 167 junior high school, 188 high school, and 102 college athletes (male and female) participated in this study. Reliability was examined by Spearman-Brown 2 ̆ 7 s coefficient of reliability and correlation coefficient on retest method, and analysis of validity was conducted by computing the correlation coefficient between TAIS and Spielberger 2 ̆ 7 s TAI scale and <b>Matens</b> 2 ̆ 7 SCAT scale. The results were summarized as follows: 1. The TAIS scale measuring trait anxiety in the sport situation was completed. It consisted of 25 items including 5 independent factors; 2 ̆ 2 Mental agitation 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 Cognitive worry concerning victory or defeat 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 Tendency of somatic anxiety 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 Flight from situation 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 Loss of confidence 2 ̆ 2. 2. A high and significant coefficient of reliability (SB =. 939, p<. 01) by Spearman-Brown 2 ̆ 7 s formula and correlation coefficient (r =. 810, p<. 01) by the retest method was found among all subjects. The same results were found without distinction of sex and age. 3. A high and significant correlation coefficient between TAIS and TAI (r =. 559, p<. 01), and SCAT (r =. 684, p<. 01) was found among all subjects.
