The two sections of the paper present (1) a discusion of Noel's test of order of a <b>Markoff</b> <b>chain,</b> and a Likelihood Ratio Criterion (LRC) for a two-dependent <b>Markoff</b> <b>chain</b> is given, and (2) a discussion of possible adjustments of Darwin's LRC with which to analyze data on a one-dependent chain assumption. The results of Hoel's test of order of a <b>Markoff</b> <b>chain</b> showed that a two-dependent (Order two) model is a better fit to interaction data than the one-dependent model (Order one).

For this `dual' process, the boundaries {{are assumed to be}} absorbing and so the killing times at the boundaries play a central role. Three natural conditionings on the fixation/extinction events pertaining to this model are investigated.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this {{research}} work a forecast model has been developped which describes the changes of state of road networks. As an example of the road network of a selected road authority bituminous roads were investigated considering the effects of life, thickness of asphalt, traffic class, method of maintenance and road categorie (e. g. federal road). The changes of state were fore-casted by means of the <b>Markoff</b> <b>chains</b> as probability processes and the use of multiple variance-analysis. A comparison of results with the conclusion of the BASt partly revealed good correspondences of damage rates of comparable road networks. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract- Causal {{reasoning}} {{occupies a}} central position in human reasoning. In many ways, causality is granular. This {{is true for}} commonsense reasoning {{as well as for}} mathematical and scientific theory. Knowledge of at least some causal effects is imprecise. Perhaps, complete knowledge of all possible factors might lead to a crisp description of whether an effect will occur. However, in our commonsense world, it is unlikely that all possible factors can be known. In commonsense, every day reasoning, we use approaches that do not require complete knowledge. We need an algorithmic way of handling imprecision if we are to computationally handle causality. Perhap, fuzzy Markoff models might be useful. People recognize that a complex collection of elements causes a particular effect, even if the precise elements of the complex are unknown. Perhaps <b>Markoff</b> <b>chains</b> might be used to build these complexes. It may be more useful to work on a larger grain size. This may reduce the need to learn extensive hidden Markoff models, which in computationally expensive. Perhaps, a satisficing solution would be to develop large grained solutions and then only go to the finer grain when the impreciseness of the large grain is unsatisfactory...|$|R

40|$|In default of the theorem of "detailed balance": Pi;=P;i, {{with regard}} to {{elementary}} transition probabilities, several "balance" theorems are introduced and proved {{on the basis of}} symmetry of physical laws in space-time. (1) First theorem of "averaged balance" (Sec. 5) : We can establish P;;=P;; by averaging over quantities of "minus class. " Table V (Sec. 3) gives a list of "minus" quantities. (2) The so-called "detailed balance of col­lisions" in classical physics is a special case of Theorem I. (3) Heitler-Coester's theorem of "semidetailed balance" is also a special case of Theorem I. (4) Second theorem of "averaged balance" (Sec. 5) : We can establish Pi;=P;; by averaging over quantities with PR= - 1. The quantities with PR= - 1 are listed in Table II (Sec. 2). (5) Theorem of "cyclic balance" (Sec. 7) : In classical physics, a chain of transitions i [...] >j [...] >k [...] >· ·· [...] >i repeats itself cyclically. (6) Theorem of "long-range balance" (Sec. 7) : The time average of transition probability from i to j is equal to the time average of transition probability from j to i. Theorems I, II, and III, are direct consequences of inversibility (covariance for space-and-time inversion). Theorem IV is a consequence of reversibility (covariance for time reversal). Theorems V and VI are connected with ergodicity of <b>Markoff's</b> <b>chains.</b> This ergodicity is proved by the condition of bilateral normalization of transition probabilities: l:; P;;= 1, l:; Pi;= 1. This bilateral normalization in turn can be derived from either reversibility or inversibility. The limits of validity of all these balance theorems in actual applications are carefully examined in the text...|$|R

The expansion factor required to touch a given subspaceLis denoted byν(C,L) and for each dimensiond, 1 ≤d≤n− 1, the relevant expansion factors are used to determine a supremumν(C,d) =sup {ν(C,L) : dimL=d,Lnot contained in a coordinate hyperplane}. Here a method for obtaining upper bounds onν(C,L) for “rational” subspacesLis given. This leads to many interesting results, e. g. {{it follows that the}} supremaν(C,d) are always attained and a general isolation result always holds. The method also applies to give simple proofs of known results for three dimensional spheres. These proofs are generalized to obtainν(B,n− 2) and a <b>Markoff</b> type <b>chain</b> of related isolations for spheresBin Rnwithn≥ 4. In another part of the paper, the subspaces occurring in view-obstruction problems are generalized to arbitrary flats. This generalization is related to Schoenberg's problem of billiard ball motion. Several results analogous to those forν(C,L) andν(C,d) are obtained...|$|R
