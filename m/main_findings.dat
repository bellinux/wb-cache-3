5|$|Biopsy of {{the kidney}} may be {{performed}} both {{to establish the}} diagnosis or to assess the severity of already suspected kidney disease. The <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> on kidney biopsy are increased cells and Ig deposition in the mesangium (part of the glomerulus, where blood is filtered), white blood cells, {{and the development of}} crescents. The changes are indistinguishable from those observed in IgA nephropathy.|$|E

After {{the conclusion of}} the excavations the area was used for farming purposes and is now covered by vegetable gardens and fruit orchards while the <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> can be seen in Israeli museums like the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and the Hecht Museum in Haifa.|$|E
25|$|Emil Abderhalden (March 9, 1877 – August 5, 1950) was a Swiss {{biochemist}} and physiologist. His <b>main</b> <b>findings,</b> though disputed {{already in}} the 1920s, were not finally rejected until the late 1990s. Whether his misleading findings were based on fraud or simply {{the result of a}} lack of scientific rigor remains unclear. Abderhalden's drying pistol, used in chemistry, was first described by one of his students in a textbook Abderhalden edited.|$|E

25|$|In the USSR, a molten-salt reactor {{research}} program {{was started in}} the second half of the 1970s at the Kurchatov Institute. It included theoretical and experimental studies, particularly the investigation of mechanical, corrosion and radiation properties of the molten salt container materials. The <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> supported the conclusion that there were no physical nor technological obstacles to the practical implementation of MSRs. A reduction in activity occurred after 1986 due to the Chernobyl accident, along with a general stagnation of nuclear power and the nuclear industry.|$|E
25|$|That same year, a CPI was {{established}} to investigate the military’s autonomous nuclear program. Among the <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> were details of illicit trade of nuclear material, {{as well as information}} about illegal financial operations that had served to keep the secret program going. In its final report, the inquiry commission recommended that the parallel program be dismantled with some of its activities to be integrated into the safeguarded civilian program. It also recommended the establishment of accountability mechanisms to increase the safety and security of the program.|$|E
25|$|The {{contributions}} of Archard (1957) {{must also be}} mentioned in discussion of pioneering works in this field. Archard concluded that, even for rough elastic surfaces, the contact area is approximately proportional to the normal force. Further important insights along these lines were provided by Greenwood and Williamson (1966), Bush (1975), and Persson (2002). The <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> of these works were that the true contact surface in rough materials is generally proportional to the normal force, while the parameters of individual micro-contacts (i.e., pressure, size of the micro-contact) are only weakly dependent upon the load.|$|E

25|$|Commission member Henry Snell {{signed the}} report but added a Note of Reservation. Although he was {{satisfied}} that the Mufti was not directly responsible for the violence or had connived at it, he believed the Mufti {{was aware of the}} nature of the anti-Zionist campaign and the danger of disturbances. He therefore attributed to the Mufti a greater share of the blame than the official report had. Snell also disagreed with the commission on matters of Jewish immigration, and did not support restrictions on Jewish land purchases. Regarding the immediate causes of the outbreak, Snell agreed with the <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> of the commission.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Gerngross {{became one of}} the first vocal critics of {{biobased}} processes. By using life cycle assessment tools he demonstrated the shortcomings of bioplastics and similar biomass based technologies intended as a substitute for the petrochemical processes used today. His <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> showed that changing from petrochemical to biomass-based processes often worsens their environmental impact and increases the emissions of carbon dioxide when compared to conventional processes based on fossil fuel stocks. With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has become increasingly important, but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States.|$|E
25|$|One of Bowlby's <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> {{through his}} {{research}} with these children was that 17 {{out of the}} 44 thieves experienced early and prolonged separation (six months or more) from their primary caregiver {{before the age of}} five. In comparison, only two out of the 44 children who did not steal had experienced prolonged separation from their primary care giver before the age of five. More specifically, Bowlby found that 12 out of the 14 children were categorized as affectionless were found to have experienced complete and prolonged separation before the age of five. These findings were important and brought more attention to the impact of a child's early environmental experiences on their healthy development.|$|E

25|$|The Rind et al. {{study has}} been criticized by various {{scientists}} and researchers, notably Stephanie Dallam (2001; 2002), {{on the grounds that}} its methodology and conclusions are poorly designed and statistically flawed. Its definition of harm, for example, has been subject to debate because it only examined long-term psychological effects, and harm can result in a number of ways, including short-term or medical harm (for example, sexually transmitted infections or injuries), a likelihood of revictimization, and the amount of time the victim spent attending therapy for the abuse. Seven years after the publication of the Rind et al. study, Heather Marie Ulrich, with two colleagues, replicated it in The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice and confirmed many of its <b>main</b> <b>findings,</b> but did not necessarily endorse all of its authors' conclusions.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above. Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere. These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Contextual effects {{occur as}} a result of the degree of {{similarity}} between the encoding context and the retrieval context of an emotional dimension. The <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> are that the current mood we are in affects what is attended, encoded and ultimately retrieved, as reflected in two similar but subtly different effects: the mood congruence effect and mood-state dependent retrieval. Positive encoding contexts have been connected to activity in the right fusiform gyrus. Negative encoding contexts have been correlated to activity in the right amygdala (Lewis & Critchley, 2003). However, Lewis and Critchley (2003) claim that it is not clear whether involvement of the emotional system in encoding memory differs for positive or negative emotions, or whether moods at recall lead to activity in the corresponding positive or negative neural networks.|$|E

25|$|Another {{focus of}} Indjejikian's {{research}} is the responsibilities and compensation of CEOs and CFOs {{of public and private}} corporations. Several of his papers have examined how firms design their bonus plans for the CFO and CEO and contrast those plans to decision making. The research of these papers was through surveys of members of the American Institute of CPA's. The <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> of these papers were that bonuses are based on the length of executive tenure, size of the firm, and length of the product development and life cycle. The papers also found public companies, relative to private companies have reduced the percentage of bonus based on financial reporting {{to the extent that the}} Sarbanes-Oxley Act has made firms much more concerned about the integrity of their financial reports and increased the costs of noncompliance.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October 2003 TfL {{published}} a report reviewing {{the first six}} months of the charge. The report's <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> were that the average number of cars and delivery vehicles entering the central zone was 60,000 fewer than the previous year. Around 50–60% of this reduction was attributed to transfers to public transport, 20–30% to journeys avoiding the zone, 15–25% switching to car share, and the remainder to reduced number of journeys, more travelling outside the hours of operation, and increased use of motorbikes and bicycles. Journey times were found to have been reduced by 14%. Variation in journey time for a particular route repeated on many occasions also decreased. The report also claimed that although the charge was responsible for about 4,000 fewer people visiting the zone daily, that the charge was responsible for only a small fraction of the 7% drop in retail sales reported.|$|E
25|$|His two <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> {{are that}} leaders {{actually}} do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising that Saddam Hussein did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely to lie to their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders to lie to their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E
30|$|The <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> {{under the}} {{experimental}} setup {{in this article}} was unexpected low biomass enrichment in the foamate in contrast to other statements in the literature (Gruber 1991; Heyd et al. 2008; Küpper et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between relative earnings and giving in a two-stage, real-effort experiment. In the first stage, four players compete in a tournament that determines their earnings. In the second stage, they decide whether to make a transfer {{to one or more}} of their group members. Our <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> is that those ranked first are significantly less likely to give than those ranked second. This difference disappears if individuals learn about the second stage after earning their income or if earnings are randomly determined. This suggests that our <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> is driven by selection based on other-regarding preferences. (JEL: D 64, J 31) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} our {{participation in}} the TREC 2003 Robust and Web tracks. For the Robust track, we experimented {{with the impact of}} stemming and feedback on the worst scoring topics. Our <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> is the effectiveness of stemming on poorly performing topics, which sheds new light on the role of morphological normalization in information retrieval. For both the home/named page finding and topic distillation tasks of the Web track, we experimented with different document representations and retrieval models. Our <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> is effectiveness of the anchor text index for both tasks, suggesting that compact document representations are a fruitful strategy for scaling-up retrieval systems...|$|R
500|$|The Payne Study and Experiment Fund {{was created}} in 1927 by Frances Payne Bolton to support {{a study of the}} {{influence}} of fiction on children. The Payne Fund Studies, a series of eight books published from 1933 to 1935 which detailed five (5) years of research aimed specifically at the cinema's effects on children, were also gaining publicity at this time, and became a great concern to Hays. Hays had said certain pictures might alter [...] "... that sacred thing, the mind of a child … that clean, virgin thing, that unmarked state" [...] and have [...] "the same responsibility, the same care about the thing put on it that the best clergyman or the most inspired teacher would have." [...] Despite its initial reception, the <b>main</b> <b>findings</b> of the study were largely innocuous. It found that cinema's effect on individuals varied with age and social position, and that pictures reinforced audiences' existing beliefs. The Motion Picture Research Council (MPRC, led by honorary vice president Sara Delano Roosevelt (mother of President Franklin D. Roosevelt), and executive director the Rev. William H. Short) which funded the study, was not pleased. An [...] "alarmist summary" [...] of the study's results written by Henry James Forman appeared in McCall's, a leading women's magazine of the time, and Forman's book, Our Movie Made Children, which became a best-seller, publicized the Payne Fund's results, emphasizing its more negative aspects.|$|E

40|$|Developmental {{differences}} in the neurocognitive networks for phonological and semantic processing in Chinese word reading were examined in 13 adults and 13 children using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Rhyming and semantic association judgments were made to two-character words that were presented sequentially in the visual modality. These lexical tasks were compared with a nonlinguistic control task involving judgment of line patterns. The first <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> was that adults showed greater activation than children in right middle occipital gyrus on both the meaning and rhyming task, suggesting adults more effectively engage right hemisphere brain regions involved in the visual-spatial analysis of Chinese characters. The second <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> was that adults showed greater activation than children in left inferior parietal lobule for the rhyming as compared with the meaning task, suggesting greater specialization of phonological processing in adults. The third <b>main</b> <b>finding</b> was that children who had better performance in the rhyming task on characters with conflicting orthographic and phonological information relative to characters with nonconflicting information showed greater activation in left middle frontal gyrus, suggesting greater engagement of brain regions involved in the integration of orthography and phonology.
