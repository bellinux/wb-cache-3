40|$|This study investigates {{whether or}} not {{long-term}} discretionary accounting conservatism has benefits for equity investors, as measured by long-term subsequent equity returns. Based on the long-term relationship between cash flows and earnings documented by Dechow (1994), this paper develops a new proxy for discretionary accounting conservatism. This proxy utilises earnings before interest and tax and cash flow generated by operations, highlighting conservative discretion within earnings. Importantly, and in contrast to prior research, this study controls for <b>market</b> <b>assessments</b> of the growth prospects of sample firms and finds that discretionary accounting conservatism is insignificantly related to subsequent equity returns, once <b>market</b> <b>assessments</b> of growth prospects have been controlled for. Compensating for cross-sectional differences, based on the relative gearing of firms, reveal {{that the relationship between}} subsequent equity returns and discretionary accounting conservatism remains insignificant, regardless of the level of gearing of the sample firm.

40|$|Central banks {{around the}} world have a {{reputation}} for being secretive about their operations and <b>market</b> <b>assessments.</b> It is sometimes argued that central banks need flexibility and therefore cannot be fully transparent. We find that this explanation does not carry through in a forward-looking New Keynesian framework, where transparency about the central bank's forecasting procedures improves output stabilization. We also show that higher transparency increases optimal conservatism, as the benefits from higher transparency in terms of output stabilization are greater the more conservative is the central bank.
