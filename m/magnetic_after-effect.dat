40|$|In this letter, we {{experimentally}} {{validate the}} ability of a recently developed ferromagnetic hysteresis model to characterize <b>magnetic</b> <b>after-effects</b> in ferromagnetic materials. The modeling framework, which combines energy analysis at the lattice level with stochastic homogenization techniques to accommodate material, stress and field nonhomogeneities, quantifies after-effects through a balance of the Gibbs and relative thermal energies. Attributes of the framework are illustrated through fits to experimental steel data. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>after-effects</b> due to either thermally-induced switching or atomic diffusion produce drift or creep in the magnetization or induction for a number of operating regimes [1; 2]. Quantification of these effects is important both for accurate material characterization and the design of sensors and actuators required to achieve and maintain highly accurate tolerances.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown by the author in a {{previous}} paper that thermodynamic vectorial internal degrees of freedom which influence the polarization or the magnetization of a medium may give rise to dielectric or magnetic relaxation phenomena. Snoek's equation for magnetic relaxation phenomena was derived and it was shown that Debye's theory for dielectric after-effects in polar liquids is a special case of the developed theory. In this paper it is shown that if Z is some vectorial internal degree of freedom which influences the polarization a new internal degree of freedom bip(int) may be defined which {{is a function of}} biZ, which may replace biZ as vectorial internal degree of freedom and which {{is a part of the}} total specific polarization. Furthermore, p(int) may be introduced in such a way that the remaining part of the polarization, p(el) (defined by p(el) =p- pint), where p is the total polarization per unit of mass), has the property that it vanishes for all values of p(int) if the medium is in a state where the electric field E and the mechanical elastic stresses vanish and the temperature of the medium equals some reference temperature. If the equations of state are linearized the latter result implies for an isotropic medium E=¿a(0, 0) (bdp) p(el), where ¿ is the mass density and a(0, 0) (P) a constant. On the other hand p(int) satifies a relaxation equation. It is seen that the use of p(int) as an internal degree of freedom is of great advantage.

In addition, the paper gives some brief review about achieving, formation {{and structure of}} bulk metallic glasses as a special group of amorphous materials. Design/methodology/approach: The studies were performed on Fe 72 B 20 Si 4 Nb 4 metallic glass in form of ribbons and rods. The amorphous structure of tested samples was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. The thermal properties of the glassy samples were measured using differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The magnetic properties contained initial and maximum magnetic permeability, coercive force and <b>magnetic</b> <b>after-effects</b> measurements were determined by the Maxwell-Wien bridge and VSM methods. Findings: The X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy investigations revealed that the studied as-cast bulk metallic glasses in form of ribbons and rods were amorphous. Two stage crystallization process was observed for studied bulk amorphous alloy. The differences of crystallization temperature between ribbons and rods with chosen thickness are probably caused by different amorphous structures {{as a result of}} the different cooling rates in casting process. The SEM images showed that studied fractures could be classified as mixed fractures with indicated two zones contained “river” and “smooth” areas. The changing of chosen soft magnetic properties (μr, Bs, Hc) obtained for samples with different thickness is a result of the non-homogenous amorphous structure of tested metallic glasses. The annealing process in temperature range from 373 to 773 K causes structural relaxation of tested amorphous materials, which leads to changes in their physical properties. The qualitative phase analysis from X-ray and TEM diffraction data enables the identification of a single phase of α-Fe for sample annealed at 823 K and a mixture of Fe 2 B, Fe 3 B and Fe 23 B 6 and α-Fe phases for samples annealed at temperature of 873 and 923 K.

Hysteresis loops, recorded using a computer controlled DC hysteresis loop tracer, were used to obtain hysteresis parameters. Findings: The XRD and TEM investigations revealed that the studied ribbons were amorphous. The SEM images showed that studied fractures morphology of ribbons is changing from smooth fracture inside with few veins network in surface freely solidified (shining surface). Character of fracture morphology revealed ductile character of Fe 56 Co 7 Ni 7 B 20 Nb 10 ribbons with vein pattern morphology, typical for amorphous alloys. The detailed analysis of data of magnetic properties i. e. Ms, μi and Hc allow to classify the alloy in as quenched state as a soft magnetic material.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dil. {{titanium}} (Ti 4 +) -doping on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>after-effect</b> (MAE) spectra of stoichiometric magnetite single crystals, Fe 3 -xTixO 4 - with 0. 0001 ? x ? 0. 008 - was {{studied in the}} temp. range 4 K 2 ̆ 6 lt;T ? TV. simeq. 125 K and analyzed {{in terms of the}} authors' revised relaxation model. The effects of these relatively low doping rates comprise: (i) strong impact on low-temp. (4 K 2 ̆ 6 lt;T 2 ̆ 6 lt; 35 K) incoherent electron (e-) -tunneling and combined intraionic thermal excitation; (ii) minor, though highly instructive, modifications of thermally activated electron hopping (50 K 2 ̆ 6 lt;T 2 ̆ 6 lt; 125 K), and (iii) low-temp. shifting of the Verwey transition (TV) relative to the temp. of zero-crossing of the crystal anisotropy (TK 1). Due to the high oxygen stoichiometry of the crystals (absence of B-site vacancies), no further MAEs appear in the high-temp. range (T 2 ̆ 6 gt; TV). The recently accentuated discussion concerning the appropriate timescale of electron transport - deduced from modern x-ray resonant scattering to be about t. simeq. 10 - 16 s, over the whole temp. range (T [symbol omitted] TV), in contrast to up to thousands of seconds as detd. from high-precision MAE expts., in the low-temp. phase (T 2 ̆ 6 lt;TV) - gives the authors the chance to sharpen the authors' arguments in favor of a clarification of the electronic cond. mechanisms in magnetite.
