The presence of the corresponding DNA segments was specifically detected in GM maize by the designed primers. It was concluded that this method is useful for fast and easy screening of Bt gene in the food products and GM Bt crops. The methods of plant genetic transformation are applied for the insertion of genes of interest into specific crop plants for their improvement (Estruch et al. 1997). These transformed plants are commonly known as genetically modified plants or GM plants. A number of GM plants have already been developed for commercial use {{in different parts of the}} world (James 2006).

40|$|Genetic {{modification}} of banana {{has been considered}} as a path towards increasing {{the value of this}} crop according to health and nutrition in developing countries. Banana as a crop {{is one of the most}} important and widely consumed fruits as a weaning food by children and as a starchy staple for all other consumers. As well as providing a low cost and easily produced source of energy, bananas are also rich in certain minerals and in vitamins A, C and B 6. Growing urbanisation in many developing countries upgraded the crop importance as a source of revenue, occasionally providing the main source of income for rural communities. Genetically modified organism bananas have been advocated as carrier for vaccines and as a source of carotenoids that can counteract debilitating vitamin A deficiency. The rather high vulnerability of banana to pests and diseases triggered biotechnological applications in an attempt to produce new, more resistant banana cultivars. However, the potential biosafety of genetically modified banana and its applications should be taken into account prior to its extensive usage. The current survey summarises the most important biotechnological techniques (in vitro culture, DNA fingerprinting, somatic emrbyogenesis, DNA flow cytometry, etc.) and applications (micropropagation, in vitro selection, somaclonal variation, protoplast fusion, haploid production, etc.) in banana and emphasises on genetic transformation in conjunction with the expressed gene and <b>modified</b> <b>trait</b> aiming at a further improvement of this crop...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{few studies}} have focused on the effects of genetically {{modified}} trees (GM trees) on the environment. One concern with GM trees is that they may have unanticipated effects on non-target organisms, i. e. effects on organisms that are not direct targets of the genetically <b>modified</b> <b>trait.</b> The main objective of this thesis was to study potential non-target effects from the interaction between GM trees and natural enemies, including phytopathogens and herbivorous insects. To study this I used a system consisting of GM trees featuring changes in growth-related characteristics, and naturally occurring enemies. The GM trees used were the aspen hybrids Populus tremula x tremuloides: one unmodified wild type clone T 89 (control) and transgenic lines with altered expression of gibberellin (GA 20 -oxidase), sucrose (SPS) or pectin (PME); and Populus tremula x alba: one unmodified wild type clone INRA 717 - 1 -B 4 (control) and lines modified to suppress the activity of the enzymes in the lignin biosynthetic pathway, i. e. CAD, COMT, CCR or CCoAOMT. The natural enemies used were the parasitic phytopathogens Melampsora pinitorqua, M. populnea and Venturia tremulae, and the herbivorous leaf-beetle Phratora vitellinae. To address this question inoculation experiments, feeding preference experiments, analyses of secondary chemistry and field inventories were performed. The results of the studies showed that the GM trees significantly affected the interaction with the natural enemies, both in the laboratory {{as well as in the}} field. For instance, both M. pinitorqua and V. tremulae showed an altered disease incidence on the GM trees of P. tremula x tremuloides compared to the unmodified wild type T 89, where all tested transgenic lines exhibited altered susceptibility to the pathogens. However, there were also differences in aggressiveness to the aspens depending on pathogen population. The results from the field inventory showed that lines within all tested transgenic construct, COMT, CAD, CCoAOMT and CCR of P. tremula x alba differed significantly from the wild type INRA 717 - 1 -B 4 in susceptibility to M. populnea. In addition, the susceptibility to the rust also differed significantly between lines carrying the same transgenic constructs. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of SPS in P. tremula x tremuloides, unintentionally induced changes in plant secondary chemistry, where the GM-line SPS 33 A exhibited the largest deviation from the wild type T 89 in contents of plant phenolics and nitrogen, and that these changes coincide with a concurrent decrease in herbivory by P. vitellinae on this line. I argue that the altered interactions are the result of physiological changes in the trees. They can originate from direct effects i. e. altered expression of the <b>modified</b> <b>trait,</b> indirect effects of the genetic modification process e. g. pleiotropy, or effects from the transformation process e. g. position effects, to which the tested natural enemies respond. The result stresses the importance of further research on the causes and mechanisms responsible for the altered interaction between GM trees and non-target organisms, as well as evaluating the potential environmental effects of cultivation of GM trees in the field. Such research will require collaboration between researchers from different disciplines, such as plant ecology and physiology, functional genomics, proteomics and metabolomics...|$|E
40|$|Many prey <b>modify</b> <b>traits</b> in {{response}} to predation risk and this modification of traits can influence the prey's resource acquisition rate. A predator thus can have a “nonlethal” impact on prey {{that can lead to}} indirect effects on other community members. Such indirect interactions are termed trait-mediated indirect interactions because they arise from a predator's influence on prey traits, rather than prey density. Because such nonlethal predator effects are immediate, can influence the entire prey population, and can occur over the entire prey lifetime, we argue that nonlethal predator effects are likely to contribute strongly to the net indirect effects of predators (i. e., nonlethal effects may be comparable in magnitude to those resulting from killing prey). This prediction was supported by an experiment in which the indirect effects of a larval dragonfly (Anax sp.) predator on large bullfrog tadpoles (Rana catesbeiana), through nonlethal effects on competing small bullfrog tadpoles, were large relative to indirect effects caused by density reduction of the small tadpoles (the lethal effect). Treatments in which lethal and nonlethal effects of Anax were manipulated independently indicated that this result was robust for a large range of different combinations of lethal and nonlethal effects. Because many, if not most, prey <b>modify</b> <b>traits</b> {{in response}} to predators, our results suggest that the magnitude of interaction coefficients between two species may often be dynamically related to changes in other community members, and that many indirect effects previously attributed to the lethal effects of predators may instead be due to shifts in traits of surviving prey...|$|R

In this review, we evaluated {{the direct and}} indirect trait-specific effects of GM plants, microbes, and animals on ecosystem processes and found {{that most of the}} effects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on ecosystem processes are indirect and are the result of associated changes in management strategy rather than a direct effect of the GMOs. Conflicting results on the performance and effects of GMOs are frequently reported, especially regarding crop yield and impacts on soil organisms. This is partly because methods with different levels of resolution have been used in different ecological contexts. Overall, {{there is little evidence that}} the effects of GM traits on ecosystem processes act with different mechanisms from those of <b>traits</b> <b>modified</b> using conventional methods.

40|$|Engineered {{glyphosate}} {{resistance is}} the most widely adopted genetically <b>modified</b> <b>trait</b> in agriculture, gaining widespread acceptance by providing a simple robust weed control system. However, extensive and sustained use of glyphosate as a sole weed control mechanism has led to field selection for glyphosate-resistant weeds and has induced significant population shifts to weeds with inherent tolerance to glyphosate. Additional weed control mechanisms that can complement glyphosate-resistant crops are, therefore, urgently needed. 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) is an effective low-cost, broad-spectrum herbicide that controls many of the weeds developing resistance to glyphosate. We investigated the substrate preferences of bacterial aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase enzymes (AADs) that can effectively degrade 2, 4 -D and have found that some members of this class can act on other widely used herbicides {{in addition to their}} activity on 2, 4 -D. AAD- 1 cleaves the aryloxyphenoxypropionate family of grass-active herbicides, and AAD- 12 acts on pyridyloxyacetate auxin herbicides such as triclopyr and fluroxypyr. Maize plants transformed with an AAD- 1 gene showed robust crop resistance to aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides over four generations and were also not injured by 2, 4 -D applications at any growth stage. Arabidopsis plants expressing AAD- 12 were resistant to 2, 4 -D as well as triclopyr and fluroxypyr, and transgenic soybean plants expressing AAD- 12 maintained field resistance to 2, 4 -D over five generations. These results show that single AAD transgenes can provide simultaneous resistance to a broad repertoire of agronomically important classes of herbicides, including 2, 4 -D, with utility in both monocot and dicot crops. These transgenes can help preserve the productivity and environmental benefits of herbicide-resistant crops...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTimothy DaltonPrevious {{research}} on small-scale farmers in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa indicates that certain {{genetically modified maize}} seed types improve production efficiencies and increase net returns (Regier 2012). Yet despite the substantiated advantages, not all farmers have adopted genetically modified maize. The purpose {{of this research is}} to identify the determinants of adopting certain types of genetically modified maize over traditional or conventional hybrid maize for 184 small-holders in two villages in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Previous adoption studies use socioeconomic characteristics of the farmer as well as farm-level production characteristics to determine the probability that a farmer will implement an improved agricultural technology. While many studies employ a binomial approach to adoption, this study tests the probability of adopting three different GM varieties—the insect resistant Bt maize, the herbicide tolerant Roundup Ready® maize, and the stacked trait BR maize. Furthermore, the model is enhanced by farmers’ open-ended explanations of their perceptions on genetically modified maize and of the major production constraints they face. 	Following results from previous adoption studies, this research tests three hypotheses in a three different model structures. The first hypothesis tests whether farmers are more likely to adopt if they have greater financial means to cover higher expected production costs. This is tested by variables measuring off-farm employment and expected production costs. The second hypothesis tests whether farmers with less labor availability are more likely to choose maize with the herbicide tolerant technology, either the Roundup Ready® or stacked BR maize, which reduce the need for weeding. The final hypothesis is whether there are differences in the determinants of adoption that differentiate GM adopters into three distinct categories. These hypotheses are tested in three model structures that test the binary probability of adopting GM maize over non-GM, the probabilities of adopting each maize variety separately, and the intensity of adoption. 	The first finding is that many non-adopters have greater access to income {{and are more likely to}} sell a portion of their yield than are many farmers who adopted, especially in comparison to those who plant RR maize. Also, BR farmers are more likely to report input expenses as a major constraint in their adoption decision. Results for the second hypothesis show that those who planted either RR or BR maize did in fact have less family labor available, used less total labor, and used a greater proportion of family to hired labor. Finally, there are differences in the determinants for geographic site, education, self-sufficiency in maize supply, number of family members working off-farm, and whether households planned to sell any of their maize yields. This indicates that adoption should be considered according to each genetically <b>modified</b> <b>trait...</b>|$|E

40|$|Cassava is an {{important}} crop in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. Cassava can be produced adequately in drought conditions making it the ideal food security crop in marginal environments. Although cassava can tolerate drought stress, it can be genetically improved to enhance productivity in such environments. Drought adaptation studies in over three decades in cassava have identified relevant mechanisms which have been explored in conventional breeding. Drought is a quantitative trait and its multigenic nature makes it very challenging to effectively manipulate and combine genes in breeding for rapid genetic gain and selection process. Cassava has a long growth cycle of 12 - 18 months which invariably contributes to a long breeding scheme for the crop. Modern breeding using advances in genomics and improved genotyping, is facilitating the dissection and genetic analysis of complex traits including drought tolerance, thus helping to better elucidate and understand the genetic basis of such traits. A beneficial goal of new innovative breeding strategies is to shorten the breeding cycle using minimized, efficient or fast phenotyping protocols. While high throughput genotyping have been achieved, this is rarely the case for phenotyping for drought adaptation. Some of the storage root phenotyping in cassava are often done very late in the evaluation cycle making selection process very slow. This paper highlights some <b>modified</b> <b>traits</b> suitable for early-growth phase phenotyping {{that may be used}} to reduce drought phenotyping cycle in cassava.

Transmission to the definitive host occurs after the parasite has reached the cystacanth stage and development into this stage is associated with changes in several behavioral and physiological traits of the host. Despite the numerous examples of trait modification in this system, {{little is known about}} the multidimensional nature of this modification. Here, we examined the relationships between cystacanth infection, and expression of multiple traits (body color, refuge use, activity, and body size) of both male and female C. intermedius. The pattern of multidimensional modification was determined for males and females and then measures of behavioral plasticity, individual consistency, and trait correlations were obtained for the <b>modified</b> <b>traits.</b> The results revealed that the overall pattern of host modification differed between males and females. Infected males and females showed similar decreases in body color but differed in changes to the other traits. Infected females were larger and less active than uninfected females, whereas infected males spent less time in refuge than uninfected males. A comparison between two situations revealed that refuge use exhibited high levels of plasticity and activity exhibited high levels of consistency and that these patterns differed based on both host sex and infection status. Analysis of the relationships among <b>modified</b> <b>traits</b> showed that traits appeared to be modified independently of each other and that correlations between traits that existed in one situation were absent in another. We suggest that the pattern of multidimensional modification is sex-specific and that the <b>traits</b> are <b>modified</b> independently.

The fit Drosophila produces more survivors and develops faster than the unfit one. The yeast, Pichia toletana induced the highest survival and the fastest development of Drosophila, while Metschnikowia pulcherrima induced the opposite. The origin also had an effect on the development time; the African lines developed faster than the European ones. The yeast species and its concentration appeared to affect the dry weight of Drosophila too. Following infection with Pseudomonas stutzeri, several antimicrobial peptides, such as drosomycin and metchnikowin have been activated in Drosophila adults when they feed on less nutritive yeast (M. pulcherrima). The above mentioned results support the capacity of genotype-by-environment interactions to shape the fitness of D. melanogaster, where the contribution of each factor may differ according to the trait observed and the population under investigation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Charles Darwin, {{while trying}} to devise a general theory of {{heredity}} from the observations of animal and plant breeders, discovered that domesticated mammals possess a distinctive and unusual suite of heritable traits not seen in their wild progenitors. Some of these traits also appear in domesticated birds and fish. The origin of Darwin’s “domestication syndrome ” has remained a conundrum for more than 140 years. Most explanations focus on particular traits, while neglecting others, or on the possible selective factors involved in domestication rather than the underlying developmental and genetic causes of these traits. Here, we propose that the domestication syndrome results predominantly from mild neural crest cell deficits during embryonic development. Most of the <b>modified</b> <b>traits,</b> both morphological and physiological, can be readily explained as direct consequences of such deficiencies, while other traits are explicable as indirect consequences. We first show how the hypothesis can account for the multiple, apparently unrelated traits of the syndrome and then explore its genetic dimensions and predictions, reviewing the available genetic evidence. The article concludes with a brief discussion of some genetic and developmental questions raised by the idea, along with specific predictions and experimental tests. A major gap in Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, aspresented in {{the first edition of}} The Origin of Species (Darwin 1859), was the absence of a theory of heredity. As Darwin knew, his theory of evolution required a distinct idea of how biological heredity worked, but in 1859 he was no...|$|R

The Social and Personal Competencies Scale (CPS for its acronym in Spanish, Escala de Competencias Personales y Sociales) {{was developed in}} 2010 (Brea 2010; Ibarrarán et al. 2012). It was designed to measure {{the effectiveness of the}} life skills module of the youth training program Juventud y Empleo in the Dominican Republic in <b>modifying</b> personality <b>traits.</b> For Galpão’s evaluation, the test was translated from Spanish to Portuguese and adapted to the local context, a process involving a group of experts in psychology and language.|$|R
40|$|Realizing the {{potential}} of genomics for crop improvement Humans {{have a long history}} of using artificial selec-tion to <b>modify</b> the <b>traits</b> of agricultural species. The advent of genomics-based technologies have pro-vided the ability to address biological questions or alter phenotypes in ways not previously imagined. In the past decade, we have obtained reference gen-omes for a number of plant species including Arabidopsis, Chlamydomonas, rice, sorghum, poplar, Medicago, maize, soybean and Brachypodium. These reference genomes can now serve as the basis for comparitive studies within or among species and as a framework for a wide variety of functional geno-mics approaches. In addition, there are projects t...|$|R
40|$|An {{argument}} in favor of the development of genetically modified (GM) hybrids is that their presence is considered to be risk decreasing. On this basis, insurance premiums for corn growers in the United States who plant approved hybrids have been reduced. In this study we investigate, using a large dataset of experimental data compiled from reports of results from experimental field trials of corn hybrids by the State Agricultural Extension Services of ten universities over 20 years, whether the presence in a corn hybrid of a GM trait, or a combination of these traits, is likely to increase or decrease risk. The effects of input use on production uncertainty can be quantified through the specification and estimation of heteroskedastic production functions that allow for the variance of yield to change with the level of inputs, and we follow this approach in this study. We also use the flexible moments approach of Antle (1983) to estimate skewness of yield. We estimate a production function for the whole sample, and for three ERS regions represented in the dataset. For each model we use the residuals of the mean function to estimate the marginal effect of each input on variance and skewness of yield. The results show {{that there is not a}} systematic relationship between the presence of GM traits and variance and skewness of yield, and the results are not entirely consistent between ERS regions.

40|$|To {{combat the}} obesity epidemic, {{interventions}} and treatments often recommend low-calorie dieting. Calorie restriction (CR) as a weight intervention, however, is often unsuccessful, {{as most people}} cannot sustain the behavior. Yet one small group has maintained extreme CR over years - members of the CR Society and followers of The CR Way. This study examined stable psychosocial characteristics of these individuals to identify traits that may promote success at long-term CR. In 65 participants, we measured diet, eating behaviors, and personality traits comparing calorie restrictors with two age-, gender-, ethnicity-, and education-matched comparison groups (normal weight and overweight/obese). We first tested whether the CR group restricted calories without indications of eating disorder pathology, and second, what crystallized psychosocial characteristics set them apart from their nonrestricting comparisons. Results indicated the CR group averaged 10 years of CR but scored lower than comparison groups on measures of disordered eating (p <. 001) and psychopathology (p <. 001). Particularly against overweight/obese participants, CR participants scored lower on neuroticism (p <. 04) and hostility (p <. 01), and were stronger in future time orientation (p <. 05). Overall, CR profiles reflected high self-control and well being, except for having few close relationships. This study suggests a potential predisposition for successful long-term CR without disordered eating. Since <b>modifying</b> <b>trait</b> factors may be unrealistic, there may be psychosocial boundaries to the capacity for sustaining CR. Paralleling a movement toward personalized medicine, this study points toward a personalized behavioral medicine model in behavioral nutrition and treatment of overweight/obesity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
