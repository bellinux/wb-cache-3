40|$|Decades of {{computer-aided}} {{process planning}} research {{has resulted in}} techniques that automate portions of the process planning task such as operation sequencing and cutter path optimisation. Nonetheless, solutions to other areas such as setup planning and fixturing remain elusive. Setup planning research has received increased attention in recent years. The importance of tolerance analysis in setup planning has been recognised. However, {{due to the lack}} of a common measure for different types of tolerances, the analysis is carried out in an ad hoc fashion and often results in suboptimal setup plans. In this paper, a tolerance normalisation approach is presented to provide an accurate means for direct comparison of different types of geometric tolerances and dimensional tolerances. A normalised tolerance is an angle representing the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> rotation <b>error</b> when locating a component.

30|$|Our {{study is}} {{free from the}} {{constraints}} of commercially available systems, but our equations and tables {{can be used to}} estimate errors generated by these systems when certain parameters are known. Our study calculates the maximum errors expected by the mechanical components of the computerised implant surgery process, with the understanding that the implantologist involved in the in-office printing has to have a knowledge of the dimensions, the design and the tolerances of the components he will use for the manufacturing of the guide. Cassetta et al. [13] estimated that 62.7 % of the total implant positioning error was due to the properties of the sleeve/ drill combination, when the Materialise Safe® guide system was used. Even though it is recommended that the osteotomy should be performed without exerting force to the guide [12] and with the bur led parallel to the long axis of the sleeve, this is not possible in a number of cases, especially where the mouth opening is a limiting factor or when an oblique bone ridge is encountered. It is, therefore, probable that during surgery, the drill is tilted inside the sleeve, changing the final position of the implant. Then the metallic components with their dimensions and tolerances define the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>errors.</b> Obviously, if the drill rotates exactly at the centre of the sleeve, no error is expected. It should be noted that when a sleeve/key/drill combination is used, the expected errors of the mechanical parts should be estimated taking into account the bigger clearance value created by the key usage. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensibly calculate the errors by taking into consideration the parameters that contribute to the 62.7 % of the total error in guided implant surgery, as Cassetta et al. [13] stated.|$|R

The result is a robot brain that can choose its next move by associating its current sensor inputs with a particular subsection of the possible input vectors. GNG networks are used for vector quantization, to generate a set of input prototypes and a separate set of output prototypes. A Q-learning process that treats the input model vectors as states and the output model vectors as actions yields a Q-table that should efficiently guide a robot through the state-action space on which it is trained.

30|$|The second layer {{which has}} the leakage {{competition}} thresholds, Err and Errcu has a similar role played by them, as they all set {{to determine the number}} of new nodes that has to be generated in a trained network. When there is an increase in Err, the network tends to adjust its θsj and αsj when rather, it’s supposed to generate new nodes in the second and the third layers. An increase in Errcu will increase the probability that only one new node is appended to the second layer and decrease the probability that two new nodes are appended to the second and the third layers simultaneously. The predictability of the model with its ability to have in mind the trained instances is determine by the number of the nodes in the second and the third layers. The predictability in general will decrease and the error from memorizing increases when the node number increases. Kumar (2017) suggests that the leakage competition threshold be 0.8 and the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>error</b> 0.11. The composition of FANNC is made of seven input units and one output unit. The hidden layer units are generated energetically. The study then utilizes the regression function of FANNC to evaluate the performance of the mutual fund. Just as in ERBPNN, input and output instances are regularized by the standard procedure. In the interim, the selection of testing instances and feeding sequence are randomly arranged.|$|E
40|$|The {{minimum number}} of samples that must be taken from a {{sinusoidal}} signal affected by white Gaussian noise, {{in order to find}} its frequency with a predetermined maximum error, is derived. This analysis is of interest in evaluating the performance of velocity-measurement systems based on the Doppler effect. Specifically, in laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) it is usual to receive bursts with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, yet high accuracy is required for the measurement. In recent years special {{attention has been paid to}} the problem of monitoring the temporal evolution of turbulent flows. In this kind of situation averaging or filtering the data sequences cannot be allowed: in a rapidly changing environment each one of the measurements should rather be performed within a <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>error</b> and the bursts strongly affected by noise removed. The method for velocity extraction that will be considered here is the spectral analysis through the squared discrete Fourier transform, or periodogram, of the received bursts. This paper has two parts. In the first an approximate expression for the error committed in LDA is derived and discussed. In the second a mathematical formalism for the exact calculation of the error as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio is obtained, and some universal curves for the expected error are provided. The results presented here appear to represent a fundamental limitation on the accuracy of LDA measurements, yet, to our knowledge, they have not been reported in the literature so far.

40|$|Coordinate {{measurement}} machine (CMM) probing {{techniques can}} involve direct mechanical contact (e. g., tactile probing) or diverse non-contact principles (e. g., laser line scan probing). For some applications, contact methods are {{not capable of}} measuring fast enough to ensure 100 % quality controlled parts. A laser line scanning probe uses a laser triangulation-based method to acquire 3 D measurement points on a workpiece relative to a sensor. Mounting the sensor in a 3 D coordinate frame, e. g., in a CMM provides enough information to fully examine the workpiece. These techniques are most commonly exploited in medical industry and industries involving plate materials. A high data density and measurement speed are significant advantages when measuring free-form surfaces by laser line scanning, making the process much more time-efficient. However, high-precision geometrical features (such as cylinders, spheres, etc.) must be measured for locating and aligning the free-form shapes. The accuracy of the equipment therefore has to be assessed. Probe <b>Maximum</b> <b>Permissible</b> <b>Error</b> (MPEP) values below 10 μm have been reported for cutting-edge laser line scanners. This paper compares the major influences on measurements on cylindrical features. First, the aspect-ratio limitations are considered by comparing two inherently different techniques. The stable inspection of reference features is important, while trying to maximize the spatial extent of the measured features. Second, the measurement method is analyzed in two ways: by using a limited sample of the features to increase stability and eliminate interference from neighboring features; by varying the number of scan tracks, which greatly affects the measurement time. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction:	Recent {{concerns}} over high failure rates in some metal-on-metal hip replacement bearings have highlighted {{the need for}} a standardised approach to wear analysis of such components at retrieval. There is a need for a traceable metrological approach to the quantification and characterisation of in vivo wear as currently {{there are a number of}} approaches that have been adopted in literature and industry with a greater or lesser reference paid to good and reliable measurement practice. Method:	This paper shows the development of a comprehensive method for measuring the wear geometry of retrieved bearings. This is achieved using currently recognised co-ordinate metrology methods. Assessment and quantification of both the magnitude and effect of the three-dimensional measurement uncertainty on the measurement process as a whole is presented. The developed method is fully in accordance with established international standards. Results and Discussion:	Through initial measurements and simulated data, it has been shown that even for a CMM with a low <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>error,</b> the task-related volumetric uncertainty associated with measurement of spherical hip surfaces can be of the order of 1 - 2 mm 3. It is further shown in the data presented that uncontrolled measurement variables have a deleterious effect on the validity of the measurement result thus increasing the measurement uncertainty. With the precision required for accurate quantification of wear in new generation metal-on-metal bearing surfaces the magnitude of this uncertainty is significant. Conclusion:	An unambiguous statement of uncertainty is vital in measuring retrieved components as a means of comparison between studies and as a measure of confidence in measurement data. It is suggested that great care be taken when performing wear measurements on retrieved bearings...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes and {{discusses}} an active dual-sensor autofocusing method {{for measuring the}} positioning errors of arrays of small holes on complex curved surfaces. The dual-sensor unit combines an optical vision sensor and a tactile probe and is designed to achieve rapid automated measurements {{in a way that}} can be adapted to be suitable for deployment on a manufacturing machine tool. Mathematical analysis is performed to establish the magnitude of the deviation from the optimal focal length that is induced by the autofocussing method. This evaluation is based on the geometrical relationship and interaction between the radius of the tactile probe with both the measured holes and the complex-curved surface. A description is provided of a laboratory-based standalone dual-sensor autofocusing unit and test rig that was built to perform experimental validation of the method. This system is estimated to have a focusing uncertainty of 11 μm deriving mainly from the inaccuracy of the X-Z translation stage and the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>error</b> of the tactile probe. A case study is presented which evaluates the accuracy of a pattern of Ø 0. 5 mm small holes on an elliptic cylinder.

It is estimated that the deviation in optimal focusing induced by this automated method is between - 23 μm and + 95 μm. This is sufficiently accurate to ensure that the optical device can capture the entire space outline of each of the small holes on the complex curve surface clearly and can therefore identify its centroid from the image to provide a measurement of the position...|$|E

This work was accomplished in order to investigate the in fluence of temperature and flow profile disturbances {{on the performance of}} flow meters in district heating applications. The flow meters tested were all ultrasonic flow meters of sing-around type. The selection of flow meters contains in total seven meters of three different brands. All meters have a flow range from 0. 015 m 3 /h to 1. 5 m 3 /h. These meters are commonly used in heat meters in small district heating subscriber stations. The flow meters are presented without identification. All tests were performed in a flow meter calibration facility and in a flow range including the minimum and maximum flow of each flow meter. In the tests three different water tempera-tures and three different installations were investigated. Water temperatures of 20 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C were used. These temperatures are representative for district heating applications. The installations tested involved flow meters mounted with long straight pipes both up-and down-stream representing ideal conditions, a single elbow and a double elbow out of plane both generating disturbed flow profiles. All set-ups are in accordance with the flow meter specifications. The results demonstrate that both the change in temperature and the disturbed flow profiles introduce errors in the flow measurements. The change from 20 °C to 50 °C and 70 °C can cause a shift in meter performance larger than the specified <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>error.</b> Compared with the ideal installation the installations generating disturbed flow profiles cause errors up to more than 2 %.

An evaluation was made in the Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kauno clinics Oncology and Haematology clinic, for linear accelerator Varian Clinac iX. „Garden fence“ and „speed“ tests were used. Images for these tests were acquired using Varian Electronic portal imaging device, Kodak dosimetric film and SunNuclear MAPCHECK dosimeter. Two image analysis programs were written using MATLAB software. Also DynaLog file analysis was made. Dependence of deviations on the gantry and collimator positions, and speed of leaves were estimated. Largest systematic leaf positioning error was 0, 103 mm ± 0, 035 mm, P= 0, 95.
