5000|$|There was no {{audio signal}} in an I/O module—rather, each I/O module {{had a single}} 4 MHz Z80 {{microprocessor}} that was responsible for converting user input (switches, knobs, faders) on four channels to control signals for the audio tower, and for returning sample level information for display on the meters and overload information for clipping indicators. The <b>Master</b> <b>module</b> (also powered by a single 4 MHz Z80) handled the master faders, the talkback system, additional meters, etc. and also included a jog wheel and dot-matrix alphanumeric display for configuring the system. Since most controls (e.g. {{the changing of the}} gain of a selected EQ) could be performed with the jog wheel and alphanumeric display and were shown in real time on the Support Computer's display, a mix engineer could do most of his/her work from a central location at the Mix Controller while remaining in the audio [...] "sweet spot" [...] for monitoring purposes, etc. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} conventional mixing consoles of the time, where a particular EQ had to be adjusted via the associated knobs in that particular channel strip, which might be located a considerable distance from the sweet spot. A third Z80-based processor board—the MPU—resided inside the <b>Master</b> <b>module</b> and was responsible for system booting and initialization, system management, inter-module communication and communication with an external PC.|$|E

50|$|A modular, multi-processor-based {{approach}} was required {{in order to}} meet one of the Crescendo's initial goals—complete reconfiguration of the entire console (regardless of size) in an SMPTE frame, i.e. in 1/30s. This was achieved by having a single processor dedicated every four I/O channels, independent {{of the size of the}} console. All of the processors in the I/O and Master modules ran in parallel and communicated with the MPU via a shared memory scheme. The MPU module controlled access to the shared memory via a bus-address-based time sharing scheme with handshaking. Each I/O and <b>Master</b> <b>module</b> used the same basic memory paging architecture—the lower 32KB were mapped to a 2KB boot EPROM and a 32KB SRAM, and the upper 32KB could be mapped under local control to one of eight 32KB SRAMs. SRAM pages 0 through 6 were located in the module itself, but the 32KB SRAM for page 7 (the so-called Bulletin Board RAM) was located remotely in the MPU module. The system's Z80 address and data busses ran the length of the console's internal bus, which could be in excess of 9 feet (3 m) long in larger configurations. Address and data line buffers in each I/O and <b>Master</b> <b>module</b> were of course required for such a long bus. The memory architecture of the MPU module differed slightly from the I/O and Master modules by utilizing EPROMS in pages 1 through 6 to store the firmware for each of the three module types. RAM pages 1 through 6 in the Master and I/O modules were ultimately used for runtime automation. Though the clock signal was shared across multiple modules, each module ran independently and unsynchronized, only to re-synchronize at the end of each SMPTE frame. The Crescendo was coded entirely in Z80 assembly language, utilizing nearly all of the 64KB of program memory space available to each.|$|E

50|$|Components used in {{the audio}} signal path {{included}} common logic still available today, as well as high-performance audio chips from companies like PMI, SSM, Analog Devices, Burr-Brown, National Semiconductor, Maxim Integrated Products, and others. An Audio Mainframe was populated with one Master audio module and up to 28 I/O audio modules. The Mix Controller's <b>Master</b> <b>module</b> controlled the Master audio module, {{and each of the}} Mix Controller's I/O modules controlled four I/O audio modules. Communication between the Mix Controller and the Audio Mainframe was via a 1 Mbit/s link for each module in the Mix Controller. Since the communications link between the Mix Controller and the Audio Mainframe was strictly a digital control interface without any audio signals, the Audio Mainframe could be positioned a large distance from the Mix Controller. This was very helpful from an acoustic standpoint, as the fans required to cool the Audio Mainframe were noticeably loud. Additionally, since the circuitry in the audio modules could be arranged completely independently of the constraints imposed by a conventional mixer's control surface, the Audio Module was able to achieve some of the best (analog) audio specifications ever seen in this type of product. The Audio Mainframe consumed around 2.5 kW in operation from its dedicated linear power supply.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in systems and synthetic biology {{is the lack of}} modular composition. Modules change their behavior once connected, due to retroactivity. In this paper, we build upon our earlier results and provide a theorem establishing how the dynamics of a <b>master</b> <b>module</b> change once slave modules are present. We quantify the change in the dynamics of the <b>master</b> <b>module</b> due to interconnection as a function of measurable biochemical parameters. Based on this, we provide a bound on the difference between the trajectories of the connected system and those of the isolated system by employing contraction theory. Therefore, we obtain a measure of robustness, which helps evaluating the degree of modularity in a system, while providing guidelines for robust module design. We illustrate the results by considering a recurring motif in gene transcription networks: an autorepressed gene regulating the expression of several downstream targets.

Our wavelet based approach for onset localization does not suffer from either smearing effects caused by windowing in the time domain nor from consistency problems caused by multiband level thresholding.

The results presented indicate that our approach is a promising basis for multicomponent acoustic signal separation. 1 System Architecture The fundamental signals considered in our approach are time limited sinusoid functions disturbed by Gaussian white noise.

40|$|As a {{lecturer}} in entrepreneurship education, {{the challenge of}} embedding an entrepreneurship mindset in my students is of great interest. A traditional lecturing approach is inadequate {{and there is a}} call for more creative teaching and a more experiential learning approach. In the words of Plutarch “Minds are not vessels to be filled, but fires to be ignited” The author decided to evaluate an existing <b>Masters</b> <b>module</b> on food entrepreneurship in the light of best practice. The approach involved {{a review of the literature}} and both EU and national policy documents. The syllabus, teaching methods and assessments on the <b>Masters</b> <b>module</b> in food entrepreneurship were examined. A questionnaire comprising of both closed and open ended questions were administered to a Masters class who had completed the module. The results of the evaluation highlighted positive features of the food entrepreneurship module e. g. specific feedback in relation to how the module helped embed an entrepreneurial mindset. Overall students benefited from the module and were of the view that they had the knowledge to start a business. The students found the “real life experience” from the guest lecture with a food entrepreneur very beneficial. The paper has synthesised knowledge of best practice according to entrepreneurship policy documents and academic literature. In light of entrepreneurial educational policy and literature findings various recommendations are made in order to make the classroom more entrepreneurial involving more innovative teaching methods such as more use of problem solving exercises, use of theatre and partnerships with existing businesses...|$|R
