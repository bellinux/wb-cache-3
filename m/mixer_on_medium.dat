40|$|The gain {{bandwidth}} of NbN hot-electron bolometer terahertz <b>mixers</b> <b>on</b> electrically thin Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 membranes was experimentally {{investigated and}} {{compared with that}} of HEB <b>mixers</b> <b>on</b> bulk substrates. A gain bandwidth of 3. 5 GHz is achieved on bulk silicon, whereas the gain bandwidth is reduced down to 0. 6 – 0. 9 GHz for <b>mixers</b> <b>on</b> 1. 5 um Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 membranes. We show that application of a MgO buffer layer on the membrane extends the gain bandwidth to 3 GHz. The experimental data were analyzed using the film-substrate acoustic mismatch approach...|$|R
