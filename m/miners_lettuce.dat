50|$|The upper {{one half}} mile (800 m) of San Bruno Creek {{is the most}} rugged and natural reach as the stream winds through steep canyons of about 45 degrees in slope. The {{underlying}} geological formation of this upper catchment basin is Pleistocene Colma Formation, which continues eastward in the basin under most of the San Francisco Bay Flood Plain. Principal flows of the creek are within the winter months of November to March, the only season of meaningful rainfall in the Bay Area. Groundwater in the middle to upper basin varies between about 70 to 150 feet (21 to 46 m), and flows generally eastward toward the Bay. This wooded upper reach watershed consists of a mixed oak woodland with coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia, as a dominant species. Other larger plants are the California Bay Laurel and the understory species Toyon. The understory also includes the following wildflowers: evening primrose (Renothera ovata), wild radish (Raphanus satira), wild cucumber (Marah fabaceus), scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), <b>miners</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Montia perfoliata), fillaree (Erodium cicutarium), vetch (Vicia americana), sweet clover (Melilotus indius), lupine (Lupinus sp.), and California poppy (Eschscholzia californica).|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to the high severity patches, Tyee low severity fire patches, which had an intact canopy, had their peak seed dispersal during June. The principal species contributing to this dispersal peak included <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> and Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda). While <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> did not produce the large seed numbers {{that occurred in the}} Fischer Fire, there was an important surge in seed production from this ruderal species in June. It is noteworthy that this annual species played a large role in the Tyee low severity fire patches while the high severity fire patches of the same age had seed rains dominated by perennial natives. While early succession on sunny sites favors annual seed production (Grime 1979), the dominance of <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> in the low severity Tyee patches requires explanation. Most likely, the shading provided by the unburned canopy maintained adequate soil moisture that allowed the annual <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> to compete longer in the post-fire succession. The distinction between seed rains dominated by annual or perennial species could not be simply explained by fire severity, but must include reference to the specific taxa involved; <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> is unlike many annuals, having a greater tolerance for shading.|$|R

30|$|The most {{numerous}} seed at {{a single}} patch for one sample period was <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Montia perfoliata, synonym Claytonia perfoliata), which in the June 27, 2005, sample totaled 2945 seeds from 8 traps (12 738 m− 2 per three weeks). The next four largest seed counts for individual patches on a single sampling period were also <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce.</b> All of these patches were in the Fischer Fire Complex. Of the ten largest seed counts for individual patches, eight were <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce,</b> all of which occurred in the Fischer Fire. The other two species were flixweed (Descurainia sophia), also from the Fischer Fire, and fireweed, from the Tyee Fire.

40|$|The total, soluble and {{insoluble}} oxalate {{contents of}} the small, large and cauline leaves and small and large stems of <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Claytonia perfoliata) plants which had been irrigated with tap water or a soluble fertilizer were extracted and measured using HPLC chromatography. Overall, all plant parts of <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> analyzed contained high levels of total and soluble oxalates; however plants irrigated with fertilizer contained lower levels of oxalates compared with plants irrigated with water. On a dry matter basis, the small leaves contained higher levels of total oxalate {{when compared to the}} total oxalate in the large leaves. Soluble oxalate in the leaves of plants irrigated with water ranged from 2. 6 to 7. 5 mg/ 100 g dry matter (DM) and was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than the leaves of the fertilizer-watered plants, which ranged from 1. 8 to 2. 8 mg/ 100 g DM. The soluble oxalate in the small and large stems of the fertilizer-watered plants ranged from 1. 20 to 1. 5 mg/ 100 g DM and was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) than the water-treated small and large stems, which ranged from 3. 75 to 4. 4 mg/ 100 g DM.

30|$|Shrubs, forbs, and graminoids that resprout from a {{survivor}} taproot, caudex, or bulb (SRCB) increased {{between the first}} and sixth post-fire years, regardless of burn severity or salvage logging (Figure 4). In year one post fire, only plots classified as burned with high severity had significantly lower SRCB cover than those classified as low severity (P < 0.05). In the second post-fire year, we found abundant cover of Scouler’s willow, <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Claytonia perfoliata Donn ex Willd.), and Idaho fescue on plots burned with high severity that were seeded but not salvage logged. Also in year two post fire, high severity plots that were both salvage logged and seeded had significantly greater SRCB cover than unburned plots, whereas in year three post fire, moderate severity plots had significantly greater SRCB cover than unburned plots (P < 0.05). In year four and six post fire, high severity plots had significantly greater SRCB cover when compared to low severity plots. Over all years, SRCB cover was lower on unburned plots than on all other plots (P < 0.05), and salvage logging appeared to affect SRCB cover only on moderate severity plots (compared to the not salvage-logged counterparts) (P < 0.05) (Table 3). Four years after the fire, there were no site factors that significantly influenced SRCB cover.|$|R
40|$|In a taxonomic {{review of}} the species of the Heterodera "cacti group," H. thornei n. sp. is {{described}} and illustrated from <b>Miner's</b> <b>lettuce</b> in California. This new species is distinguishable especially by havpunctate egg shells and a larval stylet (27 μm) and tail (56 μm) longer than other related species. Heterodera weissi is redescribed, type specimens are designated, and new data added {{on the basis of}} original and topotype specimens. New morphometric data, along with illustrations, are given for H. cacti, H. amaranthi, and H. estonica, and certain details in the original descriptions are clarified on the latter two species. Diagnoses and a key for identification of these species are given. A common name for each species is proposed when one is lacking. Previously unrecognized tooth-like structures occurring in the vulval cone top of these species and in H. schachtii are characterized and named "vulval denticles. " Because of its markedly different morphology, especially in cysts, H. betulae is removed from the H. cacti group and placed alone, since it is incompatible with any of the present Heterodera "groups.

40|$|General Description: Low spreading, {{branched}} annual often {{twice as}} broad as tall. Basal leaves {{are few and}} spatula-shaped; stem leaves are lanceolate and narrow abruptly to the petiole. The racemes are often in the axils of the foliage leaves and are clustered toward the branch ends. Sepals measure less than 1 / 5 in. (2 to 3 mm) and are unequal; the petals range from white to pale pink and are less than 1 / 3 in. (3 to 4 mm) long. There are 5 stamens. The capsule is 3 -valved and contains black papillate seeds with a short, conical appendage. Identification Tips: This non-rhizomatous, annual species is identifiable by its low-growing, branching appearance and its alternate spatula-shaped leaves. Phenology: Flowers April through July. Range: Occurs mainly {{on the western side}} of the Cascades from southern British Columbia to Marin County, California. In Washington, it is currently known in Skamania, Snohomish, Clark, Kittitas, Skagit and Clallam counties. It is historically known from Gray’s Harbor, Klickitat, Lewis, Pierce, Snohomish, and Clark counties. Habitat: This species occurs in moist forests in the lowland and lower montane zones. It is occasionally located in xeric soil or disturbed sites. Associate species include Douglas fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii), ocean-spray (Holodiscus discolor.) and <b>miner’s</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Montia perfoliata). Ecology: The most common habitat for M. diffusa is open fir woodlands. However, branching montia can tolerate some degree of disturbance, including fire or logging activity, and is often found in such areas. Therefore, occurrences may exist {{in a wide variety of}} elevations and habitats except in those areas affected by severe burn. State Status Comments: Montia diffusa is scattered throughout Washington. The habitat is subject to disturbance by excessive timber harvest. Known distribution of Montia diffus...|$|R
