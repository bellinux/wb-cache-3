5000|$|The {{next step}} up from the simple nut is a split nut, whose halves can be {{adjusted}} and locked with screws so that one side rides leftward thread faces, {{and the other side}} rides rightward faces. Notice the analogy here with the radio dial example using split gears, where the split halves are pushed in opposing directions. Unlike in the radio dial example, the spring tension idea is not useful here, because machine tools taking a cut put too much force against the screw. Any spring light enough to allow slide movement at all would allow cutter chatter at best and slide movement at worst. These screw-adjusted split-nut-on-an-Acme-leadscrew designs cannot eliminate all backlash on a <b>machine</b> <b>slide</b> unless they are adjusted so tight that the travel starts to bind. Therefore, this idea can't totally obviate the always-approach-from-the-same-direction concept; but backlash can be held to a small amount (1 or 2 thousandths of an inch), which is more convenient and in some non-precise work is enough to allow one to ignore the backlash (i.e., act as if there weren't any).|$|E
40|$|A 5 -axis {{milling machine}} has 39 {{independent}} geometric error components when the machine tool is {{considered as a}} set of five rigid bodies. The identification of the deterministic component of the systematic error is very important. It permits one to improve the accuracy close to the repeatability of the machine tool. This paper gives a new way to identify and compensate all the systematic angular errors separately and then use them further to identify the systematic translational error. Identification based on a new mathematical method and a stable numerical solution method is proposed. The model explains from first principles why some error components have no effect in a first order model. The identification of the total angular systematic errors can be done independently from the translation errors. However, the total translation error depends on the angular errors and the translation errors of each machine tool slide. The main problems solved are to find enough linear independent equations and avoid numerical instability in the computation. It is important to separate numerical problems and linear dependence. The very complex equations are first analyzed in symbolic form to eliminate the linear dependencies. The total of linear independent components in the model is reduced from 30 to 26 for the position dependent errors and from 9 to 3 for the position independent components. Secondly, the large system of linear equations is broken down in many smaller systems. The model is tested first with simulated errors modeled as cubic polynomials. An artifact-based identification is proposed and implemented based on drilling holes in various locations and orientations. New ways to measure the volumetric error directly are proposed. Direct measurement of the total volumetric error requires considerably less measurement than measuring all 6 components of each <b>machine</b> <b>slide</b> {{especially in the case of}} a 5 -axis machin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} {{condition}} monitoring of electric switch machine for railway points. Point machine, {{as a complex}} electro-mechanical device, switch the track between two alternative routes. There has been an increasing interest in railway safety and the optimal management of railway equipments maintenance, e. g. point machine, {{in order to enhance}} railway service quality and reduce system failure. This paper explores the development of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to detect some point failures (external to the <b>machine,</b> <b>slide</b> chairs, fixing, stretchers, etc), while the point machine (inside the machine) is in its proper condition. Time-domain stator Current signatures of normal (healthy) and faulty points are taken by 3 Hall Effect sensors and are analyzed by K-S test. The test is simulated by creating three types of such failures, namely putting a hard stone and a soft stone between stock rail and switch blades as obstacles and also slide chairs ’ friction. The test has been applied for those three faults which the results show that K-S test can effectively be developed for the aim of other point failures detection, which their current signatures deviate parametrically from the healthy current signature. K-S test as an analysis technique, assuming that any defect has a specific probability distribution. Empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) are used to differentiate these probability distributions. This test works based on the null hypothesis that ECDF of target distribution is statistically similar to ECDF of reference distribution. Therefore by comparing a given current signature (as target signal) from unknown switch state to a number of template signatures (as reference signal) from known switch states, it is possible to identify which is the most likely state of the point machine under analysis.

40|$|The fast tool servo (FTS) {{machining}} process provides an indispensable solution for machining optical microstructures with sub-micrometer form accuracy and a nanometric surface finish {{without the need}} for any subsequent post processing. The error motions in the FTS machining {{play an important role in}} the material removal process and surface generation. However, these issues have received relatively little attention. This paper presents a theoretical and experimental analysis of the effect of error motions on surface generation in FTS machining. This is accomplished by the establishment of a model-based simulation system for FTS machining, which is composed of a surface generation model, a tool path generator, and an error model. The major components of the error model include the stroke error of the FTS, the error motion of the <b>machine</b> <b>slide</b> in the feed direction, and the axial motion error of the main spindle. The form error due to the stroke error can be extracted empirically by regional analysis, the slide motion error and the axial motion error of the spindle are obtained by a kinematic model and the analysis of the profile in the circumferential direction in single point diamond turning (SPDT) of a flat surface, respectively. After incorporating the error model in the surface generation model, the model-based simulation system is capable of predicting the surface generation in FTS machining. A series of cutting tests were conducted. The predicted results were compared with the measured results, and hence the performance of the model-based simulation system was verified. The proposed research is helpful for the analysis and diagnosis of motion errors on the surface generation in the FTS {{machining process}}, and throws some light on the corresponding compensation and optimization solutions to improve the machining quality.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and manufacture of a fluidic variable event control system for turret lathes, which can be programmed to give any desired tool-slide length of travel in increments of 0. 001 inch. The system consists of pneumatic-hydraulic machine actuating cylinders, fitted with sensors to provide machine information, and a control cabinet containing the logic, counter, address and programme systems. Control of events, such as the engagement of the cross-slide, change of feed etc., have been related to the ram-slide motion; fluid displaced from the ram-slide actuating cylinder is metered into either a storage tank or slave cylinders in the control cabinet which, repeat and amplify the motion. Sensing units fitted to the slave cylinders, are programmed to inform the Logic System when the <b>machine</b> <b>slide</b> has travelled the required distance for an event, which initiates command signals to the address system. Programming a selection of events, their sequence and distance to be travelled by a tooling arrangement is achieved by sing multi-channel selector units. Each unit has six programme channels and controls and event, such as the rate of feed for each turret face. On receipt of a start signal, programme channel number 1 of each selector unit is energised, turret face number 1 is presented to the component material and the events programmed take place. When the sequence of operations for that turret face have been completed, the slides return to their starting point. Indexing of the turret to present face number 2 energises programme channel number 2 to control events for this face. This process is repeated until turret face number 6 and programme channel number 6 has been used; the component has now been completed and the cycle is repeated. The programme is not pre-determined such as when using plug board, punched card or tape, and can be varied by shop floor personnel adjusting the programme selector units while the machine is in operation. This feature not only enables component lengths to be adjusted, but as the choice of such events as speed, feed, or when to start the cross-slide may be varied to suit the actual working conditions, optimum production performance is more readily achieved...|$|E

25|$|In 19th-century {{machining}} practice, it was {{not uncommon}} to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication at the cutting edge–chip interface. When one considers that high-speed steel (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.)

This means that {{if they have been}} dialing left, and now they want to move to a rightward point, they move rightward all the way past it and then dial leftward back to it. The setups, tool approaches, and toolpaths are designed around this constraint.|$|R

Thus pantograph milling machines are largely a thing of the past. They are still in commercial use, but at a greatly reduced and ever-dwindling level. They are no longer built new by machine tool builders, but a small market for used machines still exists. As for the magnification-and-reduction feature of a pantograph (with the scale determined by the adjustable arm lengths), it is achieved in CNC via mathematic calculations that the computer applies to the program information practically instantaneously.
