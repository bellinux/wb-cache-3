25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him if he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E

Actors that were intended for the role of the Tango drinker were passed over as they did not like the idea of being slapped; the role ultimately went to an actor whose identity has not been discussed. Robinson praised him, saying that he was a [...] "really good actor, and he was just the best at reacting to being hit, he never <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> out of it," [...] calling his performance [...] "cool and dopey." ...|$|E

First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass of brandy neat while you'd say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this morning. Up {{with her on the}} car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish American. Didn't take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the Express. Scavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.|$|E

50|$|During this time, General Host {{acquired}} Li'l General Stores Inc., {{operator of}} 377 convenience stores in seven states.

One month later Pistell <b>made</b> <b>a</b> much <b>bigger</b> <b>deal,</b> acquiring <b>a</b> one-eighth interest in Armour & Co., a diversified meat processor. This holding was expanded in subsequent months to between 53 and 57 percent of Armour's common stock, at a cost of $261 million in debentures, notes, a warrant, and carrying costs. By acquiring a majority interest in a company ten times its own size in sales and four times its assets, critics noted that General Host had taken on long-term debt of $207 million--far beyond its assets of $38 million.|$|R

500|$|Some {{observers}} thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. James Berardinelli {{questioned the}} [...] "random amount [...] of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches." [...] Similar to Batman Forever, this primarily included {{the decision to}} add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, [...] "I {{had no idea that}} putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." [...] Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece.

Actors and directors often find Pinter's [...] "pauses and silences" [...] to be daunting elements of performing his plays, leading to much discussion {{of them in}} theatrical and dramatic criticism, and actors {{who have worked with}} Pinter in rehearsals have [...] "reported that he regretted ever starting to write 'Pause' as a stage direction, because it often leads to portentous overacting" [...] (Jacobson). Speaking about their experiences of working with Pinter in rehearsing director Carey Perloff's 1989 double bill of The Birthday Party and Mountain Language (for Classic Stage Company), American actors David Strathairn and Peter Riegert agreed with Jean Stapleton that [...] "Pinter's comments &hellip; 'freed' the cast from feeling reverential about his pauses," [...] and, while Strathairn [...] "believes pauses can be overdone," [...] he also [...] "thinks Pinter's are distinctive: 'The natural ones always seem to be right where he wrote them. His pause or beat comes naturally in the rhythm of the conversation. an actor, you find yourself pausing in mid-sentence, thinking about what you just said or are going to say.&hellip;' [...] " [...] Perloff said: [...] "He didn't want them weighted that much. &hellip; He kept laughing that everybody <b>made</b> such <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> about it.'

5000|$|Wakefield was {{the first}} of the [...] "Bonus Babies", and his bonus was [...] "more than the {{aggregate}} amount that the entire starting lineup for many major league teams earned in a season." [...] From the beginning, Wakefield felt that he was treated unfairly by sportswriters, many of whom he recalled made only $8,000 a year. [...] "Most of the resentment came from the newspapers.

It was suggested at one point that Pepi should send Brent back to the suite, but Pepi chose not to and tried to bring him back into the group with mixed success.|$|E

[...] He also maintained that Jutra's proclivities were known by {{many people in the}} industry, [...] "but nobody <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> out of it."

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people <b>made</b> such <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> about <b>a</b> breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Model 655 {{removable}} disc drives {{were the}} first to employ floating or flying heads. Early marketing material <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> of this, but {{there were a number of}} problems that plagued all of the Century Series systems. Head crashes were common, because the head flew less than a human hair's width above the disc surface. (Unless a drive unit was repaired and carefully cleaned after a crash, the next disc pack loaded in that drive would also crash. And, if a crashed disc pack was loaded on an operational drive, it would destroy the head on that drive unit. Contributing to this was the fact that disc packs were hand-loaded: spun tight onto a spindle, then uncovered by hand, in open air, before the drive cover was closed. A head crash could be caused merely by repeatedly bumping the smoked polycarbonate pack cover against the edge of a disc platter while lifting it off. Although the typical head crash ruined heads and the pack, the worst kind of head crash was caused by an entire pack coming loose from its spindle and rising freely inside the machine while spinning at high speeds!) ...|$|E
5000|$|Zinn {{opposed the}} 2003 {{invasion}} and occupation of Iraq and wrote several books about it. In {{an interview with}} The Brooklyn Rail he said, We certainly should not be initiating a war, as it's not {{a clear and present}} danger to the United States, or in fact, to anyone around it. If it were, then the states around Iraq would be calling for a war on it. The Arab states around Iraq are opposed to the war, and if anyone's in danger from Iraq, they are. At the same time, the U.S. is violating the U.N. charter by initiating a war on Iraq. Bush <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> about the number of resolutions Iraq has violated—and it's true, Iraq has not abided by the resolutions of the Security Council. But it's not the first nation to violate Security Council resolutions. Israel has violated Security Council resolutions every year since 1967. Now, however, the U.S. is violating a fundamental principle of the U.N. Charter, which is that nations can't initiate a war—they can only do so after being attacked. And Iraq has not attacked us. He asserted that the U.S. would end Gulf War II when resistance within the military increased in the same way resistance within the military contributed to ending the U.S. war in Vietnam. Zinn compared the demand by a growing number of contemporary U.S. military families to end the war in Iraq to parallel demands [...] "in the Confederacy in the Civil War, when the wives of soldiers rioted because their husbands were dying and the plantation owners were profiting from the sale of cotton, refusing to grow grains for civilians to eat." ...|$|E
