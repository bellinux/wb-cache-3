40|$|A {{standard}} of practice {{is defined as}} the desired and achievable performance level against which actual performance can be judged; it provides a benchmark for evaluating acceptable performance levels. CSMLS Standards of Practice are designed to measure the accuracy and quality of individual performance and to provide the expectations associated with professionalism for <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technologists</b> (MLTs); they represent the minimum national standards in Canada. Provincial regulatory bodies, established under provincial statutes, also have specific, stringent standards of practice which govern disciplinary matters within their mandate and jurisdiction. Employers utilize both these provincial and national frameworks to establish specific workplace responsibilities and to develop job descriptions, policies and procedures. The CSMLS General Medical Technology Competency Profile establishes the scope of practice for <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technologists</b> in Canada; it restricts MLTs to performing only those duties specifically outlined within that competency profile. MLTs must skillfully perform laboratory procedures. They must know the theory behind laboratory analyses and understand associated clinical applications. They must be competent, demonstrate sound judgment and possess good interpretive skills. They must be able to adapt to evolving situations related to various tests and outcomes, must follow established laboratory methods and must adhere to relevant quality control protocols.

40|$|For years, {{the supply}} of health {{professionals}} has been characterized by "boom and bust" cycles. At times, planners have perceived an oversupply of healthcare providers and, at other times, a shortage. This case study of the <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technologist</b> occupation is a prime example. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the closure and reopening of the Medical Laboratory Science Program at BCIT and discuss the issues and lessons to be learned from the decision making criteria and process used. The health reforms of the 1990 ’s had a profound impact on medical laboratory technologists in British Columbia. There was a perceived surplus of technologists, a major shift in practice to highly automated core laboratory -based settings, an increase in the casualization of the workforce; and a workforce that was getting older. Monitoring and investigating the key forces in the demand for and supply of medical laboratory personnel provides useful insights into the future and better information for determining policy actions. However, the data collected by BCIT from employers on their projected hiring needs provided a limited picture. More information was needed. The story of the closure of the medical laboratory science program at BCIT is a cautionary tale with three important lessons. First, we rarely have good research evidence to support health human resources planning. Second, program discontinuance decisions are not easy to make. There are many stakeholders that need to be consulted and a complete environmental scan must be undertaken considering all internal and external factors. Third, there is still much work to be done in the efforts to improve decision making abilities of administrators to be more thorough in their data gathering and analysis. It is recommended that educational administrators adopt the Force Field Analysis model that encompasses the idea that forces both drive and restrain change. The diagram helps us picture the “tug-of-war” between the forces around any given issue. Because force-field analysis causes people to think about what works for and against the status quo it can be used to study existing problems, or to anticipate and plan more effectively for implementing change...|$|E

Of great concern to the healthcare profession and government agencies is the existing and increasing shortage of <b>Medical</b> <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Technologists</b> and Technicians. The purpose of this project was to analyze the viability of Laboratory Technician educational program and draft a curriculum proposal to prepare Laboratory Technicians at California Community Colleges. It was found that both National and State personnel shortages exist and the shortage is forecast to continue. The problem is compounded by the {{decline in the number of}} educational programs available to students who might wish to pursue this career. Fortunately, California recently passed a law and developed regulations permitting a two-tiered licensure for Laboratory Technicians (first level) and <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Technologist</b> (second level). The first level is ideally suited for educational programs of the state???s community colleges. The second level will remain the purview of the four year institutions. A foundation for program development has been established. First, two community colleges in the state have existing grand-fathered programs to serve as models.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{role of the}} Society of <b>Medical</b> <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Technologists</b> of South Africa (SMLTSA) is {{to promote}} and {{regulate}} the profession of <b>Medical</b> <b>Laboratory</b> Technology in South Africa (S. A.). The National board examinations for Intern Medical Technologists (MTIN) are co-ordinated by the SMLTSA {{on behalf of the}} Health Professional Council of South Africa (HPCSA). Passing these examinations is the qualifying criterion for a career in <b>Medical</b> <b>Laboratory</b> Technology. This qualification in Biomedical Technology is unique to S. A. and as such literature regarding the performances of MTIN in the National board examinations is very limited. Objective: No previous research has been conducted to investigate the performances of MTIN in the National board examinations. For that reason, the examination scores for the periods 2008 to 2012 were analysed for variances in mean scores of MTIN who did their internship at different training laboratories, and who studied at different Higher Educational Institutions (HEI’s) as well as results of MTIN from the province of Gauteng, who specialised in four different disciplines. An analysis of the pass rate for the country was also done. Method: The One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson Chi-square test were used to detect statistical significant differences in mean performance scores between these groups. Differences were considered significant at a p-value of < 0. 05 Results: Several statistical significant differences in performance scores between groups were uncovered. Conclusion: Statistical findings indicated poor overall performances in these examinations for the periods 2008 to 2012. It is therefore suggested that an in depth investigation be implemented into the suitability of higher education training and the adequacy of Internship programmes offered by training laboratories...|$|R

Studies had {{reported}} {{high rate of}} hepatitis B infection among hospital workers with low participation in vaccination programmes, especially those whose work exposes them {{to the risk of}} HBV infection. The study assessed knowledge of hepatitis B virus infection, risk perception, vaccination history, and challenges to control hepatitis among health workers. Methods. A descriptive cross-sectional study. Consenting health care workers completed a self-administered questionnaire that assessed respondents’ general knowledge of HBV, vaccination history and HBsAg status, risk perception, and challenges to control hepatitis. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results. Three hundred and eighty-two health care workers participated in the study. There were 182 males and 200 females. The respondents comprised 94 (25 %) medical doctors, 168 (44 %) nurses, 68 (18 %) <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technologists,</b> and 52 (14 %) pharmacists. Over 33 % had poor knowledge with 35 % not immunized against HBV. Predictors of good knowledge include age less than 35 years, male sex, being a medical doctor, previous HBsAg test, and complete HBV immunisation. Identified challenges to control hepatitis include lack of hospital policy (91. 6 %), poor orientation of newly employed health workers (75. 9 %), and low risk perception (74. 6 %). Conclusion.

40|$|Background: <b>Medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technologists</b> (MLTs) are {{required}} to gain credit for continuous professional development for relicensing {{as well as for}} their own career-long learning. International studies have shown that MLTs who undertake continuing medical education (CME) have improved productivity, enhanced professional flexibility and high work fulfilment. The time spent on CME is associated with professional competency. Previous national research has shown that attendance at CME programmes in Saudi Arabia is likely affected by demographic factors. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore the perceptions of MLTs towards CME activities and to predict factors that affect attendance. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was given to 103 <b>medical</b> <b>laboratory</b> professionals from the Security Forces Hospital as part of a cross-sectional descriptive study. Data were analysed using SPSS version 21. Results: The overall mean score was 3. 88 for the 103 questionnaires, indicating an affirmative perception of the CME programmes. Males in the age group 25 - 34 years accounted for 61. 2 % of responses. The preferred delivery modes for CME programmes were short courses and workshops (23 %) and higher education relevant courses (20 %). For those who had attended CME and those who had not, no significant difference was found in gender, age, field of specialty, education categories or working experience. Conclusion: Most laboratory technicians in our study reported favourable perceptions of CME programmes, feeling that they increased professional confidence and competency. We recommend that core competencies be integrated into credentialing using profession-specific CME in a workplace setting. In addition, MLTs should be involved in designing the programmes as well. Further studies in a multicentre institution are needed to analyse the difference in perception among those who have attended CME and those who have not...|$|R
