5|$|In 1909, the City of Bridgeport {{created a}} special {{commission}} {{to oversee the}} construction of a bridge at Congress Street. A local engineer, Raymond F. Stoddard was hired as design consultant and obtained the license to use the Scherzer design. A Scherzer rolling-lift bridge with a double-leaf bascule was chosen for construction. The design is a Deck-type plate girder bridge; using two plate girders to support the deck. The Scherzer bascule was a popular design because it avoided the expense of high-stress pivot bearings; though it requires stronger foundations to support the weight of the bridge's operation. The engineering firm, J. R. Worcester and Company designed and constructed the concrete-arch approach and Fort Pitt Bridge Works fabricated the <b>movable</b> <b>bridge.</b> The cost of construction was $300,000, which was offset through funding from the Connecticut Company. A contemporary account from the Hartford Courant gave stated the contract was for $305,000 to Snare, Tristo and Company. The bridge was opened to the public July 16, 1910.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the canal is just {{to the north of}} the river, and a public {{footpath}} follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road. The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the canal bridge has been filled in to protect its structure. There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church, parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries, with later additions. Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a water pipeline running from Tallington to West Deeping was installed. No details of the bridge have survived, but the levels suggest that it was probably a <b>movable</b> <b>bridge.</b> The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill, a water mill dating from around 1700, to reach Horse Holmes Lock. A railway line crossed the tail of the lock, but after the demise of the canal, the line was widened, and the lock is thought to be buried beneath the embankment.|$|E
5|$|The French gained {{access to}} the {{outermost}} ward by undermining its advanced main tower. Following this, Philip ordered a group of his men {{to look for a}} weak point in the castle. They {{gained access to}} the next ward when a soldier named Ralph found a latrine chute in use through which the French could clamber into the chapel. After ambushing several unsuspecting guards, and setting fire to the buildings, Philip's men then lowered the <b>movable</b> <b>bridge</b> and allowed the rest of their army into the castle. The Anglo-Norman troops retreated to the inner ward. After a short time the French successfully breached the gate of the inner ward, and the garrison retreated finally to the keep. With supplies running low Roger de Lacy and his garrison of 20knights and 120other soldiers surrendered to the French army, bringing the siege to an end on 6March 1204. In drawn-out medieval sieges, contemporary writers often emphasised the importance of dwindling supplies in the capitulation of the garrison, {{as was the case with}} the Siege of Château Gaillard. With the castle under French control, the main obstacle to the French entering the Seine valley was removed; they were able to enter the valley unmolested and take Normandy. Thus, for the first time since it had been given as a duchy to Rollo in 911, Normandy was directly ruled by the French king. The city of Rouen surrendered to Philip II on 23June 1204. After that, the rest of Normandy was easily conquered by the French.|$|E

40|$|Louisiana has {{approximately}} 160 <b>movable</b> <b>bridges,</b> {{mostly in}} the southern part of the state. This places Louisiana among the states with the highest inventory of <b>movable</b> <b>bridges</b> in the nation. The typical deck systems in these <b>movable</b> <b>bridges</b> are steel grids. Records show that steel grids have had maintenance issues. An alternative ultra-high/high performance concrete (UHPC/HPC) bridge deck system is proposed for Louisiana’s <b>movable</b> <b>bridges.</b> This system consists of precast waffle slab deck panels, which are reinforced with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars as positive moment reinforcement, and a two-way carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) mesh as top reinforcement. Several validated nonlinear finite element analyses were performed to simulate the behavior of the precast panels from the onset of loading to failure. It is concluded that the precast concrete waffle slabs provide a viable alternative to steel grids by supplying load capacities that surpass service level and ultimate level load demands and deflection capacities that are within code specified limits.

2500|$|Later {{improvements}} {{included the}} paving of the stretch between Cameron {{and the gap}} east of Grand Chenier during the late 1940s. [...] A <b>movable</b> <b>bridge</b> was constructed across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway at Forked Island by 1955, replacing a ferry service at that location. [...] The only alignment change to Route 292 occurred shortly before the 1955 renumbering. [...] The Calcasieu Ship Channel was cut across the route in the mid-1940s in order to bypass a sharp bend in the Calcasieu Pass at Cameron. [...] This created {{what became known as}} Monkey Island and made a second ferry crossing necessary for auto traffic heading into Cameron. [...] The situation was remedied around 1954 when the highway was re-routed to cross the pass at its present location. [...] The original alignment traversing Monkey Island remains in the state highway system today as LA1141.|$|E
2500|$|Paving of {{the route}} {{continued}} after the 1955 renumbering, extending south from Forked Island and west from Cameron. [...] Most of the work was completed by the mid-1960s. [...] The route {{on the east side}} of Pecan Island was shortened slightly by following the back ridge rather than the established road along the front ridge. [...] The last section of gravel road, located between Grand Chenier and Pecan Island, was hard surfaced around 1967. [...] The last ferry service on the Vermilion Parish portion of the highway was discontinued when a bridge was completed across the Schooner Bayou Canal (or Old Intracoastal Waterway) in 1965. [...] In 1976, the original <b>movable</b> <b>bridge</b> across the Intracoastal Waterway at Forked Island was replaced with the current high-level fixed span. [...] The location of the new bridge also allowed the straightening {{of the route}} through the area. [...] The most recent bridge replacement occurred in 2009 when a new fixed bridge was built spanning the Sabine Lake at the state line. [...] The original swing bridge had been damaged by Hurricanes Rita and Ike and was replaced with the help of federal relief funds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, {{the bridge}} debate arose again. In July 1992, fire, {{ambulance}} and police officials reported to Toronto City Council's land use committee that, without a bridge, {{it could take}} thirty minutes for emergency vehicles and personnel to fully respond to a crash of a fifty-person aircraft at the airport, using the ferry to transport all needed vehicles to the airport. However, the 1983 agreement banned a bridge. In October 1992, City Council approved a fixed link to the airport, and assigned planning commissioner Bob Millward {{to determine if a}} link or bridge would be required, and the associated costs, timing and approvals required. The committee reported in April 1993, suggesting a <b>movable</b> <b>bridge</b> was the best option, over a tunnel or ferries. The estimated cost of a bridge was $8 million versus over $30 million for a tunnel. Councillor John Adams, who was also a Harbour Commission member, that a fixed link would be [...] "good for the airport and good for the economy". The number of passengers who had used the airport in 1992 was 215,000, down from 400,000 in 1987. Opponents were concerned that the safety issue was a back-door to opening the agreement to allow jets. City Council rejected the bridge proposal 10–6 on May 3, 1993. That same year, Air Ontario cancelled its route to Newark due to lack of demand.|$|E

2500|$|Z'EV and Einstürzende Neubauten {{made several}} {{percussion}} instruments out of trash. No Wave artist Glenn Branca began building 3rd bridge zithers {{with an additional}} <b>movable</b> <b>bridge</b> positioned on the just intoned knotted positions of the harmonic series. Hans Reichel (Born 1949) is a German improvisational guitarist, luthier, and inventor. Reichel has constructed and built several variations of guitars and basses, most of them featuring multiple fretboards and unique positioning of pickups {{as well as the}} same indirect playing technique as Branca's instruments. The resulting sounds exceed the range of conventional tuning and add interesting effects, from odd overtones to metallic noises. Later he invented his Daxophone, where he's most famous for. His Daxophone consists of a single wooden blade fixed in a block containing a contact microphone. Normally, it is played by bowing the free end, {{but it can also be}} struck or plucked, which propagates sound in the same way a ruler halfway off a table does. These vibrations then continue to the wooden-block base, which in turn is amplified by the contact microphone(s) therein. A wide range of voice-like timbres can be produced, depending on the shape of the instrument, the type of wood, where it is bowed, and where along its length it is stopped with a separate block of wood (fretted on one side) called the [...] "dax." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Bagatelles, bagatelles," [...] {{said the}} priest pensively; but he rose with greater spirit {{than he had}} yet shown, and preceded the consul into the little room that served him for a smithy. It seemed from some peculiarities of shape to have once been an oratory, but it was now begrimed with smoke and dust from the forge which Don Ippolito had set up in it; the embers of a recent fire, the bellows, the pincers, the hammers, and the other {{implements}} of the trade, gave it a sinister effect, as if the place of prayer had been invaded by mocking imps, or as if some hapless mortal in contract with the evil powers were here searching, by {{the help of the}} adversary, for the forbidden secrets of the metals and of fire. In those days, Ferris was an uncompromising enemy of the theatricalization of Italy, or indeed of anything; but the fancy of the black-robed young priest at work in this place appealed to him all the more potently because of the sort of tragic innocence which seemed to characterize Don Ippolito's expression. He longed intensely to sketch the picture then and there, but he had strength to rebuke the fancy as something that could not make itself intelligible without the help of such accessories as he despised, and he victoriously followed the priest into his larger workshop, where his inventions, complete and incomplete, were stored, and where he had been seated when his visitor arrived. The high windows and the frescoed ceiling were festooned with dusty cobwebs; litter of shavings and whittlings strewed the floor; mechanical implements and contrivances were everywhere, and Don Ippolito's listlessness seemed to return upon him again {{at the sight of the}} familiar disorder. Conspicuous among other objects lay the illogically unsuccessful model of the new principle of steam propulsion, untouched since the day when he had lifted it out of the canal and carried it indoors through the ranks of grinning spectators. From a shelf above it he took down models of a flying-machine and a perpetual motion. [...] "Fantastic researches in the impossible. I never expected results from these experiments, with which I nevertheless once pleased myself," [...] he said, and turned impatiently to various pieces of portable furniture, chairs, tables, bedsteads, which by folding up their legs and tops condensed themselves into flat boxes, developing handles at the side for convenience in carrying. They were painted and varnished, and were in all respects complete; they had indeed won favorable mention at an exposition of the Provincial Society of Arts and Industries, and Ferris could applaud their ingenuity sincerely, though he had his tacit doubts of their usefulness. He fell silent again when Don Ippolito called his notice to a photographic camera, so contrived with straps and springs that you could snatch by its help whatever joy there might be in taking your own photograph; and he did not know what to say of a submarine boat, a four-wheeled water- velocipede, a <b>movable</b> <b>bridge,</b> or the very many other principles and ideas to which Don Ippolito's cunning hand had given shape, more or less imperfect. It seemed to him that they all, however perfect or imperfect, had some fatal defect: they were aspirations toward the impossible, or realizations of the trivial and superfluous. Yet, for all this, they strongly appealed to the painter as the stunted fruit of a talent denied opportunity, instruction, and sympathy. As he looked from them at last to the questioning face of the priest, and considered out of what disheartened and solitary patience they must have come in this city,--dead hundreds of years to all such endeavor,--he could not utter some glib phrases of compliment that he had on his tongue. If Don Ippolito had been taken young, he might perhaps have amounted to something, though this was questionable; but at thirty--as he looked now,--with his undisciplined purposes, and his head full of vagaries of which these things were the tangible witness.... Ferris let his eyes drop again. They fell upon the ruin of the breech-loading cannon, and he said, [...] "Don Ippolito, it's very good of you to take the trouble of showing me these matters, and I hope you'll pardon the ungrateful return, if I cannot offer any definite opinion of them now. They are rather out of my way, I confess. I wish with all my heart I could order an experimental, life-size copy of your breech-loading cannon here, for trial by my government, but I can't; and to tell you the truth, it was not altogether the wish to see these inventions of yours that brought me here to-day." ...|$|E
