The combination of the fingerprinting analysis of both edges yields detailed quantitative information on the reaction products during decomposition, an issue of crucial importance in determining whether Mg(BH 4) (2) {{can be used as}} a next-generation hydrogen storage material. This work reveals the formation of reaction intermediate(s) at 300 degrees C, accompanied by a significant hydrogen release without the occurrence of stable boron compounds such as amorphous boron or MgB 12 H 12. At temperatures between 300 degrees C and 400 degrees C, further hydrogen release proceeds via the formation of higher boranes and crystalline MgH 2. Above 400 degrees C, decomposition into the constituting elements takes place. Therefore, at moderate temperatures, Mg(BH 4) (2) is shown to be a promising high-density hydrogen storage material with great potential for reversible energy storage applications...|$|R

This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} nutritional state {{and the reasons for}} PN individualization in pediatric patients using PN hospitalized in a tertiary hospital in Campinas, São Paulo. This longitudinal study comprised patients using PN followed by up to 67 days. Nutritional status was classified according to the criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO) (2006) and WHO (2007). The levels of the following elements on blood were analyzed: sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, chloride, magnesium, inorganic phosphorus and triglycerides (TGL). Among the criteria for individualization, were considered undeniable: significant reduction in blood levels of potassium (< 3 mEq/L), sodium (< 125 mEq/) <b>L,</b> <b>magnesium</b> (< 1 mEq/L), phosphorus (< 1. 5 mEq/L), ionic calcium (< 1 mmol) and chloride (< 90 mEq/L) or any value above the references.

It was observed that 74 / 254 (29. 2 %) of examinations demanded individualized PN by indubitable reasons. The nutritional state of patients was considered critical in most cases. Thus, the individualization performed in the beginning of PN for energy protein adequacy was indispensable.

40|$|We have {{previously}} described a microarray approach {{to identify and}} clone genes from mutants of higher organisms. In the method cDNA of two mutants with similar phenotype are competitively hybridized to DNA clones arrayed on a glass slide. Clones corresponding to an mRNA that is not expressed {{in one of the}} strains due to a mutation will be specifically highlighted in the hybridization, which provides a possibility to identify and eventually clone the mutated gene. The approach is dependent on mutations that affect the amount of mRNA. Nonsense mutations, which prematurely terminate translation, can be such mutations as a surveillance system known as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) has been developed by organisms to reduce the abundance of mRNA with nonsense codons. In the present study, we have analysed the barley (Hordeum vulgare <b>L.)</b> <b>magnesium</b> chelatase mutants xantha-f 26, xantha-f 27 and xantha-f 40 in order to investigate the presence of NMD in barley, as well as the importance of the position of the stop codon for NMD.

Systemic lidocaine and magnesium reduce pain hypersensitivity to surgical stimuli; however, their effects after mastectomy have not been evaluated clearly. In this prospective, double-blind, clinical trial, 126 female patients undergoing mastectomy {{were randomly assigned to}} lidocaine (<b>L),</b> <b>magnesium</b> (M), and control (C) groups. Lidocaine and magnesium were administered at 2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg for 15 minutes immediately after induction, followed by infusions of 2 mg/kg/h and 20 mg/kg/h, respectively. The control group received the same volume of saline. Patient characteristics, perioperative parameters, and postoperative recovery profiles, including the Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR- 40) survey, pain scales, length of hospital stay, and the short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ) at postoperative 1 month and 3 months were evaluated. The global QoR- 40 scores on postoperative day 1 were significantly higher in group L than in group C (P = 0. 003). Moreover, in sub-scores of the QoR- 40 dimensions, emotional state and pain scores were significantly higher in group L than those in groups M and C (P = 0. 027 and 0. 023, respectively). At postoperative 3 months, SF-MPQ and SF-MPQ-sensitive scores were significantly lower in group L than in group C (P = 0. 046 and 0. 036, respectively).

40|$|Ab s t r a c t. The {{objective}} of the work {{was to determine the}} content of magnesium in plants of Trifolium pratense L. which grew in an environment contaminated with aluminium or copper. The growth and development of the plants was carried out in hydroponics, with strictly controlled composition and pH of the growth medium. Copper was added to the medium (as an additional application) in a solution of CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O, and aluminium {{in the form of a}} solution of AlCl 3, at concentrations of Al+ 3 and Cu+ 2 of 20 and 100 mg dm- 3. The concentration of magnesium, aluminium and cooper was determined by means of a ICP sequential emission spectrometer D- 820 Hilger Analytical (UK) in extracts from the roots and aboveground parts. Decreasing pH of the medium did not cause any statistically significant changes in the concentration of the metals studied. There was a significant increase in the concentration of aluminium and copper in roots and aboveground parts of Trifolium pratense <b>L.</b> and lower <b>magnesium</b> concentration for plants that were grown in an environment contaminated with Al+ 3 / Cu+ 2 at a concentration of 100 mg dm- 3.

40|$|CONTEXT: Contrasting {{findings}} have been published regarding the role of magnesium sulphate used as an additive to local anaesthetics in peripheral nerve blocks. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effect of magnesium sulphate on nerve excitability. SETTING: C and Aβ compound action potentials were recorded extracellularly in vitro in saphenous nerves from adult rats. ANIMALS: Saphenous nerves (n =  30) from male Wistar rats (n =  19), 12 to 16 weeks old. INTERVENTION: Primary sensory afferents were tested with a computerised threshold tracking program (QTRAC) with a supramaximal 1  ms current pulse either alone or after 300  ms of conditioning polarising ramp currents in the presence and absence of 10  mmol <b>l</b> <b>magnesium</b> sulphate, 80  μmol l lidocaine and a combination of both. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in current thresholds to elicit compound action potential amplitudes of 40 % of the maximal response. RESULTS: Magnesium sulphate increased excitability thresholds {{to a greater extent}} in Aβ fibres than in C fibres. It enhanced the effects of lidocaine in both Aβ fibres [mixture 0. 470  mA (SD 0. 105) versus lidocaine 0. 358  mA (SD 0. 080), P <  0. 001] and C fibres [mixture 2. 531  mA (SD 0. 752) versus lidocaine 2. 385  mA (SD 0. 656), P =  0. 008]. Preconditioning experiments also showed that magnesium sulphate had an enhancing effect with lidocaine in Aβ fibres [mixture 0. 620  mA (SD 0. 281) versus lidocaine 0. 543  mA (SD 0. 315), P =  0. 005], but not in C fibres [mixture 2. 412  mA (SD 0. 641), lidocaine 2. 461  mA (SD 0. 693), P =  0. 17]. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the binding of magnesium ions depends on both the type and conformational state of voltage-gated sodium channels. They also may help to explain the conflicting reports regarding the clinical effects of magnesium sulphate as an additive to lidocaine in peripheral nerve blocks...|$|R

40|$|The transbilayer {{distribution}} of exogenous phospholipids incorporated into human erythrocytes is monitored through cell morphology changes {{and by the}} extraction of incorporated 14 C-labeled lipids. Dilauroylphosphatidylserine (DLPS) and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) transfer spontaneously from sonicated unilamellar vesicles to erythrocytes, inducing a discocyte-to-echinocyte shape change within 5 min. DLPC-induced echinocytes revert slowly (t 1 / 2 approximately 8 h) to discocytes, but DLPS-treated cells revert rapidly (10 - 20 min) to discocytes and then become invaginate stomatocytes. The {{second phase of the}} phosphatidylserine (PS) -induced shape change, conversion of echinocytes to stomatocytes, can be inhibited by blocking cell protein sulfhydryl groups or by depleting intracellular ATP or <b>magnesium</b> (Daleke, D. <b>L.,</b> and W. H. Huestis. 1985. Biochemistry. 24 : 5406 - 5416). These cell shape changes are consistent with incorporation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PS into the membrane outer monolayer followed by selective and energy-dependent translocation of PS to the membrane inner monolayer. This hypothesis is explored by correlating cell shape with the fraction of the exogenous lipid accessible to extraction into phospholipid vesicles. Upon exposure to recipient vesicles, DLPC-induced echinocytes revert to discoid forms within 5 min, concomitant with the removal of most (88 %) of the radiolabeled lipid. On further incubation, 97 % of the foreign PC transfers to recipient vesicles. Treatment of DLPS-induced stomatocytes with acceptor vesicles extracts foreign PS only partially (22 %) and does not affect cell shape significantly. Cell treated with inhibitors of aminophospholipid translocation (sulfhydryl blockers or intracellular magnesium depletion) and then incubated with either DLPS or DLPC become echinocytic and do not revert to discocytic or stomatocytic shape for many hours. On treatment with recipient vesicles, these echinocytes revert to discocytes in both cases, with concomitant extraction of 88 - 99 % of radiolabeled PC and 86 - 97 % of radiolabeled PS. The accessibility of exogenous lipids to extraction is uniformly consistent with the transbilayer lipid distribution inferred from cell shape changes, indicating that red cell morphology is an accurate and sensitive reporter of the transbilayer partitioning of incorporated exogenous phospholipids...|$|R
