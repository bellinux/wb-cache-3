40|$|We {{present the}} results of SCUBA 2 {{observations}} at 450 <b>micron</b> and 850 <b>micron</b> of the field lensed by the massive cluster A 370. With a total survey area > 100 arcmin 2 and 1 sigma sensitivities of 3. 92 and 0. 82 mJy/beam at 450 and 850 <b>micron</b> respectively, we find a secure sample of 20 sources at 450 <b>micron</b> and 26 sources at 850 <b>micron</b> with a signal-to-noise ratio > 4. Using the latest lensing model of A 370 and Monte Carlo simulations, we derive the number counts at both wavelengths. The 450 <b>micron</b> number counts probe a factor of four deeper than the counts recently obtained from the Herschel Space Telescope at similar wavelengths, and we estimate that ~ 47 - 61 % of the 450 <b>micron</b> extragalactic background light (EBL) resolved into individual sources with 450 <b>micron</b> fluxes greater than 4. 5 mJy. The faint 450 <b>micron</b> sources in the 4 sigma sample have positional accuracies of 3 arcseconds, while brighter sources (signal-to-noise > 6 sigma) are good to 1. 4 arcseconds. Using the deep radio map (1 sigma ~ 6 uJy) {{we find that the}} percentage of submillimeter sources having secure radio counterparts is 85 % for 450 <b>micron</b> sources with intrinsic fluxes > 6 mJy and 67 % for 850 <b>micron</b> sources with intrinsic fluxes > 4 mJy.

The sample straddles a metallicity of 12 +log(O/H) ~ 8. 0, a transition point below which PAH intensity empirically drops and the character of the interstellar medium changes. We derive quantitative radiances of PAH features and atomic lines on both global and spatially-resolved scales. The Spitzer spectra, combined with extensive ancillary data from the UV through the mid-infrared, allow us to examine changes in the physical environments and in PAH feature radiances down to a physical scale of 50 pc. We discuss correlations between various PAH emission feature and atomic line radiances. The (6. 2 <b>micron)</b> /(11. 3 <b>micron),</b> (7. 7 <b>micron)</b> /(11. 3 <b>micron),</b> (8. 6 <b>micron)</b> /(11. 3 <b>micron),</b> (7. 7 <b>micron)</b> /(6. 2 <b>micron),</b> and (8. 6 <b>micron)</b> /(6. 2 <b>micron)</b> PAH radiance ratios are found to be independent of position across all three galaxies, although the ratios do vary from galaxy to galaxy. As seen in other galaxies, we find no variation in the grain size distribution as a function of local radiation field strength. Absolute PAH feature intensities as measured by a ratio of PAH/(24 <b>micron)</b> radiances are seen to vary both positionally within a given galaxy, and from one galaxy to another when integrated over the full observed extent of each system. We examine direct comparisons of CC mode PAH ratios (7. 7 <b>micron)</b> /(6. 2 <b>micron)</b> and (8. 6 <b>micron)</b> /(6. 2 <b>micron)</b> to the mixed (CC/CH) mode PAH ratio (7. 7 <b>micron)</b> /(11. 3 <b>micron).</b> We find little variation in either mode, and no difference in trends between modes.

25|$|For {{a period}} {{following}} {{the second world}} war, pure nickel was electroplated as a lining to copper cookware.

Copper cookware with aged or damaged nickel linings is eligible for retinning, or possibly replating with nickel, although this service is difficult if not impossible to find in the US and Europe in the early 21st century.
