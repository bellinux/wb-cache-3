In 2005 Students in the Write was created for second grade students at Morse Elementary School in Tarrytown, NY. [...] By providing students with an authentic audience, teachers noticed significantly increased motivation to write. Students were also found to improve fluency and listening skills. On 21 February 2006, Lance Anderson (Verge of the Fringe), Dr. Chris Smith (the Naked Scientist), Nigel Paice and Debbie McGowan took part in the first podcast forum at Cambridge University.
