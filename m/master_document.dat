50|$|The writer would insert {{placeholders}} {{delimited by}} ampersands into the <b>master</b> <b>document,</b> e.g., &TITLE&, &INITIAL&, &SURNAME&, &ADDRESS1&. In each {{copy of the}} letter the placeholders would be replaced with strings read from the DAT file. Mass mailings could thereby be prepared with each letter copy individually addressed.|$|E

50|$|Typically, large {{documents}} were composed of Chapters, with each chapter {{in a separate}} file. These files were then referenced by a <b>master</b> <b>document</b> file, thereby concatenating numerous components into a single large source document. The master file typically also defined styles (such as fonts and margins) and declared macros like MakeSection shown above; macros had limited programmatic features. From that single concatenated source, Scribe computed chapter numbers, page numbers, and cross-references.|$|E
5000|$|DocBook {{files are}} used to prepare output files {{in a wide variety}} of formats. Nearly always, this is {{accomplished}} using DocBook XSL stylesheets. These are XSLT stylesheets that transform DocBook documents into a number of formats (HTML, XSL-FO for later conversion into PDF, etc.). These stylesheets can be sophisticated enough to generate tables of contents, glossaries, and indexes. They can oversee the selection of particular designated portions of a <b>master</b> <b>document</b> to produce different versions of the same document (such as a [...] "tutorial" [...] or a [...] "quick-reference guide", where each of these consist of a subset of the material). Users can write their own customized stylesheets or even a full-fledged program to process the DocBook into an appropriate output format as their needs dictate.|$|E
5000|$|A key {{new feature}} of the Finale 2007 release was an {{integrated}} [...] "linked" [...] score and part management system. A properly-set-up [...] "full score for extraction" [...] could now contain all the data and formatting necessary to generate {{a full set of}} linked ensemble parts, ensconced within a single Finale <b>master</b> <b>document.</b> Limitations on the scope of format and layout control between parts and conductor score (including measure numbers and staff system breaks) suggested that this new feature was targeted to media production work, where quick turnaround and accuracy is a crucial factor, rather than publishing, though publishers still may use some aspects of linked parts to improve the part creation process. The 2007 release was a Universal binary, and runs natively on both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs.|$|E

40|$|Instructions {{for using}} the {{assignment}} templates There are templates for the assignment answers for Word which will be emailed. Using these templates can save you some time in preparing the assignment answers. (This is a very simple example of templates as discussed in Lecture 6. 1.) A template includes the assignment title, section headings where appropriate, and all worksheets. In one easy procedure you can personalize all templates so that each already has your name and mailbox number. The templates are intended for use with a word processor. If you wish, you can also print them out and then type or handwrite; before printing adjust the space between section headings. One <b>master</b> <b>document</b> allows for inserting your name into all templates at once. In word processing terminology, a <b>master</b> <b>document</b> {{is a collection of}} subdocuments (in this case one subdocument for each assignment template). You personalize the templates in the <b>master</b> <b>document</b> (applying a global change to the whole <b>master</b> <b>document)</b> and extract the individual assignment templates using the procedure described below. Instructions for creating the templates Word 1. Create a folder on your hard disk and move the attachment there. Then extract all files to that folder. Do not just double-click to extract the files. You need to use a process (depending on your computer) that gives you an option Extract to ____ _; there you need to type {{in the name of the}} folder you created or select it from a pop-up window. On some systems, right-clicking on the zip file and then clicking on Extract All will get you there. 2. Open the document master. doc. Click on View, then on Outline, in the Outline Toolbar click on the icon Expand Subdocuments. (Mouse over the buttons in the toolbar and watch the tool tips.)

3000|$|... “Initial {{qualification}} and periodic qualification {{should be}} planned in the <b>master</b> <b>document</b> describing each automated module. Initial qualification should include IQ, OQ and PQ. IQ {{should include the}} verification of the designed module specifications, the check of installed instrumentation and the integration of working and maintenance instructions in the <b>master</b> <b>document</b> of the module. The functionalities of the automated module without reagents nor chemical components should be checked during OQ, which should also include: i) a verification of the software user access policy, {{with reference to the}} different possible level of privileges (e.g. administrators usually have the right to modify any parameters, sequences, methods, etc., while operators should have the possibility to run dispensing programs only); ii) a verification of the software sequences, if applicable; iii) a verification of the possible effects of a general power failure (e.g. to check for the presence and / or the need for an UPS; iv) a verification of the calibration status of the major components; v) a verification of data backup and restore. If the module is a commercial one, the user should ask the supplier to perform a qualification according to internal procedures or to propose a procedure to be performed by the user. If the module is custom made, the user should check that all functionalities, defined in the URS document, meet the specifications included in the <b>master</b> <b>document</b> describing the module. This should include the movement of actuators and the calibration status of the probes (temperature, pressure, and radioactivity). PQ of the module should be conducted by performing three complete runs of a representative process covering all normal operations for the concerned preparation process. For example, a module including a preparative chromatographic system should be qualified selecting a RP preparation process which includes a chromatographic purification. PQ should demonstrate that the module is suitable for the intended application in real conditions of use.|$|E

Specifically, we analyze annotating heterogeneous documents containing tables {{to obtain a}} formalized XML <b>Master</b> <b>document</b> that improves traceability (hence easing verification and update) and enables manipulation using XSLT stylesheets. This approach is useful when table instances far outnumber distinct table types because the effort required to annotate a table instance is relatively less compared to formalizing table processing that respects table’s semantics. This work is also relevant for authoring new documents with tables that should be accessible to both humans and machines...|$|E
40|$|There {{are a lot}} of {{research}} document types, {{and one of them is}} the <b>master’s</b> degree research <b>document.</b> When the student is doing his <b>master’s</b> degree <b>document,</b> he has to do a lot {{of research}}, search for a problem and provide the solution for that problem. Also he has to do an experiment for his thesis. All of the results and how it was achieved has to be written in the research <b>document.</b> <b>Masters</b> research <b>document</b> preparation is one of the more difficult tasks for the students. Like all of the research papers, there are certain specific requirements for each type. Also the structure depends for which semester the document is prepared for. Most of the students find that this is their first experience writing these kinds of documents. The common structure guidelines for the documents are not enough, because the content of the documents are very tightly linked to the student’s thesis, and its parameters: object, area, problem, solution. Because there {{are a lot of}} different theses in the information engineering area, it is hard for the students to create the primary research paper structure and content, only relying on the common guidelines given by the lecturers. Our proposed solution – a system, which would suggest a document structure and generate the research document primary version, provide comments, template phrases for specific sections of the document, e. g. writing the conclusion. Also the system will try to speed up the writing process, by providing with additional tools for writing the summary, glossary and the list of literature...|$|R

40|$|Teaching {{materials}} such as study guides have implicit structure that can be exploited to explicitly assist in the learning and teaching process. Document technologies specific to the teaching context generate visible structures and linkages in a consistent manner across multiple course materials. We describe techniques that: • Create, manage and validate links between the learning objectives, content related to each objective and corresponding assessment task. • Explicitly present relationships between concepts, as a concept map, related to unit content and external study resources. • Treat various study resources (study guide, presentation slides) as consistent views. • Facilitate the use of external media to support multiple modalities. The process creates teaching content as a single <b>master</b> <b>document</b> which is annotated to: identify learning outcomes associated with topics and exercises, relationships between concepts covered, references to external resources and media, as well as summary points and keywords. Different views of this <b>master</b> <b>document</b> produce the range of course documentation. Examples of documents include: a study guide with learning outcomes linked to content, concept maps providing a graphical view of key relationships, and presentation slides that generate visual mnemonics for important topics. While this structure simplifies formatting of learning materials it also offers additional benefits to the teacher. Reports are generated showing that all outcomes are covered and assessed.    Explicitly annotating and visualizing concepts allows the lecturer {{to ensure that all}} elements fall within a single scaffold. Simplified access to external media encourages alternative presentation modalities and produces presentations that are easily adapted to new themes...|$|E

Documentation of changes to the maintenance requirements needs to be mandated and based on updates to the existing <b>master</b> <b>document.</b> A consequence of our view is that a dynamic process is required in organisations for the review of maintenance requirements analysis.
