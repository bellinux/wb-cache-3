5|$|Baltic German {{astronomer}} Hermann Struve {{used the}} observed {{changes in the}} orbits of the Martian moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet's oblate shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. This result was confirmed by American <b>meteorologist</b> Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meteorologists</b> are {{scientists}} who study meteorology. The American Meteorological Society published and continually updates an authoritative electronic Meteorology Glossary. <b>Meteorologists</b> work in government agencies, private consulting and research services, industrial enterprises, utilities, {{radio and television}} stations, and in education.

5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by <b>meteorologist</b> George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{research}} complied by <b>meteorologist</b> and tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis, the New Richmond Tornado was the first determined F/EF5 in American history to cause a death toll exceeding 100, as the rating for the Natchez tornado has never been officially determined and the St. Louis-East St. Louis tornado ranked as only an F/EF4. In addition, the Amite-Purvis, 1908 Dixie tornado outbreak and Gainesville, 1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak tornadoes have also both been classified as only F/EF4 tornadoes, making the New Richmond Tornado the fifth deadliest F/EF5 in American history.|$|E
5|$|At one time, one {{hurricane}} researcher {{identified a}} tropical storm over Cuba in late August, {{although there was no}} evidence the storm actually existed. There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October22, although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season. There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. <b>Meteorologist</b> Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the formal}} start of naming, {{tropical}} cyclones were often named after places, objects, or saints' feast days {{on which they}} occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government <b>Meteorologist</b> Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the <b>meteorologist</b> as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the <b>meteorologist</b> in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.|$|E

We found that even though weather is an extremely dynamic domain, expert <b>meteorologists</b> examined very few animations, exam-ining primarily static images.

5|$|Several {{days prior}} to Fabian {{striking}} Bermuda, computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane {{to the west of}} the island by 200miles (320km). Not expected to be a direct threat, a <b>meteorologist</b> at the Bermuda Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to Bermuda, and 35hours before Fabian made its closest approach, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. When a track near Bermuda became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued for the island, approximately 29hours before Fabian made a direct hit on the island.|$|E
5|$|The 1868 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was among the}} quietest on record, with only four tropical cyclones recorded. Only three seasons had fewer storms than in 1868, and seven had {{the same number of}} storms. Initially, there were no known storms during the season, although a re-analysis confirmed the activity. All tropical activity occurred within a 45‑day span. There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. <b>Meteorologist</b> Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|The 1869 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the earliest {{season in the}} Atlantic hurricane database in which {{there were at least}} ten tropical cyclones. Initially there were only three known storms in the year, but additional research uncovered the additional storms. <b>Meteorologist</b> Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms may remain missing from the official database for each season in this era, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines. All activity occurred in a three-month period between the middle of August and early October.|$|E
