Club that a major inspiration behind the premise of the series derives from his lack of college experiences: [...] "I had this very small slice of an understanding of how college life is. To me, it's high school for adults, and I guess I'm depicting it that way. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>is</b> a professor. ... I'm around professors, but I'm kind of misinformed a bit. My information is broken and that's what makes China wonky and interesting, because it's what's so fucking wrong about college." [...] Similarly, in the series, Neely parodies popular culture elements that he knows only through passing mentions. The season two episode, [...] "The Diamond Castle", parodies the Mad Men episode, [...] "The Other Woman", which Neely stated he had never watched before; he explained that [...] "We do that often where we'll just take my ignorance and run with it." [...] The A.V. Club interview also has Neely describe aspects of the series inspired by his Arkansan upbringing; he admits that he [...] "talk about [...] all the time, it turns out. The final episode of the season is about hog infestation. It's happening all over southern United States, where wild boars are just overpopulating—they tear up the land and land owners and cattle ranchers have to hunt these things and put Kevlar vests on their dogs because they have horns and shit." ...|$|E
