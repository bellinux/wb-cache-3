5|$|The uterine cycle {{has three}} phases: <b>menses,</b> proliferative, secretory.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the <b>menses</b> carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold <b>menses,</b> the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease {{is more likely}} to reoccur when there is a prior history of the infection, recent sexual contact, recent onset of <b>menses,</b> or an IUD (intrauterine device) in place or if the partner has a sexually transmitted infection.|$|E
50|$|In {{his first}} {{re-election}} campaign in 2014, Huffman dominated the open primary, receiving 67.9% {{of the vote}} against 22.3% for second-place finisher Dale <b>Mensing,</b> a Republican. Huffman went on to defeat <b>Mensing</b> in the fall general election by 75 to 25%. The 2016 results were similar, with Huffman receiving 68.3% of the primary vote against 15.7% for <b>Mensing,</b> who again finished second, and defeating <b>Mensing</b> {{in the general election}} by 76.5% to 23.5%.|$|R
60|$|Inst., Prox., Ult. These {{abbreviations}} of instante <b>mense</b> (in {{the present}} month), proximo <b>mense</b> (in the next month) and ultimo <b>mense</b> (in the last month), are serviceable enough in commercial correspondence, but, like A.M., P.M. {{and many other}} contractions of Latin words, could profitably be spared from literature.|$|R
50|$|Miodrag Krivokapic, Richard Offiong, Stuart Elliott and Simon <b>Mensing</b> are {{examples}} of players that have played for both clubs, with <b>Mensing</b> being transferred directly from Motherwell to Hamilton.|$|R
5|$|The child's sex can be {{influenced}} by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the <b>menses,</b> so if a man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The father's semen and the mother's <b>menses</b> have {{movements}} that encode their parental characteristics. The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define the form or eidos of the species, while {{the movements of}} both the father's and the mother's uniform parts define features other than the form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape.|$|E
5|$|Again thick urine, the {{sediment}} from which is white, indicates that pain and disease {{are to be}} apprehended {{in the region of}} joints or viscera... Joint troubles in the hands and feet are very frequent and persistent, such as occur in cases of podagra and cheiragra. These seldom attack eunuchs or boys before coition with a woman, or women except those in whom the <b>menses</b> have become suppressed... some have obtained lifelong security by refraining from wine, mead and venery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mensing</b> {{moved from}} Motherwell to local rivals Hamilton Academical on a three-month loan deal in September 2007, after finding it {{difficult}} to progress beyond being a squad player. After extending the deal for an additional month Hamilton then signed <b>Mensing</b> permanently on 18 January 2008. He won promotion to the Scottish Premier League with the Accies in 2007-08 as Division One champions. <b>Mensing</b> was banned for a month in 2011 for testing for a banned substance methylhexaneamine. The positive urine test was taken after the game against Aberdeen on 29 December. He missed five games for Hamilton in total. <b>Mensing</b> revealed that the substance was in a dietary supplement he had been taking purchased of the high street and he had taken advise before taking and believed there to be no banned substances in it. Hamilton and <b>Mensing</b> only revealed details of the ban after it had been served. He was banned between 29 January and 28 February 2011. Despite the ban, <b>Mensing</b> maintain his innocent for testing for a banned substance methylhexaneamine. <b>Mensing</b> left Hamilton after season 2011-12 after spending five years at the club.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Carolina RailHawks, <b>Mensing</b> {{signed for}} Scottish League One club Airdrieonians on 27 January 2017, {{in a deal}} {{until the end of}} the 2016-17 season. After 17 {{appearances}} for the club, <b>Mensing</b> was released in May 2017.|$|R
25|$|Spernuntur <b>mense,</b> plus gaudet dum ferit ense.|$|R
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's <b>menses,</b> which Aristotle compares with how rennet (an enzyme from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in cheesemaking. This forms the embryo; {{it is then}} {{developed}} {{by the action of}} the pneuma (literally, breath or spirit) in the semen. The pneuma first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The pneuma then makes the other organs develop.|$|E
5|$|Very little flow (less than 10 ml) {{is called}} hypomenorrhea. Regular cycles with {{intervals}} of 21 days or fewer are polymenorrhea; frequent but irregular menstruation {{is known as}} metrorrhagia. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed menorrhagia. Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is menometrorrhagia. The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is oligomenorrhea. Amenorrhea refers to more than {{three to six months}} without <b>menses</b> (while not being pregnant) during a woman's reproductive years.|$|E
5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of <b>menses</b> (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as hot flashes and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E

5000|$|The name Mangengenge {{derives from}} the Lingala word kongenge, which means [...] "shining". The {{mountain}} was first called Mabangu or Manguel until 1866, then Pic <b>Mense</b> from 1867, in honor of Carl <b>Mense</b> (1861—1938 [...] ), who with Hans von Schwerin, was the first European to climb the mountain.|$|R
2500|$|However {{historian}} Raymond C. <b>Mensing,</b> {{notes that}} Rhodes has the reputation [...] {{as the most}} flamboyant exemplar of the British imperial spirit, and always believed that British institutions were the best. <b>Mensing</b> argues that Rhodes quietly developed a more nuanced concept of imperial federation in Africa and that his mature views were more balanced and realistic. Rhodes was not a biological or maximal racist. Despite his support for what {{became the basis for}} the apartheid system, he is best seen as a cultural or minimal racist, according to <b>Mensing.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Menses</b> should cease within 5 {{months of}} {{testosterone}} therapy (often sooner). If bleeding continues past 5 months, transgender men are strongly encouraged {{to see a}} gynecologist.|$|E
25|$|In most girls, {{menarche}} {{does not}} mean that ovulation has occurred. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year. Regular ovulation is usually indicated by predictable and consistent intervals between <b>menses,</b> predictable and consistent durations of <b>menses,</b> and predictable and consistent patterns of flow (e.g., heaviness or cramping). Continuing ovulation typically requires a body fat content of at least 22%. An anthropological term for this state of potential fertility is nubility.|$|E
50|$|After being {{released}} by Hamilton Academical, <b>Mensing</b> went on trial with Morton {{for most of}} the summer 2012 pre-season, and played as a trialist in a 1-1 draw with his former club Hamilton. On 14 September 2012, <b>Mensing</b> signed for Raith Rovers on a one-year contract despite Hamilton offering him a new contract. On his debut against Airdrie United, he got the man of the match award and his performance was praised by manager Grant Murray. <b>Mensing</b> scored his first goal for Raith Rovers in a 4-4 draw with fife neighbours Cowdenbeath.|$|R
