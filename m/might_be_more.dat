Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of nihonium has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine the volatility of nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas. However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> desirable for future experiments.|$|E
