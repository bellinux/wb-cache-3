In December of that year, the Captain General visited and dined with the company to commemorate her Golden Jubilee as Captain General.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 16 September, the {{military}} parade participants march to the Zocalo to take their places. Since 2013 a card stunt formation also {{is part of the}} parade proper, showing delicate pictures and human graphics. Musical accompaniment is provided by the buglers, (since 2013) cavalry and artillery trumpeters and drummers <b>of</b> the <b>Massed</b> Corps <b>of</b> <b>Drums</b> <b>of</b> the Mexican Army and the massed military bands and combined choirs from both the Secretariats of National Defense and the Navy.|$|R

50|$|The parade since 2010 {{starts with}} the President of Mexico, the First Lady, the National Defense and Navy Secretaries, commanders {{of the armed forces}} and the Federal Police, the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and the President of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation walking towards the {{national}} flagpole in the Zócalo to raise the large Flag of Mexico. It is raised first to the Toque de Bandera by the drummers and buglers <b>of</b> the <b>massed</b> Corps <b>of</b> <b>Drums</b> and later with the massed military bands, together with the choirs of the National Defense and Navy Secretaries performing a rendition of the Canto a la Bandera or Song to the Flag (the Himno Nacional Mexicano was played during the 2013 flag raising). After the flag raising the President and the National Defense and Navy Secretaries ride on a military vehicle to inspect the parade on the Zócalo. When the inspection ends the three disembark as the vehicle arrives at the National Palace. The parade is later ordered by the Principal Bugler <b>of</b> the <b>massed</b> Corps <b>of</b> <b>Drums</b> to order arms and stand at ease.|$|R

50|$|The {{manoeuvre}} {{is performed}} at the Trooping the Colour by The <b>Massed</b> Bands, Corps <b>of</b> <b>Drums,</b> and Pipes and <b>Drums</b> <b>of</b> Her Majesty's Guards Division, and was designed after {{the addition of the}} then newly formed Regimental Bands of the Welsh and Irish Guards to the parade. With over 400 men, it became impossible to turn the formation in the standard manner using a 'wheel'. As such, the Spin Wheel was required.|$|R
50|$|In the band's early days, large drums {{would be}} placed {{throughout}} the audience {{as a means to}} eliminate the separation between performer and audience. Inspired by the Kodo Drummers of Japan, the band sought to use the theater <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>drumming</b> to illustrate their vision of a future culture that would evolve {{as a response to the}} exponentially increasing human population on the planet. This practice was stopped, however, when the drums ceased to be played by ever-increasing crowds, becoming dangerous missiles instead. However, the band retained one defining feature with two drummers playing simultaneously (Michael Jerome and Chad Lovell) creating a propulsive, driving beat that underlaid many of the group's songs.|$|R
50|$|In 1855, {{during the}} units' {{service in the}} Crimean War, the H.M.M.F.-R.M's foot units became one under the unified title of Royal Marines Light Infantry, later known as the Royal Marine Light Infantry. From then, bugles {{replaced}} drums as signallers and order beaters, but the latter would be still useful for drill, being then called drummers and buglers, and from 1867 the R.M.L.I./R.M.A. drummers were called buglers only, serving individually in ships and the R.N's shore establishments and artillery units and <b>massed</b> into corps <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> for their units on the ground. Fifes fully declined and disappeared in usage. By then, a bugler playing both the drum and his bugle both to sound orders and do drum calls was a common sight in the RMLI and RMA. By the 1890s, even buglers also trained in using herald trumpets or Fanfare trumpets became commonplace in RMLI and RMA bases and facilities.|$|R

50|$|The {{military}} {{bands and}} Corps <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> <b>of</b> the Regulares regiments and Tabors are {{commonly known as}} the Nubas. They are the same as the normal Spanish Army military bands except that the Corps <b>of</b> <b>Drums</b> is a mix <b>of</b> <b>drums,</b> cymbals, tambourines, bugles, trumpets, bagpipes and African flutes. At the present time only the Corps <b>of</b> <b>Drums</b> is seen in continuous active service, with military band support usually from other units. It is led by a Bugle Major who in the past was the assistant <b>of</b> the <b>drum</b> major. On the 2014 National Day Parade the Corps <b>of</b> <b>Drums</b> <b>of</b> the 54th Regulares Group reinstated the practice of being led by a drum major.|$|R

50|$|A corps <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> or field {{music in}} the United States {{is a type of}} {{military}} band, which originated in European armies in the 16th century. The main instruments of a corps <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> are the drum and the flute or fife and bugle. Unlike 'full' military marching bands, corps <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> usually exist within an infantry battalion. A drum major is the leader of a corps <b>of</b> <b>drums,</b> and in the past a fife major served as the principal fifer or flautist with a bugle major serving the same purpose for the buglers.|$|R

50|$|Several {{different}} {{strings of}} logic have seen corps <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> employed in many varied roles. Because the corps would often {{be employed in}} support of the battalion, in areas such as delivering mail or designating billets, they are often given the role of assault pioneers, or supporting-fire (machine gun) platoons.The corps <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> role on the battlefield was originally to signal orders, and therefore some units are organised into signals platoons, operating radios.Corps <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> were also deployed to march under the parley flag when officers of opposing met to discuss terms of surrender, etc. Therefore some corps <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> perform a liaison role.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an automatic description system <b>of</b> <b>drum</b> sounds for real-world musical audio signals. Our system can represent onset times and names <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> by means <b>of</b> <b>drum</b> descriptors {{defined in the}} context of MPEG- 7. For their automatic description, drum sounds must be identified in such polyphonic signals. The problem is that acoustic features <b>of</b> <b>drum</b> sounds vary with each musical piece and precise templates for them cannot be prepared in advance. To solve this problem, we propose new template-adaptation and template-matching methods. The former method adapts a single seed template prepared for each kind <b>of</b> <b>drums</b> to the corresponding drum sound appearing in an actual musical piece. The latter method then can detect all the onsets <b>of</b> each <b>drum</b> by using the corresponding adapted template. The onsets of bass and snare drums in any piece can thus be identified. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of identifying bass and snare drums in popular music was about 90 %. Finally, we define drum descriptors in the MPEG- 7 format and demonstrate an example <b>of</b> the automatic <b>drum</b> sound description for a piece of popular music...|$|R
