5|$|In a {{study of}} risk taking, some types of risk, such as {{physical}} or heroic risk for others' benefit, are viewed more favorably than other types of risk, such as taking drugs. Males and females valued different degrees of heroic risk for <b>mates</b> and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic risk taking by male friends, but preferred less of it in female <b>mates.</b> Females valued heroic risk taking in male <b>mates</b> and less of it in female friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children. Males may prefer heroic risk taking by male friends {{as they could be}} good allies.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} as first articulated by Darwin (using {{the example of}} the peacock's tail) refers specifically to competition for <b>mates,</b> which can be intrasexual, between individuals of the same sex, that is male–male competition, or intersexual, where one gender chooses <b>mates,</b> most often with males displaying and females choosing. However, in some species, mate choice is primarily by males, as in some fishes of the family Syngnathidae.|$|E
50|$|In chess, {{an ideal}} <b>mate</b> is a checkmate {{position}} {{that is a}} special form of model <b>mate.</b> While in a model <b>mate,</b> each piece on the <b>mating</b> player's side (possibly excluding the king and pawns depending on context) participates in the <b>mate,</b> an ideal <b>mate</b> involves all {{the pieces of the}} <b>mated</b> player's as well, typically by blocking the <b>mated</b> king's field of movement so that it cannot escape. As in a model <b>mate,</b> an ideal <b>mate</b> also involves the <b>mating</b> pieces attacking the vacant squares around the <b>mated</b> king's exactly once, and not attacking the <b>mated</b> player's other pieces occupying the king's field of movement.|$|R

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is monogamous, and {{typically}} <b>mates</b> for life. Birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate. Male house sparrows guard their <b>mates</b> carefully {{to avoid being}} cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites. Males may sometimes have multiple <b>mates,</b> and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females. Many birds do not find a nest and a mate, and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost <b>mates</b> of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season. The formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds {{is tied to the}} holding of a nest site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.|$|E
5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it <b>mates,</b> because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often <b>mates</b> without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E

50|$|Assortative <b>mating</b> {{in humans}} {{has been widely}} {{observed}} and studied, and {{can be broken down}} into two types of human assortative <b>mating.</b> These are genetic assortative <b>mating,</b> or assortative <b>mating</b> with <b>mate</b> choice based on genetic type and phenotypical expression, and social assortative <b>mating,</b> or assortative <b>mating</b> with <b>mate</b> choice based on social, cultural, and other societal factors.|$|R
40|$|<b>Mating</b> {{is close}} to the engine of the {{evolutionary}} process—differential reproductive success. As descendants of reproductively successful ancestors, modern humans have inherited the <b>mating</b> strategies that led to our ancestor’s success.

50|$|Assortative <b>mating</b> is a <b>mating</b> {{pattern and}} {{a form of}} sexual {{selection}} in which individuals with similar phenotypes <b>mate</b> with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random <b>mating</b> pattern. Examples of similar phenotypes include, {{but are not limited}} to, body size, skin coloration/pigmentation, and age. Assortative <b>mating,</b> also referred to as positive assortative <b>mating</b> or homogamy, may increase genetic relatedness within the family. Assortative <b>mating</b> can be contrasted with disassortative <b>mating</b> (also known as negative assortative <b>mating</b> or heterogamy) in which individuals with dissimilar genotypes and/or phenotypes <b>mate</b> with one another more frequently than would be expected under random <b>mating.</b> Disassortative <b>mating</b> reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive assortative <b>mating</b> occurs more frequently than negative assortative <b>mating.</b> In both cases, due to the nonrandom <b>mating</b> pattern, there is a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg principle (which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences).|$|R
50|$|For animals, <b>mating</b> {{strategies}} include random <b>mating,</b> disassortative <b>mating,</b> assortative <b>mating,</b> or a <b>mating</b> pool.

The human practice of <b>mating</b> and artificially inseminating domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with <b>mates,</b> or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created. The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may therefore be {{the size of the}} territory of an individual. Other species of birds are also known to use their wings to create sounds that attract <b>mates</b> or mark their territory.|$|E
5|$|Males sing {{constantly}} as {{the breeding}} period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In {{the presence of}} a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract <b>mates</b> earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear to prefer <b>mates</b> with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males {{are a little}} larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both males and females prefer <b>mates</b> that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their <b>mates.</b> In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing <b>mates</b> within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
