Our goals were to (1) investigate the outcomes of telemedicine consultations for pediatric obesity on changes/additions to diagnoses, diagnostic evaluation or treatment, and (2) determine whether changes in diagnostic and management recommendations made by the consultant were associated with improvements in patient nutrition, activity level, and weight. We conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients referred to a University-affiliated Children's Hospital Pediatric Telemedicine Weight Management Clinic for a diagnosis of obesity. Of the 139 children and adolescents who received pediatric weight <b>management</b> <b>consultations</b> during the study period, 99 patients met inclusion criteria. Weight <b>management</b> <b>consultations</b> resulted in changes/additions to diagnoses in 77. 8 % of patients and changes/additions to diagnostic evaluation in 79. 8 % of patients. Of patients seen more than once, 80. 7 % showed improvement in clinical outcomes. Of patients seen more than once, 80. 6 % improved their diet, 69. 4 % increased activity levels, 21. 0 % showed slowing of weight gain or weight maintenance, and 22. 6 % showed weight reduction. Improvements in clinical outcomes were not associated with changes/additions to diagnoses (Odds Ratio [OR][*]=[*] 0. 98; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI][*]=[*] 0. 25 – 3. 98) and were weakly associated with changes/additions to diagnostic evaluations (OR[*]=[*] 2. 23; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 58 – 8. 73). However, changes/additions to treatment were associated with improvement in weight status (OR[*]=[*] 9. 0; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 34 – 76. 21). Obesity consultations were associated with changes/additions to diagnoses, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment. Treatment changes were associated with improvement in weight status.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} experience of providing <b>management</b> <b>consultation</b> to supervisors and administrators for ten EAP directors in higher education. Five areas were explored: (1) the <b>management</b> <b>consultation</b> process the EAP director provides to supervisors and administrators; (2) what influences {{the way in which}} the EAP director provides these <b>management</b> <b>consultation</b> services; (3) how the EAP director explores the individual, departmental or organizational influences on the presenting problem; (4) what the EAP director does to reach a broader level of experience or awareness for the supervisor during the consultation; (5) metaphors for the meaning of work as an EAP director and consultant. Using phenomenology as the methodology, long interviews were conducted with each of the EAP directors. The process of phenomenological reduction was used to describe the essential experience of <b>management</b> <b>consultation.</b> Results indicate that EAP directors use their intuition, clinical and organizational skills when engaged in <b>management</b> <b>consultation.</b> The EAP director works with the manager to create a mutually formulated plan for addressing the concerns of the manager or the concerns for the employee or both. Longevity on the job appears to be helpful in building the EAP director 2 ̆ 7 s consultation confidence and abilities. Building key relationships within the workplace appears to build trust in the EAP director 2 ̆ 7 s ability to be approached for help with sensitive problems. The quality of the relationship the EAP director has with the supervisor is fundamental for broadening the supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s experience and awareness level. The EAP director uses an interactive systemic approach to explore and help the supervisor or administrator see the individual, departmental, organizational, cultural and environmental influences on the consultation problem. These EAP directors have rich metaphors for the work that they do. ^ It is suggested that the established EAP core technology be expanded to include the essence of consultation practice inherent in many EAP practitioner interactions with supervisors and administrators. In addition to the original seven core technologies, EAP practice should also reflect: (8) Provision of <b>management</b> <b>consultation</b> that provides appropriate interpersonal communication practices and helps create productive work relationships between employees, their managers and their workplaces.

40|$|Many {{studies of}} {{communication}} employ interviewing techniques and conversation analysis, particularly {{in situations where}} one participant brings specialist resources. Interviews and recorded interactions are usually handled separately: ethnographic data are introduced once conversation analysis is complete, to validate findings or illustrate their wider significance. However, integrating interview data in conversation analysis {{has the potential to}} illuminate analysts’ interpretations, and to enhance professionals’ contributions from analysis through to dissemination. In this study, interviews highlighted a parameter between professionals who actively used communication to manipulate the consultation’s course, engaging patients at particular points and in particular ways, and professionals whose <b>consultation</b> <b>management</b> was more ‘clinical’ and less dependent on interaction. The different ways professionals talked in interview were paralleled by differences identified from conversation analysis of consultations. For some, ‘clinical’ orientation was more prevalent in the organization of their consultations than ‘active’ manipulation of communication, and their <b>management</b> of the <b>consultation</b> more ‘unilateral’. For others, communication played a more strategic and integral part in clinical practice, and their <b>management</b> of the <b>consultation</b> was more ‘bilateral’. These contrasts in professionals’ descriptions of their <b>consultation</b> <b>management</b> suggest that at least some features of a ‘bilateral’ approach are consciously employed and may be teachable. ...|$|R
