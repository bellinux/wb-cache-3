5|$|Another <b>major</b> <b>fire</b> {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not built into the glove boxes.|$|E

5|$|Fires were a {{constant}} problem as the palace compound was constructed {{almost entirely of}} wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after fires in 876, 1068 and in 1156 despite its limited use. However, after the <b>major</b> <b>fire</b> of 1177 which destroyed much of the Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never again rebuilt. The Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in 1063 and was never rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|The August 26, 1977 ABC Evening News {{covered the}} story of a <b>major</b> <b>fire</b> at the embassy.

Former KGB agent Victor Sheymov testified before Congress in 1998 that the fire was deliberately induced by the Soviets in an effort to gain access to sensitive areas by agents posing as firemen.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly built}} town proved highly {{vulnerable}} to fire. Houses {{were made of}} wood, heated with stoves and lit by candles and oil lamps; water for emergencies was wanting, especially in the frozen winters. The first <b>major</b> <b>fire</b> occurred on November 25, 1897, started accidentally by dance-hall girl Belle Mitchell. She also accidentally started a second <b>major</b> <b>fire</b> on October 14, 1898 which, {{in the absence of}} a fire brigade in Dawson, destroyed two major saloons, the post-office building and the Bank of British North America at a cost of $500,000 ($400 million). The worst fire occurred on April 26, 1899 when a saloon caught fire in the middle of a strike by the newly established fire brigade. Most of the major landmarks in the town were burned to the ground: 117 buildings were destroyed, with the damage estimated at over $1 million ($810 million).|$|E

5|$|According to Islamic belief Muhammad is {{credited}} with setting the Black Stone in the current place in {{the wall of the}} Kaaba.

The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans could not agree on which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1990s, {{the station}} was modernized. After water shorted out old wires in the station, on March 11, 1999, a <b>major</b> <b>fire</b> {{occurred}} originating in an equipment room on the station's lower level. A 1930s-era relay room, which controlled the interlocking north of the station, was destroyed in the fire. The station was closed for several months, with G service suspended south of Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets and F trains simply bypassing the station at a lower-than-normal operating speed. Signals and switches at the station were replaced and modernized after the fire, and again in Fall 2008 when the relay room was rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|BOAC Flight 712 (callsign Speedbird 712) was a British Overseas Airways Corporation service {{operated}} by a Boeing 707-465 from London Heathrow Airport bound for Sydney via Zurich and Singapore. On Monday 8 April 1968, it suffered an engine failure on takeoff that quickly led to a <b>major</b> <b>fire.</b> The engine fell off the aircraft in flight. After the aircraft had made a successful emergency landing, confusion over checklists and distractions from {{the presence of a}} check captain contributed to the deaths of five of the 127 on board.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 Troy {{suffered}} another <b>major</b> <b>fire,</b> {{the worst}} in its history. A locomotive's spark ignited the wooden Green Island drawbridge that existed at the time, and when {{that could not be}} contained to the bridge it spread to the east, ultimately devastating 507 buildings over a 16-block area. As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months from the ashes of its predecessor. The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 1950, a <b>major</b> <b>fire</b> {{occurred}} on the wooden trestle of the LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch over Jamaica Bay, ending direct rail service to the Rockaway peninsula. On June 25, Triboro Coach, which was owned by Green Lines' shareholders, began operating replacement bus service from the Woodside LIRR station to Rockaway Park on a temporary grant from the city. The Q53 officially began service on June 28, 1956, two days after IND Rockaway Line service commenced on the parallel Rockaway Beach Branch. It later gained popularity as a route from mainland Queens to Rockaway Beach and Rockaways' Playland during summer months, as did the Q21 and Q21A.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers {{began to}} grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Even before the {{development}} of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private houses, and this sentiment strengthened. Critics complained that the concentration of tall buildings {{in the center of the}} city was causing huge congestion, and each new skyscraper was also burning additional coal to power its facilities, together consuming a total of over one million tons each year, leaving smoke and stagnant air hanging over Chicago. Many were concerned over the risk of a <b>major</b> <b>fire</b> breaking out and spreading, uncontrolled, from building to building.|$|E
5|$|Temporary repairs began immediately, {{but due to}} {{the limited}} drydock space in the port, repairs to the hull were not {{effected}} until 11 September. Dunkerque was refloated on 27 September and her propulsion system was returned to operational status. A <b>major</b> <b>fire</b> broke out on 5 December, however, which slowed down the repair effort. Repair work lasted for the entirety of 1941, and on 25 January 1942 another fire broke out. The temporary repairs were completed by 19 February, which permitted the ship to depart Mers-el-Kébir, under heavy escort, bound for Toulon. She arrived the following day, and entered the large Vauban drydock for comprehensive repairs.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th century and {{enlarged}} in the 10th.

The abbey controlled large tracts of the surrounding land and was instrumental in major drainage projects on the Somerset Levels. The abbey was suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII of England.
