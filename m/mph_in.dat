25|$|The British Grand Prix {{was seen}} as a turning point, being {{dominated}} by Red Bull with Vettel leading home Webber, in dry conditions. Button was not on the podium {{for the first time this}} season, finishing sixth. Red Bull also dominated the following German Grand Prix with Webber taking his first pole and race win, despite being given a drive through penalty. Ferrari were also showing signs of improvement, Felipe Massa finishing third in what would be his final race of the season. He was hospitalised after being hit on the helmet by a flying spring when he was travelling at 162 <b>mph</b> <b>in</b> qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix. The accident overshadowed the race, with a lightly-fueled Fernando Alonso on pole retiring early in the race, which was won by Lewis Hamilton. Jaime Alguersuari finished his début race ahead of Buemi, the Toro Rosso test driver replacing the fired Sébastien Bourdais. Post-race, the Renault team received a suspension for the European Grand Prix, for an incident where Alonso's tyre came loose on the race track following a pit-stop error. An appeal overturned the decision, and the team raced in Valencia.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his {{elementary and secondary}} education at Academia Santa Teresita and Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, both located in San Juan, Rosselló moved to the mainland United States to attend college. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree, Magna Cum Laude at the University of Notre Dame in 1966, as well as several academic and athletic distinctions. After graduation, he continued his studies in medicine at Yale University, which he completed in 1970, also graduating Magna Cum Laude. Later he specialized in general and pediatric surgery at Harvard University. Following his residency at Harvard, he practiced medicine in Puerto Rico while also attending the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus where he earned a master's degree in Public Health (<b>MPH)</b> <b>in</b> 1981 (also graduating Magna Cum Laude). In 2011, he began studying toward a Doctor of Education in Education Leadership from the University of Turabo, graduating in 2015. During his college years, Rosselló became an avid tennis player that led him to be named the captain of Notre Dame's Men's tennis team, a P.R. 5-time-Mens-Champion, and also to play for Puerto Rico's team in regional championships, including the Central American and Caribbean Games. He was inducted into the Puerto Rico Tennis Hall of Fame in 2004.|$|E

500|$|McCudden's last {{activity}} {{worthy of}} note before his return to France was his meeting with Frank Barnwell and Harold Barnwell, chief engineers at Vickers Limited. McCudden and the brothers exchanged information on aircraft design and operations. McCudden understood more of the technique of flying and flight while the brothers gained a greater appreciation of the pilot's perspective. After watching him fly the F.B.9, the brothers were convinced of his skill and consequently McCudden was invited to fly a number of their products. Among these machines was the Vickers F.B.16. McCudden claimed to have reached 136 miles per hour (<b>mph)</b> <b>in</b> the aircraft describing it as a [...] "nice bus". Other pilots noted it was faster than the French SPAD and the S.E.5. On {{the strength of this}} evaluation Vickers approached the War Office for its use on the frontline. It was not selected for production. McCudden believed the inaccessibility of the engine was a main factor in its rejection.|$|E
