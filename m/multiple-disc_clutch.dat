5000|$|... frame {{distortion}} due {{to rough}} roads: is not {{communicated to the}} single unit of the engine, <b>multiple-disc</b> <b>clutch</b> mechanism and gearbox ...|$|E
50|$|The ST300 had a three-element torque converter, a {{front and}} rear <b>multiple-disc</b> <b>clutch</b> pack, and a {{compound}} planetary gearset with a front band and a clutch pack for reverse and manual low gear. The unit was cooled with a small auxiliary oil cooler located beneath the engine radiator. It had a die cast aluminum case, and weighed 152 lb.|$|E
50|$|The Fordomatic {{two-speed}} transmission {{was introduced}} in 1959. A simplified version of the Cruise-O-Matic, it combined a torque connector and a compound planetary gear set. A front unit (<b>multiple-disc)</b> <b>clutch</b> provided high gear, a front band on the clutch drum provided low gear, and a band on the rear unit internal gear drum provided reverse. This transmission was offered on Ford, Fairlane, Mercury, Edsel, Falcon, Comet and Meteor cars with differences in the torque converter, valve bodies and clutch plates to accommodate differing engine torques.|$|E
50|$|The 4-cylinder engine had a {{slightly}} larger cylinder bore than the superseded 25-30, giving an RAC rating of 36.3 hp from 5842 cc (32.8 hp, 5278 cc). It took 25-30's {{place in the}} catalogue. The engine's crankshaft runs in no fewer than five bearings. Power was transmitted to the live rear axle through a <b>multiple-disc</b> <b>clutch</b> with phosphor bronze and steel friction surfaces and a gearbox with sliding spur-wheel gears, providing four forward speeds and reverse, using a shaft fitted with two universal joints. The gearbox, of unusually strong design including an extra bearing on the inner end of the engine driven shaft, is operated on the gate principle. Unusually by 1907 the engine was fitted with a governor mounted on the fan spindle operating on the car's throttle. The Krebs carburettor initially fitted was replaced by an Austin design. Cooling water was circulated by a centrifugal pump, oil by a skew-gear driven vane-pump. An oil pressure gauge is fitted.|$|E
