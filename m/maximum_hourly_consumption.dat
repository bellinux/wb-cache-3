40|$|Based on an {{extensive}} dataset containing aggregated <b>hourly</b> energy <b>consumption</b> readings of residents during March 2011 and October 2012 in South Ontario, Canada, this paper estimates the energy consumption of circulating pumps of residential swimming pools (CPRSP) non-intrusively, and quantifies {{the impact of}} CPRSP on the power system. The main challenges are that, first, widely used non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) methods are not applicable to this work, due to the low sampling rate {{and the lack of}} the energy consumption pattern of CPRSP; second, temperature-based building energy disaggregation methods are not suitable for this work, as they highly depend on the accurate base load estimation and predefined parameters. To overcome these issues, in this paper, first it is found that, during the pool season, for homes with and without swimming pools, the ratio between their base loads is approximately equal to the ratio between their temperature-dependent energy consumptions, then a novel weighted difference change-point (WDCP) model has been proposed. The advantages of the WDCP model are that, on one hand, it doesn&# 39;t depend on the base load estimation and predefined parameters; on the other hand, it has no requirement on the data sampling rate and the prior information of energy consumption patterns of CPRSP. Based on the WDCP model it is shown that, the average <b>hourly</b> energy <b>consumption</b> of CPRSP is 0. 7425 kW, and the minimum and the <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> energy <b>consumptions</b> are 0. 5274 kW at 9 : 00 and 0. 9612 kW at 17 : 00, respectively. At the peak hour 19 : 00, July 21, 2011, CPRSP contributes 20. 36 % energy consumption of homes with swimming pools, as well as 8. 48 % peak load of all neighborhoods. As a result, the peak load could be reduced by 8. 48 % if all CPRSP are stopped during the peak hour...|$|R

40|$|A {{physically}} based distributed {{slope stability}} model is described that utilizes a combined surface-subsurface kinematic wave module to assess groundwater fluctuations related to slope stability. A total of 82 major rainstorms from 1972 to 1990 in Carnation Creek, British Columbia, were examined {{to determine the}} influence of different characteristics of rainstorms (such as mean and <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> intensity, duration, and rainfall amount) on the slope stability. These rainstorms vary in mean intensity from 16 to 112 mm h- 1, storm duration from 11 to 93 h, and <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> intensity from 34 to 35 mm h- 1. Four synthetic 'uniform intensity' rainstorms were also tested against real storms to assess the effect of short-term hourly rainfall intensity peaks on landslide occurrence. Altogether, 602 simulations were conducted. The combined influence of mean and <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> intensity, duration, and total rainfall amount of rainstorms were important in generating landslides. The temporal distribution of short-term intensity also influenced the landslide occurrence. When saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil was lowered or soil depth was raised, most rainstorms produced larger numbers of landslides. For the most part, actual rainstorms produced less stable conditions than their synthetic 'uniform intensity' counterparts. For all landslide-producing storms, slope failure usually occurred after some threshold of cumulative rainfall and <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> rainfall intensity. These simulations provide insights into the distributed behaviour of landslide occurrence during large rainstorms with varying characteristics. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R

A {{better understanding of}} relationships between rainfall characteristics and rainfall-related damage can help insurers and flood authorities to respond more adequately to rainfall extremes. This paper aims to study to what extent weather radars can be helpful to predict damage locations and characteristics. For the Netherlands, damage data were analysed based on daily insurance records. A database of C-band radar images was used to extract characteristics of rainfall events. These characteristics were linked to various damage statistics at district level and per day.

40|$|Outdoor {{environmental}} {{risk factors for}} asthma have been extensively researched, even though the majority of a person 2 ̆ 7 s daily activity occurs indoors. There is limited evidence linking personal exposure concentrations of ozone, pollen, mold, temperature, and humidity to childhood asthma. ^ The current study consisted of a secondary, more complex {{analysis of the data}} from the Houston Air Toxics and Asthma in Children (ATAC) Study to further investigate the association of personal ozone exposure on asthma outcome variability among middle school children with asthma. The ATAC Study primarily investigated the association between selected oxygenated air toxics and indicators of asthma variability (PEFR, FEV 1, asthma symptoms, and rescue medication usage) among 30 labile and persistent Houston middle-school children with diagnosed asthma. This panel study used a repeated measurements design of four separate 10 -day sampling periods that extended over a 20 month period. The secondary analysis included aggregate regression models that were constructed with two different estimates of ozone exposure (daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> outdoor concentration and daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal exposure), with three different estimates of personal environmental temperature and humidity exposures (daily average, intraday difference, and interday difference), and for thee different time periods [same day of exposure (lag 0), one day after initial exposure (lag 1), and two days after initial exposure (lag 2) ]. ^ Overall, the models using daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal ozone exposures in combination with intraday and interday personal temperature and humidity differences produced more significant plausible associations than models using daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal ozone exposures with personal average temperature and humidity exposures. Significant associations were identified between daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal ozone exposure and clinical indicators of asthma variability. The increasing effect on rescue medication usage from daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal ozone exposure were identified as soon as the same day of exposure (lag 0; p= 0. 0072), and the same effects were delayed until the second next day (lag 2; p= 0. 0026). The increasing effect on asthma symptoms were identified on the second next day after initial exposure (lag 2; p= 0. 0024). There was a consistent inverse relationship between personal relative humidity exposure and indicators of asthma variability. Decreasing effects on daily FEV 1 variability from personal relative humidity exposure were identified on the same day of exposure (lag 0; p= 0. 034), increasing effects on morning PEFR were identified on the next day after initial exposure (lag 1; p= 0. 0001), and decreasing effects on overnight PEFR variability were identified on the second next day after the initial exposure (lag 2; p= 0. 007). With the conclusion of this research, there are opportunities for future similar studies in the preventive management of asthma in children living in high-ozone areas. ...|$|R
