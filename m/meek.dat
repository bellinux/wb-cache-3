5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons. Stephen <b>Meek</b> served as the train's paid guide. <b>Meek</b> left the group at Fort Hall to lead {{some of the members}} on the <b>Meek</b> Cutoff.

Palmer climbed to the 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and the scant protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E

5|$|According to <b>Meek,</b> Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore {{political}} boundaries.... The faint {{outline of}} the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behaviour. It {{is believed to have}} been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart <b>Meek,</b> who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It {{is believed to have been}} rare when <b>Meek</b> collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.|$|E

50|$|Ezra <b>Meeker</b> {{owned and}} resided in two homes in Puyallup.

The <b>Meeker</b> family lived here from 1862 until 1886. The wooden cabin disappeared over time.After the move to the mansion, <b>Meeker</b> donated the cabin site to the city, who created Pioneer Park.

The Guild justified credit to Lewis Colick, who wrote {{the first draft of}} The Bobby Darin Story in 1987, and Kevin Spacey.

5|$|Bradley <b>Meek,</b> {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{took his}} family {{with him as}} far as Denver, while Hayden tried to keep Cope and Leidy from {{prospecting}} in the same area. Following a tip from geologist Fielding Bradford <b>Meek,</b> Cope also intended to investigate reports of bones <b>Meek</b> had found near Black Buttes Station and the railroad. Cope found the site and some skeletal remains of a dinosaur he dubbed Agathaumas sylvestris. Believing he had {{the full support of}} Hayden and the survey, Cope then traveled to Fort Bridger in June, only to find that the men, wagons, horses, and equipment he expected were not there. Cope cobbled together an outfit at his own expense, consisting of two teamsters, a cook, and a guide, along with three men from Chicago who were interested in studying with him. As it turned out, two of Cope's men were in fact in the employ of Marsh. When the rival paleontologist found out his own men were taking Cope's money, he was furious. While the men tried to assure Marsh they were still his men (one suggested he took the job in order to lead Cope away from good fossils), Marsh's laziness in soliciting firm agreements and payments may have caused them to seek other work. Cope's journey took the expedition through rugged country only Hayden had surveyed, and he discovered dozens of new species. Meanwhile, one of Marsh's men accidentally forwarded some of his material to Cope instead. On receiving the fossils, Cope sent them back to Marsh, but further damage had been done to their relationship.|$|E
