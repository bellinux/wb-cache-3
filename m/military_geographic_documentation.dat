40|$|The Julian Alps {{have been}} of {{military}} significance since Roman times in a <b>military</b> <b>geographic</b> sense because of its valleys, mountain passes and lines of defence on mountain ridges. They became especially important in the 19 th and 20 th century. The largest mountain front in World War I was located there,and evidence of that front is still visible today. The border between Italy and Yugoslavia {{in the heart of}} the Julian Alps was clearly a line of demarcation along the Soča and Sava watersheds and was reinforced with fortification, obstacles and trenches. During the Cold War, there was an ideological line of demarcation along the western edge of the Julian Alps as well. Military strategy in that area included the use of <b>military</b> <b>geographic</b> approaches in both westerly and easterly directions. After the geopolitical changes of 1991, the Julian Alps no longer had same <b>military</b> <b>geographic</b> significance in terms of Slovenian national security. Today other military activities are more important: training under mountains conditions for NATO soldiers, non-commissioned and commissioned officers takes place in the Pokljuka region and on the Triglav mountain chain. Military facilities have been taken on significance in the terms of tourism as well...|$|R

[...] According to the 2006 Law of Geodesy and Cartography, the areas subject to such mapping comprise the country’s territory as well as the area of the Bulgarian base in Antarctica.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A great {{convergence}} of cartography, secrecy, and power {{occurred during the}} Cold War. In the American case, a complex series of interactions between secret and classified programs and institutions and their publicly accessible counterparts accomplished both traditional and novel objectives of <b>military</b> <b>geographic</b> intelligence. This process also yielded the World Geodetic System, a masscentered “figure of the earth ” at accuracies adequate for warfare with intercontinental ballistic missiles. A structural and institutional separation developed between enterprises charged with overhead data acquisition systems, which were classified at increasingly high levels of secrecy, and those responsible for data reduction, analysis, and mapping systems, which remained largely unclassified and publicly accessible, in part to conceal the classified data acquisition systems. This structural separation destabilized photogrammetric mapping by displacing systems that privileged dimensional stability with systems that privileged novel sensor types more appropriate to Cold War geo-political objectives and constraints. Eventually, photogrammetric mapping systems were re-stabilized by successfully implementing analytical solutions imposed in digital mapping and data management systems. This achievement re-privileged dimensional stability, now redefined to the new media of geo-referenced digital data. In the early 1970 s these developments culminated in advanced research projects of <b>Military</b> <b>Geographic</b> Intelligence Systems (MGIS). Their deployment in the Vietnam War was both their apex and their undoing. In the aftermath, classified mapping and database systems diverged from civilian versions of MGIS, which became known as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) ...|$|R

50|$|The Nevado de Chañi is {{a compact}} {{mountain}} group located between the meridians of longitude West 65º42’ and 65º48’ and the parallels of latitude South 24º00’ and 24º10’. The main summit (according {{to the last}} available surveys) is 5,949m (24º03’S and 65º44’W) {{and it is the}} highest point in the province of Jujuy. There is some confusion about the height of the mountain. Official, but old, official surveys from the Argentine IGM (the <b>military</b> <b>geographic</b> institute) give a height of 6,200 which is definitely an exaggeration. Some more recent surveys give about 5,900. The height of 5,949 has been many times measured with modern GPS by summiteers during the last decade.|$|R

On 22 September 1908 he was awarded the rank of lieutenant colonel and honorary field assistant to the king. In 1912 Caviglia was sent to Tripolitania and Cyrenaica; his task was to overview both the negotiations for the pullout of the Turkish troops and the pacification of Arab and Berber chieftains.

40|$|Although the {{relationship}} between Geography and the military is long-standing and well researched, books dealing with this applied sub-discipline of geography exclusively remain rare. As such, the International handbook Military Geography is both a welcome addition to a rather sparse collection of Military Geography literature, {{as well as a}} uniquely European perspective to an otherwise American-dominated body of literature. Fifty-two contributions by authors from seven different European countries appear in this publication. The stated aim of the book is to “present selected activities and products of the <b>military</b> <b>geographic</b> community as well as important and relevant activities and products of institutions outside of this community” The authors describe the purpose of the book as “[to] show the plurality of activities and products to the [military geographic] community itself, and the armed forces in general, but also to the wider public for better understanding of what military geography deals with and what it can provide. ...|$|R

40|$|The crisis {{management}} of a disaster, whether caused naturally or by human action, requires a thorough {{knowledge of the}} territory involved, with regard to both its terrain and its developed areas. Therefore, {{it is essential that}} the National Mapping and Cadastral Agencies (NMCAs) and all other public and scientific institutions responsible for the production of geospatial information closely co-operate in making their data in that field available. This crucial sharing of geographic information is a top-level priority, not only in a disaster emergency situation, but also for effective urban and environmental planning and Cultural Heritage protection and preservation. Geospatial data-sharing, responding to the needs of all institutions involved in disaster surveying operations, is fundamental, as a priority, to the task of avoiding loss of human lives. However, no less important is the acquisition, dissemination and use of this data, in addition to direct, “in-the-field” operations of specialists in geomatics, in order to preserve the Cultural Heritage located in the crisis area. It is in this context that an NMCA such as the Italian <b>Military</b> <b>Geographic</b> Institute (IGMI) plays a key role...|$|R
