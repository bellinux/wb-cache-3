50|$|At a basic level, {{master data}} {{management}} seeks to ensure that an organization does not use multiple (potentially inconsistent) {{versions of the same}} master data in different parts of its operations, which can occur in large organizations. A typical example of poor {{master data management}} is the scenario of a bank at which a customer has taken out a mortgage and the bank begins to send mortgage solicitations to that customer, ignoring the fact that the person already has a mortgage account relationship with the bank. This happens because the customer information used by the <b>marketing</b> <b>section</b> within the bank lacks integration with the customer information used by the customer services section of the bank. Thus the two groups remain unaware that an existing customer is also considered a sales lead. The process of record linkage is used to associate different records that correspond to the same entity, in this case the same person.|$|E
