40|$|A {{number of}} {{environmental}} problems occur from the extraction, processing, distribution, and disposal of <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates.</b> While aggregates are essential inputs into the construction of buildings and roads, regions that use more aggregates per capita will have more significant deleterious environmental impacts than regions that use less. This study investigates potential causes of the above average per capita use of <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates</b> in Ontario. To discern broad factors influencing aggregates use for Canada as a whole, a panel regression on six provinces for the years 1987 - 2003 was undertaken. A case study contrasts aggregates use in Ontario from Quebec and British Columbia to uncover some specific ways in which Ontario differs from other provinces. The results suggest that Ontario could reduce its use to levels found elsewhere in Canada without compromising economic activity, and concludes with an analysis of policy options aimed at reducing the use of <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates</b> in Ontario...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of cell-(iron) <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{as a consequence}} of bacterial iron oxidation is an environmentally widespread process with a number of implications for processes such as sorption and coprecipitation of contaminants and nutrients. Whereas the overall appearance of such aggregates is easily accessible using 2 -D microscopy techniques, the 3 -D and internal structure remain obscure. In this study, we examined the 3 -D structure of cell-(iron) <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates</b> formed during Fe(II) oxidation by the nitrate-reducing Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN 1 using a combination of advanced 3 -D microscopy techniques. We obtained 3 -D structural and chemical information on different cellular encrustation patterns at high spatial resolution (4 - 200 nm, depending on the method) : more specifically, (1) cells free of iron minerals, (2) periplasm filled with iron minerals, (3) spike- or platelet-shaped iron mineral structures, (4) bulky structures on the cell surface, (5) extracellular iron mineral shell structures, (6) cells with iron mineral filled cytoplasm, and (7) agglomerations of extracellular globular structures.

40|$|To {{describe}} a new hypothesis {{for the initial}} events leading to urinary stones. A biomechanical perspective on Randall's plaque formation through form and function relationships is applied to functional units within the kidney, we have termed the 'medullo-papillary complex' - a dynamic relationship between intratubular and interstitial <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates.</b> A complete MEDLINE search was performed to examine the existing literature on the anatomical and physiological relationships in the renal medulla and papilla. Sectioned human renal medulla with papilla from radical nephrectomy specimens were imaged using a high resolution micro X-ray computed tomography. The location, distribution, and density of <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates</b> within the medullo-papillary complex were identified. <b>Mineral</b> <b>aggregates</b> were seen proximally in all specimens within the outer medulla of the medullary complex and were intratubular. Distal interstitial mineralisation at the papillary tip corresponding to Randall's plaque was not seen until a threshold of proximal mineralisation was observed. Mineral density measurements suggest varied chemical compositions between the proximal intratubular (330 mg/cm 3) and distal interstitial (270 mg/cm 3) deposits. A {{review of the literature}} revealed distinct anatomical compartments and gradients across the medullo-papillary complex that supports the empirical observations that proximal mineralisation triggers distal Randall's plaque formation. The early stone event is initiated by intratubular mineralisation of the renal medullary tissue leading to the interstitial mineralisation that is observed as Randall's plaque. We base this novel hypothesis on a multiscale biomechanics perspective involving form and function relationships, and empirical observations. Additional studies are needed to validate this hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{examining}} the uniaxial behaviour of concrete materials incorporating rubber particles, obtained from recycled end-of-life tyres, {{as a replacement}} for <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates.</b> A detailed account of a set of material tests on rubberised concrete cylindrical samples, in which fine and coarse <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates</b> are replaced in equal volumes by rubber particles with various sizes, is presented. The experimental results carried out in this investigation, combined with detailed examination of data available from previous tests on rubberised concrete materials, show that the rubber particles influence the mechanical properties {{as a function of the}} quantity and type of the <b>mineral</b> <b>aggregates</b> replaced. Experimental evaluation of the complete stress-strain response depicts reductions in compressive strength, elastic modulus, and crushing strain, with the change in rubber content. Enhancement is also observed in the energy released during crushing as well as in the lateral strain at crushing, primarily due to the intrinsic deformability of the interfacial clamping of rubber particles which leads to higher lateral dilation of the material. The test results and observations enable the definition of a series of expressions to estimate the mechanical properties of rubberised concrete materials. An analytical model is also proposed for the detailed assessment of the complete stress-strain response as a function of the volumetric rubber ratio. Validations performed against the material tests carried out in this study, as well as those from previous investigations on rubberised concrete materials, show that the proposed models offer reliable predictions of the mechanical properties including the full axial and lateral stress-strain response of concrete materials incorporating rubber particles...|$|R
