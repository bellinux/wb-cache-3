Triangulation was employed to increase the trustworthiness of interpretations. The analysis revealed the central role of planning as the strategy leaders should employ to improve institutional success. Funding was an additional theme leaders regarded as the issue that most often undermined planning and effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> All participants acknowledged the need for the integration of planning and funding to create institutional success. These findings suggest that {{community college leaders}} who use planning, funding strategies, maintenance strategies, and who empower people to sustain facility and <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> can improve the teaching-learning environment. When community college leaders transform the teaching-learning environment, they enable student success. Student success increases the earning power of students that contributes to social change by expanding the tax-base and creating greater economic development...|$|R
2500|$|By {{order of}} President Theodore Roosevelt under the Panama Canal Acts of 1902 and 1904 the Secretary of War was made {{supervisor}} of canal construction {{and the second}} Isthmian Canal Commission made the governing body for the Canal Zone.

The Governor of the Panama Canal was charged with [...] "completion, <b>maintenance,</b> <b>operation,</b> government and sanitation of the Panama Canal and its adjuncts and the government of the Canal Zone" [...] in the Executive order. A number of departments were specified in the order with others to be established as needed by the Governor of the Panama Canal [...] with approval of the President and under the supervision of the Secretary of War. Defense of the canal was the responsibility of the Secretary of War who retained control of troops with provisions for Presidential appointment of an Army officer in wartime who would have [...] "exclusive authority over the operation of the Panama Canal and the Government of the Canal Zone." [...] The Executive Order noted in closing [...] "that the supervision of the operations of the Panama Canal under the permanent organization should be under the Secretary of War" [...] thus establishing the essentially military arrangement and atmosphere for the canal and Canal Zone.|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} in the literature {{for the management of}} a set of railway <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> However, these methods consider <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> as deterministic and known a priori. In the stochastic tactical railway maintenance problem (STRMP), <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> are not known in advance. In fact, since future track conditions can only be predicted, <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> become stochastic. STRMP is based on a rolling horizon. For each month of the rolling horizon, an adaptive plan must be addressed. Each adaptive plan becomes deterministic, since it consists of a particular subproblem of the whole STRMP. Nevertheless, an exact resolution of each plan along the rolling horizon would be too time-consuming. Therefore, a heuristic approach that can provide efficient solutions within a reasonable computational time is required. Although STRMP has already been introduced in the literature, little work has been done in terms of solution methods and computational results. The main contributions of this paper include new methodology developments, a linear model for the deterministic subproblem, three efficient heuristics for the fast and effective resolution of each deterministic subproblem, and extensive computational results...|$|R
40|$|In ITER, <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> in {{the vessel}} and in the Hot Cell will be largely done by Remote Handling (RH). Remotely {{performed}} maintenance actions {{tend to be more}} time-costly than actions performed by direct human access. With a human operator in the control loop and adequate situational feedback, a two-armed master slave manipulator system can mimic direct access with dexterous manipulation, tactile feedback and vision. But even then, turnaround times are still very high. Adapting the design for simplified <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> can yield significant time savings. One of the methods known to produce a simpler, more robust design, which is also better suited for handling with robots, is Design For Assembly (DFA). This paper discusses whether and how the principles of DFA can be applied to simplify <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations</b> for ITER. While DFA is normally used with series-production and ITER is a unique product, it is possible to apply the principles of DFA to ITER <b>maintenance</b> <b>operations.</b> Furthermore, DFA's principles can be applied at different abstraction levels. Combining principles of DFA with Virtual Reality leads to new insights and provides additional value...|$|R

This paper deals with investigation on the challenges in the implementation of <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint Plan for Iskandar Malaysia among five local authorities in Iskandar Malaysia. A total of 25 respondents have been selected and interviewed. The data have been analyzed qualitatively. Base on the interview, the results show that there are challenges to implement <b>maintenance</b> and <b>operation</b> blueprint in local authority immovable asset maintenance management which are no clear direction from the top management to implement the <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia, lack of staff to implement the <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia, did not have enough time to implement the <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia and the high cost required to implement the <b>Maintenance</b> and <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia.

A future study investigating critical success factors to implement immovable asset <b>maintenance</b> and <b>operation</b> blueprint would be very interesting to produce a new approach for successful blueprint implementation...|$|R
