40|$|The {{reproductive}} performance of female mud crabs was evaluated as affected by various diets. Dietary treatments were as follows: D 1 â€” natural diet (mussel meat, squid, trash fish); D 2 â€” combination {{of natural and}} formulated diets; D 3 â€” formulated diet. Pond-sourced broodstock, with initial body weight of 300 â€“ 400 g, were tagged in their carapace then stocked in three units of 10 m 3 broodstock tanks at eight females per tank. Half of the females were ablated {{and the other half}} were intact. Spawnings were monitored and berried females were transferred to individual 500 -l tanks for incubation of eggs. Four experimental runs were conducted. Broodstock response in terms of number of spawnings, spawnings with hatching, fecundity, egg fertilization rate, total zoea produced and broodstock survival was enhanced in females fed the mixed diet (D 2) compared to those fed the natural diet (D 1) or the formulated diet (D 3). Larval quality measured as larval stage index followed the same trend. Results further showed that intact females fed diets D 1 and D 2 gave higher numerical values in {{reproductive performance}} and zoea growth index than ablated females while ablated females fed diet D 3 performed better than their intact counterparts. This may be attributed to presence of essential nutrients and vitamins A, C, E in the formulated diet. Latent period from gonadal maturation to first spawning was shortened by eyestalk ablation. Use of a combined diet would ensure the production of good quality eggs and large numbers of zoea with the best chance of completing the larval stages and thus, would serve as an appropriate starting point in establishing a viable mud crab aquaculture.

40|$|Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are key {{links to}} {{nutritional}} condition and growth regulation in teleost. To understand the endocrine mechanism of growth regulation in grouper, we cloned the cDNAs for grouper GH and IGF-I and examined their mRNA expression during different nutritional status. Grouper GH cDNA is 936 base pairs (bp) long excluding the poly-A tail. It contained untranslated regions of 85 and 231 bp in the 5 '- and 3 '-ends, respectively. It has an {{open reading frame}} of 612 bp coding for a signal peptide of 17 amino acids (aa) and a mature hormone of 187 aa residues. Based on the aa sequence of the mature hormone, grouper GH shows higher sequence identity (> 76 %) to GHs of perciforms than to GHs of cyprinids and salmonids (53 - 69 %). Grouper preproIGF-I cDNA consisted of 558 bp, which codes for 186 aa. This is composed of 44 aa for the signal peptide, 68 aa for the mature peptide comprising B, C, A, and D domains, and 74 aa for the E domain. Mature grouper IGF-I shows very high sequence identity to IGF-I of teleost fishes (84 - 97 %) compared to advanced groups of vertebrates such as chicken, pig, and human (=< 80 %). Using DNA primers specific for grouper GH and IGF-I, the changes in mRNA levels of pituitary GH and hepatic IGF-I in response to starvation and refeeding were examined by a semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Significant elevation of GH mRNA level was observed after 2 weeks of food deprivation, and increased further after 3 and 4 weeks of starvation. GH mRNA level in fed-controls did not change significantly during the same period. Hepatic IGF-I mRNA level decreased significantly starting after 1 week of starvation until the 4 th week. There was no significant change in IGF-I mRNA levels in fed-controls. One week of refeeding can restore the GH and IGF-I mRNA back to its normal levels. Deprivation of food for 1 - 4 weeks also resulted in cessation of growth and decrease in condition factor.
