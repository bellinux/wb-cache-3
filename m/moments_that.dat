5|$|Composer Tyler Bates began scoring Watchmen in November 2007. He {{planned to}} visit the shoot for a week during each month, and view {{assembly}} cuts of scenes to begin rough composing. Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as Manhunter, Blade Runner, and To Live and Die in L.A. for inspiration. Bates switched between a Yamaha CS-80 or an MOTM for <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> he felt should have more ambience or synthesizers. Snyder wanted a scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescue people from a burning building {{to have a more}} traditional superhero feel, so Bates implemented a four to the floor guitar rhythm. A 64-strong choir and the 87-piece ensemble from the Hollywood Studio Symphony were hired for the more orchestral themes.|$|E
5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
50|$|Branagh {{invented a}} prologue in which ninja warriors attack Duke Senior's family as it attends a {{performance}} of Kabuki theatre. Branagh's prologue defines exactly the <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> Duke Frederick usurps his brother's kingdom, a <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> Shakespeare himself did not.|$|R
60|$|We were {{standing}} by the opened window looking down into the street when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me. I learned in a <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> he loved me. I learned in a <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> my scarred face was all unchanged to him. I learned in a <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> what I had thought was pity and compassion was devoted, generous, faithful love. Oh, too late to know it now, too late, too late. That was the first ungrateful thought I had. Too late.|$|R

5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{political}} <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> brought Berkman and Goldman together was the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania owned by Andrew Carnegie {{became the focus of}} national attention when talks between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was Henry Clay Frick, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike. Strikebreakers were brought in and the company hired Pinkerton guards to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.|$|E

25|$|Lane {{was also}} {{involved}} in a special entitled Don Lane's America and hosted such programs as The Mad Mad World of Sports and 40 Years of Television.

25|$|There is also {{discussion}} among philosophers about mental supervenience and {{our experience of}} duration. If all mental properties supervene only upon some physical properties at durationless moments, then {{it may be difficult}} to explain our experience of duration. The philosophical belief that mental and physical events exist as a series of durationless <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> lie between the physical past and the physical future is known as presentism, and is a form of belief in Galilean relativity.|$|E
25|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} episode had several laugh-out-loud <b>moments,</b> <b>that</b> he {{appreciated}} the Eye of Gulga Grymna story arc and liked the twist that Kröd's prudishness actually {{proved to be}} an asset in battle. But Fowler also said many of the jokes remain too obvious and juvenile and that the supporting characters are being underused; he said the fact that Aneka has spent the last few episodes having sex with Longshaft was particularly offensive.|$|E

25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in which I have ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold on me, that the pull of cowardice was almost more than I could ward off. There were terrible <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
25|$|The play {{opened at}} the Arts Theatre in Cambridge on 10 February 1951 {{although}} Christie was absent as she was in Iraq accompanying her husband Max Mallowan {{on one of his}} archaeological expeditions. She arranged for flowers to be sent to the female members of the cast. Hundreds of miles away, she was as nervous as ever at the public reaction although she was reassured by telegrams which told her that the opening night was a success. Even so, Saunders and director Hubert Gregg had to make some amendments to take out some of the unintentional comic <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> had occurred on the first night.|$|E
25|$|Stylistically, Halloween II reproduces certain key {{elements}} {{that made the}} original Halloween a success, such as first-person camera perspectives, and the film picks up {{right at the end}} of the cliffhanger ending of the original film. The sequel was a box office success, grossing over $25.5 million in the United States. In terms of the response from film critics, the film has received mixed reviews both during its initial run in theatres and since; several commentators criticized the film's generally uneven pace, certain plot holes and muted character performances, while praise was received to the film's genuinely scary <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> captured the spirit of the first film.|$|E

25|$|The Devil's door: A {{moving target}} {{challenge}} pioneered by knifethrower Larry Cisewski. This time the assistant is on a door-sized rectangular board that spins about a central vertical axis. Again the thrower must execute {{a series of}} rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on parts of the board {{not covered by the}} assistant's body. Sometimes the aim is to hit the back of the board in the <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> the assistant is turned away from the thrower. Other throwers have placed a vertical row of knives down the sides of the assistant at the moments when the assistant turns to face them.|$|E
25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, {{it was clear that}} Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily, the {{enormous}} number of electrons in a material are arranged such that their magnetic moments (both orbital and intrinsic) cancel out. This is due, to some extent, to electrons combining into pairs with opposite intrinsic magnetic moments {{as a result of}} the Pauli exclusion principle (see electron configuration), or combining into filled subshells with zero net orbital motion. In both cases, the electron arrangement is so as to exactly cancel the magnetic moments from each electron. Moreover, even when the electron configuration is such that there are unpaired electrons and/or non-filled subshells, it is often the case that the various electrons in the solid will contribute magnetic <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> point in different, random directions, so that the material will not be magnetic.|$|E

25|$|Slivenski {{was part}} of two other memorable Hardcore TV <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> year. On December 13, he was {{scheduled}} to face Mr. Hughes but the lights unexpectedly went out, and when they came back on again, the entire ECW locker room was engaged in a brawl in the ring. A week later, Slivenski was brought out by Terry Funk as a mock Sabu impersonator and attacked by Funk. When Sabu's then manager Paul E. Dangerously confronted Funk, he was chased off. In front of a sold-out crowd at the ECW Arena, Slivenski scored an upset victory over Pitbull #1 in his ECW debut at Holiday Hell '93 on December 26, 1993. When his opponent continued attacking him after the match, The Sandman came to his rescue. This match aired on ECW Hardcore TV three days later.|$|E
25|$|Filming of {{an episode}} can usually take a {{considerable}} amount of time to be done and as such, each task is usually filmed back-to-back, rather than weekly as it appears in the broadcast schedule for a series. For each episode, four television crews are used to follow the candidates during a task, and often are focused on picking up on mistakes and issues between candidates, than on their overall performance. The final edit of an episode often trims down a task that took 2–3 days to be done, to fit it within approximately about half of what will be televised for that episode, meaning candidates may appear to make minimal contributions when in reality they made more, while others may not feature as much if Lord Sugar or his advisers feel they did well and completed their duties, as emphasis is often put on <b>moments</b> <b>that</b> can be entertaining for audiences. Often the filming of an episode can hamper the efforts of candidates in a task, due to film crews usually having to get filming permission first from the respective owner of a store or establishment, which can often be a time consuming and cumbersome process as a result, whilst the strict rules of the BBC on product placement and advertising mean candidates have to approach businesses with care when asking them for help.|$|E
