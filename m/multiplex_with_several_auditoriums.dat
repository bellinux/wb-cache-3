It also allows for longer studies (minimally toxic to living cells), works for adherents cells and bacteria/fungi. Besides standard applications as cell culture assays (cell counting, cell proliferation assays) and cytotoxicity testing, it also can be <b>multiplexed</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> chemiluminescent assays, such as cytokine assays, caspase assays to measure apoptosis, or reporter assays to measure a gene or a protein expression.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of jointly {{optimizing}} linear transmit and receive filters for a multi-user MIMO system, under the assumption that all users have individual Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) requirements. Each user can perform spatial <b>multiplexing</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> data streams (layers). All users and layers are coupled by interference, so the choice of filters is intricately interwoven with the power allocation strategy. The design goal is to minimize the total power subject to MMSE constraints. This results in a non-convex problem formulation, for which we propose an iterative al-gorithm. The iteration consists of alternating optimization of powers, transmit filters and receive filters. We prove that the total required power obtained by the algorithm is monotoni-cally decreasing and converges to a limit. 1...|$|R

A DS3 signal is multiplexed from 28 individual DS1 signals in a bit-interleaved fashion, with framing and overhead at determined intervals.

40|$|Reverse genetic {{approaches}} to understanding gene function would be greatly facilitated {{by increasing the}} efficiency of methods for isolating mutants without the reliance on a predicted phenotype. Established PCR-based methods of isolating deletion mutants are widely {{used for this purpose}} in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, these methods are inefficient at isolating small deletions. We report here a novel modification of PCR-based methods, employing thermostable restriction enzymes to block the synthesis of wild-type PCR product, so that only the deletion PCR product is amplified. This modification greatly increases the efficiency of isolating small targeted deletions in C. elegans. Using this method six new deletion strains were isolated from a small screen of approximately 400 [*] 000 haploid genomes, most with deletions < 1. 0 kb. Greater PCR detection sensitivity by this modification permitted ∼ 10 -fold greater pooling of DNA samples, reducing the effort and reagents required for screens. In addition, effective suppression of non-specific amplification allowed <b>multiplexing</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> independent primer pairs. The increased efficiency of this technique makes it more practical for small laboratories to undertake gene knock-out screens...|$|R
40|$|The online {{version of}} this article (doi: 10. 1007 /s 12686 - 014 - 0259 - 8) {{contains}} supplementary material, which is available to authorized usersRapid and accurate sex-identification of salmonids has remained an important challenge for aquaculture and wild population study and management. A molecular method looking for the presence of the male-specific sdY gene has recently been proposed. However, the size of the amplified fragment (similar to 500 pb) and the DNA revealing technique (agarose-gel electrophoresis) preclude its use on partially degraded DNA and in high-throughput population studies running smaller fragments on automated DNA analyzers. Here, we propose an improved molecular method based on the amplification of a shorter section of the sdY gene for sex-determination in Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Designed primers were <b>multiplexed</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> microsatellites and provided reliable sexing for 97 % of the individuals tested. We successfully applied this method to both fresh and archived tissues from 16 individuals (9 populations) of brown trout and 19 individuals (14 populations) of Atlantic salmon.

While the Kodiaks ended operations in 1990, a new Junior A team was proposed in 2006 by Global Spectrum, the contracted management company responsible for operating the city's new South Peace Community Multiplex which included the EnCana Events Centre, capable of hosting ice hockey events with a seating capacity of 4,500 people. The objective was to create an anchor tenant which could help fill the <b>Multiplex's</b> schedule <b>with</b> <b>several</b> dozen home games per year. The company recruited several Dawson Creek-based businessmen to form a non-profit society (eventually named the DC Rage Society) that would fund the start-up of the team.

40|$|Fringe-projection profilometry with 1 {{camera and}} 1 fringe-projector is a {{well-known}} and widely used technique in optical metrology. Spatial-frequency <b>multiplexing</b> interferometry <b>with</b> <b>several</b> spatial-carriers having non-overlapping spatial-spectra is also well known and productive in optical metrology. In this paper we propose temporal-multiplexing phase-shifting interferometry applied to profilometry. That is, instead of having fringe-patterns with well separated spatial-spectra, we propose instead to separate the fringe information in the temporal-spectra. In other words, we may have overlapping spatial-spectra, but separated in the temporal-spectra by frequency multiplexing. Using 1 -camera and several fringe-projectors one minimizes the object shadows and specular reflections from the digitizing solid. Temporal multiplexing profilometry allows us to illuminate the object from several projectors turned-on simultaneously. In previous phase-shifting co-phased profilometry, the projectors were turned-on and off sequentially. As seen in this work temporal-multiplexing allow us to demodulate the several fringe-patterns without crosstalk from other simultaneously projected fringes. This is entirely analogous to having several television stations broadcasting simultaneously, each TV-transmitter having its own broadcasting frequency. A given TV-receiver tunes into a single TV-station and filter-out all other broadcasters. Following this analogy, each fringe-projector must have its own temporal broadcasting frequency to remain well separated from all other projectors in the time-spectra domain. In addition to the general theory presented, we assess its feasibility with experimental results. Comment: 14 pages, 17 figure...|$|R

5000|$|The {{debut of}} ESPN in 1979 {{revolutionized}} the broadcasting of sports events. Within {{several years of}} ESPN's founding as a basic cable channel, it had developed a stable of sports broadcasts ranging from major leagues to oddities. ESPN has since grown into a massive <b>multiplexed</b> network, <b>with</b> <b>several</b> channels and a large news bureau {{that has led to}} the network bestowing the title of [...] "Worldwide Leader in Sports" [...] upon itself. Cable, and later digital cable and satellite, greatly expanded the number of channels (and, by extension, the room for broadcasting sports events) available on a given set, and also gave channels such as ESPN the ability to broadcast direct and nationwide, as opposed to dealing with local affiliates. Syndication networks gave way to regional sports networks, which carried broadcasts of local sports on a far greater scale than full-service broadcast stations could provide at the time; these combined with out-of-market sports packages (which debuted in the 1990s) allowed the carriage of these networks' sporting events across the country. However, with the increased availability of sports to broadcast came increasing rights fees, which could be recovered by the newly authorized practice of collecting retransmission consent fees from cable subscribers, which has led to numerous disputes and the dropping of channels from cable lineups. Individual leagues began launching their own networks in the 2000s; specialty networks of other sports have had varying levels of success.|$|R
