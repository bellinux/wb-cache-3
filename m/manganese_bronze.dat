40|$|Due to {{the failure}} of <b>manganese</b> {{aluminium}} <b>bronze</b> (MAB) propeller caused by dealloying corrosion as described in Part I [1], this work aims to study the prevention of dealloying corrosion using aluminium and zinc sacrificial anodes. The results indicated that both of the sacrificial anodes could prevent the propeller from dealloying. Moreover, the dealloying in seawater was less than that found in brackish water. It was possible that hydroxide ions, from cathodic reaction, reacted with calcium in seawater to form calcium carbonate film protecting the propeller from corrosion. ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{exchange}} for its motorcycle businesses, <b>Manganese</b> <b>Bronze</b> received BSA Group's non-motorcycle-related divisions—namely, Carbodies. Although the BSA name was {{left out of}} the new company's name, a few products continued to be made carrying it until 1973. [...] However, the plan involved the axing of some brands, large redundancies and consolidation of production at two sites. This scheme to rescue and combine Norton, BSA and Triumph failed in the face of worker resistance. Norton's and BSA's factories were eventually shut down, while Triumph staggered on to fail four years later.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Powder {{metallurgy}} is {{a conventional}} technique for making engineering articles from powders. Main {{objective is to}} produce final products with the highest possible uniform density, which depends on the initial loose powder characteristics. Producing, handling, characterizing and compacting materials in loose powder form {{are part of the}} manufacturing processes. Density of loose metallic or ceramic powder is an important parameter for die design. Loose powder density is required for calculating the exact mass of powder to fill the die cavity for producing intended green density of the powder compact. To fulfill this requirement of powder metallurgical processing, a loose powder density meter as per ASTM standards is designed and fabricated for measurement of density. The density of free flowing metallic powders can be determined using Hall flow meter funnel and density cup of 25 cm 3 volume. Density of metal powders like cobalt, <b>manganese,</b> spherical <b>bronze</b> and pure iron is measured and results are obtained with 99. 9 % accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Wire and Arc based Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) {{processes}} are novel {{technologies that are}} seen as promising candidates for fabricating complex 3 -Dimensional large scale components. These processes offer avenues to locally tailor metallurgy of the melt pool and thus produce functionally and compositionally graded components for improved performance in extreme conditions. This thesis explores in-situ alloying of commercial <b>Manganese</b> Aluminium <b>Bronze</b> (MAB) with copper rich Cu 3 Si filler wire during deposition, as a microstructure control strategy for designing components that are resistant against selective phase corrosion. Evolution of microstructure during WAAM processing of MAB and during in-situ alloying with Cu 3 Si wire is investigated using optical and electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and fluorescence. The microstructure of the as-deposited MAB bead is observed to change from continuous connected dual phase to cellular single phase upon controlled addition of Cu 3 Si in a MAB melt pool. Corrosion tests showed reduced severity of surface attack and an improvement {{in the rate of}} corrosion by 3 times for the new alloy. Thus this technique can be used in industries to improve corrosion resistance as an energy efficient alternative of conventional high temperature aging treatments. Additionally, the possibilities of improving mechanical behaviour of the new alloy (cellular single phase) are explored using the principles of grain refinement in the context of WAAM...|$|R

A modified layer {{with a single}} β-phase structure and with highly refined and homogenized grains was obtained. Under favorable laser processing conditions (Power = 1 kW; Scanning velocity = 35 mm/s; Spot diameter = 2 mm) the microhardness was increased by 2 times and the cavitation erosion resistance in 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution was increased by 5. 8 times. This was even {{higher than that of}} Nickel Aluminium Bronze (NAB). For as-received MAB, the SEM micrographs of the surface taken at an early stage of the cavitation erosion and general corrosion tests revealed that the iron/manganese-rich κΙ phase and the α/κΙ interface were initiation sites of damage. On the other hand, attack was much milder in the laser melted samples and started at the triple junctions of the grain boundaries. The corrosion current density in 3. 5 wt% NaCl was also improved after laser surface melting, with a reduction from 9. 54 μA/cm 2 to 4. 26 μA/cm 2. The corrosion potential also shifted in the noble direction by about 80 mV. It could be concluded that the improvement in both cavitation erosion and corrosion resistance was in particular attributable to homogenization and refinement of the microstructure.

2500|$|The final BSA {{range was}} just four models: Gold Star 500, 650 Thunderbolt/Lightning and the 750 cc Rocket Three. By 1972, BSA was so moribund that, with {{bankruptcy}} imminent, its motorcycle businesses were merged (as {{part of a}} government-initiated rescue plan) with the <b>Manganese</b> <b>Bronze</b> company, Norton-Villiers, to become NVT, headed by Dennis Poore. [...] The intention was to produce and market Norton and Triumph motorcycles at home and abroad; but Poore's rationalisation led to redundancies of two-thirds of the workforce. [...] In response, the Triumph workers at Meriden {{set up their own}} cooperative. [...] This left Poore with neither BSA nor Triumph, [...] and the sole NVT model was the Norton Commando. [...] Although this machine won the Motor Cycle News [...] "Bike of the Year" [...] award for several years running, nothing could hide the fact that the Commando was an old design, being a pre-unit pushrod parallel-twin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engines and}} {{coal-fired}} boilers were installed in August. Pearce used steel for the powerplant and <b>manganese</b> <b>bronze</b> for the propellers {{and claimed that}} his engines were the world's most powerful for their weight. Back in Russia, terrorists were hunting down Alexander II, and the British press rumored that the Livadia [...] "was about to be blown by the Nihilists' infernal machines". According to The Herald of Glasgow, Russian authorities notified Glasgow police of a plot to place nitroglycerin time bombs into the ship's coal bunkers. The coal was unloaded, the divers examined {{the bottom of the}} ship and found no trace of the bomb or the three alleged terrorists. The Livadia did suffer an explosion - her boilers ruptured during cold pressure tests. The accident was traced back to hot bending of the Livadias boiler plates. It became a textbook example of unacceptable practice and instilled [...] "a very justifiable dread of bending such plates while hot" [...] into contemporary boilermakers. Despite this setback, the Livadia was completely fitted out in three months.|$|E

2500|$|Urged to {{challenge}} again in yet larger boat sizes, Dunraven challenged again in 1895 with a [...] waterline limit. The Watson designed challenger Valkyrie III received many innovations: She would be {{wider than the}} defender, and featured the first steel mast. The NYYC ordered another defender from Herreshoff, which he had built in a closed off hangar and launched at night so as to conceal her construction: Defender used an aluminium topside riveted to steel frames and <b>manganese</b> <b>bronze</b> below waters. This saved 17 tons of displacement, but later subjected the boat to extreme electrolysis after the Cup races. Valkyrie III lost the first race, was deemed disqualified in the second race following a collision with Defender before the start line despite finishing first, and in turn withdrew from the contest. The unraveling of the races left Dunraven in a bitter disagreement with all parties over fairness of the cup committee concerning claims. After he asserted {{that he had been}} cheated, his honorary membership of the NYYC was revoked. Henry [...] "Hank" [...] Coleman Haff, was inducted into America's Cup Hall of Fame in 2004 for his sailing of Defender in 1895 and bringing the cup back.
