In his autobiography Coffin remarked, [...] "I resign <b>my</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> declare {{the operations of the}} Underground Railroad at an end." [...] Historians consider Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, published in 1876, among the best firsthand accounts of the Underground Railroad.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} was particularly contentious. Sampson contrasted his humble roots with Beckham's aristocratic ones, declaring [...] "I'm just plain old Flem. When I'm elected governor of Kentucky, come into <b>my</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> {{sit down and}} say 'Howdy Flem'." [...] He also trumpeted his own moral purity, claiming he [...] "never smoked, chewed, drank, gamblednot even bet on an election." [...] He promised, however, to protect horse racing in the Commonwealth. In response, Sampson's opponents dubbed him [...] "Flem-Flam Flem".|$|E
500|$|At one point, Chabon {{submitted}} a 672-page draft to his agent and editor, who disliked the work. Chabon had problems dropping the novel, though. [...] "It was really scary," [...] he said later. [...] "I'd already {{signed a contract}} and been paid all this money. And then I'd gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife. My instincts were telling me, This book is fucked. Just drop it. But I didn't, because I thought, What if I {{have to give the}} money back?" [...] "I used to go down to <b>my</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> fantasize about all the books I could write instead." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{comes back}} to me that on the {{following}} day my successor in the governorship of the jail, who he was I know not now, arrived, and that to him in due form I handed over <b>my</b> <b>offices</b> <b>and</b> duties. Before I did so, however, I made it my care to release Barnabas, I think on the previous evening. In his cell I read the Augusta's warrant to the old bishop.|$|R

500|$|His law {{practice}} increased greatly from this exposure, {{as did the}} demands on his time. In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone at <b>my</b> <b>Office,</b> <b>and</b> no where else. I never could in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E
500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to <b>my</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to put her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E

Revelli.” [...] Revelli sat down and said, “I want you to know that I coach my band exactly the same way you coach your football team. We’ll have discipline, and we’ll do it the way it’s supposed to be done!” [...] Revelli added, [...] "Anything you need from me or the band, all you need to do is ask." ...|$|E

I would be awarded the rank of a [...] "Untersturmfuehrer" [...] (lieutenant) and it were [...] a very definite desire of Himmler that I attend his invitation to join.|$|E
2500|$|Psychoanalysts {{today do}} not regard {{cross-dressing}} by {{itself as a}} psychological problem, unless it interferes with a person's life. [...] "For instance," [...] said Dr. Joseph Merlino, senior editor of Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius, [...] "...I'm a cross-dresser and I don't {{want to keep it}} confined to my circle of friends, or my party circle, and I want to take that to my wife and I don't understand why she doesn't accept it, or I take it to <b>my</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> I don't understand why they don't accept it, then it's become a problem because it's interfering with my relationships and environment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Spitzer responded at a July 23 {{press conference}} that [...] "As governor, I am {{accountable}} for {{what goes on in}} the executive branch and I accept responsibility for the actions of my office" [...] and that his administration had [...] "grossly mishandled" [...] the situation. Spitzer subsequently announced that he would indefinitely suspend his communications director, Darren Dopp, and reassign another top official. When questioned about his promise to bring ethical responsibility to state politics, Spitzer responded by saying [...] "I will not tolerate this behavior", [...] "ethics and accountability must and will remain rigorous in my administration," [...] and that [...] "I have always stated that I want ethics and integrity to be the hallmarks of my administration. That is why I requested that the State Inspector General review the allegations with respect to <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> that is why we have fully cooperated with both inquiries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} work on Escape from L.A., John Carpenter {{was thinking about}} quitting filmmaking because [...] "it stopped being fun". Largo Entertainment approached him with a project called Vampires, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Steakley. They gave him two screenplays; each by Don Jakoby and Dan Mazur, respectively. Carpenter read both screenplays and the novel, and he saw the potential for a film he'd been interested in making. [...] "I went into <b>my</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> thought, 'It's going to be set in the American southwest and it's a western – Howard Hawks.'" [...] Vampires gave Carpenter the chance to do a western disguised as a horror film," [...] he said. [...] "The story is set up like a western. It's about killers for hire. They're a western cliché. In this movie they’re paid to kill vampires." [...] In terms of tone and look, Carpenter felt that his film was [...] "a little more like The Wild Bunch than Hawks in its style, but the feelings and the whole ending scene is a kind of replay on Red River." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parks {{recorded}} {{only two}} albums during the 1970s, {{but he had}} performed on numerous albums recorded by friends who were working in or around the Los Angeles music scene—notably Harry Nilsson, whom Parks considered the [...] "smartest guy" [...] he had ever met in the music business. During the early 1970s, Parks dealt with prescription drug abuse. He would later say of himself as being [...] "dead for five years", and spent {{the first half of}} the decade [...] "trying to regain an interest in living." [...] Parks later stated, [...] "When I was head of audio-visual services and on the A staff at Warner Bros., a man came into <b>my</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> he had a snake and his name was Alice. Right then, I knew that my days were numbered as a person really interested in the record business." [...] Speaking about his department during this time, Parks stated, [...] "I provided that each artist would get 25% of the net profits of the rentals or sales. It was going to be a very promising market for the artist. Warners soon tired of what I thought was a fair equation of participation in creative profits, and basically isolated me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Farnam laughed. [...] "On the whole, {{it might}} be better to leave the {{cartridges}} out. If somebody did break in, all you need do would be to pretend you were asleep.

6000|$|... "All this {{is getting}} {{monotonous}} to you but let me finish when I can." [...] Savine waited a moment to regain his breath. [...] "I cheated the nurse and doctor to-day, and I'll be very like a dead man to-morrow. You must go down to <b>my</b> <b>offices</b> <b>and</b> overhaul everything; then come right back and we'll {{see if we can}} make a deal. I'll have my proposition fixed up straight and square, but this is the gist of it. While doing your best for your own advantage, hold Julius Savine's name clean before the world, win the most possible for Helen out of the wreck, and rush through the reclamation scheme--which is the key to all." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Loser" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} in March 1993 as a 12" [...] vinyl single on Bong Load, with only 500 copies pressed. Beck felt that [...] "Loser" [...] was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock's insistence. [...] "Loser" [...] unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where college radio station KXLU {{was the first}} to play it, followed by modern rock station KROQ-FM. The song then spread to Seattle through KNDD, and KROQ-FM began playing the song on an almost hourly basis. By the time stations in New York were requesting copies of [...] "Loser", Bong Load had already run out. Beck was soon beset with offers to sign with major labels. Convinced that the song was a potential hit, Rothrock gave a vinyl pressing of the single to his friend Tony Berg, who had been working in the A department for Geffen Records. Berg said, [...] "I just lost my mind when I heard it. He left <b>my</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> I swear, {{by the time he got}} home, I had left a message asking him to introduce me to [...] ". Beck, in spite of his hesitance to be on any major label, signed with Geffen subsidiary DGC. He explained, [...] "I wasn't going to do anything for a long time, but Bong Load didn't have the means to make as many copies as people wanted. Geffen were involved and they wanted to make it to more of an organized place, one with a bigger budget and better distribution." ...|$|E
