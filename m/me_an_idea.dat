25|$|What a book Melville has written! It gives <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of {{much greater}} power than his {{preceding}} ones. It hardly {{seemed to me}} that the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points.|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 2008, keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore {{posted a}} news update to the {{official}} Chroma Key website. In it, he stated {{that he had been}} working with guitarist Jim Matheos on a third OSI album [...] "for several months now, slowly but surely." [...] Moore later stated that with OSI, he and Matheos [...] "usually play it by ear. We never really know if we're going to do another OSI, we never agree on it. I don't remember ever agreeing to start a new one, really. But Jim will send <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> or something and we just start talking about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1878, Gilbert {{realised}} {{a lifelong}} dream to play Harlequin, {{which he did}} at the Gaiety Theatre {{as part of an}} amateur charity production of The Forty Thieves, partly written by himself. [...] Gilbert trained for Harlequin's stylised dancing with his friend John D'Auban, who had arranged the dances for some of his plays and would choreograph most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] Producer John Hollingshead later remembered, [...] "the gem of the performance was the grimly earnest and determined Harlequin of W. S. Gilbert. It gave <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of what Oliver Cromwell would have made of the character." [...] Another member of the cast recalled that Gilbert was tirelessly enthusiastic about the piece and often invited the cast to his home for dinner extra rehearsals. [...] "A pleasanter, more genial, or agreeable companion than he was it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to find." [...] In 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre, so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study. Gilbert had referred to the new technology in Pinafore in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service.|$|E

6000|$|My heart misgave <b>me.</b> <b>A</b> hateful <b>idea</b> {{arose in}} it. Could my sweet {{travelling}} companion be engaged--to my father's murderer? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I CONGRATULATE you, Mr. Germaine, on {{your power}} of {{painting}} in words. Your description gives <b>me</b> <b>a</b> vivid <b>idea</b> of Mrs. Van Brandt." ...|$|R
2500|$|I have in <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of God. [...] This {{idea has}} {{infinite}} objective reality.|$|E
2500|$|On October 18, 1851, The Whale was {{published}} in Britain in three volumes, and on November 14 Moby-Dick appeared in the United States as a single volume. In between these dates, on October 22, 1851, the Melvilles' second child, Stanwix, was born. On December 1 Hawthorne wrote a letter of appraisal to Duyckinck, prompted in part by his disagreement with the review in Literary World: [...] "What a book Melville has written! It gives <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of much greater power than his preceding ones. It hardly {{seemed to me that}} the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points." ...|$|E
2500|$|McGuire {{claimed he}} {{came up with the idea}} when he was {{catching}} for pitcher Hank O'Day at Toledo in 1884. [...] McGuire said that O'Day [...] "threw the heaviest and hardest ball I ever caught", and that O'Day's [...] pitches [...] "came like a shell from a cannon." [...] McGuire recalled: [...] "The reinforced full-fingered catcher's glove had just come into use the year before. [...] One day on my way to that old Toledo park on Monroe Street, I passed a butcher pounding round steak. It gave <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> and I went in and bought a lot of it. I put a piece of it in my glove at the start of every inning, and Hank's pitches beat that steak into a pulp." [...] McGuire's wife recalled her husband using [...] "a piece of beefsteak" [...] and noted: [...] "At game's end it would be hamburger." ...|$|E
60|$|This gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> new <b>idea.</b> Why {{not escape}} through the floor? To pry up another board would perhaps {{be easier than}} to force the door.|$|R
6000|$|... [And to give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> just <b>idea</b> of {{the force}} of his organ, he set off [...] laughing, with {{violence}} enough to break the windows of the [...] coffee-house, and to interrupt the chess-players.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what are}} you {{to do about the}} dancing?" [...] said Fanny, with an air of dismay on her face which flattered <b>me</b> with <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that she did care whether I danced or no.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless me! I {{forgot that}} the feud might {{last more than}} one evening. Give <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> Pris," [...] and Polly's triumph ended suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well said, Barney,' says I. 'You've given <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea.</b> I'll report later. Something's got to {{be pulled}} off quick, or we'll both starve.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, old friend; {{you have}} given <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> already," [...] I said to Benjamin. [...] "Have you got a Directory in your house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have given}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{wonderful}} <b>idea</b> of your story," [...] she murmured. [...] "Nothing has charmed {{me so much}} for a long while. Now the only thing which I am curious about is the style." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you have}} met {{this one with}} a {{firmness}} of mind and correctness of feeling which give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> high <b>idea</b> of your worth," [...] the Prince said solemnly. [...] "You have now only to persevere--to persevere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my boy," [...] said my host, [...] "we {{have the}} house and the night to ourselves. Let <b>me</b> have <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of how your affairs stand, and I will see {{what can be done to}} set them in order. I wish to hear every detail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would hardly}} do that, Bill," [...] said the young man, smiling {{in spite of}} himself. [...] "But you've given <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> and I'll work it out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The devil it is!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "I'll come, Ralph. I shall motor to Norwich, {{and catch}} the eight o'clock. Could you give <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of what it is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{told you}} once--writing children's fairy stories. Now I don't {{want you to}} be bothered about it, but I do wish you could give <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> where to send them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad of it. I can obey my {{instincts}} now, {{and see him}} no more. Personally he is distasteful to <b>me!</b> I had <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> he was honest! It is nothing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know," [...] he said, [...] "I fancy {{this young}} man's {{got what they}} call on this side <b>a</b> 'down' on <b>me!</b> He's got <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that I'm <b>a</b> crook--follows <b>me</b> about; doesn't give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> moment's peace, in fact. Say, Mr. Inspector, can't I put this thing right somehow--take him to my banker's--" ...|$|R
60|$|That {{seemed to}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> very good <b>idea,</b> for {{there might be}} many chances against our {{slipping}} away after the British had landed, and I urged that the change of base be made without delay.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} ask you," [...] she said. [...] "You live in Theos, and you can give <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea.</b> What is there that I can send Prince Ughtred for a {{coronation}} present?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is enough!" [...] Sir Sidney said. [...] "Now, can you roughly give <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> what {{proportion}} of European goods, dried fruits, {{and what we}} may call generally Eastern goods, you have?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was wondering, sir," [...] he said, in a {{confidential}} whisper, [...] "whether {{you could not}} give <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> as to who the lady was who called herself Stephen Hurd's daughter in Paris six years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{this strange}} {{exhibition}} gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good <b>idea</b> and set me to thinking. If everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely afraid of Merlin's pretended magic as Clarence was, certainly a superior man like me {{ought to be}} shrewd enough to contrive some way {{to take advantage of}} such a state of things. I went on thinking, and worked out a plan. Then I said: ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{engaging}} indeed, {{and gave}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good <b>idea</b> {{of our future}} correspondence; and, in short, as I could not refrain treating him with more kindness than I had done before, so one thing begetting another, I gave him several testimonies that I was entirely his own by inclination {{as well as by}} the common obligation of a mistress, and this pleased him exceedingly.|$|R
6000|$|KING. [...] "'I {{should not}} value the money; if money would content her Majesty, I would give more.'... Here {{was a long}} pause, which I did not break;"--nor would the King.

6000|$|... "Well, no," [...] she answered. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth though, I am quite a {{stranger}} in London, and {{it occurred to me that}} Mr. Courtlaw might have been able to give <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> where to stop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad, at any rate, to {{hear you}} talk of settling. Madame Merle had given <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that you were of a rather roving disposition. I thought she spoke of your having some plan of going round the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid," [...] {{interposed}} Lydia, [...] "that I've {{not been}} about {{enough for you}} to give <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> from other places. We always go to Greenfield to do our trading; and I've been to Keene and Springfield a good many times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want the}} team, if I {{can get it}} at a {{reasonable}} figure; they're real good beasts with the imported Percheron strain strong in them," [...] he said. [...] "It will {{be a while before}} they're put up, and I'd be glad if you could ride round and let Flora know what's keeping <b>me.</b> I'd <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> she expected there might be some trouble to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{think it}} {{unavoidable}} for every considering, rational creature, that will but examine his own {{or any other}} existence, to have {{the notion of an}} eternal, wise Being, who had no beginning: and such <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of infinite duration I am sure I have. But this negation of a beginning, being but the negation of a positive thing, scarce gives <b>me</b> <b>a</b> positive <b>idea</b> of infinity; which, whenever I endeavour to extend my thoughts to, I confess myself at a loss, and I find I cannot attain any clear comprehension of it.|$|R
60|$|It struck <b>me</b> as <b>a</b> {{sporting}} <b>idea.</b> In my enthusiasm I {{offered to}} accompany him, and wait outside the shop. I said I thought that Harris {{would like to}} be in it, too--or rather outside.|$|R
