500|$|People {{connected}} with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: [...] "I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was <b>my</b> <b>immediate</b> reaction, in other words, incredibly raw." [...] Gary Smith, {{who at the time}} was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he [...] "was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record." [...] Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production [...] "sounded way better than the other ones." ...|$|E

These fears were also shared by James who revealed that the front rows of the gigs that the band were performing at during the Britpop years were primarily attracting 15-year-old girls and that he thought the change in style was a [...] "fucking big balls move." [...] Andy Ross, who was running Food Records at the time, admitted that when he first heard it he was [...] "taken aback. We'd won Brits, we'd won two consecutive Q magazine Albums of the Year and my initial reaction was it's awkward and difficult. <b>My</b> <b>immediate</b> reaction was will you sell as many records?

On that front enemy is served by broad–gauge railway with good lateral {{communications}} and apparently ideal ground for defence. Broad–gauge railway would put him on level with me as regards numbers that could be maintained. I should require 16 or 18 divisions besides my mounted corps to ensure success against Damascus–Beirut line if strongly held, but this is probably more than my railway could support. My estimate is made on the supposition enemy will make use of his broad-gauge railway to its full capacity. I would point out that Aleppo is 350miles distant and my single line of railway advances {{about half a mile}} a day. Railhead of my double line is at Bir el Mazar, but the doubling of railway has had to be stopped during my present advance.

Suddenly, Box observes that Cox must surely be his long-lost brother, and Cox says {{that he was about to}} make the same observation: Box asks if Cox has a strawberry mark on his left arm. Cox replies that he does not. That settles it: they are long-lost brothers. In a brief finale, they agree that they will remain in the room for good, with Bouncer adding a [...] "Rataplan!"

He continued to live at the house in Devon, until suffering a fatal myocardial infarction on 28 October 1998 while undergoing hospital treatment for colon cancer in Southwark, London. His funeral was held on 3 November 1998, at North Tawton church, and he was cremated in Exeter. Speaking at the funeral, fellow poet Seamus Heaney, said: [...] "No death outside <b>my</b> <b>immediate</b> family has left me feeling more bereft. No death in my lifetime has hurt poets more. He was a tower of tenderness and strength, a great arch under which the least of poetry's children could enter and feel secure. His creative powers were, as Shakespeare said, still crescent. By his death, the veil of poetry is rent and the walls of learning broken." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1834, Lee was {{transferred}} to Washington as General Gratiot's assistant. Lee had hoped to rent a house in Washington for his family, but {{was not able to}} find one; the family lived at Arlington, though Lieutenant Lee rented a room at a Washington boarding house for when the roads were impassable. In mid-1835, Lee was assigned to assist Andrew Talcott in surveying the southern border of Michigan. While on that expedition, he responded to a letter from an ill Mary Lee, which had requested he come to Arlington, [...] "But why do you urge <b>my</b> <b>immediate</b> return, & tempt one in the strongest manner...

[...] Lee completed the assignment and returned to his post in Washington, finding his wife ill at Ravensworth.

Thomas Tull said, 'I {{would love to see}} Hellboy 3.' He didn't say he would love to do it he just said he'd like to see it, but today, I'll ask him." [...] Ron Perlman added his support for the idea, stating: [...] "Not just anybody can make this movie. I loved working for Legendary and I know for Guillermo working on Pacific Rim was one of his greatest experiences. The reason I loved working for them is because Guillermo was so happy. I came in six months into the shoot and he seemed as fresh as a daisy, simply because he was working for someone who appreciated and supported his outlandish visions of what he wanted to put on the screen. <b>My</b> <b>immediate,</b> silent wish was, wouldn't it be great if these guys came in and helped resolve the Hellboy series." ...|$|E
