It is possible to influence the amount of aggregate produced during the cell culture and purification process by carefully controlling the environment (eg, media components) and implementing appro-priate strategies to minimize the extent of aggregation. Steps to remove aggregates have been successfully used at a manufacturing scale. Care should be taken when developing a process to <b>monitor</b> the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the equipment and process with the protein to ensure that potential aggregation is minimized...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} research on technology acceptance, while acknowledging {{the importance of}} individual beliefs about the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> a technology, has produced equivocal results. This study focuses on further theoretical {{and empirical}} development of this important belief in technology acceptance. Specifically, unlike prior research which has examined only one aspect <b>of</b> <b>compatibility,</b> we provide a more comprehensive conceptual definition that views compatibility as a multi-dimensional construct. Based on the conceptual definition <b>of</b> <b>compatibility,</b> we develop operational measures of the multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>compatibility.</b> The model is tested using the World Wide Web (WWW) as the target innovation. Scale validation indicates that the operational measures <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> developed in this study have acceptable psychometric properties and confirmatory factor analysis supports the multi-dimensional structure of this construct. We then assess the nomological validity of this construct by situating it within the Technology Acceptance Model. In contrast to prior research which has regarded beliefs <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> as an independent antecedent of attitude, we posit causal linkages among the three beliefs <b>of</b> <b>compatibility,</b> usefulness, and ease of use. Results largely support the theorized relationships. 1 ON THE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL NATURE OF COMPATIBILIT...|$|R

5000|$|This {{buffer zone}} is {{typically}} what is exploited to achieve higher active resolutions {{in the various}} custom screen modes, by deliberately reducing porch widths and using the freed-up scan time for active pixels instead. This technique can achieve an absolute maximum of 704 pixels horizontally in 25 MHz mode and 792 at 28 MHz without altering the actual sync width (in real-world cases, e.g. with 800 pixel wide mode, the sync pulse would be shortened and a small porch area left in place to prevent obvious visual artefacting), {{and as much as}} 523 or 447 lines at the standard 60 and 70 Hz refresh rates (again, it is usually necessary to leave SOME porch lines intact, hence the usual maximum of 410 or 512 lines at these rates, and the 50 Hz maximum being 600 lines rather than 626). Conveniently, the practical limits of these techniques are not quite high enough to overflow the available memory capacity of typical 256 KB cards (800×600 consuming 235 KB, and even the theoretical 832×624 requiring [...] "only" [...] 254 KB), so the only concerns remain those <b>of</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>compatibility.</b>|$|R

The notion <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> symplectic structures is a key aspect of bi-Hamiltonian systems.

In this paper we show that, under some additional assumptions, compatibility in the sense of Magri implies a notion <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> due to Fassò and Ratiu, that we dub bi-affine compatibility.
