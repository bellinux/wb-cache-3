5|$|The {{use of the}} Book of Common Prayer {{became law}} in 1549. King Edward's half-sister, Mary Tudor, de facto had licence to {{continue}} hearing mass in private. So {{soon as he was}} in power, Dudley put pressure on her to stop her from allowing her entire household and flocks of visitors to attend. Mary, who in her turn did not tolerate the Book of Common Prayer in any of her residences, was not prepared to make any concessions. She planned to flee the country but then could not <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind in the last minute. Mary denied Edward's personal interest in the issue and entirely blamed John Dudley for her troubles. After a meeting with King and Council, in which she was told that what mattered was not her faith but her disobedience to the law, she sent the Imperial ambassador de Scheyfye to threaten war on England. The English government could not swallow a war threat from an ambassador who had stepped out of his commission, {{but at the same time}} would not risk all-important commercial ties with the Habsburg Netherlands, so an embassy was sent to Brussels and some of Mary's household officers were arrested. On his next visit to the Council, de Scheyfye was informed by the Earl of Warwick that the King of England had as much authority at 14 as he had at 40—Dudley was alluding to Mary's refusal to accept Edward's demands on grounds of his young age. In the end a silent compromise came into effect: Mary continued to hear mass in a more private manner, while augmenting her landed property by exchanges with the Crown.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Page {{moved to}} New York City, where {{she hoped to}} find work as an actress. In the meantime, she {{supported}} herself by working as a secretary overlooking Rockefeller Center. In 1950, while walking alone along the Coney Island shore, Bettie met NYPD Officer Jerry Tibbs, who was an avid photographer, and he gave Bettie his card. He suggested she'd make a good pin-up model, and in exchange for allowing him to photograph her, he'd help <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> first pin-up portfolio, free of charge. It was Officer Tibbs who suggested to Bettie that she style her hair with bangs in front, to keep light from reflecting off her high forehead when being photographed. Bangs soon became {{an integral part of}} her distinctive look.|$|E

500|$|Kaali {{is often}} shown {{standing}} {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest. This represents an episode where Kaali {{was out of control}} on the battlefield, such that she was about to destroy the entire universe. [...] Shiva pacified her by laying down under her foot, both to receive her blessing, but also to pacify and calm her. Shiva is sometimes shown with a blissful smile on his face. She is typically shown with a garland of severed heads, often numbering fifty. This can symbolize the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet and therefore as the primordial sound of Aum from which all creation proceeds. The severed arms which <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> skirt represent her devotee's karma that she has taken on.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} {{he goes to}} the play himself and sees his lover at a play called First Love; for him this is a sign, like a four leaf clover, that she must be the one. But {{confusion}} sets in for the poor girl because of mistaken identity. She is unable to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind about love and says, [...] "The first love is the true love, and one loves only once." [...] But Kierkegaard says this is sophistry [...] "because the category first, {{is at the same time}} a qualitative and a numerical category." [...] Her first impression of love, when she was eight, has become decisive for her whole life. [...] Now she can love only to a certain degree because she's comparing each new experience with the past experience. Kierkegaard discussed this again in 1845.|$|E

[...] Chopra described both her character and herself as being [...] "outspoken and fun loving" [...] as well as honest and unable to [...] "hide something that is wrong". She said she had a different cultural background to Sweety, and found it challenging to convincingly portray a Maharashtrian Marathi girl. She had to adopt body language and a Maharashtrian accent to suit the character. She learnt the Marathi language to make the character as authentic as possible, which she found difficult as a Punjabi. Chopra said: [...] "I am speaking a lot of Marathi in the film. It was difficult for me because it's a difficult language and I am not good at Marathi. But I think it's my luck that through Kaminey I got to learn one more language." ...|$|E

500|$|Conceivably, Olga was {{initially}} either {{open to the}} possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> mind. Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf Zahle, at the end of October 1925: [...] "My feeling is that she is not the one she believes—but one can't say she is not as a fact". However, within a month she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, [...] "There is no resemblance, and she is undoubtedly not A." [...] Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia. Olga later said she sent the gift and letters [...] "out of pity", and called the claims [...] "a complete fabrication". When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper, Anderson's supporters, Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin, claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony. She told her official biographer, [...] "I never received any such telegram."

By the episode's end she has {{decided to take a}} break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. [...] He glumly turns to his Gollum figurine and asks it, [...] "Well, Gollum, you're an expert on rings, what do I do with this one?", while simultaneously taking his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom, out of this desk drawer.

[...] He tells them that he has narrowed things down to 3 options, the first being a chance to play the harp with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the second being an all-expense paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's ornithophobia is nothing compares to his Ovinophobia, the fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in coitus, at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. In the tenth season, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility. Afterwards, they decide to move in together permanently.
