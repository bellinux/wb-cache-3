2500|$|John Renshaw Carson in 1915 did {{the first}} {{mathematical}} analysis of amplitude modulation, showing that a signal and carrier frequency combined in a nonlinear device would create two sidebands {{on either side of}} the carrier frequency, and passing the <b>modulated</b> <b>signal</b> through another nonlinear device would extract the original baseband signal. [...] His analysis also showed only one sideband was necessary to transmit the audio signal, and Carson patented single-sideband modulation (SSB) on 1 December 1915. This more advanced variant of amplitude modulation was adopted by AT for longwave transatlantic telephone service beginning 7 January 1927. [...] After WW2 it was developed by the military for aircraft communication.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{course a}} useful {{modulation}} signal m(t) will generally not {{consist of a}} single sine wave, as treated above. However, by the principle of Fourier decomposition, m(t) can be expressed as the sum {{of a number of}} sine waves of various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Carrying out the multiplication of [...] 1+m(t) with c(t) as above then yields a result consisting of a sum of sine waves. Again the carrier c(t) is present unchanged, but for each frequency component of m at fi there are two sidebands at frequencies fc + fi and [...] fc - fi. The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband, and those below constitute the lower sideband. In a slightly different way of looking at it, we can consider the modulation m(t) to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components (as results from a formal Fourier transform of a real valued quantity) as shown in the top of Fig. 2. Then one can view the sidebands as that modulation m(t) having simply been shifted in frequency by fc as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2 (formally, the <b>modulated</b> <b>signal</b> also contains identical components at negative frequencies, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 2 for completeness).|$|E

40|$|A simple {{technique}} for decoding an unknown modulated chaotic time-series is presented.

This method is simple and easy to implement in hardware. Indexing terms: chaotic time-series, secure communication (PACS: 05. 45). Secure communication using chaos has received much attention recently. Various methods for modulating and demodulating a chaotic oscillator have been proposed (see [1] and references cited in [2]). There are two ways to hide the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> inside the chaotic carrier signal. One way is to add a small <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> to the chaotic carrier signal whose amplitude is much larger. This is called chaotic masking. In this case, power is wasted in the carrier.

However, it has also been pointed out that secure communication using chaos can be broken ([3],[4]). The first method in [3] is specific to the Lorenz oscillator case.

40|$|Regularly sampled {{pulse width}} {{modulation}} (PWM) has been a mainstay of the power electronics community {{since the advent of}} digital controllers. In this form of PWM the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> is sampled only at either the peaks and/or the troughs of the triangular carrier waveform, then held constant until the next sampling instant, which allows ample time for the calculation of switching instants. Unfortunately, it produces phase and amplitude distortion of the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> that can be significant at low pulse numbers. In applications where the desired <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> is not known a priori, this phase delay can become a critical limitation. The analogue alternative to regular sampling is naturally sampled PWM, where the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal</b> is permitted to vary as a continuous waveform. This form of PWM does not apply any phase or amplitude distortion to the <b>modulating</b> <b>signal.</b> True natural sampling is, however, impossible to implement on the digital control platforms that are used in modern power electronics applications. In this paper, a type of hold circuit known as a First-Order Hold (FOH) circuit is used in conjunction with the technique known as resampled regular PWM to improve upon the limitations of regular sampling. It is found that this augmentation to the PWM strategy improves both the linearity and phase delay of the modulator as well as (for high pulse numbers) harmonic performance.
