40|$|Introduction: Every {{dental health}} {{professional}} {{should have the}} essential knowledge to identify, assess and manage a potentially life-threatening situation. Aim: To assess the experience, awareness, and perceptions about <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> among dental interns in Chennai city, India. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study carried out in four randomly selected dental colleges of Chennai city. Data were collected using a self-administered, structured, closed-ended 20 -item questionnaire. It consists of questions on experience of <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> encountered by interns during their graduation, awareness of the essential drugs and equipment, the amount of <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> training undertaken by participants, preparedness of interns in handling <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test, were used. Results: Out of 335 interns, 157 (47 %) said that syncope {{was the most common}} <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> event encountered by the interns. Regarding awareness about essential drugs, about 161 (48 %) study participants answered oxygen, epinephrine, nitroglycerin, antihistamine, salbutamol, and aspirin as emergency drugs. About half of the study participants, 187 (56 %) were aware that pressure should be given to the affected site, with or without suturing if the greater palatine artery is inadvertently cut. The majority of the interns (93 %) preferred to have a specified training on the handling of <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> in dental practice. Conclusions: Syncope was the most common <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> event.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> {{can occur}} {{frequently}} in dental setting. Effective management {{of an emergency}} situation in the dental office is ultimately the dentist's responsibility. The lack of training and inability to cope with <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> can lead to tragic consequences and sometimes legal action. For this reason, all health professionals including dentists must be well prepared to attend to <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Providing basic life support [BLS] is dentist's most important contribution until definitive treatment for a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> can be given. Hence the study is aimed to assess the dental graduates (Interns) knowledge, skills and competency regarding dentistry-medical emergency interface. Methodology: Data were collected from 105 Interns of two dental colleges of Belgaum City using a structured questionnaire consisting of 7 item questionnaire (6 closed and 1 open ended). Results: Overall in all the years, syncope / faint was seen by 40. 9 % of the respondents, 37. 1 % with hypoglycemic attacks, allergic reactions by 17. 1 %, epileptic attacks by 7. 6 %, asthmatic attacks by 4. 5 % and angina 0. 9 %. The frequencies of the emergencies encountered were once or even more. Knowledge {{of the presence of}} drugs and equipments in the emergency drug kit and the confidence in regard to use them was low. <b>Medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> training were undertaken by 42 % respondents, but in varying degrees. There was a desire for further <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> training by majority of respondents. Conclusion: The study showed that syncope is the commonest <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> event. Dental graduates had a superficial knowledge of <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies,</b> drugs and equipments. Emphasis is placed on the need for more <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> training to be offered, to increase knowledge and confidence of dental graduates (Interns) in the management of medical emergencie...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{develops}} {{the concept of}} epistemological alignment {{as a means of}} understanding how the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> entered into biomedical classification. The working hypothesis is that the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> could not develop as a paradigm from which knowledge could proliferate until a series of related concepts had been elucidated, and its epistemology became aligned. This argument is advanced by exploring the historically constructed lexicon of the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency’s</b> key components. In the process, a semantic network created by 18 th-century attempts to problematize sudden death is elucidated and explored. The paper concludes by arguing that the First World War served as a catalyst for the alignment of concepts central to the epistemology of the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} ability of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team {{criteria}} and the National Early Warning Score to discriminate cardiac arrest, unanticipated ICU admission and death within 24 hours of a vital signs measurement, and to quantify the associated workload. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A large U. K. National Health Service District General Hospital. PATIENTS: Adults hospitalized from May 25, 2011, to December 31, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We applied the National Early Warning Score and 44 sets of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria to a database of 2, 245, 778 vital signs sets (103, 998 admissions). The National Early Warning Score's performance was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve and compared with sensitivity/specificity for different <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (95 % CI) for the National Early Warning Score for the combined outcome (i. e., death, cardiac arrest, or unanticipated ICU admission) was 0. 88 (0. 88 - 0. 88). A National Early Warning Score value of 7 had sensitivity/specificity values of 44. 5 % and 97. 4 %, respectively. For the 44 sets of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria studied, sensitivity ranged from 19. 6 % to 71. 2 % and specificity from 71. 5 % to 98. 5 %. For all outcomes, {{the position of the}} National Early Warning Score receiver-operating characteristic curve was above and to the left of all <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria points, indicating better discrimination. Similarly, the positions of all <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team criteria points were above and {{to the left of the}} National Early Warning Score efficiency curve, indicating higher workloads (trigger rates). CONCLUSIONS: When <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team systems are compared to a National Early Warning Score value of greater than or equal to 7, some <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team systems have a higher sensitivity than National Early Warning Score values of greater than or equal to 7. However, all of these <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> team systems have a lower specificity and would generate greater workloads...|$|R

We hypothesized that fourth-year medical students feel inadequately prepared to lend assistance during in-flight <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> This multicenter study of two U.

Questions included baseline knowledge of in-flight medicine (10 questions) and perceived {{ability to respond to}} in-flight <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Results: 229 participants completed the survey (75 % response rate). The average score on the fund of knowledge questions was 64 %. Responses to the 5 -point Likert scale questions indicated that, on average, students did not feel confident or competent responding to an in-flight <b>medical</b> <b>emergency.</b> Participants on average also disagreed with statements that they had adequate understanding of supplies, flight crew training, and ground-based management. Conclusion: This multicenter survey indicates that fourth-year medical students do not feel adequately prepared to respond to in-flight <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> and may have sub-optimal knowledge. This study provides an initial step in identifying a deficiency in current medical education.  [West J Emerg Med. 2014; 15 (7) :– 0. ]...|$|R
