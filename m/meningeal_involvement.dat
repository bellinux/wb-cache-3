40|$|International audienceCryptococcosis is {{a serious}} infection, {{possibly}} lethal, of worldwide distribution. It mainly affects immunosuppressed patients resulting with pulmonary and/or <b>meningeal</b> <b>involvements</b> or disseminated infections. Due to the rarity of visceral and osseous infections, and {{to the absence of}} specific clinical symptoms, this diagnosis is often deferred. Resulting of diagnostic errors, samples are often directed to the department of pathology and more rarely to the department of mycology. Histopathological examination appears crucial, highlighting encapsulated yeasts with alcian blue staining. Once the diagnosis is performed, an appropriate antifungal therapy must be quickly introduced because these infections are associated with a high mortality rate. The aim of our work was to report five extra-cerebral and extra-pulmonary cryptococcosis cases, to describe their histopathological features, to evoke diagnostic techniques and to discuss the differential diagnoses...|$|R
40|$|Mortality rate in tuberculous {{meningitis}} may reach from 50 % to 70 % if not treated at early stages. This study consists of 142 patients admitted Dicle University of Pediatrics clinic {{and who were}} examined regularly in the clinic. Of theese patients, 91 (64 %) were male and 51 (36 %) female. Patient ages ranged between five months and 15 years old. Cranial tomographies images of patients were obtained within {{the first three days}} and cranial magnetic resonance imaging were obtained within the first ten days of admittance. Cranial tomography findings include hydrocephalus in 134 (134 / 142) patients (91. 7 %), cerebral infarct and brain edema in 14 patients (10. 4 %), <b>meningeal</b> and paranchimal <b>involvement</b> in 13 patients (9. 7 %), basal cisterna involvement in 11 patients (8. 2 %), cerebral atrophy in eight patients (5. 9 %) and tuberculoma in seven patients (5. 2 %), Three patients (2. 2 %) were to be found normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imagingotomografiained from 33 patients (most common findings) determined hydrocephalus in 75. 7 % of the patients. <b>Meningeal</b> and paranchimal <b>involvement</b> in 48. 4 %, basal cisterna involvement in 45. 4 %, cerebral infarct in 30. 2 %, tuberculoma in 15. 1 %, cerebral atrophy in 6. 0 % percent of the patients were determined respectively.

40|$|International audiencePseudotumoral lesions are {{uncommon}} {{but important}} to identity lesions. They can occur during inflammatory diseases (systemic diseases, vasculitis, demyelinating diseases), infectious, and vascular diseases. Also, {{in a patient}} with a treated tumor, pseudo-progression and radionecrosis must be differentiated from the tumoral development. Diagnosis can be difficult on an MRI scan, but some MRI aspects in conventional sequences, diffusion, perfusion and spectroscopy can suggest the pseudotumoral origin of a lesion. Imaging must be interpreted according to the context, the clinic and the biology. The presence of associated intracranial lesions can orientate towards a systemic or infectious disease. A T 2 hyposignal lesion suggests granulomatosis or histiocytosis, especially if a <b>meningeal</b> or hypothalamic-pituitary <b>involvement</b> is associated.

Since the shed form of L-selectin (sL-selectin) is frequently increased in acute leukaemia (sL-selectin+ leukaemia), we examined whether assay of sL-selectin in CSF could improve our ability to detect such <b>meningeal</b> <b>involvement.</b> CSF sL-selectin was significantly (p < 0. 001) higher in 15 patients with sL-selectin+ meningeal leukaemia (median 60 ng/mL, range 34 - 150) than in 20 patients with acute leukaemia without <b>meningeal</b> <b>involvement</b> (12 ng/mL, 1 - 39) or 88 control patients (14 ng/mL, 0 - 37). Serial measurements of sL-selectin in patients with sL-selectin+ leukaemic meningitis showed increased CSF concentrations of the cleaved receptor in 4 patients with therapy-resistant meningeal leukaemia and sustained normal concentrations in 9 patients in remission.

40|$|Objective: Histiocytosis is a {{systemic}} disease that usually affects {{the central nervous}} system. The {{aim of this study}} is to discuss the neuroimaging characteristics of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), the most common of these diseases; and the non-Langerhans cells histiocytosis (NLCH), which includes entities such as hemophagocytic syndrome, Erdheim-Chester and Rosai-Dorfman diseases. Method: Literature review and illustrative cases with pathologic confirmation. Results: In LCH, the most common findings are 1) osseous lesions in the craniofacial bones and/or skull base; 2) intracranial, extra-axial changes; 3) intra-axial parenchymal changes (white and gray matter); 4) atrophy.

40|$|Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is {{the most}} common {{parasitic}} disease of the central nervous system. Several drugs, such as drugs against tapeworms, praziquantel or albendazole associated to corticosteroids, have been tested for the treatment of this condition. Although some have claimed the reduction or involution of cystic or granulomatous lesions, there is no consensus about the efficacy of these treatments. The natural evolution of the disease is not clear and this hampers the assessment of treatment effects. Moreover, there are no good imaging or clinical indicators that can predict the progression or spontaneous resolution of lesions, specially at the meningeal or ventricular compartment. Therefore, evidence based medicine does not have a definitive answer about the treatment, neither of seizures, the most common manifestation of NCC, or the varied and complex <b>meningeal</b> and ventricular <b>involvement.</b> This review includes experts opinions to give the clinician some clues for decision making in the treatment of NC...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is {{protected}} by several barriers, including the blood–brain (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSFB) barriers. Understanding how cancer cells circumvent these protective barriers to invade the CNS is of crucial interest, since brain metastasis during cancer is often a fatal event in both children and adults. However, whereas much effort has been invested in elucidating the process of tumor cell transmigration across the BBB, {{the role of the}} BCSFB might still be underestimated considering the significant number of <b>meningeal</b> cancer <b>involvement.</b> Our work aimed to investigate the transmigration of neuroblastoma cells across the BCSFB in vitro. Methods: We used an inverted model of the human BCSFB presenting proper restrictive features including adequate expression of tight-junction proteins, low permeability to integrity markers, and high trans-epithelial electrical resistance. Two different human neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY 5 Y and IMR- 32) were used to study the transmigration process by fluorescent microscopy analysis. Results: The results show that neuroblastoma cells are able to actively cross the tight human in vitro BCSFB model within 24  h. The presence and transmigration of neuroblastoma cancer cells did not affect the barrier integrity within the duration of the experiment. Conclusions: In conclusion, we presume that the choroid plexus might be an underestimated site of CNS invasion, since neuroblastoma cell lines are able to actively cross a choroid plexus epithelial cell layer. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of tumor cell transmigration in vitro and in vivo...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This paper {{aimed at}} {{studying}} presentations {{of the central}} nervous system (CNS) lymphoma using structural images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: The MRI features at presentation of 15 patients diagnosed with CNS lymphoma in a university hospital, between January 1999 and March 2011, were analyzed by frequency and cross tabulation. RESULTS: All patients had supratentorial lesions; and four had infra- and supratentorial lesions. The signal intensity on T 1 and T 2 weighted images was predominantly hypo- or isointense. In the T 2 weighted images, single lesions were associated with a hypointense signal component. Six patients presented necrosis, all of them showed perilesional abnormal white matter, nine had <b>meningeal</b> <b>involvement,</b> and five had subependymal spread.

40|$|Lymphomas {{that develop}} in human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infected patients are predominantly aggressive B-cells lymphomas. The most common HIV-associated lymphomas include Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (that often involves the CNS), primary effusion lymphoma, and plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). Of these, PBL is relatively uncommon and displays a distinct affinity for presentation in the oral cavity. In this manuscript we report a previously undescribed primary leptomeningeal form of PBL in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A 40 -year-old HIV positive man presented with acute onset confusion, emesis, and altered mental status. Lumbar puncture showed numerous nucleated cells with atypical plasmocyte predominance. CSF flowcytometry showed kappa restriction with CD 8 and CD 38 positivity and negative lymphocyte markers, while the MRI showed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement. As the extensive systemic work-up failed to reveal any disease outside the brain, an en bloc diagnostic brain and meningeal biopsy was performed. The biopsy specimen showed sheets of plasmacytoid cells {{with one or more}} large nuclei, prominent nuclear chromatin, scattered mitoses, and abundant cytoplasm, highly suggestive of plasmablastic lymphoma. HIV-associated malignancies have protean and often confusing presentations, which pose diagnostic difficulties posed to the practicing neurological-surgeons. Even in cases where an infectious cause is suspected for the <b>meningeal</b> enhancement, neoplastic <b>involvement</b> should be considered, and cytology and flow-cytometry should be routinely ordered on the CSF samples. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|R

The sequence was given on day 1 and 8 irrespective {{of the degree of}} myelosuppression. Of 22 {{patients with}} leukemia there was only one who was absolutely refractory to therapy. Complete remission was induced in 3 patients with ANLL (30 %) and in 3 with ALL (30 %). Three patients became hypoplastic but recovered with blasts and 12 died from infection, complicated by intracranial hemorrhage in 3, during hypoplasia. Of 8 patients with lymphoma, 2 were clearly refractory to therapy, one died from sepsis and the remaining 5 all entered remission (2 CR + 3 PR, 62 %). Activity of HiDAC/ASP against CNS disease is suggested by the clinical response seen in patients with overt <b>meningeal</b> or intracerebral <b>involvement.</b> Toxicity associated with HiDAC/ASP was mainly hematologic. All but one patient experienced hypoplasia and severe pancytopenia; documented infections and major hemorrhages occurred in 80 and 20 % of patients respectively.
