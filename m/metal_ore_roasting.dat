40|$|Abstract. Rapid {{reduction}} roasting of {{low grade}} manganese carbonate ore by coal and biomass fuels from Hunan, China was investigated. Magnetic separation behaviors and magnetic properties of raw manganese <b>ore</b> and <b>roasted</b> manganese <b>ores</b> were analyzed. After reduction by coal and biomass fuels, the manganese ores demonstrate a new Mn-Fe oxide phase, showing obvious mixed magnetic behaviors of ferromagnet and paramagnet, and the magnetic susceptibilities of <b>roasting</b> <b>ores</b> rapidly increase to almost two {{orders of magnitude}} in comparison of the raw ores. The results show that magnetizing roasting technology could enhanced the magnetic properties of the manganese ores about two orders of magnitude higher than raw manganese <b>ore</b> at low <b>roasting</b> temperature. Thereby, we deduce that the weak magnetic separation combined with high magnetic separation could be adequate for <b>roasted</b> manganese <b>ore</b> to satisfy the requirement of electrolytic manganese industry. Application of biomass in manganese <b>ore</b> <b>roasting</b> process is promising to the effective use of biomass and for decreasing the consumption of fossil fuels in the manganese industry...|$|R
