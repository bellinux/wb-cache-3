25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

500|$|Steiger was so {{devoted to}} his craft that during the 1970s he turned to many foreign productions, {{especially}} in Italy, to obtain the sort of roles he desired, but often clashed with directors over his method acting techniques. In {{one of his last}} interviews, Steiger said: [...] "What is the greatest thing an artist in any profession can give to a person?—that would be a constructive, warm memory. Because that gets into your brain and therefore into your life, so to speak. And that's it, when somebody says to me 'I'll never forget', that's worth <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> five Academy Awards, I'm in that person's life".|$|E

500|$|Rowntree {{stated that}} the band decided to give Coxon a much freer hand on Blur. Street also {{observed}} a change of Albarn's writing style, as he [...] "was much more prepared to write in the first person, rather than about interesting characters. I think [...] grown a bit and was prepared to start writing about his own experiences rather than transposing them on to a character like Tracy Jacks or Dan Abnormal." [...] Coxon agreed, and felt [...] "Damon's songs were revealing <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> to him" [...] and {{said that when he}} heard some of his home demos he realised [...] "he'd obviously gone off his head a bit more". The album features the first song to appear on a studio album in which Coxon not only wrote the lyrics, but also sang lead vocal—"You're So Great".|$|E
500|$|While Burger's Daughter {{was still}} banned in South Africa, a copy was smuggled into Nelson Mandela's prison cell on Robben Island, {{and later a}} message was sent out {{saying that he had}} [...] "thought well of it". Gordimer said, [...] "That means <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> any other opinion it could have gained." [...] Mandela also {{requested}} a meeting with her, and she applied several times to visit him on the Island, but was declined each time. She was, however, at the prison gates waiting for him when he was released in 1990, and she was amongst the first he wanted to talk to. In 2007 Gordimer sent Mandela an inscribed copy of Burger's Daughter to [...] "replace the 'imprisoned' copy", and in it she thanked him for his opinion of the book, and for [...] "untiringly leading the struggle".|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{had three}} {{children}}: Billie Ann {{by his first}} wife; David and Steven by his second wife Charlotte Blythe Dunn, and no children with his third wife Elaine (née Lewis). Steve Dunn also became a successful horse trainer, winning two World Grand Championships, the first before his father won one. Steve Dunn's winning horses were Motown Magic in 1989, and Out On Parole in 2002. Bud and Steve Dunn remain the only father and son to win World Grand Championships within the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. When Bud won his first World Grand Championship in 1992, three years after his son's first, Steve said, [...] "I think him winning meant <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> when I won it." [...] Bud Dunn said of his partnership with Steve, [...] "I always wanted him to work out here. But ain't many fathers and sons ever got along that long." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lucy Stone, who {{did much}} of the {{organizational}} work for the national conventions, encouraged Anthony to take {{over some of the}} responsibility for them. Anthony resisted at first, feeling that she was needed more in the field of anti-slavery activities. After organizing a series of anti-slavery meetings in the winter of 1857, Anthony told a friend that, [...] "the experience of the last winter is worth <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> all my temperance and woman's rights work, though the latter were the school necessary to bring me into the antislavery work." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{reviewer}} commented {{about the}} play's score, that [...] "its tough wisecracking lyrics are as tersely all-knowing as its melody, which is nailed down in brassy syncopated lines {{that have been}} copied—but never equaled in sheer melodic memorability—by hundreds of theater composers ever since." [...] Singer and musicologist, Susannah McCorkle writes that the score [...] "meant <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> ever, now that I knew that he wrote it after a grueling world tour and years of separation from his wife and daughters." [...] Historian and composer Alec Wilder says that the perfection of the score, when compared to his earlier works, was [...] "a profound shock." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{overwhelmingly}} positive British {{response to}} the film led to its critical and commercial success throughout Europe. Derek Malcolm of Cosmopolitan wrote, [...] " [...] is fast {{becoming one of the}} cult movies of the year ... The great virtue of the film is the way it grabs hold of its audience and simply refuses to let go. It exploits all our fears of irrational violence and unmotivated attack, {{and at the same time}} manages to laugh at itself without spoiling the tension - a very considerable feat. Carpenter, who is clearly a director with places to go, has succeeded in making a comedy that scares the pants off us. And don't think you're laughing at it. As a matter of fact, it's laughing at you." [...] Malcolm later wrote that he held some reservations about the film: [...] "I don't feel like going on and on about the movie, partly because I think it is in grave danger of being oversold anyway, and partly because it isn't much <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> tremendous fun". The film broke one house record in the UK and was named one of the best films of the year by critics and moviegoers.|$|E

2500|$|Reznor {{possesses}} a baritone vocal range. He {{is a fan}} of David Bowie, and has cited Bowie's 1977 album Low as one of his favorite albums. Reznor has stated that he played the album constantly during the recording of The Downward Spiral for inspiration. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails toured as a co-headlining act on the North American leg of David Bowie's Outside Tour. Reznor also appeared in Bowie's video for [...] "I'm Afraid of Americans", cast as Bowie's stalker. Reznor also made several remixes for the single release of the same song, as well as a remix of [...] "The Hearts Filthy Lesson". Reznor also states in the 2010 documentary [...] that the band Rush had played a major part in his childhood influences. He also stated that he considered Rush to be [...] "one of the best bands ever" [...] and had gained a perspective on how keyboards could be introduced into hard rock after listening to their 1982 album Signals. Reznor also stated [...] "Freddie Mercury's death meant <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>than</b> John Lennon's" [...] and covered Queen's [...] "Get Down Make Love", which was produced by Paul Barker and Al Jourgensen of Ministry and released on the single for [...] "Sin". He also expressed the significant influence that Coil had on his work, saying that Horse Rotorvator was [...] "deeply influential". In many interviews with Musician, Spin, and Alternative Press, Reznor mentioned Devo, The Cars, The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Pere Ubu, Soft Cell, Prince, Ministry, Gary Numan, and The Cure's 1985 album, The Head on the Door, as important influences. According to Todd Rundgren, Reznor told him that he listened to Rundgren's 1973 album, A Wizard, a True Star with [...] "great regularity". In a radio interview, Reznor stated the first song he ever wrote [...] "Down in It" [...] was a [...] "total rip-off" [...] of the Skinny Puppy song [...] "Dig It." ...|$|E
