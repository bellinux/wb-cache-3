5|$|Mackintosh's party, {{which left}} the ship {{on the morning}} of 3 January, {{consisted}} of Mackintosh and three sailors, with a sledge containing supplies and a large <b>mailbag.</b> Two sailors quickly returned to the ship, while Mackintosh and one companion went forward. They camped on the ice that evening, only to find next day that the whole area around them had broken up. After a desperate dash over the moving floes, they managed to reach a small glacier tongue. They camped there, and waited for several days for their snow-blindness to subside. When their vision returned, they found that Cape Royds was in sight but inaccessible, as the sea-ice leading to it had gone, leaving a stretch of open water. They {{had little choice but to}} make for the hut by land, a dangerous undertaking without appropriate equipment and experience.|$|E

25|$|Two more anthrax letters, {{bearing the}} same Trenton postmark, were dated October 9, {{three weeks after}} the first mailing. The letters were {{addressed}} to two Democratic Senators, Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. At the time, Daschle was the Senate Majority leader and Leahy was head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Daschle letter was opened by an aide, Grant Leslie, on October 15, and the government mail service was shut down. The unopened Leahy letter was discovered in an impounded <b>mailbag</b> on November 16. The Leahy letter had been misdirected to the State Department mail annex in Sterling, Virginia, because a ZIP code was misread; a postal worker there, David Hose, contracted inhalational anthrax.|$|E

2500|$|The word mail {{comes from}} the Medieval English word male, {{referring}} to a travelling bag or pack.|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com|year=2007|edition=Unabridged (v 1.1)|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mail}} It was spelled that way until the 17th century, and is distinct from the word male. The French have a similar word, malle for a trunk or large box, and m√°la is the Irish term for a bag. In the 17th century, the word mail began to appear as a reference for a bag that contained letters: [...] "bag full of letter" [...] (1654). Over the next hundred years the word mail began to be applied strictly to the letters themselves, and the sack as the <b>mailbag.</b> In the 19th century the British usually referred to mail as being letters that were being sent abroad (i.e. on a ship), and post as letters that were for localized delivery; in the UK the Royal Mail delivers the post, while in the U.S. the U.S. Postal Service delivers the mail. The term email (short for [...] "electronic mail") {{first appeared in the}} 1970s. The term snail-mail is a retronym to distinguish it from the quicker email. Various dates have been given for its first use.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{official}} experiment at flying Air Mail {{to be made}} {{under the aegis of}} the United States Post Office Department took place on September 23, 1911, on the first day of an International Air Meet sponsored by The Nassau Aviation Corporation of Long Island, when pilot Earle L. Ovington flew 640 letters and 1,280 postcards from the Aero Club of New York's airfield located on Nassau Boulevard near Stratford School in Garden City (Long Island), New York, to the nearby Mineola Post Office in Mineola, located less than six miles away. After being duly sworn in by U.S. Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock as the first U.S. Air Mail pilot in history, Ovington took off in his own American-made Bleriot Queen tractor-type monoplane, Dragonfly, at 5:26 PM and dropped the bag of mail over Mineola six minutes later from an altitude of 500 feet. Unfortunately the bag broke when it hit the ground, but all of the mail was eventually recovered and forwarded by regular channels with the cancellation reading [...] "AEROPLANE STATION No.1 ‚Äì GARDEN CITY ESTATES, N.Y." [...] Emphasizing the concept, in 1912 the United States printed a 20-cent stamp in the Parcel Post series showing a flying machine and titled, [...] "AEROPLANE CARRYING MAIL". [...] The <b>mailbag</b> behind the pilot is labeled [...] "No. 1".|$|E

Also in 2009, the couple's reunion was named one of the Top Nine General Hospital Moments of 2009, in conjunction with the promotion of the Academy Award nominated, musical-romantic film Nine. In 2010, the couple was included in an ABC daytime special three-hour program featuring classic couples. A scene from couple's post-prison 2010 reunion appeared on the ABC primetime drama Detroit 1-8-7. Also in 2010, the couple was featured in a Soap Opera Digest article on how soaps were bringing love in the afternoon back to the screen. Academy award nominated actor James Franco was involved in the couple's wedding. When their wedding date was announced on the official General Hospital Facebook, a social network created for fan feedback, the announcement was met with tremendous fan satisfaction and support. The anticipation of the fictional couple's wedding also spanned outside of the soap opera medium when they were featured in Cosmopolitan magazine and The Celebrity Bride Guide, which features articles on prominent celebrities and public figures.|$|E
2500|$|By January 1944, {{thanks to}} the {{documents}} sold by Bazna, Papen was reporting to Berlin that he knew everything about British efforts to bring Turkey into the war on the Allied side, {{and he had a}} document saying that Britain would focus on the Mediterranean until Operation Overlord was launched that spring. Papen guessed correctly that Operation Overlord was the liberation of France, as the document made it clear that Overlord would not be launched in the Mediterranean, but the document did not say just when and where Overlord would be launched, limiting its value. In January 1944, Papen had learned via the [...] "Cicero documents" [...] of a British plan to have the Royal Air Force use airfields in Turkey to bomb the oil fields of Ploie»ôti in Romania, which supplied Germany with most of its oil. Papen told the Turkish foreign minister H√ºseyin Numan Menemencioƒülu if the Turks allowed the RAF to use Turkish air fields to bomb Ploie»ôti, then the Luftwaffe would use its bases in Bulgaria and Greece to bomb Turkey, threatening that [...] "the least consequences would be the complete destruction of Istanbul and Izmir". Papen reported to Ribbentrop that {{thanks to the}} [...] "Cicero documents" [...] that [...] "this round in the campaign for Turkey has been won by us...a Balkan offensive could not now take place". The British code-breakers at Bletchley Park had intercepted messages from Papen to Ribbentrop and Hitler in January 1944 mentioning a spy code-named Cicero was working in German pay, but as Papen preferred to use the diplomatic <b>mailbag</b> to report information to Berlin, Bletchley Park could not reveal much. An American spy in the Ausw√§rtige Amt, Fritz Kolbe, told the OSS in February 1944 that someone in the British embassy in Ankara whose code-name was Cicero was selling secrets to Papen, which triggered an investigation that caused Bazna to break off contact. However, despite the intelligence sold by Bazna, the Allies were winning the war and on 20 April 1944, the Turks wishing to ingratiate themselves with the winners, ceased selling chrome to Germany. On 26 May 1944 Menemencioƒülu announced that Turkey was reducing exports to Germany by 50%, and on 2 August 1944 Turkey severed diplomatic relations with Germany, forcing Papen to return to Berlin.|$|E
