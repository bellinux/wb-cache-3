5|$|Early {{the next}} day, Tuesday, July 1, McClellan, having come from nearby Haxall's Landing the night before, {{examined}} his army's battle line on Malvern Hill. His inspection left him worried <b>most</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Union Army's right (eastern) flank, which lay behind Western Run. Western Run was an area necessary for McClellan's plans {{to relocate to}} Harrison's Landing, and he feared an attack might come from there. As a result, he posted the largest portion of his army there: two divisions from Edwin Sumner's II Corps, two divisions from Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman's III Corps, two divisions from Brig. Gen. William Franklin's VI Corps and one division from Maj. Gen. Erasmus Keyes's IV Corps, who were stationed across the James. The division under Brig. Gen. George McCall, badly damaged in the fighting at Glendale with McCall himself wounded and captured, was held in general reserve.|$|E
5|$|The Thousand-Year Door {{contains}} several characters, {{the majority}} of whom are not playable. Progression in the game is sometimes dependent on interaction with non-player characters, although many {{are used in the}} game's various subquests. In particular, the Goomba Professor Frankly, who knows the <b>most</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mysteries relating to Rogueport, must be visited every time Mario retrieves a Crystal Star. The game continues the tradition of Paper Mario, in which Mario can be accompanied by one assistant character at a set time. There are seven party members in total: Goombella the Goomba, Koops the Koopa, Madame Flurrie the wind spirit, a Yoshi (named by the player), Vivian the Shadow Siren, Admiral Bobbery the Bob-omb, and Ms. Mowz, who is available as an optional character.|$|E

Palps long and slender, some long hairs ventrally; article I rounded and somewhat salient laterally, inner 'ring' with dorsal tongue-like prolongation and ventrally semicircular and plate-like, the posterior {{margin of the}} plate extending beyond the palp; articles 2 and 3 with no apparent suture, 0.75- 0.85mm in length and about four times as long as wide, narrowly rounded distally. Hypostome lanceolate and bluntly pointed; dentition mainly 3/3, the innermost file of small, spaced teeth, basally 2/2.|$|E

25|$|Freud {{initiated}} the psychoanalytic critique of Surrealism with his remark that what interested him <b>most</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Surrealists {{was not their}} unconscious but their conscious. His meaning was that the manifestations of and experiments with psychic automatism highlighted by Surrealists as the liberation of the unconscious were highly structured by ego activity, similar to {{the activities of the}} dream censorship in dreams, and that therefore it was in principle a mistake to regard Surrealist poems and other art works as direct manifestations of the unconscious, when they were indeed highly shaped and processed by the ego. In this view, the Surrealists may have been producing great works, but they were products of the conscious, not the unconscious mind, and they deceived themselves with regard to what they were doing with the unconscious. In psychoanalysis proper, the unconscious does not just express itself automatically but can only be uncovered through the analysis of resistance and transference in the psychoanalytic process.|$|E
25|$|The 2000–01 season {{featured}} {{a drop of}} two points for the Centennials, but an improvement in the standings to second in the Interior Division. The Cents {{wound up with a}} record of 30–21–9 and 69 points. However, it wouldn't be the regular season that fans in Merritt would remember the <b>most</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> year, rather an improbable run to the Fred Page Cup Final. The Cents faced off against Prince George in the Interior Division opening round and promptly swept the Spruce Kings in four straight. They then met up in the Interior Conference final with the Penticton Panthers, who had finished the season first in the division, 29 points ahead of the Centennials. The first place Panthers proved to be no match for Merritt, as the Cents outscored Penticton 16 to 7 in a four-game sweep. Next up, it was the franchise's first appearance in the Fred Page Cup final, and it would be against the Victoria Salsa. Despite a thrilling seven game series, the Salsa took the BCHL championship on home ice. Forward Mike Ouelette provided a bright spot individually as he won BCHL Rookie of the Year for the Interior Conference.|$|E

However, Ron Gilbert {{did not intend}} for the {{relationship}} between the characters to develop in this way, stating that Elaine [...] "never really liked Guybrush and thought of him as more of a little brother".

500|$|By the 1980s, critics {{emphasised}} {{the power}} of the poem's message and technique, and it was seen as an important English poem. After analyzing the language of the poem, W. Hutchings declared in 1984, [...] "The epitaph, then, is still making us think, still disturbing us, even as it uses the language of conventional Christianity and conventional epitaphs. Gray does not want to round his poem off neatly, because death is an experience of which we cannot be certain, but also because the logic of his syntax demands continuity rather than completion." [...] Also in 1984, Anne Williams claimed, [...] "ever since publication it has been both popular and universally admired. Few readers then or now would dispute Dr. Johnson's appraisal... In the twentieth century we have remained eager to praise, yet praise has proved difficult; although tradition and general human experience affirm that the poem is a masterpiece, and although one could hardly wish a single word changed, it seems surprisingly resistant to analysis. It is lucid, and at first appears as seamless and smooth as monumental alabaster." [...] Harold Bloom, in 1987, claimed, [...] "What moves me <b>most</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> superb Elegy is the quality that, following Milton, it shares with so many of the major elegies down to Walt Whitman's... Call this quality the pathos of a poetic death-in-life, the fear that one either has lost one's gift before life has ebbed, or that one may lose life before the poetic gift has expressed itself fully. This strong pathos of Gray's Elegy achieves a central position as the antithetical tradition that truly mourns primarily a loss of the self." [...] In 1988, Morris Golden, after describing Gray as a [...] "poet's poet" [...] and places him [...] "within the pantheon of those poets with whom familiarity is inescapable for anyone educated in the English language" [...] declared that in [...] "the 'Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard,' mankind has felt itself to be directly addressed by a very sympathetic, human voice." [...] He later pointed out: [...] "Gray's 'Elegy' was universally admired in his lifetime and has remained continuously the most popular of mid-eighteenth-century English poems; it is, as Gosse has called it, the standard English poem. The reason for this extraordinary unanimity of praise are as varied as the ways in which poetry can appeal. The 'Elegy' is a beautiful technical accomplishment, as can be seen even in such details as the variation of the vowel sounds or the poet's rare discretion in the choice of adjectives and adverbs. Its phrasing is both elegant and memorable, as is evident from the incorporation of much of it into the living language." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{independence}} {{and after the}} independence of India, India has maintained such central British institutions as parliamentary government, one-person, one-vote {{and the rule of}} law through nonpartisan courts. It retained as well the institutional arrangements of the Raj such as district administration, universities and stock exchanges. One major change was the rejection of separate princely states. Metcalf shows that over the course of two centuries, British intellectuals and Indian specialists made the highest priority bringing peace, unity and good government to India. They offered many competing methods to reach the goal. [...] For example, Cornwallis recommended turning Bengali Zamindar into the sort of English landlords that controlled local affairs in England. Munro proposed to deal directly with the peasants. Sir William Jones and the Orientalists promoted Sanskrit, while Macaulay promoted the English language. [...] Zinkin argues that in the long-run, what matters <b>most</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> legacy of the Raj is the British political ideologies which the Indians took over after 1947, especially the belief in unity, democracy, the rule of law and a certain equality beyond caste and creed. Zinkin sees this not just in the Congress party but also among Hindu Nationalists in the Bharatiya Janata Party, which specifically emphasises Hindu traditions.|$|E
