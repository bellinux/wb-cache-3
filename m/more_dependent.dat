5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{is home to}} most of the state's population, and the area's {{fertile soil}} is used to grow a variety of crops.

Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west.

5|$|The volcano {{appears to}} be part of a north-south {{trending}} group of rhyolitic, silicic Quaternary volcanoes (including Puelche Volcanic Field, Laguna del Maule, and Volcán Domuyo) that veers off the north-northeast direction of the rest of the Andes. The directional formation of this belt corresponds to the fold-and-thrust movement of the nearby Malargüe fault, which formed in the Tertiary and remained active until the early Pliocene or late Miocene. This may suggest that Calabozos' activity is <b>more</b> <b>dependent</b> on local processes than subduction of the Nazca Plate.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in other}} areas soon began to be felt. The method of {{government}} after the conquest {{can be described as}} a feudal system, in that the new nobles held their lands on behalf of the king; in return for promising to provide military support and taking an oath of allegiance, called homage, they were granted lands termed a fief or an honour. Major nobles in turn granted lands to smaller landowners in return for homage and further military support, and eventually the peasantry held land in return for local labour services, creating a web of loyalties and resources enforced in part by new honorial courts. This system had been used in Normandy and concentrated more power in the king and the upper elite than the former Anglo-Saxon system of government. The practice of slavery declined in the years after the conquest, as the Normans considered the practice backward and contrary to the teachings of the church. The more prosperous peasants, however, lost influence and power as the Normans made holding land <b>more</b> <b>dependent</b> on providing labour services to the local lord. They sank down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree villeins or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor or seek alternative employment.|$|E
5|$|His 1555 {{election}} for Marlborough was similar, but <b>more</b> <b>dependent</b> on influential connections. Pleydell's father had once leased {{the lands of}} Thomas Seymour in the nearby parish of Eastrop (and possibly Preshute), establishing a relationship of trust between the families. After Seymour's brother Edward was executed in 1552, his widow Anne inherited the responsibility of maintaining the vast estates. The Duchess appointed Pleydell as chief ranger of Savernake Forest (then under her ownership) before 1554 and as her receiver general that year. His position as ranger probably led to the acquisition of property in Chippenham and Preshute, and {{his status as a}} Preshute landholder assisted him in becoming Member for Marlborough. Pleydell, serving with Sir Andrew Baynton, replaced Peter Taylor alias Perce and John Broke of the 1554 session; they were succeeded by William Daniell and William Fleetwood in 1558 after a parliamentary hiatus following the death of Queen Mary.|$|E

5|$|On October 7, 2014, {{the ports}} of Seattle and Tacoma {{formally}} announced {{their intention to}} move management of their marine cargo businesses to a joint alliance in March, ending decades of competition, because of increased threats from British Columbia and other ports. A full merger, including the two port commissions, was opposed by Tacoma, who feared that the more populous King County would have more votes on the combined commission than Pierce County, who were <b>more</b> <b>dependent</b> on the cargo port. In March 2015, the plan was pushed back to August while working on specifics of the alliance, including a decision on which legal entity it would fall under. The Washington State Legislature and Governor Jay Inslee approved {{the creation of a}} port development authority, similar to Washington's existing public development authority designation, in late April.|$|E
5|$|The whale ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the <b>more</b> <b>dependent</b> they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge {{sitting on top of}} its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore <b>more</b> <b>dependent</b> than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of justice and {{exchange}} theories, the authors propose that employees offset their levels of work–family conflict (WFC) with their levels of pay satisfaction. Results based on two waves of data indicate that pay satisfaction has a negative relationship with WFC after controlling for actual pay and other work-related and family-related variables. Analysis of pay satisfaction dimensions reveals that satisfaction with benefits and pay structure are negatively related to WFC, whereas satisfaction with pay level and pay raise are not. Number of dependents and level of education moderate the relationship between pay satisfaction and WFC; specifically, having <b>more</b> <b>dependents</b> and higher education attenuates the relationship between pay satisfaction and WFC...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses an {{experimental}} field approach {{to investigate the}} pro-social preferences and behavior of social services providers and the behavior of potential beneficiaries in Bogota, Colombia. Field experiments were conducted using games including a newly designed Distributive Dictator Game {{in order to examine}} traits and mechanisms guiding pro-sociality. Replicating the patterns of previous studies, individuals showed a preference for fair outcomes, positive levels of trust and reciprocity, and willingness to punish unfair outcomes. The results provide evidence that the poor trigger more pro-social behavior from all citizens, including public servants, but the latter display strategic generosity. Additional observations include a bias in favor of women and households with <b>more</b> <b>dependents,</b> but discriminatory behavior against stigmatized groups. ...|$|R
