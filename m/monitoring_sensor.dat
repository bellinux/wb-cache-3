40|$|Abstract — Network {{monitoring}} and measurement is commonly regarded as an essential function for understanding, managing and improving the performance and security of network infrastructures. Traditional passive network monitoring approaches are not adequate for fine-grained performance measurements nor for security applications. In addition, many applications would benefit from monitoring data gathered at multiple vantage points within a network infrastructure. This paper presents the design and implementation of DiMAPI, an application programming interface for distributed passive network monitoring. DiMAPI extends {{the notion of the}} network flow with the scope attribute, which enables flow creation and manipulation over a set of local and remote <b>monitoring</b> <b>sensors.</b> Experiments with a number of applications on top of DiMAPI show that it has reasonable performance, while the response latency is very close to the actual round trip time between the monitoring application and the <b>monitoring</b> <b>sensors.</b> A broad range of monitoring applications can benefit from DiMAPI to efficiently perform advanced monitoring tasks over a potentially large number of passive <b>monitoring</b> <b>sensors.</b> I...|$|R

These sensors are used to monitor the project during the dam construction and operation periods, and {{play an important role}} in reservoir safety operation and producing benefits. With the changing of operating environments and run-time of projects, there are some factors affecting the operation and management of projects, such as a certain amount of damaged sensors and instability of the measured data. Therefore, it is urgent to evaluate existing safety <b>monitoring</b> <b>sensors</b> in water conservancy and hydropower engineering projects.
