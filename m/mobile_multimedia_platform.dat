40|$|Abstract—Reliable and {{energy-efficient}} {{delivery of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> across different <b>platforms</b> and application scenarios is very challenging. Both open and proprietary standards exist worldwide; {{we focus on}} enhancements to the digital video broadcasting – handheld (DVB-H) standard for transmission over cooperative cellular networks, which {{enables the use of}} relaying to supplement existing fixed infrastructure. Cooperation creates a distributed form of multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems, resulting in breakthroughs in network energy efficiency and reliability. Thus, cooperative networks have an inherently green ad hoc topology that is able to substantially reduce infrastructure cost, system complexity and energy expenditure. In this paper, novel strategies are proposed and evaluated that combine: (1) fountain coding, e. g., Raptor codes at the application layer, and (2) network coding. Originally proposed for broadcasting over the Internet, the application of fountain codes to wireless cooperative communications networks has been limited to date. These codes enable lower (physical) layer compatibility. Network coding is used to reduce energy consumption by opportunistically recombining and rebroadcasting required combinations of packets. The energy cost of our peer-to-peer file repair sessions, which are integrated with the file delivery session itself, are quantified. Signal processing and modeling techniques used for cross-layer system simulations are also overviewed. I...|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{a paradigm}} shift promising a utility-based delivery of storage and processing capacity, services, and software over the Internet. In essence it aims to reduce costs, facilitate self-automated systems and decouple service delivery from underlying technology. Thus, the cloud paradigm empowers customers {{with the ability to}} focus on creating novel services alleviating the burden of software and hardware resource provisioning. The success of cloud computing in the domain of enterprise applications has sparked increasing interest in applying the same principles to the provision of <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> services. However, the potential benefits are far from being achieved, despite the rapid growth in popularity and omnipresence of <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> applications. The combination of cloud computing and <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> is non-trivial, and many aspects from system, <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> and user perspectives need to be considered. For example, mobile applications in the cloud involve a trade-off in terms of what should run on the device and what in the cloud, which is contingent to the application type, the device capability, data locality and the operating environment (network bandwidth, delay, cloud availability). Moreover, the traditional server/client programming models fail to provide seamless cloud execution in volatile mobile networks. Furthermore, distant cloud data centers induce prohibitive latency for certain classes of interactive mobile applications such as 3 D games and augmented reality. This dissertation investigates ways to efficiently apply the concepts of the emerging cloud computing paradigm in the design, development and delivery of <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> services. It describes an information systems architecture called CAELUS (Cloud Architecture for Enabling <b>Mobile</b> <b>Multimedia</b> Services) which includes both conceptual models and a concrete software platform. The conceptual models capture specific requirements for efficient building of <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> cloud services and guide the creation of the software platform (i 5 Cloud) which serves as a test bed of the CAELUS architecture. The contributions of this dissertation, in a addition to a comprehensive survey of literature, comprise a design view, platform and abstraction levels that lower the barrier for <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> services to leverage the clouds. Several case studies have evaluated the CAELUS-based development and delivery of <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> cloud services. In particular, the case studies were conveyed in the application domains of technology-enhanced learning, digital documentation in cultural heritage and human-computer interaction. Prototype applications together with technical evaluations and user studies demonstrate the validity and applicability of the architecture and the conceptual approach...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that besides {{the quality of}} service (QoS), the energy efficiency is also a key parameter in designing and evaluating <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> communication systems, which has catalyzed great interest in recent literature. In this paper, an energy efficiency model is first proposed for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> communication systems with statistical QoS constraints. Employing the channel matrix singular-value-decomposition (SVD) method, all subchannels are classified by their channel characteristics. Furthermore, the multi-channel joint optimization problem in conventional MIMO-OFDM communication systems {{is transformed into a}} multi-target single channel optimization problem by grouping all subchannels. Therefore, a closed-form solution of the energy efficiency optimization is derived for MIMO-OFDM mobile mlutimedia communication systems. As a consequence, an energy-efficiency optimized power allocation (EEOPA) algorithm is proposed to improve the energy efficiency of MIMO-OFDM <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> communication systems. Simulation comparisons validate that the proposed EEOPA algorithm can guarantee the required QoS with high energy efficiency in MIMO-OFDM <b>mobile</b> <b>multimedia</b> communication systems...|$|R
