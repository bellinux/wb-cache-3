I can give a perfect inventory of its contents: three kegs, a tin biscuit-box, an iron saucepan, several cocoa-shell cups, a lantern, and three bottles, probably containing oil; while the clothes {{of the family and}} a few mats were thrown across the open rafters. Upon my first meeting with this exile he had conceived for me one of the baseless island friendships, had given <b>me</b> <b>nuts</b> to drink, and carried me up the den 'to see my house'--the only entertainment that he had to offer. He liked the 'Amelican,' he said, and the 'Inglisman,' but the 'Flessman' was his abhorrence; and he was careful to explain that if he had thought us 'Fless,' we should have had none of his nuts, and never a sight of his house. His distaste for the French I can partly understand, but not at all his toleration of the Anglo- Saxon. The next day he brought me a pig, and some days later one of our party going ashore found him in act to bring a second. We were still strange to the islands; we were pained by the poor man's generosity, which he could ill afford, and, by a natural enough but quite unpardonable blunder, we refused the pig. Had Tari been a Marquesan we should have seen him no more; being what he was, the most mild, long-suffering, melancholy man, he took a revenge a hundred times more painful. Scarce had the canoe with the nine villagers put off from their farewell before the Casco was boarded from the other side. It was Tari; coming thus late because he had no canoe of his own, and had found it hard to borrow one; coming thus solitary (as indeed we always saw him), because he was a stranger in the land, and the dreariest of company. The rest of my family basely fled from the encounter. I must receive our injured friend alone; and the interview must have lasted hard upon an hour, for he was loath to tear himself away. 'You go 'way. I see you no more--no, sir!' he lamented; and then looking about him with rueful admiration, 'This goodee ship--no, sir!--goodee ship!' he would exclaim: the 'no, sir,' thrown out sharply through the nose upon a rising inflection, an echo from New Bedford and the fallacious whaler. From these expressions of grief and praise, he would return continually to the case of the rejected pig. 'I like give present all 'e same you,' he complained; 'only got pig: you no take him!' He was a poor man; he had no choice of gifts; he had only a pig, he repeated; and I had refused it.

He put all the instrumentation in place to perform the experiments, and throughout the experiment taught me to think and work systematically and effectively. I could have avoided many pitfalls and delays in that and subsequent experiments, had I followed his advice more diligently. Alex Groisman and Keith Matthews did some preliminary work on the knots project. In particular, Alex suggested the use of high-molecular weight PEG to increase viscosity without changing refraction index and also provided the initial oxygen scavenging recipe; the idea to use servo motors to control the optical elements was Keith’s. Theoretical predictions of knot sizes for the 71 knot, not published elsewhere, were kindly provided by Pietro Pieranski. He, Andrjez Stasiak, Doug Smith, Mei Wang, and Julius Su provided other helpful suggestions in the knots project. Members of the Quake group who taught me the art and craft of microfluidics included Emil Kartalov and Carl Hansen. The use of constrictions to control shear stress was suggested by Mike Diehl.
