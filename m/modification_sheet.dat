40|$|AbstractThe {{post-combustion}} capture (PCC) {{technology is}} a promising possibility to reduce CO 2 emissions of fossil fuel fired power plants. One of the main concerns for the PCC is the loss in electric power output. A reduction in efficiency penalty for solvent based PCC {{can be achieved by}} improving the solvent properties as well as by improving the process design. There are many different process flow <b>sheet</b> <b>modifications</b> with an improvement in process design reported in literature. In this work two of these modifications for a capture plant are evaluated. To be able to compare these process modifications it is necessary to evaluate them on identical solvent and process conditions. The modified processes are compared to base cases processing the flue gas from a supercritical pulverised coal fired power plant as well as a natural gas combined cycle power plant. The solvent used in the capture plant is a generic improved solvent, representing possible future solvents. The main advantages of the flow <b>sheet</b> <b>modifications</b> are pointed out. Subsequent, the specific reboiler heat duty, the specific cooling duty and the specific auxiliary power for the capture plant are shown for the flow <b>sheet</b> <b>modifications.</b> The overall efficiency penalties for the flow <b>sheet</b> <b>modifications</b> are compared and differences are highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Machine Notation, {{supported}} by the B-Toolkit. These specifications are built up piece by piece and may contain a number of complex interactions that {{can be difficult to}} navigate through. An investigation of graphical notations was carried out to highlight important features of abstract specifications in order to overcome some of the refinement problems. The chosen notation, HOOD (Hierarchical Object Oriented Design) method was used to provide an overview {{of the structure of the}} specification and identify important data flows through a specification. A few features of the HOOD notation are unsuitable for use on large specifications and there may be an overhead in using the notation but it has been shown to be useful. HOOD can be recommended as a way of focusing on the structure of the specification and the dependencies between components.

40|$|A novel polydopamine {{functionalized}} reduced graphene oxide/palladium (PDA-RGO/Pd) nanocomposite modified electrode was fabricated, {{and applied}} for the electrochemical determination of dopamine. The surface <b>modification</b> of GO <b>sheets</b> with PDA via a self-polymerization process {{and the formation of}} PDA-RGO/Pd composites were confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR and SEM. The electrocatalytic activity of PDA-RGO/Pd to the oxidation of dopamine was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry. The results showed that the anodic peak currents of DA were linearly proportional to its concentration in the range of 0. 05 to 1 mM with a detection limit of 6. 2 mu M (S/N = 3).

GO-g-PLLA can disperse homogeneously in the PLLA matrix, and the tensile test showed that the mechanical properties of GO-g-PLLA/PLLA were much better than that of GO/PLLA; compared with GO, only 3 % GO-g-PLLA content can realize a 37. 8 % increase in the tensile strength for their PLLA composites.

40|$|Invalidating conjectures of {{financial}} engineering by supervening events, the subprime crisis called for critical rationalism. Contract modification based on rebus sic stantibus would be its perfect legal translation. Since the crisis {{originated in the}} US, legal origins theory (LOT) should predict an adaptive solution based on judge-made law, but has remained silent so far. As a ruling on frustration of purpose in a previous economic crisis, Alcoa vs. Essex {{could serve as a}} precedent in American common law. Instead, the US relied on legislative, regulatory, executive, fiscal and monetary means, which LOT associates with “political channels” prevailing in civil law countries. We argue that judicial relief and legislation can interact functionally. Their slow process in the US and America’s backward real estate recording system has impeded rapid crisis resolution, however. To avoid the risk of a global version of Japan’s “lost decade”, we suggest banks apply rebus sic stantibus notionally. Negotiated contract <b>modification</b> and balance <b>sheet</b> adjustment, linked by a feedback loop, would maintain value in otherwise “toxic” mortgage-backed securities, mitigate losses, reduce new capital needs, avoid the cost of ever more foreclosures and provide a more focused stimulus to the economy than the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing.

30|$|The power {{conversion}} efficiencies of the above-mentioned solar cells are very low, and our previous report {{had shown that}} a HNO 3 treatment could enhance the efficiencies of CNT/n-Si solar cells [30]. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, HNO 3 treatment on MLG/a-C hybrid films had not been investigated yet. We believed that a HNO 3 treatment may have a similar effect on the above-mentioned solar cells. After the HNO 3 treatment, the efficiencies of the corresponding solar cells have improved to 0.004 %, 1.080 %, 0.800 %, and 0.820 %, respectively, as shown in Table 1. There are three main reasons for the efficiency improvement. Firstly, HNO 3 doping could enlarge the work function of MLG [31]; thus, a higher Voc is obtained after HNO 3 treatment (Table 1). Secondly, HNO 3 <b>modification</b> enhances the <b>sheet</b> conductance of the films, leading to a larger Jsc. The Rs of the 400 °C sample decreases from 9, 564 to 8, 572 Ω/sq, that of the 600 °C sample decreases from 1, 864 to 1, 032 Ω/sq, that of the 800 °C sample decreases from 346 to 282 Ω/sq, and that of the 1, 000 °C sample decreases from 262 to 208 Ω/sq. Thirdly, a HNO 3 treatment could reduce the internal resistance of the solar cells [30]; thus, the FF is enhanced (Table 1).|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a technique that}} allows control of visual stimuli quality {{through the use of}} a setup with a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) film positioned in the optical pathway of one or both human eyes. Nowadays, PDLC films allow alteration of the resolution and contrast limits of the transmitted light due to continuous change in the light scattering that is obtained by the application of an AC electrical field. In our experimental setup, the use of a wide-aperture up to area of 20  x  15  cm 2 PDLC sheet is combined with a flat-screen PC display or with a modified display emission block without its interference filter unit and with an installed individually controllable colored light-emitting diode (LED) backlight. In the latter case, the spatial structure of visual stimulus remains constant, but the PDLC switching-on timing for intensity, color, and contrast of visual stimuli control is done by a PC via an Arduino USB interface. Arduino applies a voltage to the backlight colored LEDs and the low voltage up to 30  –  80  V to light-scattering PDLC <b>sheet.</b> <b>Modifications</b> to this setup can improve the resolution of the timing and screen stimulus intensity and color purity, and increase the flexibility of its application in visual research tasks. A particular use of PDLC scattering sheets involves the altering of the stimuli input strength of the eye in different binocular viewing schemes. In such applications, a restricted-optical-aperture PDLC element is mounted in a goggle frame, and the element is controlled by the application of low-voltage AC field. The efficacy of the setup is demonstrated in experiments of human vision contrast sensitivity adaptation studies. Studies allow to determine the characteristic time of the contrast sensitivity altering of 4  s during adaptation phase and the same order of the characteristic time during recovery.

40|$|A 3700 -km 2 area {{adjacent}} to the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, is examined to constrain the development and dynamics of the western central sector of the last British and Irish Ice Sheet. Results from geomorphological mapping, lithostratigraphic investigations, three-dimensional geological modelling and field observations are combined to produce an empirically constrained, five-stage conceptual model of ice sheet evolution. (A) Previously published dates on interstadial organic deposits and mammalian fossils suggest that the Main Late Devensian (MLD) (MIS 2) glaciation of central Scotland began after 35 ka cal BP. During build-up, ice advanced from the western Scottish Highlands into the Clyde and Ayrshire basins. Glaciomarine muds and shelly deposits scavenged from the Firth of Clyde were redeposited widely as shelly tills and glacial rafts. Ice advance against reverse slopes generated, and subsequently overtopped, ice-marginal sediment accumulations. We hypothesise {{that some of these}} formed pre-cursor ridges which were moulded into suites of ribbed moraine during the glacial cycle. (B) Sustained stadial conditions at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (c 30 – 25 ka cal BP) resulted in development of a major dispersal centre over the Firth of Clyde and Southern Uplands. This dispersal centre locally preserved previously formed subglacial bedforms, and fed a wide corridor of fast-flowing ice east towards the Firth of Forth. (C) Initial deglaciation promoted a substantial re-configuration of the ice surface, with enhanced westward drawdown into the outer Firth of Clyde and eastward migration of an ice divide towards the Clyde-Forth watershed. (D) Renewed ice sheet thickening over the Firth of Clyde may have accompanied growth of the Irish Ice Sheet during the Killard Point Stadial (c 17. 1 – 15. 2 ka cal BP); it was associated with limited bed <b>modification.</b> Subsequent ice <b>sheet</b> retreat was characterised by substantial meltwater production, ponding and erosion. (E) Late stages of MLD ice sheet retreat were punctuated by one or more significant ice margin oscillations. Discovery of De Geer moraines at the site of a former proglacial lake in western Ayrshire allows glacier flow at the ice margin to be approximated as ≤ 290 m a− 1 during one such oscillation. Such velocities were probably enabled by basal sliding and shallow sediment deformation. At this stage those parts of the MLD ice sheet margin that were grounded in the Firth of Clyde were extremely vulnerable to collapse. Final disintegration of glacier ice in the Clyde basin probably occurred early in the Lateglacial Interstadial (Greenland Interstadial- 1), coinciding with marine incursion to c 40 m above present day sea level...|$|R
