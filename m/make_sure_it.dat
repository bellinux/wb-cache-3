5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> stayed dry.|$|E

5|$|Schafer {{stated that}} they began the {{development}} with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should be doing in the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, {{they were able to}} expand {{out the rest of the}} game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.|$|E

25|$|In general, idic(15) occurs de novo but {{the parents}} must be karyotyped to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is not inherited, mostly because this {{will affect the}} course of genetic {{counseling}} given to the family. If the abnormality is found prenatally {{and one of the}} parents harbour the marker, the child has a chance of not carrying the mutation. Further tests should however be done to prove the marker has not been rearranged while being inherited. This information is also necessary for counseling of future pregnancies. Each family is unique and should therefore be handled individually.|$|E

In {{one of his first}} films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted to talk to his wife first, to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was all right with her.

He later personally directed Mobile Fire Department firefighters in extinguishing the blaze.

25|$|Brazil {{continued}} {{to try to}} remain neutral to the United States and Germany because {{it was trying to}} <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> could continue to be a place of interest for both opposing countries. Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.|$|E
25|$|Worship and temples {{appear to}} have been {{routinely}} offered by Greeks to their Roman governors, with varied reactions. Cicero declined a temple proposed by the city officials of Roman Asia to his brother and himself, while the latter was proconsul, to avoid jealousy from other Romans; when Cicero himself was Governor of Cilicia, he claimed to have accepted no statues, shrines, or chariots. His predecessor, Appius Claudius Pulcher, was so pleased, however, when the Cilicians built a temple to him that, when it was not finished at the end of Claudius' year in office, Claudius wrote Cicero to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was done, and complaining that Cicero was not active enough in the matter.|$|E

25|$|Authentication is {{the act of}} verifying a {{claim of}} identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal, he tells the bank teller he is John Doe—a claim of identity. The bank teller asks to see a photoID, so he hands the teller his driver's license. The bank teller checks the license to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> has John Doe printed on it and compares the {{photograph}} on the license against the person claiming to be John Doe. If the photo and name match the person, then the teller has authenticated that John Doe is who he claimed to be.

25|$|The {{choice of}} date {{on which to}} launch the plan was largely {{determined}} by other events taking place. Roosevelt wanted to present the legislation before the Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments on the Wagner Act cases, scheduled to begin on February 8, 1937; however, Roosevelt also {{did not want to}} present the legislation before the annual White House dinner for the Supreme Court, scheduled for February 2. With a Senate recess between February 3–5, and the weekend falling on February 6–7, Roosevelt had to settle for February 5. Other pragmatic concerns also intervened. The administration wanted to introduce the bill early enough in the Congressional session to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> passed before the summer recess, and, if successful, to leave time for nominations to any newly created bench seats.|$|E

Cowbell also confirms that the person who wins the contest will be awarded a holiday to Italy and a recording contract. Pat decides to take part in the contest and his unexpected singing voice (played by Ronan Keating) wins the contest. Pat is to sing again in the finale, in a head-to-head contest with the winner of another heat, Josh (voiced by Rupert Grint).

25|$|Croteam used {{an array}} of {{automated}} and in-place tools to help rapidly design, debug, and test the game for playability. In one aspect, they recognized {{in the development of}} a puzzle game was that while puzzles could be designed with specific solutions, the process of creating the video game around the puzzle could create unsolvable situations or unforeseen shortcuts. To address this, they used a bot, developed by Croteam member Nathan Brown who had previously developed bots for other games including the ones incorporated into ports of Serious Sam 3 for consoles. The bot, named Bot, would watch the playthrough of a puzzle by a human player in terms of broad actions such as placing boxes on a switch for the completion of a puzzle. Then, as the puzzle's environment was tuned and decorated, they would have Bot attempt to solve the puzzle, testing to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> did not run into any dead-ends. If it did encounter any, Bot reported these through an in-house bug reporting system and then used game cheats to move on and finish out testing, which took between 30 and 60 minutes for the full game. As such, they were able to quickly iterate and resolve such problems when new features were introduced to the game. Overall, Croteam estimates they logged about 15,000 hours with Bot before the release of the public test version, and expect to use similar techniques in future games. They also used human playtesters to validate other more aesthetic factors of the games prior to the title's release.|$|E
