40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Methylchloroisothiazolinone</b> (MCI) <b>and</b> <b>methylisothiazolinone</b> (MI) are {{the active}} {{ingredients}} in commonly used preservative systems (e. g. Kathon CG(®)). MCI/MI {{is present in}} the European baseline patch test series at 100 [*]ppm aq. Since 1986, 200 [*]ppm (dose 0. 006 [*]mg/cm(2)) has been used in Sweden without causing skin irritation. Centres in Spain, the United Kingdom and Ireland have also used 200 [*]ppm in their baseline series. OBJECTIVES: To find the optimal patch test concentration for MCI/MI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCI/MI 100 [*]ppm aq. and MCI/MI 200 [*]ppm aq. were simultaneously patch tested in 3300 consecutively tested dermatitis patients at eight European patch test clinics and one US patch test clinic. With the Finn Chambers(®) technique (diameter 8 [*]mm), 15 [*]µl was micropipetted on to the filter paper in the chamber. The corresponding volume for Van der Bend(®) chambers was 20 [*]µl, and that for IQ Chambers(®) was 25 [*]µl. RESULTS: Contact allergy to MCI/MI at 100 and 200 [*]ppm was found in 1. 2 % and 2. 1 % of patients, respectively (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: MCI/MI 200 [*]ppm aq. (dose 0. 006 [*]mg/cm(2)) diagnoses significantly more contact allergy than the presently used concentration of 100 [*]ppm (dose 0. 003 [*]mg/cm(2)), without resulting in more adverse reactions. MCI/MI at 200 [*]ppm should therefore be considered for inclusion in the European baseline test series. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background Delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} {{reactions to}} nickel (Ni 2 +) in humans {{are associated with}} increased production of both T helper (Th) 1 - and Th 2 -like cytokines. Cytokine responses to the major group of contact allergens, i. e. organic compounds, have been less extensively studied. We have investigated here the cytokine production induced by a mixture of <b>methylchloroisothiazolinone</b> (MCI) <b>and</b> <b>methylisothiazolinone</b> (MI), the active ingredients in common preservatives {{that are capable of}} eliciting allergic contact dermatitis. Objective To characterize the immune response induced by MCI/MI in terms of the production of Th 1 - and Th 2 -like cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from allergic and non-allergic subjects. Methods Ten subjects with a history of contact allergy to MCI/MI and nine age-matched non-allergic volunteers participated. Their actual status was confirmed by patch testing. PBMC were cultured in {{the presence or absence of}} MCI/MI; cell proliferation was measured employing [H- 3]thymidine incorporation; and the number of cytokine-producing cells was determined using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay and the levels of soluble cytokines in culture media by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The proliferative response of PBMC to MCI/MI was significantly greater in the case of the allergic group than for the non-allergic group, as was the production of interleukin (IL) - 2 and IL- 13 (as determined by ELISpot and/or ELISA). PBMC from three of the allergic individuals with increased production of IL- 2 and IL- 13 responded to MCI/MI with elevated numbers of cells producing IL- 4 and IL- 5. The increases in the production of IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 5 and IL- 13 were positively correlated. Conclusion MCI/MI elicited concomitant production of both Th 1 - and Th 2 -like cytokines by PBMC from subjects with contact allergy to these substances. This finding indicates that the organic compounds MCI/MI elicit a mixed Th 1 - and Th 2 -type of response, similar to that elicited by the metal ion Ni 2 + in Ni 2 +-sensitized individuals...|$|R

40|$|Background. Due to {{allowing}} of methylisothiazolinone (MI) in cosmetics, cleaning products, and paints, {{an epidemic}} of MI-hypersensitivity emerged. Patch testing Kathon CG® (3 : 1 mixture of <b>methylchloroisothiazolinone</b> <b>and</b> <b>methylisothiazolinone,</b> MCI/MI) does not correctly detect MI contact allergy, due to the low concentration of MI in the test material. Methods. A retrospective survey was performed to estimate the prevalence of MCI/MI hypersensitivity in 14693 patients tested consecutively between 1993 and 2014. Moreover, currently 314 patients were prospectively tested with the allergens MCI/MI and with MI during one year. Results. MCI/MI hypersensitivity increased retrospectively from 0. 5 % to 6. 0 %. By current prospective testing we detected 25 patients (8 %) with MCI/MI and/or MI positive reactions. Out of the 25 patients 10 were only MCI/MI positive, 9 were only MI positive, and 6 were MCI/MI and MI positive. If MI had not been tested separately, MI contact allergy would have missed in 36 % of all detected cases and in 2. 8 % of the total 314 patients. Conclusions. The frequency of MCI/MI hypersensitivity is increasing also in Hungary. We confirm that, in order to detect MI contact allergy, {{it needs to be}} tested separately. A further increase of MI hypersensitivity might be expected in the future as products containing MI are still widely available...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patch testing detects delayed-type sensitizations and {{may show}} changes in {{prevalence}} over time. OBJECTIVES: To compare sensitization prevalence to our baseline series allergens {{during the years}} 2000 - 2004 to results from 1990 to 1994. METHODS: We analysed baseline patch test series allergens from 2000 through 2004. RESULTS: 4094 individuals were patch tested to the baseline series (mean age 45. 4 years, males 41. 7 %). The highest sensitization rates were found for nickel sulfate (19. 3 %), fragrance mix (10. 4 %) and Myroxylon pereirae (7. 8 %). Compared to 1990 - 1994, <b>methylchloroisothiazolinone</b> (<b>and)</b> methylisothiazoline (MCI/MI) and neomycin sulfate sensitization decreased and lanolin alcohol, thiuram mix and ammoniated mercury sensitization increased. CONCLUSIONS: Current sensitization rates {{are similar to those}} across Europe. Reduced sensitizations to MCI/MI and neomycin sulfate and increased sensitizations to thiuram mix and ammoniated mercury chloride may well be because of changes in exposure. The current group comprises a higher proportion affected by leg dermatitis and may thus explain the higher sensitization to lanolin alcohol. Comparing patch results over time shows important changes in sensitization prevalence...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{assessing}} {{skin irritation}} to chemicals have traditionally used laboratory animals; however, such methods are questionable regarding their relevance for humans. New {{in vitro methods}} have been validated, such as the reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model (Episkin®, Epiderm®). The comparison (accuracy) with in vivo results such as the 4 -h human patch test (HPT) is 76 % at best (Epiderm®). There {{is a need to}} develop an in vitro method that better simulates the anatomo-pathological changes encountered in vivo. To develop an in vitro method to determine skin irritation using human viable skin through histopathology, and compare the results of 4 tested substances to the main in vitro methods and in vivo animal method (Draize test). Human skin removed during surgery was dermatomed and mounted on an in vitro flow-through diffusion cell system. Ten chemicals with known non-irritant (heptylbutyrate, hexylsalicylate, butylmethacrylate, isoproturon, bentazon, DEHP <b>and</b> <b>methylisothiazolinone</b> (MI)) <b>and</b> irritant properties (folpet, 1 -bromohexane <b>and</b> <b>methylchloroisothiazolinone</b> (MCI/MI)), a negative control (sodiumchloride) and a positive control (sodiumlaurylsulphate) were applied. The skin was exposed at least for 4 h. Histopathology was performed to investigate irritation signs (spongiosis, necrosis, vacuolization). We obtained 100 % accuracy with the HPT model; 75 % with the RHE models and 50 % with the Draize test for 4 tested substances. The coefficients of variation (CV) between our three test batches were < 0. 1, showing good reproducibility. Furthermore, we reported objectively histopathological irritation signs (irritation scale) : strong (folpet), significant (1 -bromohexane), slight (MCI/MI at 750 / 250 ppm) and none (isoproturon, bentazon, DEHP and MI). This new in vitro test method presented effective results for the tested chemicals. It should be further validated using a greater number of substances; and tested in different laboratories in order to suitably evaluate reproducibility...|$|R
40|$|Background. Cross-reactions and co-sensitizations are {{of great}} {{importance}} in understanding contact allergy and exposure sources. Objectives. To investigate common cross-reactions and co-sensitizations in p-phenylenediamine (PPD) -sensitized and toluene- 2, 5 -diamine (TDA) -sensitized individuals. Methods. Fromour patch test population, 8036 patients patch tested with the European baseline series were extracted. Readings had to be performed at least on day 3 according to ICDRG guidelines. Results. Two hundred and fifty-one patients were sensitized to PPD and/or TDA; 231 patients were sensitized to PPD, and 109 to TDA. Significant differences were observed regarding the strengths of patch test reactions to PPD and number of cross-reactions. For TDA, a difference was found between all reaction strengths, except between + and ++ strengths. PPD-sensitized individuals {{were more likely to}} be sensitized to carba mix, cobalt chloride, colophonium, p-tert-butyl phenolformaldehyde resin, paraben mix, <b>and</b> <b>methylisothiazolinone.</b> TDA-sensitized individuals were more often sensitized to carba mix. Conclusions. Cross-reactivity was commonly found among individuals sensitized to PPD or TDA, and was strongly related to the strength of the patch test reaction. Regarding co-sensitizations, a frequently appearing or common exposure source could not be determined. However, modification of the allergen by, for example, the skin microbiota may have caused the formation of molecules that are, for the human immune system, indistinguishable from PPD...|$|R

40|$|Chloromethylisothiazolinone (MCI) <b>and</b> <b>methylisothiazolinone</b> (MI) {{have been}} widely used as {{preservatives}} in cosmetics, household products and industrial products since the late 1970 s. First cases of contact allergy to the MCI/MI combination were noted in 1980 – 1982 in Sweden. Then, {{a significant increase in the}} frequency of sensitization to these compounds was observed in many European centers. The increase has been stopped by the introduction of legislation on their maximum concentrations in consumer and industrial products in Europe and in some non-European countries. But approval of the use of MI alone without limits in industrial products (from 2000) and at a maximum concentration of 100 ppm in cosmetics (from 2005) resulted in an unprecedented increase in the number of individuals sensitized to this compound. Allergic contact dermatitis due to MI occurs in both adults and children. It is often manifested by severe symptoms, which may be also induced by airborne exposure. The most important sources of sensitization include cosmetic products and paints. To counteract the increasing problem of contact allergy epidemic to MI, the recommendations have been developed, suggesting the ban on the use of MI in “leave-on” cosmetics and maximum concentration of 15 ppm in “rinse-off” products.

This study was to evaluate the pulmonary function using, impulse oscillometry (IOS) for children exposed to a mixture of CMIT/MIT from HD. Twenty-four children who were only exposed to a mixture of CMIT/MIT, with no previous underlying disease, were assessed by IOS. Diagnostic criteria for HDLI were categorized as definite, probable, possible, or unlikely. Home visits and administration of a standardized questionnaire were arranged to assess exposure characteristics. Definite and probable cases showed higher airborne disinfectant exposure intensity during sleep (32. 4 ± 8. 7 μg/m 3) and younger age at initial exposure (3. 5 ± 3. 3 months) compared with unlikely cases (17. 3 ± 11. 0 μg/m 3, p = 0. 026; 22. 5 ± 26. 2 months, p = 0. 039, respectively).

Objectives: To report on <b>methylchloroisothiazolinone</b> (MCI) /MI <b>and</b> MI allergy in Belgium. Patients and methods Between January 2010 and December 2012, the medical charts of 6599 patients of the Belgian Contact and Environmental Dermatitis Group were retrospectively reviewed for MCI/MI and MI sensitization by use of a standardized questionnaire. Available data on sensitization in 2081 patients tested in 2013 were also included. Results: In 2012, the sensitization rate for MCI/MI had increased to 4. 5 % and that for MI to 6. 0 %; the latter showed a further increase to 7. 2 % in 2013. The people mainly affected were women with a median age of 49 years with hand and/or facial dermatitis, most often resulting {{from the use of}} cosmetics. Simultaneous reactions to octylisothiazolinone were observed. Conclusion: A dramatic increase in the rate of contact allergy caused by MI in cosmetics is occurring in Belgium. Notwithstanding the recent recommendation to discontinue the use of MI in leave-on cosmetics, safer use concentrations should also be determined for rinse-off products.

Material and Method: Seventy-three patients with clinically suspected contact dermatitis due to cosmetics were patch tested by the European standard series and cosmetic series. The patch test results were analyzed as percentages. x 2 {{test was used to}} demonstrate the relationship between cosmetic products and cosmetic allergens. Results: 90. 4 % of patients in our study group were female and 9. 6 % were male; the median age was 37. 5 (range 16 - 71) years. The most commonly involved parts of the body were the face (49. 3 %), hands (16. 4 %), periocular region (6. 8 %), lips (6. 8 %), and the neck (5. 5 %). The most common offending cosmetic products causing allergic contact dermatitis were soaps and cleansing lotions (32. 8 %), moisturizer creams (21. 9 %), make-up (15. 0 %), and hair dyes (9. 6 %). 41. 0 % of patients showed positive reaction to at least one cosmetic allergen included in either standard or cosmetic series. The cosmetic allergens in the standard series and the rates of positivity were as follows: fragrance mix (6. 8 %), lanolin alcohols (5. 5 %), paraphenylenedaimine (2. 7 %), colophony (1. 4 %), paraben mix (1. 4 %), formaldehyde (1. 4 %), <b>and</b> <b>methylchloroisothiazolinone</b> (Kathon CG) in descending order.

40|$|Parabens {{have been}} used as {{antimicrobial}} preservatives in multiple different types of products for decades, however relatively recent studies have caused concern as to whether their wide-use could be potentially harmful. The following paper reviews the extensive areas of human exposure, from mother to fetus, infants via breast milk, baby and child care products through adult personal care products, and other environmental sources. The potential impacts on human health are also discussed. Parabens predominantly impact biological systems as an endocrine disruptor not only by binding to the human Estrogen Receptor directly, but increasing the availability of naturally occurring 17 β-estradiol, further potentiating the effect. Alternative antimicrobial preservatives are also discussed, along with their efficacies and potential health concerns. Common alternatives found in personal care products include phenoxyethanol, <b>methylisothiazolinone,</b> <b>and</b> formaldehyde releasers. Additionally, weak organic acids and plant-derived essential oils are also used in personal care products, but tend to be added more so to food products to prevent the growth of spoilage bacteria, fungi and mold. The potential for these alternatives to replace the use of parabens in personal care products, our greatest area of exposure, is very promising. If parabens in personal care products were replaced with a safe and effective alternative, then the other areas of environmental exposure would likely be negligible to produce any harm on society. Future investigation into the nuances of the various plant-derived essential oils and effective formulations for preservation, is likely the most promising solution, due to their mostly harmless nature.

40|$|The {{lymphocyte}} transformation test (LTT) {{has been}} used for evaluation of in vitro lymphocyte responses in 18 patients with dermatitis and positive patch tests to 200 ppm of a combination of 5 -chloro- 2 -methylisothiazolinone <b>and</b> 2 - <b>methylisothiazolinone</b> (MCI) in nine patients with dermatitis unrelated to MCI and in seven subjects without skin diseases. Two workers sensitized by occupational exposure to a formulation containing 1, 2 -benzisothiazolin- 3 -one (BIT) were also studied. Lymphocytes from nine patch-test-positive patients proliferated vigorously to MCI in vitro. Lymphocytes from the remaining nine patients were not stimulated. Lymphocytes from two BIT-sensitized workers responded to BIT in vitro. The lymphocyte proliferation to isothiazolinones indicates the presence of memory cells in the patients' blood and confirms immunologic reaction to the inducing agent. To establish clinical relevance of LTT results, 12 MCI patch-test-positive patients underwent “use test” with lotion containing 15 ppm MCI. Four of five LTT- positive patients were use-test-positive, whereas seven of seven LTT-negative patients were use-test-negative. LTT-positive and lotion-positive patients responded to 100 ppm or lower concentrations of MCI on patch testing, whereas seven of eight LTT-negative and lotion-negative patients responded to 200 ppm only. In the case of MCI, proliferation was due to the chlorinated component, indicating that this part contains an allergenic epitope. Finally, MCI-specific lymphocyte proliferation was observed only in patients with MCI-positive skin test, but not in nine patients with dermatitis induced by other agents, or in seven subjects without skin diseases. Thus, the {{lymphocyte transformation test}} is able to distinguish between irritant and allergic skin responses. It may also be valuable in establishing the clinically relevant patch-test concentration of allergens with irritative properties...|$|R
40|$|P. aeruginosa is a {{versatile}} microorganism {{with high levels}} of antimicrobial resistance and a common contaminant of home and personal care (HPC) products. Relatively little is known about P. aeruginosa in industrial settings and to further investigate this, four areas were considered: (i) culture-dependent and –independent detection of P. aeruginosa; (ii) P. aeruginosa and bacterial diversity in HPC products; (iii) preservative susceptibility and phenotypic characterisation of industrial P. aeruginosa strains, and; (iv) P. aeruginosa adaptation to a preservative combination. A large collection of P. aeruginosa and non-P. aeruginosa industrial isolates was utilised to evaluate five selective agars for the detection of P. aeruginosa. Media using negative selection performed best overall, but media using positive selection had potential as enrichment media. Culture-independent detection of P. aeruginosa and overall bacterial diversity was achieved via direct DNA extraction from contaminated HPC products, species specific PCRs and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The bacterial diversity in HPC products was low, with less than three contaminating genera in each product. The diversity of P. aeruginosa strains from industrial, clinical and environmental sources was investigated using five genotyping techniques, ranging from PCR-fingerprinting methods to whole genome sequencing, and phenotypic assays examining preservative susceptibility, growth dynamics and motility. P. aeruginosa strain diversity was high and there was no association between genotype, phenotype and isolation source. The development of adaptive resistance of P. aeruginosa to a preservative combination used in HPC products was modelled using planktonic growth and biofilm assays. P. aeruginosa PA 14 grew in elevated levels of the preservatives chloromethylisothiazolinone, <b>methylisothiazolinone</b> <b>and</b> dimethylol dimethyl hydantoin but it was unknown whether the increased tolerance was stable. Whilst eradication of P. aeruginosa from the industrial environment is unlikely, improved detection methods and understanding of the species will inform industrial practices and preservative formulations to minimise HPC product contamination...|$|R
40|$|Burkholderia cepacia complex {{bacteria}} can contaminate and {{survive in a}} variety of antimicrobial and preserved industrial products. Contamination may lead to economic loss for manufacturers and also potentially pose a risk to the health of vulnerable consumers. Understanding the interaction between Bcc bacteria and preservatives, and the molecular basis for their resistance, is essential in order to better target these organisms and to facilitate the implementation of improved preservative strategies which target resistance mechanisms. In the present study, multi-locus sequence typing analysis of a collection of 67 Bcc isolates from environmentalindustrial sources was used to expand the current knowledge of Bcc species diversity within this niche and identified B. lata (n= 17) and B. cenocepacia (n= 11) as predominant species groups. The relationship between Bcc species diversity, isolation source and preservative susceptibility was investigated using a collection of 83 genetically diverse Bcc strains from clinical, environmental and environmental-industrial isolation sources. Susceptibility to eight preservatives was not related to Bcc taxonomy, as susceptibility profiles varied both between and within species groups. However, Bcc isolates from environmental-industrial sources had a significantly higher minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration (MIC and MBC) for the formaldehyde releasing agent DMDM hydantoin. This suggests that for this preservative agent, susceptibility was related to source and that the selection of highly tolerant Bcc bacteria had occurred within the niche. Isothiazolone, DMDM hydantoin, phenoxyethanol and methyl paraben preservatives were observed to be highly efficacious against Bcc bacteria when evaluated in growth medium at the maximum concentration regulated for use in rinse-off personal care products in EU-regulated countries. Benzethonium chloride and sodium benzoate preservatives had the weakest anti-Bcc activity at these levels but were effective against several strains. Combinations of preservatives, and preservatives with potentiating agents, were evaluated for synergistic anti- Bcc activity. The greatest anti-Bcc activity was observed when isothiazolone preservatives were combined with EDTA or phenoxyethanol, with each combination resulting in an additive effect. The competency of Bcc bacteria to adapt to preservatives was explored via the progressive sub-culture of B. lata strain 383 in subinhibitory preservative concentrations. This genome sequence strain represented a Bcc species commonly encountered in the environmental-industrial niche. Stable adaptive-resistance to isothiazolone and benzethonium chloride preservatives was developed. Phenoxyethanol, DMDM hydantoin and methyl paraben preservatives were recalcitrant to B. lata strain 383 adaptation. The preservative and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the adapted B. lata strain 383 derivatives differed, suggesting the induction of agent-specific adaptive-resistance mechanisms had occurred. The B. lata 383 -CMIT,-BIT, derivatives (adapted respectively to chloromethylisothiazolinone and benzisothiazolinone), demonstrated cross-resistance to isothiazolone preservatives and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Sequence analysis of the topoisomerase genes in these derivatives revealed fluoroquinolone resistance was not mediated by target modification. Preservative-induced adaptive resistance was not associated with overall increased multi-drug resistance. The molecular basis for resistance to DMDM hydantoin and isothiazolone preservatives was investigated via the random transposon mutagenesis of B. lata strain 383 using pTnModOTp’. Several genetic pathways were identified as putative preservative resistance determinants, suggesting that resistance is multi-factorial. These included the detoxification of formaldehyde via a glutathione-dependent pathway; a type II general secretory system (A 3244 _A 3233 genes); a homologue of an ABC-type efflux system involved in resistance to organic solvents (A 3512 _A 3517 genes); homologues of multi-drug RND-type efflux systems EmrB/QacA-Emr-TolC; and bacterial defence mechanisms against oxidative stress. A transcriptomic microarray-based approach was used to profile global gene expression of B. lata strain 383 in response to sub-MIC of 0. 00162 % DMDM hydantoin and 0. 00001498 % of a <b>methylisothiazolinone</b> <b>and</b> CMIT blend, as well as isothiazolone-induced adaptive resistance. With a 1. 5 -fold change and P < 0. 05 confidence level criterion applied, few significant changes were observed after a single sub-MIC exposure, and the differential expression of putative resistance determinants identified by transposon mutagenesis was not induced at these concentrations. Isothiazolone-induced adaptive-resistance involved a greater number of significant gene expression changes that were stable irrespective of the presence of the priming agent, with 126 up-regulated and 90 down-regulated genes. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that isothiazolone-induced adaptive resistance was multi-factorial in nature, and identified active efflux as a putative key resistance mechanism. A novel role for a RND-type efflux system (B 1004 _B 1006 genes) was identified, and the up-regulation of the ABC-efflux system (A 3512 _A 3517 genes) and bacterial defence mechanisms against oxidative stress corroborated the transposon mutagenesis findings. B. lata strain 383 -CMIT demonstrated a four-fold reduction in MIC for the priming preservative (2. 81 E- 04 %) in the presence of 512 mg/L of the efflux inhibitor PAβN. Resistance mechanism targeted preservative strategies such as using efflux inhibitors may work to improve preservation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
