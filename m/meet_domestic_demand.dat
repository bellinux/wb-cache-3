2500|$|Since the {{founding}} of the state through the mid-2010s decade, the state-owned utility, Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) had an effective monopoly on power generation in the country. In 2010 the company sold 52,037GWh of electricity. Until the mid-2010s the country also faced a persistently low operating reserve, which is mostly the result of Israel being an [...] "electricity island". Most countries have the capability of relying on power drawn from producers in adjacent countries {{in the event of a}} power shortage. Israel's grid however, is unconnected to those of neighboring countries. This is mostly due to political reasons but also to the considerably less-developed nature of the power systems of Jordan and Egypt, whose systems constantly struggle to <b>meet</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> and whose per-capita electric generation is less than one fifth that of Israel's. Nevertheless, while operating reserves in Israel were low, the country possessed sufficient generation and transmission capacity to meet domestic electricity needs and unlike in the countries surrounding it, rolling blackouts have historically been quite rare, even at periods of extreme demand.|$|E

It can be seen that by 2035 the percentage of annual safe yield extracted will increase to between 11.3 and 103 %, averaging around 50 %. This indicates that less water may be available for socio-economic development in the future. It also suggests that by 2035 Kiwira and Mbaka sub catchments will be nearly at or exceeding the annual safe yield leaving no room for socio-economic development, or the need to reduce existing socio-economic <b>demands</b> to <b>meet</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demands.</b> The other option is to increase the percentage of total recharge allocated to the annual safe yield from 10 to 20 % in these catchments.|$|R

The lucrative market to South America was helped by the families separated by the Civil War. However, there was intense competition from Air France, KLM and British South American Airways. Since the company was struggling to <b>meet</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand,</b> the Government allowed another company, Aviaco, to operate the domestic routes that Iberia did not use from February 18, 1948.|$|E

50|$|The currency’s {{appreciation}} {{was crucial}} to keep inflation under control.

This was especially important in the period immediately following the adoption of the new currency, when the sudden drop in inflation caused a surge in demand. The increased imports, therefore, were essential to avoid demand-side inflationary pressures that would undermine the stabilization plan.|$|R

50|$|Kazakhstan’s gas {{production}} suffices to <b>meet</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> of 10.5 billion cubic meters (2012). However, due to limited internal {{gas pipeline network}} that does not connect all the production centers (west) with demand centers (south, east, north), the country needs to import gas from Uzbekistan to satisfy the demand {{in the south of}} the country and from Russia to satisfy demand in the north and east. In 2012, the country exported 8.8 billion cubic meters of gas to China through the Central Asia - China pipeline. Kazakhstan serves as a major transit country for gas exports from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan that are destined to Russia and China. In 2012, the amount of gas transited through Kazakhstan was 96.5 billion cubic meters.|$|E
50|$|The 1960s saw an {{acceleration}} and diversification {{of the manufacturing}} sector to <b>meet</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand,</b> {{with an emphasis on}} intermediate inputs and consumer durable goods. By 1971 these accounted for about 50 percent of industrial output. Still, manufactured products—mainly processed agricultural goods—made up only about 10 percent of Ecuador's exports in 1971. Industry was still at an early stage of development, and about 50 percent of the labor force worked in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Traditional industries, such as food processing, beverages, and textiles, were largely dependent on agriculture. The small size of the domestic market, the high production cost in relation to available external markets, and an undeveloped human, physical, and financial infrastructure all combined to limit the expansion of consumer durable goods in the Ecuadorian economy.|$|E

40|$|In {{the post}} war era, {{much has been}} said {{about the role of the}} foreign trade sector in {{affecting}} the rate and the level of domestic economic growth in the group of LDCs. The impact of exports in particular received the lion's share of attention. It has been frequently argued that exports act as an engine of growth. The line of causation here runs from exports to domestic economic growth. Through the effects of both the multiplier and the accelerator, output expands by a multiple of the initial value of exports. Exportation also tends to reduce the opportunity cost of domestic resources by providing foreign exchange necessary to <b>meet</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demands</b> from abroad at relatively lower prices. Forward and backward linkages stimulate growth in export-related activities. Export expansion, in addition, gives rise to external economies, economies of scale, an efficient allocation of resources, and a greater-than-one elasticity of expectations on the part of domestic exporters. Thus, we set out in this note to measure the labour absorptive capacity of exports and import substitution in Egypt. Our objective function which we seek to maximize (minimize) is that of labour employment (unemployment) via the foreign trade sector. ...|$|R
50|$|The State Supervision of Mines {{has brought}} forward that the {{production}} level {{should be cut}} back to 30 bcm to avoid the more severe quakes.

One plan called for the irrigation of a 7,500-hectare area east of Khawr Ramm (known as Wadi Rum) using 100 million cubic meters per year (80,000 ac·ft/yr) of water pumped from a large underground aquifer. Another plan envisioned a 7500 ha cultivated area in the Wadi al Arabah region south of the Jordan River valley using desalinated water from the Red Sea for irrigation.|$|E
