40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the size of}} the <b>mark-up</b> <b>on</b> the lending rate for endowment mortgages, due to expected prepayment by the borrower. For this type of mortgage, prepayment is mostly the result of mobility in the housing market. We control for the risk of default by using a unique data set of Dutch borrowers insured against default. The estimates indicate that households with a higher liquidity constraint are less likely to prepay, as they have a lower <b>mark-up</b> <b>on</b> the lending rate. In contrast, the collateral constraint has a very limited influence <b>on</b> the <b>mark-up.</b> We explain this result as follows. Usually, income constraints are generated at the household level, whereas constraints on housing wealth pertain to the regional level. Hence, income changes may improve the relative position of households in the housing market, but an increase in homeowners. housing wealth does not improve their relative position in the housing market.

40|$|With July 1, 1994 as a deadline, the European Union {{deregulated}} {{the property}} liability markets {{to a great}} extent. This led to the abolishment of twelve regional monopolies in property liability insurance in Germany. In Switzerland as well efforts are being made to deregulate the existing 19 cantonal monopolies in fire insurance {{in an attempt to}} follow the EU lead. This paper examines the possible outcome of an abolishment of the cantonal monopolies on the Swiss property liability insurance market, taking an indirect approach. It is based on a comparison of premium payments in the German monopoly regions on the one hand, and premium payments of private insurers on the other. For the period 1980 to 1994, <b>mark-up</b> <b>on</b> damage payments proved to be lower by 21 percentage points in the monopoly regions. This result is in line with a corresponding analysis of the Swiss property liability insurance market covering the period from 1984 to 1994 : the cantonal monopolies in Switzerland have a <b>mark-up</b> <b>on</b> damage payments that is 47 percentage points lower than the mark-up of their private counterparts. In conclusion, the comparison of monopolies and firms operating in a free market environment points to the fact that a deregulation of the Swiss monopolies in property liability insurance would very likely result in higher premiums. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use {{and develop the}} concept of a semi-public good. A semi-public good is defined as an ordered pair of commodities, the first one being a private {{commodity}} and the second one a public good, which are related to each other by an individual inequality constraint for each individual agent. This approach allows us to design economie institutions which carry out price discrimination among users of a semi-public good. People who are seriously hampered by too small a provision of a public good, because it constrains their use of the private commodity, are willing to pay a <b>mark-up</b> <b>on</b> the price for the latter one if this mark-up is spent for expanding the provision of the public good. In the model the availability of a public good is planned and organized by a central planner. The consumer's willingness to pay an individual <b>mark-up</b> <b>on</b> the price of a private commodity reflects his preferences for the availibility of the public good. These mark-ups are collected by the private goods industry and transferred to the central planner in order to cover the costs of the public good infrastructure. This framework of a private industry and a central planner providing semi-public goods is called an industrial economy. The model will be illustrated by some numerical examples...|$|R

Welding has been performed by deforming only the aluminium component with a degree of deformation of 20 … 30 %. The numeric modelling of the aluminium component modeling has allowed studying the state of the tension and of the local deformations in the welded joint.

We devise a model for tradable goods that combines the market competition and the pricing-tomarket literature and we empirically document the contrast between perfectly and imperfectly competitive markets for the export-production relative price responses to exchange rate changes. When the macroeconomic view is taken, a change in the degree of competition in exports (a change in the average <b>mark-up</b> <b>on</b> exported products) alternates the reaction in relative prices and quantity exported and thus requires careful policy-related consideration.
