40|$|Abstract—Power bus structure, {{consisting}} of two parallel solid power and ground planes separated by an insulator, behaves as a cavity resonator at high frequencies. Noise on the power bus, due to a sudden change in the current drawn by an active component, can appear as an undesired spatial fluctuation in the voltage be-tween power and ground, especially at resonant frequencies of the resultant cavity, which may lead to problems in signal integrity, excessive delays, false switching, and radiated emission. These res-onances can be suppressed by introducing high-frequency loss into the structure. This paper investigates a simple method to reduce self-/transfer impedance of power/ground planes for mitigating power/ground bounce in high-speed printed circuit board design by adding {{a thin layer of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> <b>coating</b> to the inside-facing surfaces of copper power and ground plates to increase their effective high-frequency surface impedance. The increased surface impedance will increase the attenuation constant of the propagat-ing wave inside the cavity that benefits reduction of cavity’s quality factor (Q factor). The simulation results obtained from a modified cavity resonator model show that increasing surface impedance can dramatically reduce self- and transfer impedances at board resonant frequencies.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} systematic {{studies of}} fabrication and properties of Cu+Ni nanocomposite coatings obtained by electrodeposition technique. Special {{attention is paid}} to establish the influence of fabrication conditions and microstructure of the <b>coating</b> <b>material</b> on its <b>magnetic</b> and elastic properties. Design/methodology/approach: The results were obtained by applying electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, PARSTAT 2273, roughness factor), magnetization versus temperature measurements (2 <T< 300 K, field 0. 5 T), vibrating reed technique (Young’s modulus) and scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S- 4200 (4)). Findings: Magnetization curves M(T) show a superparamagnetic effect at T< 50 K which depends on dispersion of magnetic particles in a nonmagnetic matrix. This effect is proportional to the field HS required to saturate the magnetization curve M(H). So, the determination of the HS gives information about the dispersion of magnetic particles in a nonmagnetic matrix. It was shown that the observed decrease of the apparent Young’s modulus due to an increase of coating roughness can be well described by exponential function different for nano-sized and micro-sized Ni powder. Research limitations/implications:The method of fabrication of Cu+Ni nanocomposite coatings and the examination methods of elastic and magnetic properties of these kinds of materials can be used in many fields in materials science. Practical implications: The proposed method of evaluating of dispersion degree of magnetic nano-sized powder in nonmagnetic matrix can be applied in many problems of magnetic nanocomposite materials.
