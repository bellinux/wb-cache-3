40|$|A project {{submitted}} to the Department of Mechanical Engineering in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the B. S. degree. Department of Mechanical Engineering ME 494 In order to find a safer method for recreational divers to recover small submerged object, Bazinga Team, a senior project design group from the California Maritime Academy, designed and built an automatically ascending, double lift point, self-contained lifting device. The concept stems from the <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>lift</b> bags used for recreational diver salvage. This project will allow divers a hands-free method to execute salvage operations. A number of methods were discussed for accomplishing this task. The method chosen consists of a control module attached to a scuba tank that will supply input air for two lift bags and discharge air from the bags using a pneumatic actuator. A pressure sensor and accelerometer are used to input values to an Arduino that are needed to determine rate of ascent and orientation of the object being salvaged. This device is being developed to operate at approximately 100 ft, which is the safe limit for recreational divers. The composition of the device includes a number of off-the-shelf components for ease of acquisition, cost, and assembly. The internal components of the control module will include operating valves for the air system, an Arduino, a control circuit board, a pressure sensor, batteries, a start switch, and an accelerometer. The components external of the cap and tube style module, are the tank and regulator, air lines rigging gear and the lift bags. The lift bags will include pneumatic actuators mounted to the dump valves. The device is in the prototype stage {{for the purposes of}} the academic requirements. The team fabricated many of the parts in the device, while the rest were purchased, installed, and function tested. Many issues had to be managed to be ready for pool testing. Watertight integrity was determined as well as electromechanical function. Control issues were resolved by building addition branches of the electrical circuit, particularly in the case of adapting the pressure sensor resolution into a usable range for the scope of the project. The device was tested in the CMA pool. While the electromechanical testing in the pool was satisfactory, there were resource constraints that prevented the necessary testing to get a satisfactory test of the control system. The project group is planning to develop a 2 nd iteration after graduation. California Maritime Academy [...] Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

50|$|The {{land was}} {{acquired}} from co-operative landowners {{without the need}} for compulsory powers, although this forced a slightly indirect route. It started from a point a little to the south of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) station at Chichester; it left westwards and immediately turned south, running broadly southwards to Selsey itself, a distance of 7¼ miles (11.7 km). Just south of Chichester, the line crossed the Chichester Canal, which still had some small traffic volume passing, and a simple <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>lifting</b> bridge was provided there.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{operation}} of the swing span was adapted in 1974. Previous to that time the bridge was <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> by <b>lifting</b> a steel plate in {{the deck of the}} bridge and inserting a ten-foot bar into a lever. The operator would walk in a clockwise circle to open the span for marine traffic and then reverse the operation to close. The bridge still has this manual capacity. Remarkably a single-armed gentleman operated the bridge in this fashion until the age of 71, retiring when the electrical motor was installed.|$|R
25|$|Returning to its naval roots, {{a version}} of the D-10 was {{installed}} as a coastal artillery piece in Finland in the 1960s. This weapon is designated 100 56 TK in Finnish Navy service and consists of a complete T-55 tank turret without the stabilizer but furnished with a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> ammunition <b>lift,</b> a chute for used cases, and gun laying apparatus allowing indirect fire directed by remote fire control. The maximum elevation of the barrel was also increased and the turret was furnished with new aiming optics, in some cases including a thermographic camera for night use.|$|R
40|$|Inertial lift pumps {{function}} adequately {{for both}} purging and sampling of monitoring wells; however, using these devices causes a surging action, which may cause increased turbidity, loss of volatiles, aeration, and degassing of samples. You may use these pumps to collect representative non-sensitive samples; however, {{do not use}} them to collect VOCs or gas-sensitive samples. Operation and Materials The inertial <b>lift</b> pump <b>operates</b> by either moving sample tubing {{up and down in}} a well or by moving a rigid inner pump casing up and down (e. g., TIMCO ® or Water Hand Pump, Brainard•Kilman ® Hand Pump). Both the sample tubing design and the rigid inner pump casing design are equipped with a check valve at the bottom. Figure 18 illustrates both the sample tubing inertial lift pump design and the inner/outer inertial lift pump casing design. An electric or gasoline-powered motor can provide a continuous up and down motion for either design. <b>Manually</b> <b>operating</b> inertial <b>lift</b> pumps can be quite difficult. A rapid up and down motion moves water up these pumps by lift and inertia. A rapid upstroke lifts the water in the tubing or casing. At the end of the upstroke, the water in the tubing or casing continues to move slightly upward by inertia. On the downstroke, the check valve at th...|$|R
