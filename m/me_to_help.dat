500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking in that moment, the cold will do that. She asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> so I suggested that she just hum the theme to Game of Thrones in her head while we were rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!" ...|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{approached}} Gill {{and asked}} him for a place in his chambers. Gill's chambers were full but he did suggest a well-respected barrister named F. E. Smith, and Hastings {{went to see him}} with a letter of recommendation from Gill. Smith was out and Hastings instead spoke to his clerk; the two did not get on, and Hastings left without securing a place. Hastings later described this as [...] "the most fortunate moment of my whole career". Directly below Smith's chambers were those of Horace Avory, one of the most noted barristers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. As he prepared to return home, Hastings was informed that Chartres Biron (one of the barristers who occupied Avory's chambers) had been appointed a Metropolitan Magistrate, which freed up a space in the chambers. He immediately went to Avory's clerk and got him to introduce Hastings to Avory. Avory initially refused to give Hastings a place in the chambers, but after Hastings lost his temper and exclaimed that [...] "if he didn't want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him it would leave me more time to myself", Avory laughed and changed his mind.|$|E

Then, as I passed, {{she gave me a}} nice smile and shook ’er little fist at the cook, wot ’ad got ’is back towards ’er.

2500|$|At the time, {{the rebels}} {{had yet to}} {{completely}} surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very difficult for you to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission {{arrived in}} Manchuria to begin its {{investigation}} to establish if Japan had committed aggression or not. Puyi {{was interviewed by}} Lord Lytton, and recalled thinking {{that at the time}} that he desperately wanted to ask Lytton for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that [...] "the masses of the people had begged me to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free". After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "...a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me". The representative, posing as an antique dealer, who [...] "...told me he was sent by the Empress: She wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported". Koo said he was [...] "touched", but he could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the [...] "final blow" [...] to her, leading her into a downward spiral. Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called [...] "bandits". General Doihara was able for in exchange for a multi-million bribe to get one of the more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defense Minister. Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma's defection turned to be ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defense Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.|$|E
2500|$|By 28 May several witness reports {{had been}} {{received}} by the police. One sighting of Nelson, at 5.15pm, reported {{that she had been}} with a man who was [...] "very drunk" [...] and was being violent towards her, [...] "punching her on the head". Another witness said he saw Nelson walk past his garden in Newmains {{in the company of a}} man with a tattooed face. A third witness had seen Nelson and a man of similar appearance in Newmains, and said: [...] "He just looked angry," [...] punching a lamp post as he walked past and saying he was going to [...] "kill some cunt tonight." [...] One witness said he had overheard the man, who was [...] "angry and agitated," [...] saying that he would [...] "end up killing someone tonight." [...] Another witness heard him tell Nelson: [...] "This is all your fucking fault" [...] while pointing angrily in her face. A fourteen-year-old girl also saw the pair together [...] "boozing behind Newmains Asda." [...] She said he was bare-chested and sunburnt and told her his name was [...] "Rab Bayne" [...] and had [...] "asked me to rate his body, like out of ten." [...] She described how the pair were drinking alcohol that they claimed was stolen – the male drinking tequila and Nelson drinking vodka. A passer-by reported seeing Nelson with a man with a facial tattoo outside the Scotmid store in Newmains, where she was rubbing suntan lotion into his sunburned back which was [...] "red as a lobster". He said: [...] "She didn't look too happy. I thought it was a boyfriend-girlfriend thing. They must have got something in the shop, sun tan lotion, because as they were walking away the girl was rubbing something onto his shoulders." [...] A shirtless, sunburned man with a tattooed face was also seen [...] "wandering aimlessly" [...] in Cambusnethan on the evening of 22 May, attracting the attention of a family who had gathered to watch the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final on television. One of the group said: [...] "What attracted attention was his hairstyle and his back was very, very red from the sun." [...] Police also received information that Robert Bayne had telephoned an acquaintance on 24 May and asked for help to [...] "batter" [...] the last people to see Nelson. Crucially, the call was made before the body had been identified. The witness said: [...] "He asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him batter [...] I don't know why he said this because we didn't know it was Zoe who was found." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Excuse me, {{it is of}} {{very serious}} importance. I have no {{authority}} over this poor girl--I am not even an old friend.
