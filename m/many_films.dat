5|$|Born Wei Junluo, Shangguan Yunzhu fled to Shanghai {{when her}} {{hometown}} Jiangyin {{was attacked by}} the Japanese. In Shanghai she became a drama and film actress, and her career took off {{after the end of}} the Second Sino-Japanese War.

After the Communist victory in mainland China in 1949, her career was set back when her husband was embroiled in the anti-capitalist Five-anti Campaign, but she later portrayed a wide variety of characters in <b>many</b> <b>films.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1970, {{scientists}} {{realized this}} pose was incorrect {{and could not}} have been maintained by a living animal, as it would have resulted in the dislocation or weakening of several joints, including the hips and the articulation between the head and the spinal column. The inaccurate AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in <b>many</b> <b>films</b> and paintings (such as Rudolph Zallinger's famous mural The Age of Reptiles in Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History) until the 1990s, when films such as Jurassic Park introduced a more accurate posture to the general public.|$|E

5|$|Affected by her {{association}} with Cheng Shuyao, Shangguan {{did not play}} any major role for several years. This changed in 1955, when she starred in the film Storm on the Southern Island. Director Bai Chen (白沉) chose her to play the leading role as a heroic nurse, {{a far cry from}} her traditional roles of socialites and rich wives. She adjusted to her new role well, and portrayed a wide variety of characters in <b>many</b> <b>films</b> including It's My Day Off (1959), Spring Comes to the Withered Tree (1961, director Zheng Junli), Early Spring in February (1963, director Xie Tieli), and Stage Sisters (1965, director Xie Jin).

5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in <b>many</b> <b>films</b> at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E

Worldwide, it {{ranks as the}} twentieth-highest-grossing film, the ninth-highest-grossing film distributed by Disney, the highest-grossing 2006 film, the highest-grossing film in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, the highest-grossing film to star Johnny Depp and the highest-grossing second installment in a franchise. It is the third film in history to reach the $1 billion mark worldwide, and it reached the mark in record time (63 days), a record that has since been surpassed by <b>many</b> <b>films,</b> of which the first was Avatar (in January 2010).|$|E
5|$|It {{is true that}} a {{house that}} is between two {{destroyed}} homes can be undamaged, {{but this is not}} the result of a tornado skipping, as some previously thought. After the 1974 Super Outbreak, Dr. Ted Fujita studied <b>many</b> <b>films</b> of tornadoes from that day. Included in his review was damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes. Fujita concluded that multiple vortices, highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds, are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses. The phenomenon of satellite tornadoes, where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado, can also lead to gaps in damage between the two tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>many</b> <b>films</b> {{from the}} silent era, The Carpet from Bagdad was {{believed}} completely lost, but in 1982 an Oceaneering International diving expedition salvaged {{a number of}} artifacts from {{the wreck of the}} RMS Lusitania, including one reel of film. With the assistance of BBC technical advisor Laurie Ward, the BFI National Archive was able to recover images from several feet of the film, sufficient to identify the title, but not to restore any of the film to projectable condition. Although there was a theater on the Lusitania, this print of The Carpet from Bagdad was probably being taken to London as a film distributor's preview, as was the case for several other films known to have been on board.|$|E
