40|$|Total war and <b>mental</b> <b>shocks.</b> A. Becker. The {{doctors who}} {{examined}} "shell shocked" patients during the Great War had quickly to loose the impression they were malingering. But {{it was very}} dijficult for them to reconstitute the mental itinerary of their patients, to read them as a narration about helpless men and women taken in the chaos of war. On the contrary, they accused heredity, degenerescence and German barbarity {{much more than the}} conditions of total war, either at the front or in the prisoners camps for soldiers, in occupied territories or civilians camps for the general population. Social darwinism was adapted to the intellectual struggle: the "fitted" for brutality, the Germans, were totally prepared to try to destroy the French "race". Nevertheless the "good" race resisted and the traumatised (the one, who, at a certain point, failed to keep up with war, death, etc.) had to be hidden or desappear in oblivion. Becker Annette.

50|$|For {{the action}} to succeed, a claim {{must be based}} on {{physical}} pain, <b>mental</b> distress, <b>shock,</b> loss of life expectancy, loss of life amenities, inconvenience and discomfort, disability or disfigurement (and the humility and sadness which arise therefrom).

60|$|Any great <b>shock,</b> <b>mental</b> or physical, is apt {{to reduce}} man {{to the level of}} his brother beasts.

Jo told Richard everything, tarnishing both Jane's relationship with Richard and Jo's relationship with Jane.|$|R
60|$|When Mr. Hawkins returned, {{he gave a}} {{favourable}} {{report of}} Venetia. He said that all danger was now past, and that all that was required for her recovery were time, care, and repose.

60|$|It is a {{fact that}} the very greatness of a <b>mental</b> <b>shock</b> helps one to bear up against it by {{producing}} a sort of temporary insensibility. I came out of the state-room stunned, as if something heavy had dropped on my head. From {{the other side of the}} saloon, across the table, Ransome, with a duster in his hand, stared open-mouthed.

40|$|In a February 1915 {{article in}} the Lancet, British {{psychologist}} Charles S. Myers gave definition to an increasingly used war-front medical term, shell shock. Myers described shell shock as the physical injuries that resulted from the impact of an exploding shell. 1 By the end of World War I, however, shell shock’s definition had become so malleable it could describe nearly any physical or <b>mental</b> ailment. Shell <b>shock,</b> with its seemingly elusive definition, came to carry cultural meaning that extended far beyond the wounds of the soldier.

5000|$|The term Carnoustie effect {{dates from}} the 1999 Open, when the world's best players, {{many of whom were}} reared on manicured and {{relatively}} windless courses, were frustrated by the unexpected difficulties of the Carnoustie links, which was compounded by the weather. One much-fancied young favourite, a 19-year-old Sergio García of Spain, went straight from the course to his mother's arms crying after shooting 89 and 83 in the first two rounds. The Carnoustie effect is defined as [...] "that degree of <b>mental</b> and psychic <b>shock</b> experienced on collision with reality by those whose expectations are founded on false assumptions."

All {{the rest of the night}} he lay upon Colonel Pepper's couch, wide awake, consumed by pain and distress. About daylight he fell into a sleep, fitful and full of nightmares, to be awakened around nine o'clock by Pepper. The old gambler evinced considerable alarm until Lane explained how he happened to be there; and then his feeling changed to solicitude.|$|E
60|$|The Honourable Mr. Bidmore's {{letters to}} his father soon after {{announced}} that poor Mr. Cargill had been seized with a nervous fever, and again, that his reconvalescence was attended with so much debility, it seemed both of mind and body, as entirely to destroy his utility as a travelling companion. Shortly after this the travellers separated, and Cargill returned to his native country alone, indulging upon the road in a melancholy abstraction of mind, which he had suffered to grow upon him since the <b>mental</b> <b>shock</b> which he had sustained, and which in time became the most characteristical feature of his demeanour. His meditations were not even disturbed by any anxiety about his future subsistence, although the cessation of his employment seemed to render that precarious. For this, however, Lord Bidmore had made provision; for, though a coxcomb where the fine arts were concerned, he was in other particulars a just and honourable man, who felt a sincere pride in having drawn the talents of Cargill from obscurity, and entertained due gratitude for {{the manner in which}} he had achieved the important task intrusted to him in his family.|$|E
60|$|Once the <b>mental</b> <b>shock</b> {{of moving}} {{unsupported}} {{through the air}} was over, his sensations ceased to be unpleasant, became very speedily pleasurable. He had been warned of air sickness. But he found the pulsating movement of the aeropile as it drove up the faint south-west breeze was very little {{in excess of the}} pitching of a boat head on to broad rollers in a moderate gale, and he was constitutionally a good sailor. And the keenness of the more rarefied air into which they ascended produced a sense of lightness and exhilaration. He looked up and saw the blue sky above fretted with cirrus clouds. His eye came cautiously down through the ribs and bars to a shining flight of white birds that hung in the lower sky. For a space he watched these. Then going lower and less apprehensively, he saw the slender figure of the Wind-Vane keeper's crow's nest shining golden in the sunlight and growing smaller every moment. As his eye fell with more confidence now, there came a blue line of hills, and then London, already to leeward, an intricate space of roofing. Its near edge came sharp and clear, and banished his last apprehensions in a shock of surprise. For the boundary of London was like a wall, like a cliff, a steep fall of three or four hundred feet, a frontage broken only by terraces here and there, a complex decorative facade.|$|E

60|$|The {{storm of}} emotion which {{had passed through}} him, and the <b>mental</b> <b>shock</b> which he had undergone, would have sent many a man into a raging fever, but John was too strong-willed and too {{practical}} to allow his strength to be wasted {{at the very time}} when he needed it most. Within a few days he realised a portion of his property, and starting for New York, caught the first mail steamer to England. Day and night, night and day, he trod the quarter-deck, until the hardy sailors watched the old man with astonishment, and marvelled how any human being could do so much upon so little sleep. It was only by this unceasing exercise, by wearing down his vitality until fatigue brought lethargy, that he could prevent himself from falling into a very frenzy of despair. He hardly dared ask himself what was the object of this wild journey? What did he expect? Would Mary be still alive? She must be a very old woman. If he could but see her and mingle his tears with hers he would be content. Let her only know that it had been no fault of his, and that they had both been victims to the same cruel fate. The cottage was her own, and she had said that she would wait for him there until she heard from him. Poor lass, she had never reckoned on such a wait as this.|$|E
60|$|Much {{allowance}} {{is to be}} {{made for}} a man who is staggering under the <b>mental</b> <b>shock</b> of defeat and the physical exertions which Buller had endured. That the Government made such allowance is clear from {{the fact that he was}} not instantly recalled. And yet the cold facts are that we have a British General, at the head of 25,000 men, recommending another General, at the head of 12,000 men only twelve miles off, to lay down his arms to an army which was certainly very inferior in numbers to the total British force; and this because he had once been defeated, although he knew that there was still time for the whole resources of the Empire to be poured into Natal in order to prevent so shocking a disaster. Such is a plain statement of the advice which Buller gave and which White rejected. For the instant the fate not only of South Africa but even, as I believe, of the Empire hung upon the decision of the old soldier in Ladysmith, who had to resist the proposals of his own General as sternly as the attacks of the enemy. He who sorely needed help and encouragement became, as his message shows, the helper and the encourager. It was a tremendous test, and Sir George White came through it with a staunchness and a loyalty which saved us not only from overwhelming present disaster, but from a hideous memory which must have haunted British military annals for centuries to come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] {{the doctor}} agreed, [...] "that would clench the matter altogether, and I am almost certain {{you will find}} that what he has said is true.

She was so obstinate over the matter that it completely puzzled me; but if what Carne said was true, and she had the knowledge of something that would have gone very far to prove Ronald Mervyn's innocence, the matter is explained. The only difficulty before us is to get her to speak, because, of course, she cannot do so without laying herself open to a charge--I don't mean a criminal charge, but a moral one--of having suppressed evidence in a manner that concerned a man's life. I think the best plan will be for us to meet at your house, Mr. Volkes, at eleven o'clock to-morrow. I will go into the village before that, and will bring Ruth Powlett up in my gig, and if you will allow me I will do the talking to her.

30|$|Results: Eighteen {{interviews}} were conducted with intensivists, fellows, nurse-practitioners, respiratory therapists and registered nurses. Intubation perspective and practice varied dependent on three domains: patient's characteristics, clinician's characteristics, and organizational structure. Patient factors included nature of acute illness, underlying comorbidities, clinical presentation, and patient's values. Clinician factors included background, training, experience and practice style. System factors included of standardized policies and protocols, hierarchy and team dynamics. Although most clinicians agreed that intubation is needed in case of persistent respiratory distress, altered <b>mental</b> status, or <b>shock,</b> they disagreed on when to initiate it. In different contexts, intubation could be considered as preemptive (prophylactic), therapeutic ('just in time'), and as a rescue. Assessment, reassessment, and time-limited trial off noninvasive techniques matter. Based on these results, we propose a model regarding intubation in sepsis consisting of the steps in the decisional process, a classification of the categories of timing of intubation, and decisional context factors that impact the timing of intubation.|$|R
40|$|Background: Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) is {{a common}} and serious illness in Chile. Aim: To evaluate the etiology, severity, prognostic factors and blood culture yield of CAP requiring hospitalization in Puerto Montt in Southern, Chile. Patients and methods: All non immunocompromised adults with CAP admitted at Puerto Montt Hospital during one year, were prospectively studied. Clinical and radiological assessment was done in all patients. Blood and sputum cultures were obtained and serology for atypical agents was determined. Results: We studied 200 patients, aged 63 ± 19 years (109 males). The prognostic factors associated with mortality were an age over 65 years, an altered <b>mental</b> status, <b>shock</b> and acute renal failure. Etiology was demonstrated in 29 % of patients. The most frequent pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (40. 7 %), Haemophilus influenzae (23. 7 %) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (16. 9 %). Mixed infections were found in 17 %. Fifteen atypical pathogens were identified in 12 patients. Of these only two received a specific treatment but no one died and their length hospital stay was similar than {{in the rest of}} the patients. Overall, blood cultures were positive in 12. 5 % of patients, but among alcoholics, 58 % were positive. In only one percent of cases, positive cultures motivated therapeutic changes among clinicians.

Conclusions: Atypical agents were a common cause of CAP in this group of patients, but their pathogenic role and treatment requirements are debatable. Focusing blood cultures on specific groups could improve their yield. The rate of Penicillin resistance for S pneumoniae wa...|$|R

60|$|The {{news came}} to us while we were at breakfast, {{and we were all}} inexpressibly shocked. Papa at once ordered the carriage, and {{directly}} it came to the door he started for Harmer Place to inquire himself as to the truth of these dreadful reports. He returned in {{about an hour and a}} half, and brought quite a budget of news to us. When he arrived, he had sent up his name, but Miss Harmer sent down word that Doctors Sadman and Wilkinson were in attendance, and that therefore she would not trouble him to come in. Papa had felt a good deal hurt at the message, but he thought it was probably given because Miss Harmer, knowing how much they had injured him, was afraid that her sister might recognize him, and in the state she was in, reveal something about the will. However, just as the carriage was driving away, Dr. Sadman, who, from the window above, had seen papa drive up, came to the door and called after him. Papa stopped the carriage, got out, and went back to speak to him. Dr. Sadman particularly wished him to come up to give them the benefit of his opinion. Finding that Miss Harmer was not in the room, and that Angela was insensible, and not likely ever to recover consciousness, he had gone up with him. He had found her in a dying state, and he did not think it at all likely that she would live more than a few hours. She was apparently dying from the effect of the shock upon the system, and the terror and pain that she had undergone; for round one arm a piece of string was found which had cut completely into the flesh, probably for the purpose of extorting the supposed place of concealment of plate, valuables, or money. She had not apparently received any injury which in itself would have been sufficient to cause death, but she had had a very heavy fall upon the back of her head which might have affected her brain. The symptoms, however, from which she was suffering were not exactly those which would have been caused by concussion of the brain; and although the fall had assisted to produce the evil, yet, on the whole, her death would be attributable rather to the <b>mental</b> <b>shock,</b> the terror and distress, than to actual bodily violence.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{you will}} say, dearest friend. The truth is, I {{have not been}} forgetting you (how far from that!) but {{wandering}} in search of cool air and a cool bough among all the olive trees to build our summer nest on. My husband has been suffering beyond what one could shut one's eyes to in consequence of the great <b>mental</b> <b>shock</b> of last March--loss of appetite, loss of sleep, looks quite worn and altered. His spirits never rallied except with an effort, and every letter from New Cross threw him back into deep depressions. I was very anxious, and feared much {{that the end of}} it all (the intense heat of Florence assisting) would be a nervous fever or something similar. And I had the greatest difficulty in persuading him to leave Florence for a month or two--he who generally delights so in travelling, had no mind for change or movement. I had to say and swear that baby and I couldn't bear the heat, and that we must and would go away. Ce que femme veut, if the latter is at all reasonable, or the former persevering. At last I gained the victory. It was agreed that we two should go on an exploring journey to find out where we could have most shadow at least expense; and we left our child with his nurse and Wilson while we were absent. We went along the coast to Spezzia, saw Carrara with the white marble mountains, passed through the olive forests and the vineyards, avenues of acacia trees, chestnut woods, glorious surprises of most exquisite scenery. I say olive forests advisedly; the olive grows like a forest tree in those regions, shading the ground with tents of silvery network. The olive near Florence is but a shrub in comparison, and I have learnt to despise a little, too, the Florentine vine, which does not swing such portcullises of massive dewy green from one tree to another as along the whole road where we travelled. Beautiful, indeed, it was. Spezzia wheels the blue sea into the arms of the wooded mountains, and we had a glance at Shelley's house at Lerici. It was melancholy to me, of course. I was not sorry that the lodgings we inquired about were far above our means. We returned on our steps (after two days in the dirtiest of possible inns), saw Seravezza, a village in the mountains, where rock, river, and wood enticed us to stay, and the inhabitants drove us off by their unreasonable prices. It is curious, but just in proportion to the want of civilisation the prices rise in Italy. If you haven't cups and saucers you are made to pay for plate. Well, so finding no rest for the sole of our feet, I persuaded Robert to go to the Baths of Lucca, only to see them. We were to proceed afterwards to San Marcello or some safer wilderness. We had both of us, but he chiefly, the strongest prejudice against these Baths of Lucca, taking them for a sort of wasp's nest of scandal and gaming, and expecting to find everything trodden flat by the Continental English; yet I wanted to see the place, because it is a place to see after all. So we came, and were so charmed by the exquisite beauty of the scenery, by the coolness of the climate and the absence of our countrymen, political troubles serving admirably our private requirements, that we made an offer for rooms on the spot, and returned to Florence for baby and the rest of our establishment without further delay. Here we are, then; we have been here more than a fortnight. We have taken an apartment for the season--four months--paying twelve pounds for the whole term, and hoping to be able to stay till the end of October. The living is cheaper than even at Florence, so that there has been no extravagance in coming here. In fact, Florence is scarcely tenable during the summer from the excessive heat by day and night, even if there were no particular motive for leaving it. We have taken a sort of eagle's nest in this place, the highest house of the highest of the three villages which are called the Bagni di Lucca, and which {{lie at the heart of}} a hundred mountains sung to continually by a rushing mountain stream. The sound of the river and of the cicala is all the noise we hear. Austrian drums and carriage wheels cannot vex us; God be thanked for it; the silence is full of joy and consolation. I think my husband's spirits are better already and his appetite improved. Certainly little babe's great cheeks are growing rosier and rosier. He is out all day when the sun is not too strong, and Wilson will have it that he is prettier than the whole population of babies here. He fixes his blue eyes on everybody and smiles universal benevolence, rather too indiscriminately it might be if it were not for Flush. But certainly, on the whole he prefers Flush. He pulls his ears and rides on him, and Flush, though his dignity does not approve of being used as a pony, only protests by turning his head round to kiss the little bare dimpled feet. A merrier, sweeter-tempered child there can't be than our baby, and people wonder at his being so forward at four months old and think there must be a mistake in his age. He is so strong that when I put out two fingers and he has seized them in his fists he can draw himself up on his feet, but we discourage this forwardness, which is not desirable, say the learned. Children of friends of mine at ten months and a year can't do so much. Is it not curious that my child should be remarkable for strength and fatness? He has a beaming, thinking little face, too; oh, I wish you could see it. Then my own strength has wonderfully improved, just as my medical friends prophesied; and it seems like a dream when I find myself able to climb the hills with Robert and help him to lose himself in the forests. I have been growing stronger and stronger, and where it is to stop I can't tell, really; I can do as much, or more, now than at any point of my life since I arrived at woman's estate. The air of this place seems to penetrate the heart and not the lungs only; it draws you, raises you, excites you. Mountain air without its keenness, sheathed in Italian sunshine, think what that must be! And the beauty and the solitude--for with a few paces we get free of the habitations of men--all is delightful to me. What is peculiarly beautiful and wonderful is the variety of the shapes of the mountains. They are a multitude, and yet there is no likeness. None, except where the golden mist comes and transfigures them into one glory. For the rest, the mountain there wrapt in the chestnut forest is not like that bare peak which tilts against the sky, nor like that serpent twine of another which seems to move and coil in the moving coiling shadow. Oh, I wish you were here. You would enjoy the shade of the chestnut trees, and the sound of the waterfalls, and at nights seem to be living among the stars; the fireflies are so thick, you would like that too. We have subscribed to a French library where there are scarcely any new books. I have read Bernard's 'Gentilhomme Campagnard' (see how arriérés we are in French literature!), and thought it the dullest and worst of his books. I wish I could see the 'Memoirs of Louis Napoleon,' but there is no chance of such good fortune. All this egotism has been written with a heart full of thoughts of you and anxieties for you. Do write to me directly and say first how your precious health is, and then that you have ceased to suffer pain for your friends.... But your dear self chiefly--how are you, my dearest Miss Mitford? I do long so for good news of you. On our arrival here Mr. Lever called on us. A most cordial vivacious manner, a glowing countenance, with the animal spirits somewhat predominant over the intellect, yet the intellect by no means in default; you can't help being surprised into being pleased with him, whatever your previous inclination may be. Natural too, and a gentleman past mistake. His eldest daughter is nearly grown up, and his youngest six months old. He has children of every sort of intermediate age almost, but he himself is young enough still. Not the slightest Irish accent. He seems to have spent nearly his whole life on the Continent and by no means to be tired of it. Ah, dearest Miss Mitford, hearts feel differently, adjust themselves differently before the prick of sorrow, and I confess I agree with Robert. There are places stained with the blood of my heart for ever, and where I could not bear to stand again. If duty called him to New Cross it would be otherwise, but his sister is rather inclined to come to us, I think, for a few weeks in the autumn perhaps. Only these are scarcely times for plans concerning foreign travel. It is something to talk of. It has been a great disappointment to me the not going to England this year, but I could not run the risk of the bitter pain to him. May God bless you from all pain! Love me and write to me, who am ever and ever your affectionate E.B.B.|$|E

40|$|Four {{cases of}} sclerodermia have been {{reported}} durintwo months. Sclerodermia which seems to he hardness of the skin is actually a general affection that first appears on the skin and has various types: edematous, sclerema for children, and then the forms of patches or drops or bands Or annulars. It is sor t of connective tissue affection and is chiefly observed in women and {{as the reason for}} it, is thought to be due to the acute infections and chronic toxics in theory dysendocryno- sympathic that eventually is caused by nervous- <b>mental</b> disturbances and <b>shocks.</b> "nThree of the pa t ients were adults {{and one of them was}} a 60 years old man. Clinical symptoms were common in all three persons and as a usual it began from the fingers and then it appeared in the face, but in the man it was different and the disease began first from the chest and abdomen and buttucks parts, and although the duration of the illness was more than few months it had not yet affected the limbs. After sometime it affects the muscles and bones and in a few years it expands so that causes a general weakness and eventually results in death. "nThe treatment is tern porary and differs comparatively in different cases. Vitamin E given with large dosage, Vitamin D 2 to keep calcium from running. Bismuth, Penicilline with large dosage and tetracycline given continuously, and at last cortisone and A. C. which have temporary and rapid result...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In April 2009, the {{pandemic}} influenza A(H 1 N 1) virus emerged and spread globally. The {{objective of this}} study was to describe the independent risk factors for hospital mortality and the treatment effect of corticosteroids among patients with 2009 influenza A(H 1 N 1) infection. Methods We retrospectively obtained clinical data of 155 adult patients with confirmed infection of 2009 influenza A(H 1 N 1) in 23 hospitals in Beijing, China from October 1 to December 23, 2009. Risk factors for hospital mortality were identified with multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Among the 155 patients, 90 (58. 1 %) were male, and mean age was 43. 0 ± 18. 6 years, and comorbidities were present in 81 (52. 3 %) patients. The most common organ dysfunctions included acute respiratory failure, altered <b>mental</b> status, septic <b>shock,</b> and acute renal failure. Oseltamivir was initiated in 125 patients (80. 6 %), only 16 patients received antiviral therapy within 48 hours after symptom onset. Fifty-two patients (33. 5 %) were treated with systemic corticosteroids, with a median daily dose of 80 mg. Twenty-seven patients (17. 4 %) died during hospital stay. Diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 8. 830, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 041 to 38. 201, p = 0. 004) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (OR 1. 240, 95 % CI 1. 025 to 1. 500, p = 0. 027) were independent risk factors of hospital death, as were septic <b>shock</b> and altered <b>mental</b> status. Corticosteroids use was associated with a trend toward higher hospital mortality (OR 3. 668, 95 % CI 0. 987 to 13. 640, p = 0. 052). Conclusions Hospitalized patients with 2009 H 1 N 1 influenza had relative poor outcome. The risk factors at hospitalization may help clinicians to identify the high-risk patients. In addition, corticosteroids use should not be regarded as routine pharmacologic therapy. </p...|$|R
50|$|Visiting {{her in a}} <b>mental</b> {{hospital}} proves <b>shocking,</b> as for {{the staff}} recognize her as Jennifer. Nurse Crenshaw (Elizabeth Huddle) explains {{to her that she}} escaped from the institution over a year ago, following an attack by a man who appears to be the same man trying to kill her currently. She also finds the children's books Michael found in the hospital library, thus explaining why she assumed the main character's identity after her escape. Having some answers, Laura heads back to New York, only to stumble in Michael, who apologizes to her and admits that he wants her back. Together, they check into a motel, where - after Michael has left for pizza - the murderer attacks Michael in his car and stabs him in the leg, before going to the motel and attacking Laura. She is able to hit him on the head with a lamp and then runs off. He chases her, and as he is about to stab her, Michael shoots him to death. Laura recognizes him as her brother and bursts out in tears. Remembering everything now, she explains that the person killed in her apartment was her boyfriend David, not Mark. Mark killed David because he knew that his father did not approve of him, and then set the house on fire, hoping that Laura would die as well. Laura escaped, but the trauma caused her to lose her memory The reason why he came back years later to attempt to kill her again was because the Ouija board subconsciously helped her regain her memory. But as Michael points out, this doesn't explain the messages that Cindy (whose body was found in the trunk of Mark's car in another town) received while using the board alone.|$|R
