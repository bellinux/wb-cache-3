40|$|X-ray {{radiation}} in macromolecular crystallography can chemically {{alter the}} biological material and deteriorate {{the integrity of}} the crystal lattice with concomitant loss of resolution. Typical alterations include decarboxylation of glutamic and aspartic residues, breaking of disulfide bonds and the reduction of metal centres. Helical scans add a small translation to the crystal in the rotation method, so that for every image the crystal is shifted to expose a fresh part. On beamline PROXIMA 2 A at Synchrotron SOLEIL, this procedure has been tested with various parameters in an attempt to understand how to mitigate the effects of radiation damage. Here, the strategies used and the crystallographic metrics for various scenarios are reported. Among these, the loss of bromine from bromophenyl moieties appears to be a useful <b>monitor</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> damage as the carbon-bromine bond is very sensitive to X-ray irradiation. Two cases are focused on where helical scans are shown to be superior in obtaining meaningful data compared with conventional methods. In one case the initial resolution of the crystal is extended over time, and in the second case the anomalous signal is preserved to provide greater effective multiplicity and easier phasing...|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} and <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> dose delivered in patient tissues {{is a critical}} aspect in radiation therapy. Various dosimeters have proven effective in measuring radiations at low doses. However, {{there is a growing}} demand for new dosimeters based on small, non-invasive and high resolution devices. Here we report on a miniature dosimeter based on an optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate an ultimate detection limit of 160 mGy with an effective interaction region of 6 x 10 - 4 mm 3. Due to its reliability, compactness and biomedical dose level sensitivity, our system shows itself suitable for applications in radiation therapy dosimetry. Nowadays, <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> ionizing <b>radiations</b> (IRs) is very important in different fields.

30|$|As with screen-film radiography, <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> {{exposure}} {{remains a}} topic of concern in digital imaging.

In film-screen radiography, the silver lining used to be an important quality control element of the radiological examination.

Without visualisation of the silver lining around the image, the radiologist is unable to check if the X-ray beam has been adequately collimated. As the radiologist is responsible for image quality and radiation protection, he or she should be aware of this shortcoming and visibility of the silver lining should be checked regularly. In this way, the silver lining may once again serve as a quality control element.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Concerns {{about the}} {{radiation}} dose associated with CT scanning {{have led to}} a call for establishment of diagnostic reference levels. Self-complete surveys have been used extensively to gather this information, however, departmental Radiological Information System's/Picture Archive Communication Systems (RIS/PACS) also hold this information. We compared dosimetry derived from survey with those using RIS/PACSs. Methods: Technical data were collected from a large metropolitan tertiary hospital in WA using both data collection methods for a range of adult CT scanning examinations. Radiation dose was calculated from both datasets and the results evaluated for several indexes of inter-rater agreement. Results: Radiation dose calculated using self-report survey data differed both systematically and proportionally from that calculated using RIS/PACS data. Differences were not consistent across CT examination type and thus not amenable to simple correction. The disparity was greater and more variable for organ dose than effective dose due to reliance of survey data on “generic” anatomical start and stop limits compared with actual data available on RIS/PACS. Conclusions: The bias observed in our study indicates that care should be taken when interpreting the results <b>of</b> studies measuring <b>radiation</b> dose using self-complete surveys. The availability of electronic databases that include information required for the evaluation and <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> CT <b>radiation</b> dose provides the opportunity to capture better quality data in a cost-effective manner.
