2500|$|Although Klein {{had painted}} <b>monochromes</b> {{as early as}} 1949, and held the first private {{exhibition}} of this work in 1950, his first public showing was {{the publication of the}} Artist's book [...] in November 1954. Parodying a traditional catalogue, the book featured a series of intense <b>monochromes</b> linked to various cities he had lived in during the previous years. Yves: Peintures anticipated his first two shows of oil paintings, at the Club des Solitaires, Paris, October 1955 and Yves: Proposition <b>monochromes</b> at Gallery Colette Allendy, February 1956.

5|$|Influenced by the Chinese Song and Yuan dynasties, Japanese <b>monochrome</b> ink {{painting}} called suibokuga largely replaced polychrome scroll paintings. By {{the end of}} the 14th century, <b>monochrome</b> landscape paintings (sansuiga) {{became the}} preferred genre for Zen painters, evolving to a unique Japanese style from the Chinese origin. Shūbun, who created Reading in a Bamboo Grove (1446), and his student Sesshū, author of Landscape of the Four Seasons, are the most well known priest-painters of the period. As with most of the early Japanese paintings, these works were created for Buddhist temples. At {{the end of the}} Muromachi period around 1573, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries, and was practised by artists from the Kanō school.|$|E

5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of light. Color images are created by combining separate <b>monochrome</b> images taken through different filters.

As with its predecessor, the Stamper brothers developed the game in <b>monochrome</b> to avoid visual overlay and attribute clash, as it was a common processing limitation in early 8-bit consoles. However, the Amstrad release exclusively displayed dual-colours.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in <b>monochrome,</b> muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and <b>monochrome.</b> Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
5|$|There is {{absolutely}} no doubt that before the restoration, the whole ceiling was dirtier, more muted and more <b>monochrome</b> than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau, still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.|$|E
50|$|Coming full-circle {{from his}} early Table (1962) {{in which he}} {{cancelled}} his photorealist image with haptic swirls of grey paint, in 1969, Richter produced {{the first of a}} group of grey <b>monochromes</b> that consist exclusively of the textures resulting from different methods of paint application.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums.

Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E
