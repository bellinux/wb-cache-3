It consisted of 60 more orbits of Saturn, with 21 <b>more</b> <b>close</b> Titan flybys, seven of Enceladus, six of Mimas, eight of Tethys, and one targeted flyby each of Dione, Rhea, and Helene. The extended mission began on July 1, 2008, and was renamed the Cassini Equinox Mission as the mission coincided with Saturn's equinox.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rising}} {{popularity}} of the longer coat and waistcoat, the large collected rhinegraves and overskirt were abandoned in favor of <b>more</b> <b>close</b> fitting breeches. By the late 1670s, close fitted breeches were worn with the stockings worn over them and on or above the knee, often being gartered with a garter below the knee. With the long waistcoat and stockings worn over the knee, {{very little of the}} breeches could be seen. A possible reason that the stockings were worn over the knee, was to give the impression of longer legs since the waist coat fell very low, just above the knee. The breeches tended to be of the same material as the coat. The stockings varied in color.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the degree of}} short-run, real wage flexibility in a two-sector economy under floating rates. This is done by deriving optimal wage indexation in a contracting framework. We find that the <b>more</b> <b>closed</b> the economy, the lower the degree of wage indexation. As a result, output will fluctuate less around its desired level in a <b>more</b> <b>closed</b> economy. These findings further imply that a given unexpected monetary shock will cause as maller output shock in a more open economy, whereas a given real shock will induce a smaller output shock in a <b>more</b> <b>closed</b> economy. ...|$|R

25|$|At the Texas State Fair game in Dallas {{against the}} Texas Longhorns, an early surge saw Texas at Vanderbilt's 18-yard line. McGugin sent in Neely, his injured captain. It worked to some extent, with Texas losing yards and ending {{up at the}} 17-yard line; Franklin Stacy then kicked a field goal. After a Vanderbilt touchdown, the offenses {{exchanged}} punts before Neely ran back a 30-yard punt return. The 60-yard drive which followed was capped by a 46-yard touchdown run by Gil Reese. In the fourth quarter, Neely hit Bomar with a 23-yard pass and Bomar ran for 20 yards <b>more,</b> <b>close</b> to the goal. Reese ran it in on the next play and the field goal was good, giving the Commodores a 20–10 victory.|$|E
500|$|The {{classification}} of Agaricus deserticola {{has been under}} debate since the taxon was first described. It was thought by some mycologists {{to be a member}} of the Gasteromycetes, a grouping of fungi in the basidiomycota that do not actively discharge their spores. The Gasteromycetes are now known to be an artificial assemblage of morphologically similar fungi without any unifying evolutionary relationship. When the species was known as a Gyrophragmium, Fischer thought it to be close to Montagnites, a genus he considered a member of the [...] family Agaricaceae. Conrad suggested a relationship with Secotium, which he believed to be close to Agaricus. Curtis Gates Lloyd said of Gyrophragmium: [...] " [...] has no place in the Gasteromycetes. Its relations are <b>more</b> <b>close</b> to the Agarics. It is the connecting link between the two passing on one hand through Secotium to the true Gasteromycetes." [...] Morse believed that Gyrophragmium and the secotioid genus Endoptychum formed a transition between the Gasteromycetes and the Hymenomycetes (the gilled fungi).|$|E

2500|$|In closing diphthongs, {{the second}} element is <b>more</b> <b>close</b> {{than the first}} (e.g. [...] ); in opening diphthongs, the second element is more open (e.g. [...] ).

However, exceptions to this rule are not rare in the world's languages. In Finnish, for instance, the opening diphthongs [...] and [...] are true falling diphthongs, since they begin louder and with higher pitch and fall in prominence during the diphthong.|$|E

2500|$|The term stećak is {{uncommon}} in regional dialects and without etiological value, and semantically incorrect and contradicting as it {{derives from the}} verb [...] "to stand", while the chest-type to which it refers predominantly is laid down, while another sub-type of pillars and crosses is the one predominantly upright; this upright or standing sub-type does not amount even 5% of {{the overall number of}} stećci; in the original stećci inscriptions they are most often called as kami (meaning [...] "stone" [...] regardless of the form), thus some scholars proposed the term kamik (pl. kamici) for all forms of headstones, while stećak would mean only the upright sub-type. The term kamik is <b>more</b> <b>close</b> to the original meaning and sometime is used instead of stećak in professional literature.|$|E
2500|$|After World War I, ex-{{members of}} India House and {{erstwhile}} {{members of the}} Berlin Committee and the Indian revolutionary movement increasingly turned to the young Soviet Union, becoming closely associated with communism. The Berlin India Committee moved to Stockholm after the war. Led by V.N. Chatterjee, the committee wrote to Leon Trotsky to secure Bolshevik aid for the accused at the Hindu-German Conspiracy Trial. Many involved in the conspiracy subsequently moved to Soviet Russia. When the Communist Party of India was founded in Tashkent in October 1920, a number of its founding members, including M.P.T. Acharya, Virendranath Chatterjee, [...] Champakaraman Pillai and Abdul Rab, had been associated with India House or the Paris Indian Society. Individuals like Acharya attended the second congress of the Communist International. Chatterjee and Acharya later worked with the League against Imperialism. Moving to Weimar Germany after the war, Chatterjee's program of revolutionary nationalism developed into the Indian Independence Party in 1922 which won Chicherin's approval and Comintern funding. Chatto later joined the German Communist party. In 1927, Chatto accompanied Jawaharlal Nehru to the Brussels Conference of the League against Imperialism. However support from Soviet Russia for Chatterjee's program waned as M.N. Roy, a Bengali revolutionary in Moscow previously of the Anushilan Samiti was considered <b>more</b> <b>close</b> to ideology of Marxism than Chatterjee's aims of nationalist revolution. Roy steadily developed the Indian Communist Party with Stalin's encouragement and support.
