5|$|Food is {{essential}} to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources.

Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, organic farming and more sustainable business practices.|$|E
